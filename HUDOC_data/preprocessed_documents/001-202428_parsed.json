Moreover, according to the record, he also stated that he did not want a lawyer and waived his right to silence. In his statement, which was three pages long, the applicant stated that D.T. had asked him to collect things from a certain Murat in his village. Murat, accompanied by three PKK members, had threatened him with a gun so the applicant had felt obliged to carry 300 million Turkish liras (TRY) to D.T. in Istanbul. When the applicant had arrived at Elaz\u0131\u011f bus station, another person unknown to him had handed him a packet of cigarettes after having confirmed his name and surname.

The trial court also noted that before the public prosecutor, the applicant partially accepted his police statements while denying that D.T. had sent him to the countryside as a courier, stating that a person had given him the abovementioned items when he had been in his village so that he could give them to D.T.

Therefore, the applicant had been free to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer from the beginning of his questioning by the police. Moreover, before making statements to the police, the applicant signed a form setting out the rights of arrestees, including the right to remain silent and to have access to legal assistance. However, he decided not to avail himself of any of those rights and made statements to the police. Relying on that point and referring to the decisions in Kaytan (v. Turkey, no. 27422/05, \u00a7\u00a031, 15\u00a0September 2015), and \u015eedal (v.

The lawyer\u2019s presence and active assistance during questioning by police is an important procedural safeguard aimed at, among other things, preventing the collection of evidence through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the suspect and protecting the freedom of a suspected person to choose whether to speak or to remain silent when questioned by the police (see Soytemiz v.

That also applies to the right to legal assistance. However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, such a waiver must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance. Such a waiver need not be explicit, but it must be voluntary and constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right. Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his or her conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he or she could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of her or his conduct would be. Moreover, the waiver must not run counter to any important public interest (see Simeonovi, cited above, \u00a7 115). It follows that a waiver of the right to a lawyer, a fundamental right among those listed in Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 which constitute the notion of a fair trial, must be strictly compliant with the above requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Murtazaliyeva v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, \u00a7 118, 18 December 2018).",

As there were no compelling reasons to restrict the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer when he was giving statements to the police, the Court must apply a very strict scrutiny to its fairness assessment (see Dimitar Mitev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a034779/09, \u00a7 71, 8 March 2018). More importantly, the onus will be on the Government to demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to legal advice (see Beuze, cited above, \u00a7 145; Simeonovi, cited above, \u00a7 132; and Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7 265).",

Cyprus, no. 4268/04, \u00a7 82, 11\u00a0December 2008). In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. Indeed, where the reliability of evidence is in dispute the existence of fair procedures to examine the admissibility of the evidence takes on an even greater importance (see Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, \u00a7 116, 1 April 2010).",

Neither did the Court of Cassation, before which the applicant raised the issue of legal assistance for the first time, carry out any assessment concerning the conditions of his alleged waiver of the right to a lawyer when making statements to the police on 7\u00a0August 2004 or the use made of those statements by the trial court without examining their admissibility (compare Saranchov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a02308/06, \u00a7\u00a047, 9 June 2016). In the absence of any such assessment, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant had the opportunity to meaningfully challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use despite the fact that he was represented by a lawyer throughout the trial (compare Sitnevskiy and Chaykovskiy v. Ukraine, nos. 48016/06 and 7817/07, \u00a7\u00a0131, 10\u00a0November 2016). Hence, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant\u2019s complaint received an appropriate response from the national courts and considers that fair procedures for making an assessment of the issue of legal assistance proved non-existent in the present case (see Rodionov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a09106/09, \u00a7 167 in fine, 11 December 2018).",

As is apparent from the trial court\u2019s reasoned judgment, the court found it established in the light of the statements of the applicant and D.T. that the applicant had acted as a courier for the PKK, a point which he had contested throughout the criminal proceedings. Therefore, and contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicant reiterated his police statements during the whole of the proceedings, this point caused a prejudice to the rights of the defence, which was moreover not addressed and remedied by the national courts. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the applicant\u2019s statements formed an integral part of the evidence upon which his conviction was based.",
