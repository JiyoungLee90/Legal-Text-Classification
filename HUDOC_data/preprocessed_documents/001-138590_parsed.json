However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained.

Russia, no.\u00a0302/02, \u00a7\u00a0136, 10 June 2010). In the sphere of medical treatment, the refusal to accept a particular treatment might, inevitably, lead to a fatal outcome, yet the imposition of medical treatment without the consent of a mentally competent adult patient would interfere with a person\u2019s physical integrity in a manner capable of engaging the rights protected under Article\u00a08 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2002III). However, Article 2 of the Convention enshrines the principle of sanctity of life, which is especially evident in the case of a doctor, who exercises his or her skills to save lives and should act in the best interests of his or her patients. The Court has therefore held that this Article obliges the national authorities to prevent an individual from taking his or her own life if the decision has not been taken freely and with full understanding of what is involved (see Haas v. Switzerland, no.\u00a031322/07, \u00a7\u00a054, ECHR 2011). It follows that one of the central issues in determining the validity of a refusal to undergo medical treatment by a patient is the issue of his or her decision-making capacity.",

They did not examine the issue of S.\u2019s capacity to understand, even though the file clearly put his mental soundness into question (see paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 15 and 17 above). Furthermore, the fact that the doctors arranged for a psychiatrist to visit S. suggests that they doubted S.\u2019s mental capacity to take rational decisions.

The introduction of the civil claim in the criminal case may well have been preferable for the applicant from the standpoint of court fees and other costs and expenses.
