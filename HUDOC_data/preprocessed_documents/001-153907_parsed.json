In my brother\u2019s case, the law-enforcement agencies had failed to take any steps to search for his abductors. They had arrived at the crime scene to inspect it several days later after the crime had been reported to them, in spite of the fact that already in about an hour after the abduction my cousin Mr A.-M.A. had informed the Leninskiy ROVD of the abduction. From this it is possible to conclude that the authorities had known that the persons who had detained my brother, had belonged to law-enforcement agencies. It also follows that the investigation in the criminal case should have questioned lawenforcement officials responsible for the Leninskiy district in Grozny in order to find out the reasons for their failure to take urgent steps to apprehend the abductors ...",

The abductors had arrived as a large group of armed men in uniforms in numerous civilian vehicles which were typically used by the local law-enforcement agencies; the abductors had used portable radio-stations and condoned off a large area, which would have been impossible for an illegal armed group. The abductors had acted openly, without any fear of being discovered by the authorities and openly spoken with the applicants\u2019 neighbours. The abductors had acted as an organised group under chain of command and had been able to drive unobstructed through checkpoints in the area. The authorities had not taken any urgent steps to establish the whereabouts of Mr Rizvan Aziyev in spite of the applicants\u2019 immediate complaint about it. Finally, the authorities had motives for the abduction of Mr Rizvan Aziyev owing to his past as a member of illegal armed groups and his acquaintanceship with Mr A.Kh. who had been killed during the special operation carried out in another neighbourhood in Grozny on the same date. The applicants submitted that they had made a prima facie case that their relative had been abducted by State agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. They stressed that Mr Rizvan Aziyev had disappeared in life-threatening circumstances, that he had been missing for a long period of time and that therefore, he must be presumed dead.",

The investigation into the abduction had accepted the theory that the perpetrators belonged to the State authorities and forwarded information requests to verify whether Mr Rizvan Aziyev had been in State custody whereas the other theories had not been verified. Despite the clear indications to the special operation against Mr Rizvan Aziyev, the investigators neither took steps to identify and question the law-enforcement officials as to the reasons for their belated reaction to the abduction nor requested information on special operations carried out in the area on 31 October 2009.

As for the Government\u2019s reference to Shaipova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085, the Court notes, that unlike in that case where the abductors had arrived on foot and where the applicants\u2019 statements concerning the perpetrators had been vague, in the present one there are materials in its possession demonstrating the validity of the applicants\u2019 allegation of special operation for the following reasons. In spite of the absence at the material time of curfew in the area and the abductors arrival at the applicants\u2019 house in civilian vehicles \u2013 unlike in numerous other cases concerning abductions perpetrated by State agents in the same district several years prior to the events in question (see, for example, Askhabova v. Russia, no. 54765/09, \u00a7\u00a0135, 18 April 2013 concerning abduction perpetrated in August 2009) the Court would like to point out the following. Firstly, the abductors arrived as a large group in at least ten vehicles; they cordoned off several streets and acted as an organised group. Their vehicles were able to drive freely through the military checkpoints situated in vicinity of Staraya Sunzha. The abductors had informed the local residents that they had been conducting a special operation (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). Secondly, from the investigation file it follows that the investigators took no meaningful steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons, such as a blood feud, ransom, drugs or hostility. No serious steps were taken to verify those hypotheses and no information was obtained that the abductors could have been other than State agents (see, by contrast, Zubayrayev v. Russia, no. 67797/01, \u00a7 81, 10\u00a0January 2008). Lastly, the reluctance of the authorities to verify the information concerning the connection between the abduction of Mr Rizvan Aziyev and the killing on the same date as a result of the special operation of Mr A.Kh. (see paragraphs 8, 19, 21 and 39 above) provide the Court with the grounds to conclude that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relative was abducted by State agents. The Government\u2019s statement that the investigators found no evidence proving the involvement of members of lawenforcement authorities in Mr Rizvan Aziyev\u2019s disappearance is insufficient to discharge them from the above-mentioned burden of proof. Having examined the documents submitted by the parties and drawing inferences from the Government\u2019s failure to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question, the Court finds that Mr Rizvan Aziyev was arrested on 31 October 2009 by State servicemen.",

The crime scene examination was carried out three times, and only one and a half month after the receipt of the abduction complaint was it examined with the forensic experts which led to the loss of valuable evidence (see paragraphs\u00a026, 27 and 34 above). From the beginning of the investigation, the applicants and their neighbours had stated that the abductors had been a large group of men looking like the police who had cordoned off several streets in the area. Despite the fact that the investigators received that information within the first week of the proceedings, by August 2010 they had not questioned any of the local law-enforcement officials to verify this information. The Court also notes that in spite of the numerous witnesses to the abduction (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above), the investigators limited themselves to the questionings of a few of them and in such a manner that it necessitated subsequent re-questionings (see paragraphs 41, 45 and 46 above). Further, in spite of the allegations that Mr Rizvan Aziyev could have been detained in connection with his affiliation with Mr A.Kh. (see paragraph 39 above), the investigators failed to take steps and verify this information. They made no attempts to question other persons, such as those who had manned the checkpoints in the vicinity of Staraya Sunzha and Argun on the date of the abduction (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above). In addition, the investigators failed to follow up on the information concerning the identity of one of the alleged abductors who had been seen and described to them by a neighbour (see paragraph 42 above). The investigators took no steps to establish whether the abductors\u2019 vehicles could have belonged to the local law-enforcement agencies.",

Assuming that the applicants\u2019 access to the case file would have provided them with the chance to assess the progress of the investigation, in the light of the shortcomings identified by the first applicant in February 2011 (see paragraph 39 above), it could have been presumed that these deficiencies would have been remedied and the necessary steps taken. However, the Government did not provide any information as to the status of the criminal proceedings afterwards.
