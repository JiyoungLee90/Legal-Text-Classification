Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among many other authorities, Janowski v.

It is prepared to accept that most of the statements, such as the assertion that the claimant \u201cfailed to appoint the school council\u201d or \u201cgranted overtime work only to certain teachers\u201d could be considered as statements which lacked a sufficient factual basis. However, the Court considers, contrary to the view taken by the domestic courts, that the applicant's speech also included statements which could reasonably be regarded as value judgements, such as the statement that the claimant \u201cmismanaged the school complex finances\u201d, \u201cspent money on teachers' training in an inappropriate and non-objective way not corresponding to the school's needs\u201d or that the school \u201clacked discipline\u201d. The Court considers that these value judgments on a matter of public interest enjoy the protection of Article 10 of the Convention.",

In the present case, although the second-instance court rescinded the fine imposed on the applicant and conditionally discontinued the criminal proceedings, the applicant still has a criminal record (see paragraph 44 above).

Poland, no.\u00a023806/03, \u00a7 47, 24 February 2009).",
