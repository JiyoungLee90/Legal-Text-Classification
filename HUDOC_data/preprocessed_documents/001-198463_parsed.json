He argued that in determining the final compensation, the court should have taken the date of the hearing concerning final compensation, 5 November 2008, when examination on the merits had taken place, resulting in judgment no. 224/2009 by which he had been awarded compensation. Therefore, pursuant to Article 17 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, more than a year had elapsed between the hearing concerning the setting of provisional compensation and that concerning the setting of final compensation. In view of the above, the final compensation should have been set with reference to the hearing of 5\u00a0November 2008. In the applicant\u2019s view, the hearing of 25\u00a0September\u00a02005 should not have been taken into account, as it had resulted not in a ruling on the merits but rather in decision 70/2006 by which the examination on the merits had been adjourned and an expert report ordered.",

As regards the material time for determining the compensation, referring to Articles\u00a0111, 223, 224 and 281 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a majority of twenty-three judges of the Court of Cassation held that it was the first hearing (of 21\u00a0September 2005) that should have been taken into account \u2012regardless of whether or not the examination on the merits had taken place on that date \u2012 on the grounds that \u201cduring that hearing the subject of the evidence procedure and of judicial research was being determined\u201d. A\u00a0minority of thirteen judges disagreed with the above-mentioned conclusion on the grounds that Article 17 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution implied that its purpose was for individuals who had been deprived of their property to be given full compensation corresponding to the value of the property as at a date closer to the date of payment. Therefore, in the present case, the material time to be taken should have been the last hearing before the decision on the merits had been issued.",

The first rule, which is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property, and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see,\u00a0among\u00a0many\u00a0other authorities, F\u00e1bi\u00e1n v.

In this regard, the Court has already held that without the payment of a sum reasonably commensurate with the value of the property, deprivation of property is normally an excessive infringement of the right to peaceful enjoyment of property (see\u00a0Malama\u00a0v.\u00a0Greece, no. 43622/98, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2001II). In particular, the adequacy of compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as unreasonable delay (see Angelov v. Bulgaria, no. 44076/98, \u00a7 39, 22\u00a0April 2004, and Almeida Garrett, Mascarenhas Falc\u00e3o and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054). In similar cases, the Court has mainly sought to ascertain whether the administration re-evaluated the compensation to be awarded on account of its depreciation owing to the lapse of time (see, among other authorities, Akku\u015f v. Turkey, 9 July 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 29-31, Reports of Judgments and\u00a0Decisions 1997IV, and Zacharakis v. Greece, no. 17305/02, \u00a7\u00a031, 13\u00a0July\u00a02006).",

The Court has already held that the purpose of that provision is to assess the compensation with reference to the date which is appropriate, in order for \u201cfull compensation\u201d to be paid, as required by the wording of the provision itself (see Poulimenos, cited above, \u00a7 46). The plenary of the Court of Cassation, in interpreting that provision, considered that the hearing that should be taken into account for calculating the compensation was the first hearing of the case, irrespective of whether it had been adjourned or the case had not been examined on the merits for any reason, because \u201cduring that hearing the subject of the evidence procedure and of judicial research was being determined\u201d (see paragraph 11 above).",

However, at the hearing on that date the court did not pronounce the final unitary amount of compensation, but issued decision no. 70/2006 adjourning the examination of the merits of the case and ordering an expert report on the value of the property. Following several adjournments on the grounds that the expert\u2019s report had not yet been delivered, the hearing at which the case was examined on the merits took place on 5 November 2008. In a judgment of 29 June 2009, the Court of Appeal assessed the final unitary amount of compensation taking the date of the hearing concerning the provisional compensation as the material date. They reasoned that the first hearing concerning the setting of final compensation had been held on 21\u00a0September\u00a02005, which was less than a year after the date of the hearing concerning provisional compensation.",

The Court further notes that the delay in the setting of final compensation cannot be attributed to the applicant, who made normal use of domestic remedies.
