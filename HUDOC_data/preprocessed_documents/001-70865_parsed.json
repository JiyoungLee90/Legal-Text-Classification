It follows that the detainees, including the applicant, had to share the sleeping facilities, taking turns to rest.

The parties also agree that, save for one hour of daily outdoor exercise, for the remainder of the day the applicant was locked in the cell which contained all the facilities used by prisoners on a daily basis, such as the washbasin, lavatory and eating utensils.

By contrast, in other cases no violation of Article 3 was found, as the restricted space for sleeping was compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107; Nurmagomedov v.

CPT's 11th General Report, \u00a7 30) and that the applicant was only permitted to talk to his close relatives in a language they did not master, which made contact with his family more difficult. The Government did not suggest that such restrictions were based on security concerns of an appreciable nature (cf. CPT's 2nd General Report, \u00a7 51).

Within fourteen days of receipt of the file the court has to determine whether the case is ready for trial and, if so, fix the hearing date and order the defendant's release or continued detention (see paragraphs 91 and 94 above).

It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7 106; Letellier v.\u00a0France, judgment of 26\u00a0June 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0207, \u00a7 43). In the present case the decisions of the domestic authorities gave no reasons why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his applications for release, they considered the risk of his absconding to be decisive. The domestic decisions merely hinted at the existence of \u201csufficient grounds to believe that the defendants would abscond\u201d, without saying what those grounds actually were.

Thus, the trial court was unable to begin the examination of the case in earnest from June 2000 to April 2001 because the prosecution persistently failed to arrange for a translation of the bill of indictment into Tajik, the language spoken by seven of the defendants. After that defect had been rectified, the domestic courts were unable to agree whether other procedural shortcomings had irreparably impaired the defence rights and this led to a further delay from March to September 2002. Furthermore, on each occasion the file was returned to the , it took a considerable amount of time \u2013 ranging from one and a half to four months \u2013 merely to fix the hearing date.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, judgment of 23\u00a0November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273B, \u00a7\u00a028; Toth v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224, \u00a7 84). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per instance may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

Contrary to the Government's submissions, the actual number of witnesses was 61, each of whom was called to the witness stand for fifteen minutes only. As to the interpreters, it was precisely because of the domestic authorities' failure to make interpretation available in good time that it had become necessary to return the case for an additional investigation with the resultant delay in the proceedings. As to the lawyers' conduct, the applicant indicated that on extremely rare occasions the case had been adjourned due to his lawyer's absence and, in any event, he had consented to the continuation of the proceedings without his lawyer's presence.",

His detention was unlawful for more than a year and, when \u201clawful\u201d, was not based on sufficient grounds. Finally, on various occasions he was denied the right to have the lawfulness of his detention examined speedily.
