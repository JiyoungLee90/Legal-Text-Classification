Since the car needed urgent refuelling, they decided to drive to a petrol station located on the right bank of the Dniester River in the town of Vadul lui Vod\u0103. They were stopped at the exit from their village by a police patrol and Vadim Pisari was asked to open the boot of his car. The two young people were then allowed to continue on their way. In order to reach the petrol station they needed to cross a bridge over the Dniester River located approximately one kilometre from their village.

The command of the left checkpoint was ensured by a Russian sergeant, V.K., who was the only one armed with a loaded machine gun at the time of the events. The command of the right checkpoint was also ensured by a Russian sergeant.

According to the report, Vadim Pisari was responsible for a serious breach of the rules of conduct at checkpoints and for threatening the lives of the soldiers present and of the people in the adjacent localities. At the same time, the report cited as one of the reasons for the incident the lack of appropriate means for stopping vehicles at the checkpoint.

Accordingly, the action of the Russian soldier was taken for the purpose of effecting a lawful arrest within the meaning of Article 2 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention.

However, the allegation that one of the bullets shot by V.K. pierced the coat of another soldier from the checkpoint who was not far from the car has not been disputed (see paragraph 13 above). This is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the use of a machine gun by V.K. posed a very serious risk not only for the life of Vadim Pisari but also for that of his passenger and even for that of the soldier who was almost hit by one of the bullets.

More importantly, it was not consistent with V.K.\u2019s initial affidavit written the same morning (see paragraph 13 above). Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that V.K. risked being hit by the victim\u2019s car and, therefore, finds no obvious indication of danger posed by the car driver if allowed to escape. Even assuming that the actions of Vadim Pisari were potentially dangerous, the Court does not consider that the level of the threat required that he had to be stopped immediately by gunfire.
