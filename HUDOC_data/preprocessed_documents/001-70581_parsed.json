The Government did not make any new submissions that would warrant a fresh examination of the same issues. In particular, the general statistics concerning the efficiency of the bailiffs' service in 1998 and 1999 is not relevant for the case at hand since in the aforementioned decision the Court found that the execution of the judgment was prevented by the failure to make adequate budgetary provisions by appropriate legislative measures, over which the bailiffs could not possibly have any control. The Court further observes that nothing in the Burdov case suggests that the application of principles concerning the execution of a final judgment established in the Court's case-law (see, among others, Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, p. 510, \u00a7 40, and Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 1999-V) is limited to instances related to payment of social benefits. In any event, the Court reiterates that, according to Rule\u00a055 of the Rules of Court, any plea of inadmissibility must be raised by the respondent Contracting Party in its written or oral observations on the admissibility of the application rather than during the procedure on the merits (see K.\u00a0and T. v.

The outstanding part of the amount claimed related to alleged damage to the applicant's property caused by State authorities, the poor state of the environment the applicant had to live in, a fine allegedly imposed on her in 1994-1995 and items allegedly seized in the course of searches of the applicant's flat conducted in 1999-2001.

The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Makarova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a07023/03, \u00a7 47, 24 February 2005 and Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7 33, 24 February 2005). The Court finds that in the present case the same principle applies, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government should secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the award made by the domestic courts. For this reason the Court does not find it necessary to make an award for pecuniary damage in so far as it relates to the principal amount.",
