In addition to the fact that it is issued to a private party in civil proceedings, and not to the police in criminal proceedings, an Anton Piller order is to be distinguished from a search warrant in that it confers no right of forcible entry onto premises. Its terms require the defendant to permit the plaintiff to enter, but it remains open to the defendant to refuse and, if he so wishes, to apply by urgent motion for variation or discharge of the order (see paragraph 20 below). He is, however, under pressure to give permission, especially since refusal to comply will expose him to the risk of proceedings for contempt of court on the motion of the plaintiff, with a possible penalty of imprisonment. Moreover, even if the defendant later succeeds in having the order discharged, his disobedience whilst it was in force will - unless it was made in circumstances in which it was a nullity in law - still constitute a contempt, albeit one which will probably be treated as technical and will usually attract no penalty (per Lord Justice Buckley in Hallmark Cards Inc. v.

On the expiry of that period, there will in principle be a hearing inter partes at which the court will review the order and consider whether the relief should be continued. On that occasion, or at any time subsequently, the defendant may apply for the order to be varied or discharged. Whilst the court may set aside the order even after its execution, it will not do so unless discharge was applied for reasonably soon thereafter and will serve some practical purpose (Booker McConnell plc v.

It is quite clear from our attendance note of the conversation that [the investigator] also told [H.] that the police were interested in you and [the applicant\u2019s company] in relation to pornographic material. It was also clearly assumed that should the police wish to take action then a joint execution of the search warrant and the [order] would be the ideal arrangement. Obviously anything other than a simultaneous execution might well prove to be to little or no effect. Of course no one could be certain at that time that such simultaneous execution would take place since it depended, inter alia, on a judge granting a full Anton Piller order and the police obtaining a search warrant quite apart from any other practical difficulties. That was the position when the application before the application judge was made on [26] February [1981]. Let us be quite clear, we do not in any way deny that it was the intention that the [order], if granted, would be served and executed at the same time as the search warrant, assuming that [that] was granted to the police and that the other arrangements could be made. We repeat that such is obvious. We also think reference to the transcript [of the hearing concerning the application for the order] makes it quite clear that the application judge was informed of the police interest and the likelihood or possibility of a search warrant being executed.\"",
