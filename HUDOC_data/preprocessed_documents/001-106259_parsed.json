He argued, however, that the said time-limit was, in fact, a maximum period for initial pre-trial detention, and should not be applied automatically, as the Government seem to have suggested. The applicant insisted that a domestic court should decide on the duration of pre-trial detention in each case individually, and that, in the absence of a clearly specified time-limit for such a detention, a relevant court decision would not constitute a sufficient legal basis for an individual\u2019s pre-trial detention.",

In particular, as regards the decision of 28 April 2005 by which the applicant\u2019s placement in pre-trial detention was ordered, the Government pointed out that the District Court had referred in its decision to Article 108 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure. They argued that this legal provision set no requirement for a domestic court to indicate a time-limit in its decision ordering an individual\u2019s placement in pre-trial detention, as it was clear from the wording of Article 109 of that Code that the initial period of such detention could not exceed two months. The Government insisted that the applicant\u2019s lawyers should have been aware of the time-limits established in Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, and could have explained to the applicant that his detention ordered by the court on 28 April 2005 would not have lasted more than two months.

Accordingly, even though the District Court had not specified in its decision of 26 April 2006, by which it had ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention, the period for that detention, it had been clear that, in accordance with Article\u00a0255 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, this period could not have exceeded six months from the date on which his case had been sent to the trial court, and that upon the expiry of that period the trial court could have extended the term of his detention pending trial each time for no longer than three months.

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see, as a recent authority, Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2010-...). It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature, and the Court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law may entail a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 56308/00, \u00a7 58, 10 August 2006, and Shteyn (Stein) v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23691/06, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 94, 18 June 2009).",

It also provided certain reasons for its decision (see paragraph 10 above). At the same time, the District Court remained silent as to how long the applicant should remain in detention. In this latter respect, the Government argued that Article 108 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure imposed no obligation on domestic courts to indicate any time-limit when ordering an individual\u2019s placement in pre-trial detention. The Court observes that this argument contradicts the interpretation of the relevant national legislation given by the Russian Constitutional Court, which emphasised on several occasions that the national courts were under an obligation to set a time-limit, when ordering an individual\u2019s placement in, or extending the period of, detention on remand, at any stage of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 37 above). It is therefore clear that, by omitting to specify such time-limit, the court order of 28 April 2005 failed to conform to the applicable rules of the domestic criminal procedure.",

The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure clearly provided that the initial period of pre-trial detention may not exceed two months. It also takes into account the fact that the applicant acknowledged that he had been aware of that provision. The Court, however, is not persuaded that the maximum time-limit provided for in Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure should be applied implicitly each time when an individual\u2019s placement in custody is being authorised by a domestic court. It is true that this period, in itself, does not appear unreasonably long and could be justified by the need for the authorities to ensure the proper conduct of various investigative actions. Nevertheless, the Court agrees with the  that, however short a period of one\u2019s detention on remand may be, it should be clearly defined by a domestic court, this being an essential guarantee against arbitrariness. With this in mind, the Court considers that the absence of any specific time-limit in the District Court\u2019s decision of 28\u00a0April 2005 amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d capable of rendering the applicant\u2019s detention pursuant to that order arbitrary and therefore \u201cunlawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).",

In any event, similarly to its finding in paragraph 50 above, the Court considers that a court\u2019s failure to specify a period, during which a person concerned should remain in detention after his or her case is referred to a court for trial, put such a person in a situation of uncertainty, as a period of six months is far too long to be applied implicitly on the sole ground that a criminal case has been lodged with a court competent to examine it.

Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2005X (extracts)). Although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. , 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7 102, 8 February 2005; Goral v.

This is particularly true in cases, such as the present one, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 was determined by the prosecution without judicial control of the issue whether collected evidence supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the imputed offence (see Rokhlina v.

The Court reiterates in this respect that it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish the existence of concrete facts relevant to the grounds for continued detention. Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina, cited above, \u00a7 67, and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85).",

At no point, however, did the domestic courts describe the applicant\u2019s personality in detail, disclose any evidence, or mention any particular facts of the applicant\u2019s case warranting his continued detention. The judiciary never specified why, notwithstanding the arguments put forward by the applicant in support of his requests for release, they considered the risk of his absconding, interference with the witnesses or with the course of justice, or reoffending to exist and to be decisive. Moreover, the preliminary investigation in the present case had ended by 17 April 2006, but the applicant remained in detention on remand for another year, until 16 April 2007, during which period the courts, in their decisions to extend the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial, simply stated that there were no reasons to revoke or change the applicant\u2019s preventive measure, as \u201cthe circumstances which the court had taken into account when ordering the applicant\u2019s placement in detention remained unchanged\u201d (see paragraphs\u00a023-24 and 26 above). The Court reiterates in this connection that whilst at the initial stages of the investigation the risk that an accused person might pervert the course of justice could justify keeping him or her in custody, after the evidence has been collected that ground becomes less strong (see Mamedova v. , no. 7064/05, \u00a7 79, 1 June 2006).",

It reiterates in this respect that the behaviour of a co-accused cannot be a decisive factor for the assessment of the risk of the detainee\u2019s absconding. Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee (see Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7 76).",

The Government went on to note that there had been no indication to that effect in the appeal of 3 May 2005, although the applicant\u2019s lawyers had undoubtedly been aware of the provisions of Article 375 \u00a7 2 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure and could have consulted the applicant on this point.

However, a day before the appeal hearing the applicant lodged a request seeking to have his attendance at that hearing secured by the appellate court. The latter granted the applicant\u2019s request but postponed the hearing until 25 May 2005. It therefore took the appellate court twenty-two days to examine the applicant\u2019s appeal against the detention order authorising his placement in custody, a period which, in itself, does not appear particularly long. Moreover, it is also clear that the applicant himself caused a delay in the examination of his appeal by lodging a request for his personal participation in the appeal hearing a day before the date for which that hearing was initially scheduled. In the absence of any explanation on the applicant\u2019s part in this respect, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that nothing prevented the applicant, who had been assisted by two lawyers, to express his intention to take part in the proceedings before the appellate court in the appeal of 3 May 2005.",

In this connection, the Court is not convinced that authorities should be expected to arrange for the immediate transport to a courtroom of any detainee who seeks his or her personal attendance in court proceedings a day before a scheduled hearing, as this does not appear to be enough notice.

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. In this regard the Court emphasises the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see, among other authorities, Ismoilov and Others v. , no. 2947/06, \u00a7\u00a7 161 and 166, 24 April 2008). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras v. , no. 42095/98, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000X).",
