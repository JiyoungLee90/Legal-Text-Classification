Firstly, the legal and social status of children born outside marriage had evolved considerably since the \u2019s decision of 8 December 1976 and had in practice become equivalent to that of children born within marriage. The , moreover, had itself adopted a more restrictive approach to Article 6 \u00a7 5 of the Basic Law (principle of equal treatment between children born outside and within marriage) in its decision of 18\u00a0November 1986 (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d, paragraph\u00a023 below). Furthermore, a new situation had arisen as a result of the accession of the former GDR to the FRG, since by virtue of section\u00a0235(1)(2) of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code, taken together with section 25(1), children born outside marriage before 1 July 1949 had the same rights as children born within marriage if the father had been resident in the territory of the former GDR on 3 October 1990 (see\u00a0\u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d, paragraphs 19-20 below). However, there were no objective grounds for a difference of treatment between children born outside marriage before or after 1 July 1949, or between children born outside marriage before 1 July 1949 according to whether or not the father had been resident in the territory of the former GDR on 3\u00a0October 1990. The Court of Appeal concluded that the arguments put forward by the Federal Constitutional Court in its decision of 8\u00a0December 1976 were no longer valid, particularly with regard to the practical and procedural difficulties of establishing the paternity of children born outside marriage before 1 July 1949, and the need to protect the \u201clegitimate expectations\u201d of the deceased (Vertrauensschutz des Erblassers) and his family.",

In the Regional Court\u2019s view, that provision did not contravene the Basic Law despite German reunification, as the Federal Constitutional Court had held in its decision of 3 July 1996 (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below, paragraph 22).",

Many paternity suits were therefore unlikely to succeed owing to insufficient evidence. Moreover, the new legislation made it possible to contest declarations of paternity drawn up before 1 July 1949. Accordingly, having regard to those factors, the legislature had not overstepped its margin of discretion in this regard. Furthermore, it had to a certain extent been able to take account of existing uncertainties regarding the law of succession and of the opinion of those opposed to reforming the legal status of children born outside marriage. Lastly, the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of the deceased and their families that the exception provided for in the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act would be maintained also deserved a certain degree of protection.",

Following German reunification, in order to avoid any disadvantage for children born outside marriage in a different social context, it also granted them the same inheritance rights as children born within marriage, provided that the father had been resident in the territory of the former GDR at the time when the reunification had taken effect. However, it maintained the exception laid down in the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act, which excluded children born outside marriage before 1\u00a0July 1949 from any statutory entitlement to inherit. The constitutionality of that provision was also confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court, first in 1976 and twenty years later in 1996 (see\u00a0\u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d, paragraphs 21-22 above).

It reiterates in this connection that as early as 1979 it held in its Marckx judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-59) that the distinction made for succession purposes between \u201cillegitimate\u201d and \u201clegitimate\u201d children raised an issue under Articles 14 and 8 taken together.",

Firstly, the applicant\u2019s father had recognised her after her birth and had always had regular contact with her despite the difficult circumstances linked to the existence of two separate German States. He had neither a wife nor any direct descendants, but simply heirs of the third order whom he apparently did not know. The aspect of protecting these distant relatives\u2019 \u201clegitimate expectations\u201d cannot therefore come into play. Secondly, the applicant has spent a large portion of her life in the former GDR, where she grew up in a social context in which children born outside and within marriage enjoyed equal status. However, she was unable to derive any benefit from the rules providing for equal inheritance rights between children born outside and within marriage, since her father had not been resident in the territory of the former GDR at the time when German reunification had taken effect. In this connection, it should be noted that following German reunification, the legislature sought to protect the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage whose father had been resident in the territory of the former GDR; since inheritance rights come under the protection of the right of property in German law, the factor taken into account was the deceased\u2019s place of residence. Yet while this difference of treatment may have been justified in the light of the social context in the former GDR, it nevertheless had the effect of aggravating the existing inequality in relation to children born outside marriage before 1\u00a0July 1949 whose father had been resident in the FRG. Lastly, the application of the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act excluded the applicant from any statutory entitlement to the estate, without affording her any financial compensation.",
