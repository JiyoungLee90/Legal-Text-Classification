The hospital record read that twenty-five per cent of the applicant\u2019s body, mainly the face and the upper body, had been burned (combusio corporis, facies et extremitas superior) owing to the acid attack and that she was in a critical condition. On 1 August 2009 she was taken to Italy for more specialised hospital treatment. The hospital record of 2 October 2009 read that the applicant had medium to deep facial, neck and body burns (ustioni intermedioprofonde di volto, collo, tronco, arti superiori ed inferiori) caused by sulphuric acid. According to the record of her hospital treatment in Italy, between 2009 and 2012 the applicant underwent at least fourteen operations. The costs for such operations were borne by the Regions of Puglia and Marche, Italy, and by the applicant. She suffered from anxiety and from psychological problems and was scared to go back to Albania. She was granted sick leave by the Albanian authorities for at least seven months but it appears that she was unable to work for several years.",

The domestic courts dismissed his action. The Tirana Court of Appeal held that, since the criminal investigation had been ongoing, and since the prosecutor\u2019s office had had the discretion to determine the investigative actions to be carried out, the complainant did not have legal standing. It reaffirmed that there was no right of appeal against a decision to stay criminal proceedings under the criminal procedural law.

It defined gender-based violence as \u201cviolence which is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately\u201d. General Recommendation no. 19 stated that \u201cStates may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing compensation\u201d. As regards comments on specific articles of the CEDAW Convention, General Recommendation no. 19 further noted that \u201ctraditional attitudes by which women are regarded as subordinate to men or as having stereotyped roles perpetuate widespread practices involving violence or coercion, such as family violence and abuse, forced marriage, dowry deaths, acid attacks and female circumcision. Such prejudices and practices may justify gender-based violence as a form of protection or control of women. The effect of such violence on the physical and mental integrity of women is to deprive them of the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of human rights and fundamental freedoms. While this comment addresses mainly actual or threatened violence the underlying consequences of these forms of gender-based violence help to maintain women in subordinate roles and contribute to their low level of political participation and to their lower level of education, skills and work opportunities\u201d.",

According to General Recommendation no. 35, gender-based violence against women \u201cis one of the fundamental social, political and economic means by which the subordinate position of women with respect to men and their stereotyped roles are perpetuated. Throughout its work, the [CEDAW] Committee has made clear that this violence is a critical obstacle to achieving substantive equality between women and men as well as to women\u2019s enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Convention. It takes multiple forms, including acts or omissions intended or likely to cause or result in death or physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, threats of such acts, harassment, coercion and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. (...) Gender-based violence against women may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in certain circumstances, including in cases of rape, domestic violence or harmful practices.

Data in the 2019 survey provided evidence that violence against women and girls in Albania was widespread and that it affected the majority of women. The 2018 survey revealed that 52.9% of women of 1874 years \u2018ever\u2019 experienced one or more of the five different types of violence (intimate partner violence, dating violence, non-partner violence, sexual harassment and/or stalking) during their lifetime and 36.6% of women \u2018currently\u2019 experienced violence. 75.4% of women reported domestic violence against women is a major problem in Albania. 70.8% of women reported sexual violence against women and girls is a major problem in Albania, 69.9% reported sexual harassment of women and girls is a major problem, and 68.4% reported stalking of women is a major problem in Albania.

In addition, 27.5% of women maintained all or most people in the community believe when a woman was beaten by her husband that she was partly to blame or at fault and that a woman should be ashamed or embarrassed to talk to anyone outside of her family about abuse or violence in her marriage. These social norms can contribute to the prevalence of intimate partner domestic violence against women and keep battered women trapped in abusive and violent relationships.",

Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, \u00a7 140, 25 June 2019; Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2004XI, and Soare and Others v. Romania, no. 24329/02, \u00a7 108, 22 February 2011). In the present case the Court notes that the applicant was the subject of a violent attack which resulted in grievous injuries, pain, and disfigurement of twenty five percent of her body. She was sent to the hospital in a critical condition (see\u00a0paragraph 6 above) and according to the report of 18 December 2009 her life would have been in danger if no specialist medical aid had been given (see paragraph 33 above). The Court therefore considers that the method used by the assailant was of a nature and intensity likely to endanger the life of the applicant. Article 2 of the Convention is therefore applicable in this case.",

At the relevant time, the Criminal Code provided for a number of offences committed against a person\u2019s life or health. These offences, including that provided for in Article 88 of the CC under which the prosecutor opened the criminal investigation into the acid attack, are subject to investigation by the prosecutor of his own motion (see also paragraph 63 above). The Court is satisfied that, in the absence of any arguments by the applicant that the criminal-law provisions were ineffective, there existed an effective legislative framework in Albania at the relevant time concerning crimes against life and health. The Court further notes, although not relevant to the present case, that, following legislative amendments in 2012 and 2013, the Criminal Code contains specific provisions proscribing domestic violence and battery, and criminalising as an aggravating circumstance the commission of another offence during or after a court protection order given in relation to the occurrence of domestic violence (see paragraphs 65 and 66 above).",

The applicant\u2019s statement was corroborated by the applicant\u2019s family members. However, it does not appear that the applicant at any time before the attack brought to the authorities\u2019 attention any risks posed to her life by her former husband, which would have triggered the authorities\u2019 positive obligation to take preventive measures or other reasonable steps to protect the applicant\u2019s life (compare and contrast Osman, cited above, and Civek v. Turkey, no.\u00a055354/11, 23 February 2016).

The investigation must be capable of establishing the cause of the injuries and, where appropriate, the identification of those responsible with a view to their punishment (see\u00a0Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.

Whenever there are any doubts about the occurrence of domestic violence or violence against women, special diligence is required of the authorities to deal with the specific nature of the violence in the course of the domestic proceedings (see Volodina v. Russia, no. 41261/17, \u00a7\u00a092, 9\u00a0July 2019).",

Between 2006 and 2012 the international reports further noted that violence against women was under-reported, under-investigated, under-prosecuted, and under-sentenced. They suggested that the police and prosecuting authorities manifested an ineffectual approach to violence against women on the ground of \u2018social attitude and cultural values\u2019 and that a climate of leniency or impunity prevailed towards perpetrators of violence against women (see paragraphs 113, 117 and 120-122 above). In its 2010 Concluding Observations, the CEDAW Committee recommended, amongst other things, that \u201cpublic officials, especially law enforcement officials and members of the judiciary\u201d become fully aware of all forms of violence against women\u201d. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that, at the time of the attack, there existed prima facie a general climate in Albania that was conducive to violence against women. Furthermore, the 2017 GREVIO evaluation report noted that domestic violence exceeded \u201call other crimes as the criminal offence with the largest number of victims\u201d (see\u00a0paragraph 109 above).",
