The case originated in an application (no. 29188/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cemil Erbey (“the applicant”), on 23 May 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr E. Şahin, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 12 June 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

The Ministry also alleged that an expropriation had been effected in relation to the said land in 1966 and that V.G. had received compensation for it. However, the land register had not been amended due to an administrative error.

In its judgment, the first-instance court noted that the Ministry had been in actual possession of this land for more than twenty years and that the applicant had been aware of this fact when he had bought the plot.
The applicant appealed.
On 17 September 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 20 December 2000.
The applicant requested rectification of the decision of 17 September 2001.
On 24 December 2001 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's request.
