Although the Board of Inquiry was made up of members of the armed forces, none were in the applicant's immediate chain of command or had any connection with the events in respect of which the applicant sought redress. The procedure before the Board of Inquiry was set out in the relevant rules and the  principles applied throughout. The applicant was present at those proceedings and was represented by counsel, who was able to cross-examine witnesses and lodge written submissions. Accordingly, the Government concluded that the factual questions were examined by a quasi-judicial body whose process had most of the hallmarks of a judicial process and was attended by numerous quasi-judicial safeguards. As regards the decision on the amount of compensation to award, although this was taken administratively, the  principles applied and, in any case, the decision was subject to challenge by way of judicial review. It was therefore entirely appropriate in the present case.",

Whereas in , the issues to be determined required a measure of professional knowledge or experience and the exercise of administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims, in Tsfayo the Housing Benefits Review Board (\u201cHBRB\u201d) was deciding a simple question of fact, namely whether there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the applicant's delay in making a housing benefit claim. On this question, the applicant had given evidence to the HBRB that the first that she knew that anything was amiss with her claim for housing benefit was when she received a notice from her landlord \u2013 the housing association \u2013 seeking to repossess her flat because her rent was in arrears. The HBRB found her explanation to be unconvincing and rejected her claim for back-payment of benefit essentially on the basis of their assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue. Nor could the factual findings in Tsfayo be said to be merely incidental to the reaching of broader judgments of policy or expediency which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take. Accordingly, the Court concluded that judicial review proceedings did not offer, in the circumstances raised in Tsfayo, \u201csufficiency of review\u201d in light of the fact that the High Court had no jurisdiction to rehear the evidence or substitute its own views as to the applicant's credibility. As a result, the central issue in the dispute was not determined by an independent and impartial tribunal.",

However, as noted above (\u00a7 72), it is not always the case that such circumstances will give rise to a violation of Article 6. The Court observes that the Army Board had responsibility, in the main, for making findings of fact. In addition, in the present case, it enjoyed a large degree of discretion in deciding what level of compensation ought to be offered to the applicant, the relevant legislation and internal regulations laying down no particular method by which any award of compensation ought to be calculated. However, unlike the cases of Bryan v. the United Kingdom and X v. the United Kingdom, cited above, the exercise of that discretion did not benefit from any specialist knowledge offered by the members of the tribunal in question. Accordingly, there was no compelling reason for the decision on the level of compensation to have been made by the Army Board, rather than by an independent and impartial tribunal. In this respect, therefore, the Court considers that the circumstances are similar to those in Tsfayo. There will therefore be a breach of Article 6 unless in the particular circumstances of the case the judicial review proceedings offered \u201csufficiency of review\u201d such as to ensure that the requirements of Article 6 regarding the independence and impartiality of the tribunal were met.",

The central issue in the applicant's case was whether the approach of the Army Board in assessing the level of the compensation order was appropriate. The Court considers it significant that in its October 2003 judgment, the High Court examined in some detail how the Army Board had arrived at the figure offered. It is clear that the applicant's criticisms were carefully examined by the court, which reached its decision following an analysis of the approach of the Army Board and an assessment of whether or not that approach was reasonable in the circumstances. As regards the applicant's first criticism concerning the exercise of the Army Board's discretion in calculating the award on the basis of a six-year cut-off date, the High Court was able to review all the relevant factors relating to the decision of the Army Board and to assess whether the approach taken was appropriate. The criticism was rejected on the ground that the Army Board had acted entirely properly in selecting a six year cut-off date for the calculation. In respect of the second criticism regarding the salary base used for the calculation of the compensation award, the Court observes that in so far as there was a factual dispute between the parties as to the applicant's salary at the time of the redundancy, the question of fact was in the event revisited: the High Court had regard to papers submitted by the applicant supporting his argument that an incorrect salary base had been used and concluded that further investigation was required. Accordingly, the matter was reviewed by the Army Board, which subsequently made a substantially increased offer of compensation. The applicant does not dispute that the revised salary base used was correct.",
