Before the judge, he wanted to call Mr Walusimbi to give first-hand evidence that the plaintiff had taken drugs. This was neither pleaded nor included in the Panorama material. The judge rightly excluded it and there is no application for leave to appeal against that part of the decision. The judge held that the general evidence added little or nothing to the issue of widespread drug taking. I agree, not least since I would permit Professor Beckett's evidence to be adduced and this deals with the same topic. Further general evidence about widespread drug use by athletes does not go to establish that the plaintiff has taken drugs or that he is reasonably suspected of having done so. This again was very late evidence tendered in breach of court orders and the rules, and I consider that the judge exercised his discretion correctly to exclude it.\u201d",

As an indication of the prejudice which he had suffered, the applicant referred to the exclusion of the evidence of two of his best witnesses as a consequence of his misunderstanding of the requirements laid down for valid service of evidence. He cited also technical deficiencies in the drafting of his defence pleadings which led in part to the exclusion of Mr Moule's evidence and restricted the applicant's ability to cross-examine Mr Christie and his witnesses at trial. He alleged further prejudice as a result of his ignorance about how to force disclosure of Mr Christie's drug-testing records and how he might seek to have certain evidence given by Mr\u00a0Christie's witnesses excluded from the trial on the basis that it had not been anticipated.

They explained these decisions by reference to three factors. Firstly, the absence of an express provision relating to civil proceedings, equivalent to the Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) right to legal assistance in criminal proceedings, which implied that the obligation to provide legal aid under Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be restricted. Secondly, the fact that the Convention left States a free choice as to the means to be used in ensuring a right of effective access to a court. Such means may comprise, for example, simplification of rules of procedure rather than provision of legal aid. Thirdly, the legitimacy, given limited resources, of operating systems of civil legal aid which restrict eligibility so long as such restrictions were not arbitrary. ",

However, the Court notes that a number of factors exist which indicate that the applicant was concerned with verifying the truth or reliability of the allegations to a high standard only after the event, once the defamation proceedings had been commenced against him. Firstly, the applicant stated in his application to the Court that the assessment of whether Mr Christie used or was justifiably to be suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs was inevitably going to involve considerable expert evidence, access to which was constrained by the applicant's limited financial means. Secondly, the offending article itself made no mention of any authoritative basis for the drug-taking allegation. Indeed, the applicant conceded in the article that \u201cthere is no bloody hypodermic needle, and no direct evidence that points the finger at Christie\u201d, and that the allegation was supported only by \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d (see paragraph 9 above). Thirdly, the evidence of Mr Moule and Mr\u00a0Walusimbi, which the applicant described as crucial to his case, was initially presented in very vague terms more than a year after the article was published, and was elaborated upon only immediately before the commencement of the trial.",
