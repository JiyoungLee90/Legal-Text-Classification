The first issue which the jury had to decide was whether the two couriers (N. and M.) had made contact with the applicant in March 2003. In his statement to the police the applicant denied knowing the two women and other people mentioned by them, and also denied that he had made and received calls to and from Turkey. However, the two women identified the applicant as being the person they made contact with in March 2003, namely as the person who had given N. food, gloves, disinfectant and a laxative, and to whom M. had given the capsules they had carried in their stomachs. A number of factors gave credibility to the women\u2019s identification of the applicant: (i) the circumstances of the meetings they had with him at which time he was using a white four-door car and was in the company of an Asian woman; (ii) the applicant\u2019s statement that he habitually made use of a white four-door Ford Escort and that he was married to a Thai woman; (iii) the fact that when arrested N. and M. had separately identified the applicant in photographs; (iv) moreover, the two women had separately identified the applicant in identification parades supervised by a duty magistrate; and they did the same without hesitation when they testified, both during the committal stage and before the jury. In the light of all those factors the jurors could reasonably conclude that the person N. and M. had met in March 2003 and to whom they had delivered the capsules was the applicant.",

The court considered that a recipient would expect to receive the full delivery, and that therefore it was logical for the supplier to force the courier to deliver what had been missing because of her fault. It followed that, from their testimony, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that what N. and M. had carried in March 2003 was also heroin. The court considered that this was the only possible conclusion to be arrived at. Neither was it conjecture to conclude that the drug being carried in April was destined for the applicant. Indeed during the trial by jury M. had indicated the applicant as the recipient. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that he could not be the recipient because the women had referred to someone whose father had passed away, which was not the case for the applicant. It considered the relevant part of the statement by the women as hearsay evidence and in any event it was a statement which referred to a third person and not the applicant.",

It noted that a correct interpretation of Salduz v.\u00a0Turkey\u00a0[GC]\u00a0(no.\u00a036391/02, ECHR\u00a02008) had to be made in view of the circumstances of that case, where indeed Mr Salduz had been in a vulnerable position when he had made his statement. The rationale of the right was precisely that, and not to allow guilty persons to be let off scotfree because of a formality which had no real or serious consequences. In the present case the applicant did not claim that he was forced to make the statement, or that he was in any other way vulnerable when he made his statement. The right to a lawyer was aimed at avoiding abuses, which in fact did not happen in the applicant\u2019s case. Thus, while there was no procedural obstacle for the applicant to complain at this stage, namely before the constitutional jurisdictions, despite the fact that he had not raised the issue in the criminal proceedings, the element of vulnerability was missing in the applicant\u2019s case, and thus there could be no violation of his rights. The Constitutional Court held that even if the statement had been determinant for the finding of guilt, that finding was not necessarily tainted unless the statement had been obtained under duress, which was not so in the present case. Nevertheless, in the instant case the statement was of no relevance whatsoever, as the applicant had not admitted to anything and the Court of Criminal Appeal had only referred to the statement in saying that the jury had not believed the applicant\u2019s version. It had been other evidence that had led to his finding of guilt. Lastly, the Constitutional Court noted that it could not agree to a general view that the moment a statement was made without legal assistance it became ipso facto invalid and brought about a breach of Article\u00a06.",

However, it was not so in the present case, where the witnesses had reiterated their statements even before the trial courts. It followed that those statements were also admissible. Lastly it confirmed the reasoning of the first-instance court relating to the impartiality of the magistrate, finding the applicant\u2019s argument opportunistic.",

The Constitutional Court further noted that Mr Salduz\u2019s young age had not been the decisive factor for the finding in that case, but merely a further argument. Moreover, it was not necessary in the case at hand to examine whether there existed any compelling reasons to justify the absence of a lawyer during questioning or whether such restrictions prejudiced the case, in so far as at the relevant time Maltese law had not provided for the right to legal assistance at that stage of the investigation and therefore there had been no need for the accused to request it. There had therefore been a systemic restriction on access to a lawyer under the relevant legal provision in force at the time.

As a result, a number of cases where the accused had not been assisted by a lawyer \u2013 because the matter was not regulated in Maltese law \u2013 were found not to violate the Convention and the Constitution. Nevertheless, in The Republic of Malta vs Alfred Camilleri of 12\u00a0November 2012 the Constitutional Court, in the particular circumstances of the case, found a violation of the accused\u2019s fair trial rights, in particular because he had not even been cautioned by the police. However, following a request for retrial which was upheld by a judgment of the Constitutional Court of 31 January 2014, no violation was found in that case because the accused, who had given a statement in the absence of a lawyer, had not been forced to reply to the questions put to him by the police, nor was he particularly vulnerable to the extent that he would have required the assistance of a lawyer. The accused was fifty-five years old and therefore mature. While he had never been to prison or been questioned, he had already been found guilty of minor charges and therefore was acquainted with the law. Lastly, his statement had not been the only evidence, as some police officers had been eyewitnesses to his handling of the drugs in issue.",

In the applicant\u2019s view the latter judgment was continuously misinterpreted by the domestic courts, despite its principles being reiterated by the Court in other cases, such as in Pishchalnikov v.\u00a0Russia (no. 7025/04, 24 September 2009), where the Court found a violation despite the fact that the statement had not been the sole evidence. The applicant further referred to Dayanan v.

Denmark, \u00a7\u00a050, 24\u00a0May 1989, Series A no. 154). What matters is the extent and nature of the pre-trial measures taken by the judge (see Fey v. Austria, 24\u00a0February 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 255A). On the one hand, the presence on the bench of a member of the judiciary who had conducted the preliminary investigation with extensive investigation and questioning, provided grounds for some legitimate misgivings leading to a violation of Article\u00a06 (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 86, and Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria, 25 February 1992, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 227). On the other hand, less onerous steps such as a marginal interrogation role where it was not for the impugned person on the bench to assess the merits of the accusations at the earlier investigation stage, did not lead to the same conclusion (see Fey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-36). One of the relevant factors was whether the judge at issue could have had a pre-formed opinion (on the applicant\u2019s guilt) which was liable to weigh heavily in the balance at the moment of the decision (see De Cubber, cited above, \u00a7 29, and Fey, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

Furthermore, the magistrate had the power to order the applicant\u2019s arrest if he had not already been remanded in custody, and to hear any bail requests.

The Government noted that in Albu and Others v.\u00a0Romania (nos. 34796/09 and others, 10 May 2012) the Court reiterated the general principles applicable in cases concerning conflicting court decisions. It emphasised that it was not the Court\u2019s function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court, unless they had infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Furthermore, in that judgment the Court reiterated that the possibility of conflicting court decisions was an inherent trait of any judicial system and that it was important to establish whether \u2018profound and long-standing differences\u2019 existed in the case-law of the domestic courts, whether the domestic law provided for machinery for overcoming those inconsistencies, whether that machinery had been applied, and if appropriate to what effect. A key consideration in assessing the above was whether certain stability in legal situations had been ensured, as legal certainty contributed to public confidence in the courts. However, the requirements of legal certainty did not create a right of consistency of case-law, given that caselaw development was not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice. Achieving consistency of the law might take time, and periods of conflicting case-law might therefore be tolerated without undermining legal certainty.",

The Constitutional Court has also established that each and every case is considered on its own merits and if it transpires that the person is not a vulnerable person or there is other evidence besides an admission in a statement, the Constitutional Court did not find an Article 6 violation.

No plausible grounds were given for this radical change from the same Constitutional Court\u2019s prior case-law, which had specifically denied the \u201cdecisive\u201d role of the age or vulnerability factor in the determination of the Salduz right to legal assistance.

Such [a] case-by-case approach does not run counter to the principle of judicial certainty, as diametrically opposed judgments presuppose that these were given in different cases.\u201d In other words, the Government is claiming that Salduz did not posit a principle of law and therefore national courts may depart from it when the facts of a case are not exactly the same as those in Salduz. This view not only downgrades Salduz to the rank of a strictly fact-sensitive understatement by the Grand Chamber, but, worse still, reflects a wrong and worrying methodological perspective on the Court\u2019s role and the legal force of its judgments.",

Should the Contracting Parties be free to follow the Court\u2019s case-law if, when and so far as this pleased the respective Governments or local courts, the \u201cachievement of greater unity\u201d between these Parties would be an illusory goal, each of the Parties choosing at any given historical moment the extent to which they wished to take part in the \u201ccommon understating and observance of ... human rights\u201d which is at the heart of the European human rights protection system. Were the principle of the subsidiarity of the Court\u2019s review to be amenable to such discretionary manipulation of the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would be downgraded to the position of a mere commission tasked with recommending to the Contracting Parties to the Convention the steps they could possibly take for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the States remaining free to take into consideration convenient judgments and to ignore inconvenient judgments delivered by this Court. To paraphrase Loizidou, such a system, which would enable States to qualify the binding nature of the Court\u2019s judgments, would not only seriously weaken the role of the Court in the discharge of its functions, but would also diminish the effectiveness of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order (ordre public).",

In other words, the constitutional remedy was useless.

It seems to me that paragraph\u00a068 of Dimech clearly contradicts paragraph 131 of Borg. The optimistic approach in Borg is not backed up by the pessimistic assessment in Dimech.

In this scenario, the objective impartiality test will hinge on the type of decisions taken by the investigating magistrate, which might raise a plausible suspicion as to his or her preconceived mindset. For example, an investigating magistrate who has ordered the arrest of a person whom he or she considered to be guilty or against whom there was sufficient circumstantial evidence (Article 554 of the Criminal Code) should not intervene in the trial, since that previous order would instil serious doubts in the mind of the accused and gravely undermine the trial judge\u2019s objective impartiality.",

In that case, the Court examined whether the post held by a central investigating judge within the Ministry of the Interior could have raised an issue as to his objective impartiality once he had returned to his post as a judge and taken over the investigation of the pending criminal case. After leaving political office to resume the investigation, the investigating judge did not satisfy the impartiality requirement of Article 6. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court and, in particular, the investigating judge appointed from that court\u2019s Criminal Division, had corrected the defect in question by conducting a fresh investigation from the outset. During that process, most of the investigative steps had been carried out anew and many further measures had been taken, and the parties had had the opportunity, both before the designated investigating judge and at the trial in the Supreme Court, to confirm or contradict the statements previously taken from them, in a procedure offering all the necessary guarantees. Hence, the allegations of lack of impartiality for political reasons in the trial of a Minister of State for Security at the Ministry of the Interior convicted of misappropriation of public funds and false imprisonment, although grounded, did not suffice to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. The Court concluded, by four votes to three, that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. In the present case, no political suspicion lingered over the magistrate sitting in the Court of Magistrates as a Court of Criminal Inquiry, nor had she any previous ministerial tasks which could raise a doubt about her objective impartiality.",

In my opinion, the question is much simpler: the applicant had not had victim status since his withdrawal of the related plea on 30\u00a0October 2006. In any case, the complaint is unfounded, in view of the fact that the witnesses\u2019 statements were confirmed under oath before the magistrate conducting the inquiry and repeated during trial, where the witnesses were cross-examined.

The present judgment reiterates Dimech, which is wrong and should be reversed. If Dimech opened the door to legal uncertainty, the present judgment keeps it wide open.

Be that as it may, in the light of the repetitive findings of violations of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention by this Court, the Maltese Constitutional Court should correct its trajectory and return to its initial Convention-friendly interpretation of Salduz.
