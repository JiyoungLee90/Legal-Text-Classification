Answering the Roma's mockery and insults addressed to him and to his cow, Che\u0163an Gligor started to threaten the Roma with his whip and even hit Pardalian L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f.

Mircea Zoltan was stopped from coming out of the house by a villager and was hit by another's fist and a shovel, which finally led to his dying in the fire. His carbonized body was found the following day in the burned-down house. The autopsy report established that he had died from respiratory failure, 100% carbonized.",

The Convention system is a subsidiary one and provides for the exhaustion of domestic remedies. We observe that the T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f court of appeal, in its judgment of 24 February 2004, referring inter alia to the Court's case-law, confirmed the applicants' right to pecuniary damages and awarded non-pecuniary damages (see \u00a7 77). This conclusion was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. The fact that the amount requested by the applicants was diminished by the domestic courts due to the state of provocation under which the accused had committed the crimes does not raise, according to us, any problem under the Convention.
