Patent law, both substantive and procedural, is governed by the Patent Act (Act of 7 November 1910, Official Gazette (Staatsblad) 1910, no. 313, as subsequently amended).  Certain procedural details are dealt with in delegated legislation made by the Minister for Economic Affairs under the Patent Act.  ",

It was therefore decided to establish a system involving an examination of patent applications by a State agency which was \"entitled, though not obliged,\" to extend its examination to \"all points which [might] be of relevance to the validity of the patent\", and in which \"during the examination the opportunity [should] be offered for entering objections\".  An expert body was created for this purpose, the Patent Office.  It was observed that only by creating such a body \"[could] the technical experts, who [were] quite indispensable, obtain an independence befitting them\" and \"[could] the required guarantee be provided for the quality of the decisions which, although they [might] not quite be judicial decisions in the strict sense of the word, [came] very close to being so\".

The member had not contested the order itself.  For that reason the tribunals had to assume that he could only have been dismissed without justification if the order had manifestly been given without proper authority.  In the particular case, the order was capable of being based on Rule 11A of the Industrial Property Rules (Reglement Industri\u00eble Eigendom), a provision introduced in 1957, according to which duties incumbent on the Patent Office but not assigned specifically to any Division were to be carried out by the President, who was empowered to delegate them to ordinary members of the Patent Office.  The Central Appeals Tribunal quoted the explanatory memorandum to the Order of 1957 introducing the above Rule 11A, from which it appeared that the competent Minister had assumed that members of the Patent Office were subordinate to the President except in relation to decisions relating to patent applications.  With regard to such decisions they could act only in accordance with their own convictions (see the judgment of the Central Appeals Tribunal of 17 February 1971, no. 1970/B 12, unpublished).  ",

In that case the plaintiff, against whom an injunction had been issued in earlier summary proceedings restraining it from infringing a patent owned by the defendant, asked for a declaration that this injunction applied only to the period between the issuing of the injunction and the date on which the plaintiff had requested the Patent Office to grant a compulsory licence under the patent.  The defendant pleaded that the proceedings relating to compulsory licences were not binding on it as the Patent Office, in deciding on compulsory licences (which in the defendant's view amounted to the determination of civil rights and obligations as understood by Article 6 (art.\u00a06) of the Convention), was not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\".  The President of the  declined to give a ruling on this issue.  Even if its assumption were correct, the defendant could, after the grant of the compulsory licence, address itself to the civil courts, which would then decide whether the compulsory licence had been properly granted.  The defendant's objection to the arrangement for the grant of a compulsory licence could therefore in no way warrant the conclusion that such a licence should never be granted to the plaintiff, which had been the thinking underlying the defence plea.

Secondly, that case-law had left intact the obligation, in \"appeal-to-the-Crown\" proceedings, to appeal first to the competent administrative bodies before review by the civil courts was possible.

In this respect the present case is to be distinguished from that of Van de Hurk v. the , where the civil courts had actually held the administrative tribunal in question to afford sufficient safeguards (judgment of 19 April 1994, Series\u00a0A no. 288, p. 18, para. 54).

Unlike the applicant company, the Court considers its Oerlemans judgment as a pertinent precedent since, far from being based on the particular circumstances, that judgment was grounded on the finding of \"well-established principles of  law\" which were applicable in the specific case.  After a comprehensive examination of the pertinent case-law of the Netherlands Supreme Court as well as the opinions of learned legal commentators in the Netherlands, the Court found it established that \"where an administrative appeal to a higher authority [was] not considered to offer sufficient guarantees as to a fair procedure it [was] possible to have recourse to the civil courts for a full review of the lawfulness of the administrative decision\" (p. 21, para. 53).  The applicant company has not convinced the Court that this conclusion was based on an erroneous interpretation of Netherlands law and the Court therefore sees no reason in the present case to revise its earlier finding as to the state of  law. The \"well-established principles\" relied on by the Court in arriving at its conclusion predate the dispute which was at the root of the Oerlemans case and were gleaned from domestic case-law relating to forms of \"administrative appeal\" other than an \"appeal to the Crown\" (see the Oerlemans judgment, p. 21, paras. 53-54).  It follows, therefore, that the Court's finding as to  law relates generally to all instances where the civil courts do not consider an administrative procedure to afford sufficient procedural safeguards.

Should they have found this to be so, the civil courts would have had full jurisdiction to rule on the merits, that is, to decide whether the Appeals Division had been right to refuse to grant the patent applied for and to afford appropriate relief.  The judgment of the President of the Regional Court of The Hague of 11 July 1989 (BIE 1990, p.\u00a0246 - see paragraph 60 above) provides corroboration of this analysis.  ",
