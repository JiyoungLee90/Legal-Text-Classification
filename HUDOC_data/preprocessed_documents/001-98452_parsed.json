He had not appealed against the decision of the district prosecutor to dismiss his complaint. In particular, on 25\u00a0March 2005 the district prosecutor had received the applicant's complaint about the conditions of his detention. In response, the prosecutor had admitted that the applicant's allegations were true and had advised the applicant that the right existed to appeal against the decision to dismiss the complaint. However, the applicant had not done so. The Government further argued that the applicant had also had the opportunity to bring a compensation action for non-pecuniary damage resulting from the unsatisfactory conditions of detention. Lastly, the applicant, who had had an opportunity to meet regularly with his lawyer, could have complained to the latter that the conditions of his detention were poor. They provided a relevant statement signed by K., the court-appointed lawyer who had represented the applicant at the time. As regards the postal receipts submitted by the applicant as proof that his complaints about the conditions of his detention had been dispatched to the domestic authorities, the Government noted that those letters had been addressed to the judicial qualifications' board and had nothing to do with the applicant's grievances concerning the conditions of his detention.",

The regional prosecutor and the district court had remitted his complaints to the district prosecutor's office. The regional court had sent the complaint to the district court which, in its turn, remitted it to the district prosecutor. As regards K.'s statement submitted by the Government, the applicant considered it irrelevant. The purpose of the lawyer's visits had been to discuss his client's defence.

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must, for a violation to be found, go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94, ECHR 2000-XI).",
