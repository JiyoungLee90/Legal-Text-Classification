However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-III, and Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19\u00a0March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 510, \u00a7 40).

Russia, no. 38305/02, \u00a7\u00a035, 17 March 2005).",

Russia, no.\u00a069529/01, 18 November 2004). The Court found that the quashing of the judgment, as a result of what was an \u201cappeal in disguise\u201d rather than a conscientious effort to make good a miscarriage of justice, breached the principle of legal certainty and the applicant\u2019s \u201cright to a court\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 33).",

The quashing took place in the same way as in Pravednaya, on account of the discovery of new circumstances. The same ministerial instruction, which interpreted the Pensions Law in a different manner from that applied in the judgment in the applicant\u2019s case and which was issued after the judgment had come into force, served as such a \u201cnew\u201d circumstance. It is conceivable that the statutory pensions regulations are liable to change and a judicial decision cannot be relied on as a guarantee against such changes in the future. However, the enforcement of a final judgment awarding a pension in respect of a period preceding the judgment should be guaranteed. The Court\u2019s task in the present case is not to assess whether the quashing of the judgment as such was compatible with the Convention, but rather whether the quashing was capable of justifying the failure to enforce the judgment. With regard to the latter question, the Court does not find any reason which would enable it to reach a different conclusion in the present case from that in Pravednaya. Therefore, the quashing of the judgment, which did not respect the principle of legal certainty and the applicant\u2019s \u201cright to a court\u201d, cannot be accepted as a reason to justify the non-enforcement of the judgment.",
