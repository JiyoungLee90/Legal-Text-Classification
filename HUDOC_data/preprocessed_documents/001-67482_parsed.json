However, special considerations might apply in exceptional cases where applicants first avail themselves of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage become aware of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six-month period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware of these circumstances (see Ayd\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), nos.\u00a028293/95, 29494/95 and 30219/96, ECHR 2000III (extracts)).",

Consequently, even if it is accepted that the remedy offered only a remote prospect of success, as alleged here, it was not a futile step.
