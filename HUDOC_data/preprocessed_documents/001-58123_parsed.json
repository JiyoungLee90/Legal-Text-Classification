The majority\u2019s conclusion that the applicant had fulfilled the requirement of exhaustion under Article 26 of the Convention has the unfortunate consequence of making the case-law less clear in this area and of weakening the principle of subsidiarity. According to this principle, it may be recalled, it is the national authorities which have the primary responsibility for the enforcement of the Convention guarantees; the European Court having only a supervisory role which comes into operation once the national means of redress have been exhausted. It is therefore of utmost importance from the point of view of the Convention system of protection of human rights that the national authorities, notably the courts, are given a proper opportunity to make good the matter complained of before the Strasbourg review enters into play.
