Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that this principle also applies in the present cases. It, therefore, considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgments in favour of Ms Tatyana Galushko (application no.\u00a03961/10), Mr Tavakkul Aliyev (application no.\u00a0 7709/10), Mr Suleyman Suleymanov (application no.\u00a019426/10) and Mr Gahraman Suleymanov (application no.\u00a025986/10).",
