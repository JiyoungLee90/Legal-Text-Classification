The applications’ dates of introduction are also tabulated in the Annex.
In the course of the proceedings applicants Vladimir Nikolayevich Yeremin and Igor Mikhaylovich Semyonov died, and their relatives adopted the applications.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Antonov, Mr I. Fedotov, Mr V. Glukhov, Ms O. Gurova, Mr G. Migay, Mr. Y. Pakin, and Ms L. Yerokhina, consultants from the Moscow Region. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
In July–October 2008 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The Government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits, but the Court rejected this objection.
The applicants are pensioners who live in the Moscow Region. Before retirement they used to work in hazardous industry. They had a dispute with a pension authority about the scope of their privileged pensions and appealed to the Region’s district and town courts.
In March–November 2006 the courts held for the applicants and ordered the pension authority to recalculate the pensions. The courts based their finding on the Law on Labour Pensions. In May 2006–February 2007 these judgments became binding and were executed.
On the pension authority’s request, in October 2007–March 2008 the district and town courts quashed their judgments due to discovery of new circumstances. The courts found, in particular, that the judgments had ignored the interpretation of the Law on Labour Pensions given by the Supreme Court in December 2005 and March 2007.
The applicants’ cases were remitted for a rehearing and eventually dismissed.
