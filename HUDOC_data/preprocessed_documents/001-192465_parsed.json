It takes the view that the Government have not furnished any convincing or credible arguments which would provide a basis to explain or justify how the injury was sustained. The Court is reluctant to attribute any decisive importance to the short delay of about one hour between the applicant\u2019s release from custody and his seeking medical attention (see paragraphs 5-7 above), which, in any event, cannot be considered so significant as to undermine his case under Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 47940/99, \u00a7 49, 20 July 2004). The suggestion that he was hit by an acquaintance shortly after his release (see paragraph 10 above) is not supported by any evidence. The fact that the applicant signed a waiver before his release (see paragraph 5 above) carries little weight, since this happened while the applicant was still at the police station, in all likelihood under the influence of the preceding situation and in the presence of the officers who had allegedly ill-treated him.",
