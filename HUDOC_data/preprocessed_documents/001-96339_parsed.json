Being aware that the men had been helpless and unable to care for themselves, Volkov and Zharov had not fulfilled their legal duty, under the Police Act, the Regulation on Police Patrols and the internal instructions, to protect victims of offences or accidents, intoxicated persons unable to move, and other vulnerable individuals.

The degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the actions resulting in an injury short of death were such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2. In many cases where a person was assaulted or ill-treated, his or her complaints will rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, \u00a7 51, and \u0130lhan, \u00a7 76, both cited above). In this connection, the Court reiterates that, to fall within the scope of Article 3, the alleged ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, its duration, its physical and mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Saadi v.  [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 134, ECHR 2008...).",

What Article 3 does require is that the authorities conduct an effective official investigation into the alleged ill-treatment even if such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals (see Ay v. , no. 30951/96, \u00a7\u00a060, 22\u00a0March 2005, and M.C., cited above, \u00a7 151).",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.\u00a0, no. 77617/01, \u00a7 107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq.). In cases under Articles 2 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v.

As noted above, the assessment of the severity of the treatment depends on many factors, including its nature and context, its duration, its physical and mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to make the victim suffer is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 (see Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands v. Greece (the \u201cGreek case\u201d), applications nos.\u00a03321/67, 3322/67, 3323/67 and 3344/67, Commission\u2019s report of 5\u00a0November 1969, Yearbook XII, and Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 2001-III). Even if there was no evidence of any positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant and no fault on the part of individual officials involved in the alleged ill-treatment, it should be emphasised that the Governments are answerable under the Convention for the acts of any State agency, since what is in issue in all cases before the Court is the international responsibility of the State (see Novoselov v. Russia, no. 66460/01, \u00a7 45, 2 June 2005, and Lukanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 20 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997-II).",

However, given the absolute nature of the protection of Article 3, whose requirements permit of no derogation, this duty to protect cannot be said to be confined to the specific context of the military or penitentiary facilities. It also becomes relevant in other situations in which the physical well-being of individuals is dependent, to a decisive extent, on the actions by the authorities, who are legally required to take measures within the scope of their powers which might have been necessary to avoid the risk of damage to life or limb (see, in the similar context of a positive obligation under Article\u00a02 of the Convention, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a046477/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2002II).",

The Regulation contains a detailed inventory of actions that must be carried out by the police officers arriving at a crime scene. They are mandated to administer first-aid to the victim, identify him or her, call an ambulance, and to secure possible on-site evidence, without, however, altering the victim\u2019s position or that of the objects around him.

The Court reiterates in this connection that, in cases of life-threatening situations, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention, and they cannot leave it to the initiative of the victim\u2019s relatives (see Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 69).

Only after that decision was reviewed and annulled by a supervising prosecutor on 15 March 2002 did the criminal investigation actually begin.",

However, the public prosecutors had not arranged for a confrontation between them and Mr Vancharin, on the one hand, and between Mr Vancharin and the officer-on-duty, on the other, with a view to eliminating discrepancies in their testimonies. The trial court ultimately rejected Mr Vancharin\u2019s testimony as unreliable on the ground that he had acted in breach of the applicable regulations and therefore had a vested interest in concealing the truth. That the prosecution had overestimated the probative weight of Mr Vancharin\u2019s testimony is an obvious consequence of their above-mentioned omission to investigate the conduct of the police officers of the Sokolinaya Gora police station.",

That finding sits ill with the undisputed fact that the applicant had been unconscious and unable to move on his own, which was the reason why the officers had resorted to dragging him away from the road. The fact of his being unconscious, which the officers did not dispute, was obviously incompatible with the conclusion that the gravity of his condition and the risk it posed to his life and limb could have gone unnoticed.

What is important is that those proceedings culminated in the acquittal of the police officers. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has already found on a number of occasions that there is no case-law authority for Russian civil courts to be able, in the absence of a finding of guilt in criminal proceedings, to consider the merits of a civil claim relating to alleged serious criminal actions. The Court has found that while the Russian civil courts in theory have the capacity to make an independent assessment of factual and legal issues, in practice the weight attached to the findings of the preceding criminal proceedings is so important that even the most convincing evidence to the contrary furnished by a plaintiff would be discarded and such a remedy would prove to be only theoretical and illusory rather than practical and effective, as required by the Convention (see Chember, cited above, \u00a7 71; Menesheva v. Russia, no.\u00a059261/00, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2006III; Isayeva v. Russia, no.\u00a057950/00, \u00a7 155, 24\u00a0February 2005; and Isayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 57947/00, 57948/00 and 57949/00, \u00a7\u00a0147, 24 February 2005). In cases where criminal proceedings against public officials were discontinued at the pre-trial stage or ended in an acquittal, any other remedy available to the applicant, including a claim for damages, had limited chances of success and could not be regarded as capable of affording redress to the applicant (see Tarariyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a04353/03, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR 2006...

In the instant case the criminal proceedings did not lead to trial and conviction. Accordingly, the civil claim could not be considered an effective domestic remedy which the applicant was required to have used (see, in particular, Tarariyeva, cited above, \u00a7 101).

Firstly, the initial examination was carried out on the basis of the original medical records, whereas the second panel had at its disposal some extracts from those records which had been reproduced in the first experts\u2019 report. The Court notes the opinion of the director of the Russian federal centre for forensic medicine, who stated that conducting an examination solely by reference to previous findings was incompatible with the professional methods and standards of forensic medicine (see paragraph 74 above). Secondly, the Court observes that the experts on the first panel worked for the Ministry of Defence, a State body unrelated to both the medical institution in question and the investigative authority. By contrast, the second examination was entrusted to the Health Protection Department of the Moscow Government, which was the authority responsible for maintenance and supervision of all  city hospitals, including Hospital no. 33. This situation created an apparent conflict of interests and was incompatible with the requirement that a forensic doctor enjoy formal and de facto independence (see Barabanshchikov v. , no. 36220/02, \u00a7 59, 8\u00a0January 2009). In the light of the above considerations, the Court accepts the findings of the first experts\u2019 report as the basis for its analysis.",

The diagnosis of alcohol intoxication was not based on a blood or urine test or an examination by a toxicologist, but solely on a mention of \u201calcohol breath\u201d. Moreover, despite the alleged high and potentially lethal alcohol concentration in the applicant\u2019s blood, no disintoxication treatment was prescribed or administered.

The experts emphasised that owing to the lack of supervision of the applicant\u2019s worsening condition, the intervention was belated.

Multiplied by the life expectancy of thirty years, the total claim for pecuniary damage amounted to EUR\u00a01,292,750. The applicant also claimed EUR 200,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

In the Government\u2019s view, the claim in respect of the loss of earnings was groundless because it concerned \u201cfuture probabilities\u201d.

An award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved the more uncertain the link between the breach and the damage becomes (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a7 426 et seq., 18 June 2002). The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of either past or future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award to an applicant, and is to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (former Article 50), 6 November 1989, Series A no.\u00a038, \u00a7\u00a015, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom (Article 41), nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, ECHR 2000).",

Turkey, \nno. 24351/94, \u00a7\u00a0350, ECHR 2003V, and Orhan, cited above, \n\u00a7 433). The same approach may be applied to the calculation of future expenses.\u00a0In the present case, however, the overall amount claimed by the applicant was calculated simply by multiplying his annual medical expenses by average life expectancy in .

Nor did the authorities discharge their duty to investigate, in an efficient manner, the assault on the applicant or the above-mentioned failings of the police and medical personnel. These events must have caused the applicant not just physical pain and suffering but also emotional feelings of distress, frustration, injustice, and prolonged uncertainty which call for an award in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see, as a recent authority, Varnava and Others v.  [GC], nos.\u00a016064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 224, 18\u00a0September 2009, with further references).
