However, since that case the focus of examination has shifted from the type of proceedings chosen to protect one\u2019s rights to the substance of what is sought to be protected in any particular proceedings. Indeed, the Court has considered it conceivable that Article 6 may be applicable even in the absence of a claim for financial reparation: it suffices if the outcome of the proceedings is decisive for the \u201ccivil right\u201d in question (see Perez v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a047287/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2004I). Accordingly, this provision has been held by the Court to apply both to those situations in which an applicant has joined criminal proceedings as a civil party to protect his or her civil interests (see Perez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-75), and to those in which the applicant pursued a private criminal prosecution to the same end (see Helmers v. Sweden, 29 October 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 27-30, Series A no. 212A). In Helmers, the Court found Article 6 \u00a7 1 applicable to the case because the outcome of the applicant\u2019s private prosecution and his claim for compensation depended on the decision regarding whether or not his good reputation had been unjustly harmed.",
