Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005-II). As to the requirement of an oral hearing, this is not a mandatory form of the adjudicative process, especially in higher instances where written procedures may be more appropriate. A hearing may not be necessary in the particular circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties' written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), 23 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021-22, Series A no. 283-A, and Fischer v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 44, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0312). Legal assistance in civil cases is not mandatory either, although, in certain circumstances, Article 6 \u00a7 1 may sometimes compel the State to provide for the assistance of a lawyer when such assistance proves indispensable for an effective access to court (see Airey v. , 9 October 1979, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 32, p. 14-16,).",

Furthermore, he appealed against the decision not to reopen the case and in his appeal he was again able to state his position on the case.

In contrast, the opposite party attended both hearings before the  and was free to attend the hearing before the court of appeal. In such circumstances the Court finds that the applicant was placed at a significant disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the opposing party (see Groshev\u00a0v. , no.\u00a069889/01, \u00a7\u00a029, 20 October 2005).",

However, the Court observes that under section 11 of the USSR Advocates Act (see paragraph 26 above) it was in the courts' power to appoint a legal-aid lawyer to any litigant and for any type of case if that litigant had no sufficient means to pay for the lawyer himself.",

However, this is not a convincing argument either. Indeed, as a general rule there is no right to free legal assistance in civil cases, but there are exceptions to this rule (see, for example, the case of Airey, cited above). In the Court's opinion, where the effective participation of a detainee in civil proceedings cannot be secured by other means, the law must provide for some form of legal aid. It is a\u00a0fortiori true in the present case where the applicant did not appear to be a vexatious litigant. The authorities had refused to bring him to the court or to hold a court session in the correctional colony, whereas the other party had been present at the two hearings and had been free to attend the hearing before the court of appeal as well.",

However, the availability of that option depended on too many factors out of the applicant's control. First of all, the applicant would have needed to have a relative or a friend willing to represent him. Furthermore, the Court emphasises that the authorities gave the applicant virtually no time to make necessary arrangements for the representation. The applicant did not receive any reply from the court to his original application for legal aid. He learned of the date of the second hearing (that of 6\u00a0September) only on 28\u00a0August 2001. The time left to the applicant, who was being detained, was barely enough to find a representative of his own. In addition, it took the colony administration seven days to post the applicant's letter in which he repeated his request for legal aid. As a result, the letter was received by the court when the hearing had already been held. There was a repeat of the same situation before the court of appeal: the judge notified the applicant of the date of the appeal hearing only one day in advance (on 9\u00a0October 2001). Even in the unlikely event that the notification reached the applicant on the same day, the applicant would have had no time to find any representative.",

Furthermore, they refused him the right to participate in the subsequent proceedings in person, ignored his numerous applications for legal aid, and did not give him any time to find his own representative. The plaintiff, on the contrary, fully enjoyed his procedural rights.
