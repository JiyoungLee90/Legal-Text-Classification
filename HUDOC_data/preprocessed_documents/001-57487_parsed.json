Sexual activity is the main, not to say sole, ingredient of all three paintings, and neither the appellants\u2019 explanations nor the witness Mr. Ammann\u2019s learned-seeming but wholly unpersuasive remarks can alter that fact. To go into detail, however distasteful it may be, one of the paintings contains no fewer than eight erect members. All the persons depicted are entirely naked and one of them is engaging simultaneously in various sexual practices with two other males and an animal. He is kneeling down and not only sodomising the animal but holding its erect penis in another animal\u2019s mouth. At the same time he is having the lower part of his back - his buttocks, even - fondled by another male, whose erect penis a third male is holding towards the first male\u2019s mouth. The animal being sodomised has its tongue extended towards the buttocks of a fourth male, whose penis is likewise erect. Even the animals\u2019 tongues (especially in the smallest painting) are more suggestive, in shape and aspect, of erect male organs than of tongues. Sexual activity is crudely and vulgarly portrayed for its own sake and not as a consequence of any idea informing the work.

Subject to paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to \"information\" or \"ideas\" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any section of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \"democratic society\" (see the Handyside judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, \u00a7 49).

The view taken of the requirements of morals varies from time to time and from place to place, especially in our era, characterised as it is by a far-reaching evolution of opinions on the subject.

In 1982, confiscation was the measure envisaged under the relevant case-law and was as a rule employed for this purpose. Accessible to the public and followed by the lower courts, this case-law has alleviated the harshness of Article 204 \u00a7 3. The impugned measure was consequently \"prescribed by law\" within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention.",
