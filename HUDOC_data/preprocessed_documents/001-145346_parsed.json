The respondent State enforced the judgments under consideration in that case in cash and undertook to so enforce a number of other similar judgments (see Momi\u0107 and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 28730/06, 17 May 2011). However, it should be emphasised that none of the applicants in those cases, unlike the present applicant, had accepted government bonds. The present case must therefore be distinguished from \u010coli\u0107 and Others jurisprudence.

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 180 and 193, ECHR 2006-V). One of the features of such redress is the amount awarded by the national authorities (see Kudi\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 28971/05, \u00a7 17, 9\u00a0December\u00a02008). While it is true that the national authorities expressly acknowledged the breach alleged in the present case, the applicant was not able to obtain any compensation in respect of the delayed enforcement of the judgment (see paragraph 9 above). Therefore, she may still claim to be victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in relation to the period during which the judgment remained unenforced (see Dubenko\u00a0 v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a074221/01, \u00a7 36, 11 January 2005).
