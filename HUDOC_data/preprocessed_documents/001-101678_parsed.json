In certain well-defined circumstances it may extend to requiring the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual. Subject to considerations as to the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities and which also conforms with the other rights guaranteed under the Convention. The test imposed in the context of the duty to prevent and suppress offences against the person is that it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). This approach has been applied also to areas where risks to life have arisen due to dangerous situations, such as the settlement of people in slum dwellings next to a massive rubbish dump and naturally-occurring hazards such as mudslides, where the authorities, knowing about the potential danger, are under obligations to respond with due regard to protection of the right to life. In this context, the Court has found failures on a substantive level, in the failures to take the necessary measures to inform and safeguard the population, and also on procedural level, due to inadequate investigatory and judicial response permitting the cause of the disaster to be established, for the persons responsible to be held accountable and for compensatory relief to be available to the victims (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, ECHR 2004XII, and Budayeva and Others v. , nos. 15339/02, 21166/02, 20058/02, 11673/02 and 15343/02, ECHR 2008... (extracts)).",

They require States to make regulations compelling hospitals, whether private or public, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients' lives. They also require an effective independent judicial system to be set up so that the cause of death of patients in the care of the medical profession, whether in the public or the private sector, can be determined and those responsible made accountable (see Powell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a045305/99, ECHR 2000-V; Calvelli and Ciglio v.

Where the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, \u201cthe obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged\u201d (see Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 51; Lazzarini and Ghiacci v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a053749/00, 7 November 2002; and Mastromatteo v.

It is primarily the task of the domestic systems to investigate the cause of fatal accidents and to establish facts and responsibility. In the present case, which concerns an accident during a military training exercise, the Court notes that while it may indeed be considered that the armed forces' activities pose a risk to life, this is a situation which differs from those \u201cdangerous\u201d situations of specific threat to life which arise exceptionally from risks posed by violent, unlawful acts of others or man-made or natural hazards. The armed forces, just as doctors in the medical world, routinely engage in activities that potentially could cause harm; it is, in a manner of speaking, part of their essential functioning. Thus, in the present case, parachute training was inherently dangerous but an ordinary part of military duties. Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and through sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum. If nevertheless damage arises, it will only amount to a breach of the State's positive obligations if it was due to insufficient regulations or insufficient control, but not if the damage was caused through the negligent conduct of an individual or the concatenation of unfortunate events (see, for comparison, Kalender v. , no. 4314/02, \u00a7\u00a7 43-47, 15\u00a0December 2009).",

In the case at hand, the relevant events which led to loss of life occurred under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which organised and carried out the parachuting training of 27\u00a0May 1998 (see paragraph 6 above). Having regard to the context, the circumstances surrounding the accident which led to the death of the applicants' son were largely confined within the knowledge of the public authorities, which were also the only entities possessing sufficient expertise and resources to identify and establish the reasons behind it. Thus it was for these authorities to ensure that there was an effective investigation.

On the first place, an internal inquiry was carried out by a joint commission of the Ministries of the Interior and Defence, which gathered numerous pieces of evidence and submitted a report, concluding that the accident had been caused by the helicopter's \u201cinappropriate\u201d speed and by deficiencies in the preparation of the parachute training and in the coordination between the helicopter's crew and the paratroopers (see paragraphs 12-17 above). The Court is satisfied that the commission possessed the necessary expertise and impartiality, that its investigation was comprehensive and that its conclusions were adequate, tenable and convincing. Indeed, the Court notes, as the commission did, that the communication between the helicopter's crew and the paratroopers appears to have been deficient as, firstly, Chief Sergeant T., who was in charge of the parachute jumps, failed to indicate to the crew the exact speed needed (see paragraphs 7 and 40 above) and, secondly, the crew failed to communicate to the paratroopers the exact speed attained after his instructions to \u201cspeed up\u201d (see paragraph 7 above). Furthermore, the helicopter's device recording the parameters of the flight had not been loaded with a tape (see paragraphs 7 and 16 above). The Court notes also that the internal inquiry's conclusions provide a plausible and convincing explanation of the events of 27 May 1998, and in particular of the fact that two very experienced paratroopers died in the same way, within seconds of each other, after their heads hit the left rear tyre of the helicopter, and that Mr G., the paratrooper who had jumped first, did not jump normally either, his head barely missing the same tyre. The Court sees no reason to doubt the thoroughness and the correctness of the internal inquiry's conclusions. It notes that even if the measures recommended in the commission's interim report of 6 June 1998, namely an experiment with a dummy and requesting additional information from the helicopter's manufacturer, were apparently never carried out (see paragraph 12 above), the final report of 24 June 1998 still appears to have been based on ample and diverse evidence, namely site inspections, witness testimony and documents (ibid.). Furthermore, even if the commission's members were officials of the Ministries of the Interior and Defence, the Court sees no reason to question their impartiality in this exercise. These officials included paratroopers, doctors and other experts (see paragraph 12 above). Their expertise has not been challenged and was apparently also recognised by the prosecuting authorities who initially appointed the commission's members as experts in the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 30 above). The internal inquiry's conclusion that the paratroopers bore no fault for the fatal accident was also reiterated in the expert report submitted for the purposes of the criminal proceedings on 17 November 2000 (see paragraphs 36-37 above).",

The Court does not find problematic in itself the fact that these inquiries carried out by the authorities did not lead to establishing any degree of criminal responsibility of the persons responsible for the parachute training of 27 May 1998. It notes that Article 2 of the Convention obliges the authorities to carry out a meaningful investigation; it is not required that there is an ensuing criminal conviction (see paragraph 60 above). Although the conclusions of the prosecuting authorities as to the causes of the fatal accident of 27 May 1998 did not provide convincing explanation for the way in which two experienced paratroopers died one after the other and one other paratrooper almost hit the wheel of the helicopter, it does not necessarily follow that they erred in not applying criminal sanctions. It is not apparent that the evidence concerning Mr\u00a0Stoyanov's death, gathered by the authorities, suggested that a particular individual or individuals committed such grave errors as to be justifiably held criminally responsible.

Had the applicants sought to pursue the matter further and have a court finding to that effect, it was open for them, on the basis of the factual findings of the two inquiries, to bring civil proceedings. Domestic law at the time, namely section 249(6) of the Armed Forces Act, expressly authorised them to bring an action for damages against the Ministry of Defence, irrespective of whether or not they had already received compensation (see paragraphs 47 and 50 above). Furthermore, as regards the alleged responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, they could bring an action for damages under the general legislation providing for tort liability of the State (see paragraphs 51-52 above). The Court sees no reason to find that such actions would not have been capable of establishing the fault of the authorities, which would have been a prerequisite for their liability for damages.",

In such circumstances the obligation of the State is to provide a regulatory and judicial framework, in which the availability of civil proceedings will very often be sufficient.",

They also do not contest the fact that by the time they were informed on this report, they could file a claim against the Ministry of the Interior for compensation of their loss and sufferings. In my view by this time the authorities had met their positive obligations in similar circumstances.",

I fully agree with the majority that the purpose of the criminal investigation was to inquire into possible criminal acts, which \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 could result in the indictment of those responsible. In the present case the applicants do not maintain that the established negligent omissions leading to their son's death constituted any criminal acts, or that the authorities failed to meet any obligations by not prosecuting the officers responsible for negligent acts. In the face of the proper conclusions of the internal inquiry, with which the applicants agreed, it remains unclear why they expected the outcome of the criminal proceedings as a panacea for their grieving, or as an obstacle to their opportunity to file a compensation claim before the prescription time-limit expired.",
