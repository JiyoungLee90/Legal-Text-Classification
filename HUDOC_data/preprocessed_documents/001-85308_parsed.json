In his view, the decision to set aside the eyewitnesses\u2019 statements was unfounded. In any case, the authorities had failed to provide a credible alternative explanation as to the origin of his injuries. In his opinion the following elements should be taken into account as aggravating factors in the assessment of the seriousness of the ill-treatment he had been subjected to: he was 14 years old at the time; he was severely ill; in his particular condition the attack had made him seriously fear for his life; and he was of Roma origin (in the context of the organised harassment of Roma by the Romanian authorities). He also pointed out that the authorities had acted late at night and that the use of force had been neither necessary nor proportionate in the circumstances.",

The effect of Article 13 of the Convention is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable claim\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 of the Convention varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Aksoy v.
