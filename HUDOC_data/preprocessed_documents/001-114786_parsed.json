The Court has consistently stressed that, in the context of deprivation of liberty, the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.  [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a092-94, ECHR 2000XI).",

In particular, the applicant was afforded no more than 1.3 square metres of personal space while detained in the remand prison where he was confined to his cell for most of the day and 1.41 square metres of personal space during his detention in the correctional facility. Admittedly, as regards the applicant\u2019s detention in the correctional facility, the Court has previously held that the personal space afforded to the detainees in the dormitory of a correctional facility must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees during the daytime, which ensures that they have unobstructed access to natural light and air (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16\u00a0September 2004). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the level of privacy available to the applicant was insufficient to comply with the standards set forth in Article\u00a03 of the Convention. For over three years, during the night, the applicant was housed in a dormitory with at least 135 other persons where he was afforded only 1.3\u00a0square\u00a0metres of personal space. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, the sanitary facilities available were not sufficient to accommodate the needs of the detainees. There were only eight to nine wash basins and two to three toilets available for at least 135 detainees. Lastly, the Court observes that on seven occasions the applicant was transferred to a disciplinary cell where he at times enjoyed more than 6 square metres of personal space. However, given the infrequency and the brevity of such periods of detention, the Court does not consider them to have alleviated the applicant\u2019s situation.",
