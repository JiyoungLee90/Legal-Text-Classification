Moreover, the facts suggest that throughout this considerable period of time there has been no genuine attempt on the part of the investigative authorities to investigate thoroughly the circumstances of the death. Thus, between November 2006 and August 2014 the investigative authorities took thirteen decisions whereby they either refused to open a criminal investigation or discontinued one. All those decisions were, however, overruled by the supervising authorities, who considered that the investigation had not been thorough and that further procedural measures were required (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above).",
