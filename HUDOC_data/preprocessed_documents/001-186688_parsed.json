Referring to the resolutions of 10 April 1992 and 4 February 1994, it stated that the SPFU had not established what had constituted assets under those legal acts. The assets on the basis of which UPO had been created had been transferred to the Republican Council, succeeded by the Federation, as was evident from the latter\u2019s founding documents. Since the assets had not been transferred to the Union-wide Council, they were not covered by those resolutions.

The trade unions\u2019 title to those assets had not been challenged and had therefore been lawful. Under Article 92 \u00a7 7 of the 1994 Constitution of Ukraine, the legal regime applicable to property was to be determined by the laws of Ukraine only. Since a special law governing the legal regime of assets belonging to Union-wide civic organisations of the former Soviet Union had not been adopted when the case was examined, there had been no legal restrictions on the creation of UPO on the basis of sanatoria\u2019s assets. Accordingly, UPO had been founded lawfully, there was no basis for annulling its founding documents and the SPFU\u2019s allegation that it was the managing authority of UPO\u2019s assets was at odds with the law and the circumstances of the case.",

The court dismissed UPO\u2019s reference to the judgment of 20\u00a0January 1997, stating that the parties in that case and in the present one were not the same, and that judgment contained value judgments rather than facts as regards the owner of the disputed property.

The resolution of 29\u00a0November 1990 had set a moratorium on any change of title to, and owners of, State property until the enactment of a law on privatisation of property. Accordingly, the disputed property which had been transferred to the Republican Council and used by it had been State property.

Trade unions had been operating under the charter of trade unions of the Soviet Union and had been Union-wide civic organisations. Therefore, the Sanatorium had been the property of a civic organisation of the former Soviet Union located on the territory of Ukraine and, when UPO had been created, the Sanatorium had belonged to the State and could be alienated only with the State\u2019s consent. The Supreme Court also referred to the resolutions of 10 April 1992 and 4 February 1994 in support of its findings. In particular, it held that the question of holders of title to property of Union-wide civic organisations had not yet been regulated by domestic law and the property of such organisations was at present regarded as State property.

It also stated that in the Supreme Court decision of 4\u00a0February 2015 it had been established that the issue regarding holders of title to property of Union-wide civic organisations of the former Soviet Union had not been regulated by domestic law. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, the Supreme Court had thereby recognised the absence of legitimate grounds for depriving it of its property. The applicant also stated that the fact that it had been deprived of its property more than twenty years after the adoption of the above-mentioned legal acts constituted a breach of the principle of legal certainty. In any event, those acts concerned property of Union-wide civic organisations of the former Soviet Union before their successors had been determined, and not that of the Federation, which in October 1990 had stopped functioning under the charter of trade unions of the Soviet Union and had declared itself the successor of trade unions of the Ukrainian SSR. Moreover, the above-mentioned legal acts gave the State temporary rights regarding the property of Union-wide civic organisations of the former Soviet Union until their successors had been determined, and did not provide for transferring title to relevant property to the State. Even assuming that the interference with its rights was based on formal grounds in the domestic law, that law did not correspond to the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirements, as in cases nos. 137/7, 48/202-20/191 and 51/227 the domestic courts had concluded that the transfer of property from the Federation to UPO had been lawful. However, that had not precluded the HCCU from reaching the opposite conclusion in the applicant\u2019s case. Furthermore, the applicant considered that there had been no public interest in depriving it of its property: since the Federation was a legal successor of the trade unions of the Ukrainian SSR, the transfer of management of the disputed property to the State, let alone its ownership, under the resolutions of 10 April 1992 and 4 February 1994, had not pursued any legitimate aim. The applicant stated that even assuming that the above-mentioned legal acts had been applicable, their application twenty years later had constituted a disproportionate burden on it.

It had been treated as their owner by the State authorities, which had registered its title to those premises, for a number of years. Furthermore, it was not disputed by the parties, and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise, that the retrospective annulment of the applicant\u2019s title to the premises constituted a \u201cdeprivation of property\u201d within the meaning of that provision (see, for instance, Kryvenkyy v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 43768/07, \u00a7 41, 16 February 2017).

It is not the Court\u2019s role to decide which of the conflicting decisions were correct or the exact status of the property transferred to UPO. However, it observes that it does not follow from those decisions that there existed one unique approach at the domestic level as regards the status of property belonging to the former State-controlled trade unions located on the territory of the Ukrainian SSR. Furthermore, the Government did not show that, despite the inconsistencies in the case-law observed in the present case, such case-law has subsequently become uniform. It appears that such a situation has been caused by the absence in Ukraine of a law dealing with the legal status of property of Union-wide civic organisations of the former Soviet Union located on the territory of Ukraine and providing for an inventory of the property of such organisations. The absence of such legislation has in turn caused the difference in the domestic courts\u2019 understanding of what property belonged to such organisations and whether such property also included the property of the trade-union organisations. Overall, given the lack of requisite clarity in the domestic law on this issue, producing opposing judicial interpretations, the Court has serious doubts as to whether the interference complained of met the lawfulness requirement under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Shchokin, cited above, \u00a7 56; Serkov, cited above, \u00a7 42; and Chumak v.

As to the issue of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the interference, the Court considers that it is closely linked to the proportionality of the interference; it will therefore examine it in the context of the proportionality (see, similarly, Volchkova and Mironov v.

In other words, and as already indicated (see paragraph 55 above), there appeared to be no objective reasons to believe that the applicant had bought the property in bad faith. Indeed, the attempt to return UPO\u2019s property to the State in 1997, including the disputed property, turned out to be unsuccessful. No court decisions against UPO and its property seem to have been given in the following ten years, that is until 2007 (see paragraph 28 above), when the State decided to make other attempts to claim that property. Even assuming that the property transferred to UPO was indeed State property and that the State attempted again to restore its title to it after the applicant had bought part of it, the Court fails to understand why it had to wait for so long before doing so, that is, from the time the applicant bought the property in 2002 until the prosecutor lodged a claim in 2011. In this connection, the Court finds it immaterial that the prosecutor allegedly did not learn about the 2002 contract until 2011 (see paragraph 27 above). Indeed, after the applicant had concluded the contract in 2002, the State authorities registered its title to the purchased property and that information was available in the relevant register. In other words, the State knew or ought to have known about the 2002 contract and the registration of the applicant\u2019s title to the disputed property long before 2011. However, it did not react for the following nine years.",

In this connection, it reiterates that mistakes or errors committed by State authorities should serve to the benefit of the persons affected, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Tomina and Others v. Russia, nos. 20578/08 and 19 others, \u00a7 39, 1\u00a0December 2016).",

They did not explain how the State interests in the property served the \u201cpublic interest\u201d (see similarly, in the latter respect, Maksymenko and Gerasymenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057). Nor did the prosecutor advance any specific argument in that respect in his claim for the annulment of the 2002 contract (see paragraph 27 above). Indeed, after the State had received in 2011 a favourable judgment, which was upheld in 2014, it did not immediately proceed with registration of its title to the disputed premises, but did so only in April 2018 (see paragraph 33 above). In view of the above factors, the Court is not convinced that the annulment of the applicant\u2019s title to the disputed property was the only possible option for the State to restore its rights in respect of that property.",

The latter concluded that the report was of poor quality and unprofessional, had not complied with the relevant regulations and could not be used. Without providing any alternative assessment, the Government thus considered that the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage was unsubstantiated and invited the Court to reject it. As to the non-pecuniary damage claimed, they stated that the applicant had linked it to damage caused to children living in the disputed premises, who were not parties to the present case. Moreover, the applicant had not said that the claimed amount, if awarded, would be transferred to those children. The Government thus asked the Court to reject that claim as well. In respect of the court fees incurred by the applicant in the domestic proceedings, the Government submitted that the applicant had not provided any information about the amount of time spent by its lawyer during the proceedings and his or her hourly rate. As regards the claimed cost of I.\u2019s report, the Government considered that that report did not constitute appropriate confirmation of the pecuniary damage incurred and asked the Court to reject that claim. As regards the claims for UAH\u00a022,640.64 and EUR 7,850, the Government left them for the Court\u2019s discretion. Lastly, the Government did not agree that the issue raised in the present case represented a systemic problem. The figures referred to by the third parties (see paragraph 53 above) concerned all types of cases in which prosecutors had participated and did not indicate the existence of a systemic problem. They stated that for a declaration by the Court of a systemic problem there should be a lack of domestic remedies, whereas in circumstances similar to those in the present case, the relevant party could lodge a separate claim for damages.",
