The Court notes that in the present case the Government had acknowledged the breach of the Convention and paid the judgment debt. Nevertheless, the payment, which intervened only after a substantial delay and after the present application had been communicated to the Government, did not afford the applicant adequate redress (see Burdov v. , no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2002III; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27 May 2004).
