However, given the brevity of the report of 10 July 2002, which resulted from a superficial visual assessment of the applicant's medical condition upon his admission to the remand centre, and bearing in mind the lapse of time between July 2002 and September 2003, the Court has serious doubts that any expert forensic assessment would shed light on the circumstances in which the applicant had sustained the injuries. In any event, such an attempt at assessment was first made in June 2004, when a medical expert confirmed that in the absence of any morphological description of the injuries in the initial report it was impossible to make any further assessment. In this context, the Court cannot afford any weight to the Government's argument based on the fact that the injuries were located in an area of the applicant's body which was easily accessible to his own hands. Nor does the Government's suggestion that the use of self-harm was a defence tactic stand up to any scrutiny.",

Importantly, the national authorities did not interview any of the convoy officers or detainees, if any, who had been present in the prison van during the transfer from the temporary detention centre to the remand centre on 10\u00a0July 2002. In addition, it appears that the applicant was first questioned and his statement taken only in September 2003 at the closure of the initial inquiry.",
