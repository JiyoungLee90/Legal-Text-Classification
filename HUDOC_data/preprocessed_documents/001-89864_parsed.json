On 11 December 2003 he was questioned by an official from that Department. He claimed that he could not return to  for fear of persecution as he had been an active member of the Falun Gong movement since 1992 or 1994. He explained that although the Falun Gong movement did not have a clear structure, he followed the directions for practice of the technique and explained them to others. Practitioners performed exercises in groups with a view to physical and mental well-being. There were no lists of members and nobody checked who was present; sessions took place in public parks, or in members\u2019 apartments. The applicant stated that although he had not personally faced any problems in  and that the situation was tolerable when he left in 2001, the authorities had cracked down on the movement in the ensuing two years and his name had been included on \u201cblack lists\u201d. He also explained that before 2003 he had had other grounds entitling him to remain in Russia, but that when his work permit was coming to an end he realised that he could not return to  as he risked persecution. The Chinese trading company which had invited him to work in Russia as their representative had ceased their activities and he had had no contact with the director in  for a considerable time. The first applicant also alleged that the Chinese Consulate in  was looking for him and that he was obliged to constantly change his place of residence. He had published articles and attended international meetings of Falun Gong adherents. He referred to his UNHCR mandate refugee card and a series of documents that attested to the Chinese Government\u2019s policy of persecution of Falun Gong members which had started in 1999 (see paragraph 49 below).",

His description of his own activities was limited to \u201cdoing gymnastics\u201d in parks and private flats. It was also noted that the applicant had applied for asylum more than two years after his arrival and one month before the expiry of his temporary residence permit, which in the light of his circumstances could not be extended, and that he was probably trying to obtain a right to remain. Finally, the Department referred to information from Russian Government sources such as the Federal Migration Service (the FMS), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ITAR-TASS news agency which described the Falun Gong movement as a \u201cpseudo-Buddhist sect of a totalitarian nature\u201d and cited Chinese news reports about criminal acts committed by its followers and the damage caused to its members, for example by inciting followers to commit suicide or to refuse to accept medical aid. Several publications by Russian history and Eastern studies scholars likewise classified Falun Gong as a sect, referring to such traits of the teaching as the ideas of \u201cexclusiveness\u201d of the truth, the presence of a \u201cdeified leader\u201d who was regarded as the only source of wisdom, the expectation that the end of the world was imminent, the need for its members to adhere to a strict code of behaviour and the use of specific symbols. These sources found that the information about ill-treatment of Falun Gong members in  mostly originated from the movement itself and that the Chinese authorities were right to take measures to curb its activities.",

The Court reiterates that in the context of both positive and negative obligations the State must strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. However, in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation. Where immigration is concerned, Article 8 cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect a married couple\u2019s choice of country for their matrimonial residence or to authorise family reunion on its territory (see G\u00fcl\u00a0v. Switzerland, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7\u00a038 Reports 1996-I). However, the removal of a person from a country where close members of his family are living may amount to an infringement of the right to respect for family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Boultif v. Switzerland, no.\u00a054273/00, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 2001IX).",

Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious (see Jerry Olajide Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43279/98, 26\u00a0January 1999; and Andrey Sheabashov v. Latvia (dec.), no. 50065/99, 22\u00a0May 1999). Where this is the case the removal of the non-national family member would be incompatible with Article 8 only in exceptional circumstances (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, \u00a7\u00a068; Mitchell v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a040447/98, 24 November 1998; and Ajayi and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a027663/95, 22 June 1999; Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.).",

The Court can assume that the applicants were engaged in a genuine family relationship. However, while under the provisions of Russian law the first applicant could not be deported while the appeal proceedings were pending, it is clear that his immigration status prior to 5 April 2005 gave him no expectation that he would obtain a right to residence permit.",

The first applicant had spent most of his life and academic career in  and had family members there.
