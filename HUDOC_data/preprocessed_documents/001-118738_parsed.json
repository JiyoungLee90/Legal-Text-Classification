The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them (see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67, Series A no. 211; Milatov\u00e1 and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2005V; and, a fortiori, Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the , no. 35376/97, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, 3 March 2000; and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. , no. 14902/04, \u00a7\u00a0538, 20 September 2011). Therefore, it is even possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-46; and Grega\u010devi\u0107 v. , no. 58331/09, \u00a7 50, 10\u00a0July 2012).",

Austria, 26 March 1982, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 49, and Milatov\u00e1 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65). That being so, it is equally irrelevant whether or not the applicant replied to an earlier submission, namely the appeal of the Zagreb County State Attorney\u2019s Office.

As to the proceedings instituted by the applicant before the national authorities, the Court agrees that, as they were in part aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, the domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 284, ECHR 2006V). However, the Court notes that part of the applicant\u2019s complaints, concerning the alleged lack of impartiality of the trial court, was declared inadmissible (see paragraph 37). Therefore, no award can be made in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with that complaint. Accordingly, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR\u00a01,200 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the national authorities, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount. As to the Convention proceedings, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was represented by counsel, the sum of EUR 1,873, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount.",
