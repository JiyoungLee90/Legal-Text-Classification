In respect of K.S., it noted that at the identification procedure she had recognised the applicant by his eyes and eyebrows. The fact that she could not describe his clothing did not discredit her evidence. The court found that it could not be required of a witness to note everything necessary for criminal proceedings. A person could only focus on a single detail rather than on the full picture. Nor was her evidence discredited by her failure to recognise the applicant at the court hearing, as at court hearings witnesses were in a particularly stressful situation. Similar considerations were applied to K.M., who, moreover, had recognised the applicant at the County Court hearing. The fact that K.M. and T.S. (another witness) \u2013 who had been together at the time of the events \u2013 had taken note of different aspects of the events did not render those statements unreliable; rather, it reflected the fact that the perception and memory of different people differed. Nor did the different expressions used by K.M. at the identification procedure and in court render her statements unreliable. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal found no radical differences between K.A.\u2019s statements in the identification report and in court, and therefore considered that the rejection of his statements as evidence had been not justified either. In conclusion, the Court of Appeal considered that K.A.\u2019s, K.S.\u2019s and K.M.\u2019s statements, as well as their identification reports, had to be taken into account and assessed together with the other evidence.",

It also noted that the applicant, S.G. and I.J. had been friends, whereas the other witnesses had had no connection with them. Considering a number of statements by independent witnesses, the court found that I.J. had not been credible in assuming full responsibility and noted that there was no way of finding out why he had done so. It also noted that the applicant\u2019s statements had been inconsistent. He had said during the preliminary investigation that he had seen I.J. hitting L., whereas in court he had said that he had been further away from the scene and denied having seen anything. The court also referred in that connection to the words heard by witnesses from a person whose appearance corresponded to that of the applicant: \u201cWhy then did he come to start a quarrel?\u201d If the applicant had arrived at the scene after L. had been knocked down, he would have known nothing about the reasons and initial stages of the conflict and would have had no reason to express himself in such a way.",

The principles of direct examination and oral presentation of evidence under Article 15 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were therefore fully implemented in the proceedings in the court of first instance. That meant, inter alia, direct examination of witnesses and victims at a court hearing as the rule, and disclosure of testimony given during the pre-trial investigation as the exception. Although under the Code of Criminal Procedure an appellate court was in principle entitled to examine and assess evidence to the same extent as a county court, and it could not be ruled out that witnesses would be directly examined during the appeal proceedings, Article 15 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that an appellate court, unlike a county court, could also base its judgment only on evidence examined by the county court and disclosed in the appeal proceedings. The principle of direct judicial examination and oral presentation of the evidence was thus not necessarily implemented in full in the appeal proceedings.",

In addition to its own analysis of the evidence, an appellate court should also indicate the mistakes made by the first-instance court which had caused its conclusions to conflict with the facts.

The manner of application of Article 6 to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7\u00a056, Series A no. 115; Ekbatani v.

A copy of the appeal was served on the applicant and his lawyer and both of them were summoned to the Court of Appeal hearing. However, the applicant informed the court in writing of his wish not to take part and asked for the case to be examined in his absence. The Court notes that it has not been argued that the applicant \u2013 who was not in detention \u2013 was hindered from seeking legal advice concerning the nature of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal or their possible outcome, including the possibility that the first-instance acquittal judgment would be overturned and the applicant convicted by the Court of Appeal as requested by the prosecutor. The Court further notes that, according to the record of the Court of Appeal hearing, the applicant\u2019s lawyer \u2013 who was present \u2013 submitted that he was aware of the applicant\u2019s wish not to take part. The Court thus considers that the applicant unequivocally waived his right to take part in the hearing before the Court of Appeal (see, generally, Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 73, with further references; compare and contrast Popovici, cited above, \u00a7 73, where the Government failed to adduce any evidence in support of their submission that the applicant had refused to attend the hearing in question). The Court does not therefore need to further examine the question of whether the special features of the proceedings concerned would have allowed an appellate court to decide the case without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the applicant in person. In that respect the present case differs from a number of cases the Court has dealt with where the defendant in criminal proceedings had not been heard by an appellate jurisdiction since no oral hearing had been held at all (see Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, \u00a7 7, 10\u00a0March 2009; Marcos Barrios v. Spain, no. 17122/07, \u00a7 10, 21 September 2010; and Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez v. Spain, no. 15256/07, \u00a7 8, 16 November 2010), had not been heard in person regardless of the hearing having taken place (see Lacadena Calero v. Spain, no. 23002/07, \u00a7 10, 22\u00a0November 2011) or had been able to address the court but had not been heard during the trial (see Constantinescu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 28871/95, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2000-VIII, and Popa and T\u0103n\u0103sescu v.

The applicant was equally aware of the Court of Appeal\u2019s powers to convict him. In this context, the Court considers it significant that the applicant did not request in any manner the examination of witnesses at the appellate court\u2019s hearing (compare Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 18 May 2004, where the Court, in finding a violation, relied on the fact that the applicant had requested summoning the witnesses but in spite of that request the court of appeal nevertheless had overturned the first-instance judgment without summoning the witnesses; contrast with Fluera\u015f v.

At the same time, according to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed are primarily matters for regulation by national legislation and the domestic courts (see among many other authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, \u00a7 118; Garc\u00eda Ruiz, \u00a7 28; and Schenk, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, all cited above). Exceptions to the principle that all evidence against the accused must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Solakov v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no. 47023/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2001-X, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 118, with further references to Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7 39, ECHR\u00a02001-II). The Court considers that if it has been accepted that the defendant\u2019s ability to put questions to witnesses against him during the pre-trial proceedings can meet the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) and that the testimony of such witnesses can be admissible as evidence, those requirements are, a fortiori, met when the witnesses in question have been examined before the first-instance court in the presence of the defendant who could put questions to them and the appellate court admits those statements as evidence. The Court notes that it has not been argued that the proceedings before the first-instance court in the present case did not meet the fair trial requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d).",

It reiterates in this connection that it is not its task to act as an appellate court or, as is sometimes said, as a court of fourth instance, for the decisions of domestic courts. It is the role of the domestic courts to interpret and apply the relevant rules of procedural or substantive law. The domestic courts are best placed to assess the credibility of witnesses and the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case (see, among many other authorities, Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, \u00a7 32, Series\u00a0A no. 235-B; Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16 December 1992, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no. 247-B; Melnychuk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 28743/03, ECHR 2005-IX; and Karpenko v. Russia, no. 5605/04, \u00a7 80, 13 March 2012). In the instant case, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which might lead to the conclusion that the domestic courts acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner in assessing the evidence, establishing the facts or interpreting the domestic law. On the contrary, the Court considers that adequate safeguards against arbitrariness were in place in the proceedings against the applicant. The Court notes that the difference in the County Court\u2019s and Court of Appeal\u2019s assessment of the evidence mainly resulted from the courts\u2019 different approach to the coherence or discrepancies within and between the testimony of individual witnesses and their interpretation of the circumstances of the offence as a whole. The Court also notes in this connection that the Court of Appeal, following the Supreme Court\u2019s pertinent case-law (see paragraph 24 above), provided \u2013 as required by the Supreme Court \u2013 particularly thorough reasoning as to why it had come to a conclusion different from that of the County Court, and indicated what mistakes the latter had made, in the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, in assessing the evidence. The Court observes, in particular, that the Court of Appeal disagreed with the County Court\u2019s rejection of certain witness statements and identification reports as evidence and, having taken into account that evidence, arrived at a conclusion different from that of the County Court (see paragraphs 10 and 15 et seq. above).",

The Court considers that the Contracting States dispose in principle of a wide margin of appreciation to determine how the right secured by Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention is to be exercised. Thus, the review by a higher court of a conviction or sentence may concern both points of fact and points of law or be confined solely to points of law. In several member States of the Council of Europe such a review is limited to questions of law or may require the person wishing to appeal to apply for leave to do so (see, for example, Pesti and Frodl v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), nos. 27618/95 and 27619/95, ECHR 2000-I (extracts); Kristjansson and Boasson v. Iceland (dec.), no. 24945/04, 10 April 2007; and Dorado Ba\u00falde v. Spain (dec.), no. 23486/12, 1 September 2015). Moreover, the second paragraph of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 specifically refers to exceptions to the right to appeal in criminal matters in cases where the person concerned was convicted following an appeal against acquittal. The Court finds therefore that there is no appearance of a violation of the provision cited. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",
