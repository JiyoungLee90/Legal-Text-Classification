The expert report was sent to the court by the Republican Institute for Judicial Expertise and Criminalistics (\u201cIREJC\u201d, a State institution) on 8 November 2004, following a visit to the applicant's part of the house on 26 October 2004. The report largely confirmed the findings of the two previous expert reports and assessed the damage caused to the applicant's house at MDL 125,174 (EUR 7,784). It also found that the process of the deformation of the house had not yet stopped and new cracks had appeared after minor repairs had been undertaken. On 15 April 2005 the court accepted V.'s objections to the expert report and ordered a new report to be drawn up by IREJC. On 13 May 2005 IREJC sent the case file back to the court without drawing up the report. On 19 May 2005 the experts charged with drawing up the report were summoned, but they failed to appear on 5 July 2005. On 29 November 2005 V. requested another expert report. On 6 December 2005 the court sent IREJC a request for a new expert report, but on 19 December 2005 the IREJC returned the case file since V. had failed to pay IREJC its costs, as ordered by the court. The applicant stated that she did not want another report since the previous one had confirmed her position. On 30 January 2006 the court ordered the parties to each bear IREJC's costs and ordered a new report to be drawn up. In their observations of September 2006 the Government informed the Court that IREJC had not yet drawn up its report and asked for permission to submit it to the Court when it was ready.

No explanation was given for that delay. More unexplained delays occurred during the process of obtaining the expert reports, such as the period between 20 February 2004 when the court's request was sent to the experts, and 26 October 2004, when the experts visited the house at issue (see paragraph 21 above).

A lack of diligence in the experts' conduct is apparent, as is the failure of the court to take any action in this respect. It is also somewhat surprising that the court found it necessary to order another expert report after three previous reports had all concluded in the applicant's favour. Even though some of the reports may have been invalidated by procedural mistakes, the Court considers that the repetition of such mistakes in the course of the same proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the system set up by the State for obtaining expert reports (see, mutatis mutandis, Wierciszewska v.
