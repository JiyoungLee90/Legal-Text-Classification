Thus, although these provisions have a certain relevance outside the strict confines of criminal law, the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases. Nevertheless, certain principles concerning the notion of a \u201cfair hearing\u201d in cases concerning civil rights and obligations emerge from the Court\u2019s case-law. Most significantly for the present case, it is clear that the requirement of \u201cequality of arms\u201d, in the sense of a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the parties, applies in principle to such cases as well as to criminal cases (see Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27\u00a0October 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, Series A no. 274).",
