However, it also observes that, as the Government have argued, a 1997 amendment to Article 128 of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure clearly establishes a right under Turkish law to challenge in the courts decisions to hold a suspect in police custody. It follows that such a remedy exists in theory. As to how the remedy operates in practice, the Court notes that the Government have not furnished any example of a judicial decision rendered by a State Security Court where a public prosecutor\u2019s order for a suspect to be held in police custody has been quashed before the end of the fourth day (the statutory limit for the period that the public prosecutor may order suspects to be held in police custody) (see \u00d6calan v.
