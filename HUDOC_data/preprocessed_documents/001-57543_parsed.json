He stated that, by reason of his second detention on remand (12 July 1962 - 16 September 1964), he had suffered considerable financial loss, not to mention personal injustice and humiliation.  He alleged that the sudden cessation of his services had ruined his business; that not only had he lost important business contacts, but contracts in hand had had to be left unfulfilled or carried out incompletely; that this had resulted in a serious decline of the Scherzinger company and an almost total loss of the company\u2019s capital.  Reserving his right to present further claims, Neumeister for the time being estimated the loss at 3,500,000 schillings at least.

He further claimed that he had spent in vain at least 100,000 schillings in lawyers\u2019 fees in order to obtain his release.  Finally, he considered that he was entitled to at least 3,000,000 schillings damages for the injustice he had suffered.  He pointed out, however, that the total amount he claimed, 7,069,400 schillings, should be reduced somewhat as his business losses resulting from his arrest had been calculated on estimated gross profits.  Noting that the damages due to him by the  considerably exceeded the total sum originally claimed, he reserved his right to make a corresponding increase in his claim and in addition he asked for payment of interest at an official rate of 5 per cent per annum.",

They further observed that if the \"waiver\" had become effective as from 14 February 1973, there was no explanation why the authorities dealing with the matter had not relied upon it, as a ground of rebuttal, when the applicant increased his claims in March 1973.  The Delegates explained too that the Commission had never taken any position on the offers which the applicant might have made to the Austrian authorities, since it considered that it had no further competence in the matter once the claim had been referred to the Court.  In conclusion they submitted that the arrangement reached in May 1972 raised no preliminary bar in law to the examination of the claim for compensation, but it was a matter for the appreciation of the Court whether account was to be taken of that understanding on the substance, to see, for example, if it had given rise to \"a certain moral obligation\" on the part of Neumeister.",

Having noted that the Austrian judicial authorities gave the danger of absconding as the reason for their successive decisions not to release the applicant, the Court stated that it found it understandable that this risk seemed to them to have been much increased in July 1962 by the greater gravity of the criminal and civil penalties which a co-accused\u2019s new statement must have caused Neumeister to fear (judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A, no. 8, pp. 38-39, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10).

Until that approximate date the interruption of Neumeister\u2019s business activity resulted from decisions which were in conformity with the requirements of the Convention; therefore, that interruption cannot entitle him to reparation.  Subsequently, the interruption could not be taken into account under Article 50 (art. 50) unless the overrunning of the \"reasonable time\" had caused some damage distinct from that which the applicant would necessarily have suffered in the event of his being released one and a half years earlier but imprisoned for the same period after conviction.",

In effect, the time the applicant had spent in detention on remand was reckoned as part of his sentence and, more especially, he was granted remission of the remainder of his sentence, i.e., two years, seven months and ten days.  He would doubtless have had prospects, if he had been imprisoned after conviction, of being released on probation for a third of the term of imprisonment, but even on this assumption it is established that he avoided deprivation of liberty for eleven months and ten days at the very least.  Moreover, he was saved the adverse consequences which further imprisonment would inevitably have caused him in his business activities.  In short, the act of grace of 14 February 1973 was of considerable benefit to him.  The few conditions which accompany that act are in no way onerous; they are defined limitatively in the Act which applies to such cases.  While remission of sentence, like the reckoning of detention as part of a sentence, does not constitute real restitutio in integrum (Ringeisen judgment of 22 June 1972, Series A, no. 15, p. 8, \u00a7 21, 2), it comes as close to it as is possible in the nature of things.",
