The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among others, Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 41964/98, \u00a7 64, 27 June 2006).",

Turkey, no.\u00a058398/00, 23\u00a0May 2006, Pakkan v. Turkey, no.\u00a013017/02, 31 October 2006, G\u0131yasettin\u00a0Altun v. Turkey, no. 73038/01, 24 May 2005, Tutar v.
