The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).
