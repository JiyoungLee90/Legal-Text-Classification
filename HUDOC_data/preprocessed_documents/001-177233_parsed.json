The report addressed issues of diligence and promptness in the diagnosis of the applicant\u2019s cancer and the adequacy of her treatment. The doctors observed that cervical cancer was an illness that progressed slowly, which could be easily diagnosed in its early stages by means of the cytological testing of a smear sample. They noted that the applicant had not been given that test during her routine gynaecological examinations, in breach of national regulations (see paragraphs 34 and 35). As a result, the cervical cancer had been diagnosed belatedly, when it was already at an advanced stage and when only palliative medical care was required. The doctors further concluded that the treatment provided to the applicant had been deficient. In particular, the medical authorities had failed to provide the applicant with a primary consultation with a specialist in radiotherapy, a colposcopy examination, or treatment with the required medicines: serotonin receptor blockers, glucocorticoids, pyrazolone, and so forth (for the relevant domestic regulations see paragraphs 35 and 36 above).
