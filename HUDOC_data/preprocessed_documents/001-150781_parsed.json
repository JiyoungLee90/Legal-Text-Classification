The court also referred to the seriousness and the continuous nature of the offences. It stressed that the applicant had acted in his capacity as mayor when he had allegedly committed the offences. It concluded that the public would be shocked if the applicant were to be released. In assessing the concrete danger to public order if the applicant were released from detention, the court stressed that the offences had allegedly been committed over a long period of time (starting in 2009, when he had been appointed mayor, until the time of his arrest), that they were repetitive and that the perpetrator was a mayor in charge of protecting legal order. The court pointed out that as the applicant\u2019s wife was under investigation, the applicant having used her law firm to cash the money received as bribes, his release from prison would allow him to influence her position. It concluded that his release from detention would intimidate other persons in possession of information relevant for the investigation.",

Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR\u00a02001-II). An extreme lack of space in a prison cell weighs heavily as an aspect to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the impugned detention conditions were \u201cdegrading\u201d from the point of view of Article 3 of the Convention. In its previous cases where applicants had less than 4\u00a0sq m of personal space at their disposal, the Court has found that the overcrowding was so severe as to justify of itself a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see, among many other authorities, Sulejmanovic v. Italy, no.\u00a022635/03, \u00a7 51, 16 July 2009, and Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, \u00a7 59, 6\u00a0December 2007). By contrast, in other cases where overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3, the Court has noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements have included, in particular, the availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements and the possibility of using the toilet in private (see case-law cited in Orchowski v.

In this connection the Court reiterates that by virtue of Article 5 \u00a7 4 an arrested or detained person is entitled to bring proceedings for the review by a court of the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the \u201clawfulness\u201d, in the sense of Article 5 \u00a7 1, of his or her deprivation of liberty (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 145B). Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and give to the individual concerned guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. In order to determine whether proceedings provide the \u201cfundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty\u201d regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which such proceedings take place (see, among other authorities, Megyeri v.\u00a0Germany, 12 May 1992, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 237A). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties \u2013 the prosecutor and the detainee (see Nikolova v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a031195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-II).
