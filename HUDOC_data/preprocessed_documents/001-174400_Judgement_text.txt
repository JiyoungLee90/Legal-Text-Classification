The case originated in an application (no. 53803/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Sefa Akgül (“the applicant”), on 11 July 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr O. Çelen, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the complaints concerning the alleged lack of fairness in the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on account of the applicant’s inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence to that court and the alleged lack of independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Balıkesir.
.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 26 May 2010 the applicant was dismissed from his post as an officer in the army due to non-compliance with disciplinary rules.
On 22 June 2010 the applicant brought an action before the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested the annulment of his dismissal. On 9 November 2010 the chief public prosecutor submitted his observations to the Supreme Military Administrative Court. These observations were notified to the applicant and he replied to it in his petition of 14 December 2010.
.  On 8 February 2011 the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case taking into account the “secret documents” submitted by the Ministry of Defence. These documents were not disclosed to the applicant.
.  On 26 April 2011 the applicant’s request for rectification was rejected by the same court.
