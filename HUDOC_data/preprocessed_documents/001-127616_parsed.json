In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7 282, ECHR 2001-VII (extracts)). Such proof may, however, follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

The medical report, which noted the time of that initial examination as 11.50\u00a0p.m., indicated that there was no sign of physical violence on the applicant\u2019s body (see paragraph 8 above). The applicant was then taken back to the police station but was immediately transferred again to the hospital to undergo a second medical examination before he was handed over to officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch. The second medical report, drawn up at 1.14 a.m. the same night, noted no sign of ill-treatment on the applicant\u2019s body either. From that point on, during the following two days, four medical examinations were performed on the applicant. In contrast to the two initial reports, doctors conducting those latter examinations, the first of which was performed at 2.25 a.m., reported several injuries on the applicant\u2019s body, including lightly bleeding bruises and scratches. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the initial reports and the others was later clarified by the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute, which concluded that soft-tissue lesions such as those found on the applicant might not be visible immediately after the incident (see paragraph 27 above). In that connection, the Court also points out that at no stage of the domestic proceedings or during the Strasbourg proceedings has the applicant challenged the veracity of the initial reports or alleged that the doctors who issued them had failed to examine his injuries (see Co\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022568/05, \u00a7 33, 26 March 2013). There is also no indication in the case file that he requested or was refused permission to see another doctor (see Aysu v. Turkey, no. 44021/07, \u00a7 35, 13 March 2012).",

Moreover, the Court considers that the alleged beating, which, according to the applicant was inflicted on him by ten to fifteen officers for about twenty minutes, would have left different marks from the easily treatable soft-tissue lesions found on his body (see Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, \u00a7 61, 24 January 2008, and \u0130z v. Turkey (dec.), no. 9830/07, 5 July 2011). It observes that the applicant also complained about having been punched several times on the chin, which was later rebutted by a dental report, noting that there was no indication that such external force had been applied to his mouth (see paragraph 15 above).",

During the course of that investigation, which lasted for a period of two years and six months, the public prosecutor obtained the statements of all police officers on duty on the night of the alleged incident, some of whom had been assigned to various other places in the country by that time. He also took the statements of three officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch, provided photographs of all officers in order for the applicant to identify those who had ill-treated him and requested more photographs following the applicant\u2019s failure to identify the officers concerned during the first session (see paragraphs 22-26 above). Although the applicant claimed that he could have identified the police officers involved had he seen them in person or been shown more recent photographs, the Court finds that assertion questionable as the applicant had not been able to recognise any of the fifteen officers who, according to him, had inflicted physical violence on him, despite checking the officers\u2019 photographs during three sessions.",

Accordingly, it cannot consider it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was subjected to illtreatment during his time in police custody at the Beyaz\u0131t police station.
