The altercation had taken place in the narrow doorway of the disciplinary cell.

The guard duly warned the applicant and only after that used the rubber truncheon to restrain him.

In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Sheydayev v.

The burden of proof rests on the Government to demonstrate with convincing arguments that the use of force, which resulted in the applicant's injuries, was not excessive (see, for example, Dzwonkowski v. Poland, no. 46702/99, \u00a7 51, 12 April 2007).",

The Court takes cognisance of the Government's argument that those injuries were not serious and did not cause any \u201chealth problem\u201d. However, this fact alone cannot rule out a possibility that the treatment was severe enough to be considered inhuman or degrading. The Court considers that the degree of bruising noted by the remand prison paramedics indicated that the applicant's injuries were, as such, sufficiently serious. Accordingly, the question before the Court in the instant case is whether the State should be held responsible under Article 3 in respect of these injuries.",
