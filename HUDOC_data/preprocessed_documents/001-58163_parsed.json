It is to be noted, for example, that no procedural measures were taken to list the case for hearing or to deal with interlocutory motions during that time. This must be considered a particularly significant period of inactivity. The Government have sought to explain this with reference to the volume of work with which the Supreme Court had to contend at the relevant period. However, the excessive delay cannot be excused on this ground and is imputable to the respondent State, it being recalled that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see the Philis v.
