Detention entails inherent limitations on his family life, and some measure of control of the detainee\u2019s contacts with the outside world is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention. However, it is an essential part of a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for family life that the authorities enable him or, if need be, assist him to maintain contact with his close family. This principle applies a fortiori to untried prisoners who must be considered innocent by virtue of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Trosin v.

It does nothing to limit the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise, and deprives the detainee of the minimum degree of protection against arbitrariness or abuse to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (see Vlasov v.

In rejecting the applicant\u2019s requests to visit her husband by reference to that provision, he appeared to interpret it as giving him absolute discretion in the matter of allowing or refusing family visits during the trial (see the wording of his letter of 18 April 2011 in paragraph 8 above). On the issue of family visits, Article 8 requires the States to take into account the interests of the prisoner and his or her family members and to evaluate them not in terms of broad generalities but in application to the specific situation (see Andrey Smirnov, cited above, \u00a7 48). In the present case, however, Judge N. and his colleagues in the Supreme Court of Tatarstan made no attempt to justify the refusal of family visits beyond a generic reference to the \u201cparticular circumstances of the case\u201d, the nature of the charges against the applicant\u2019s husband or unspecified security considerations. The President of the Supreme Court of Tatarstan upheld a blanket ban on family visits in respect of all defendants for the entire duration of a trial (see paragraph 14 above). As a consequence, the applicant was unable to see her imprisoned husband for three and a half years.",

It expressed the view that a reasoned decision refusing an application for a prison visit should be amenable to a judicial review. A court carrying out such a review should decide whether or not the refusal was justified in the light of factual elements of the case. Even though the Constitutional Court formulated that position as early as 1998 and affirmed it in subsequent decisions (see paragraph 17 above, and also Vlasov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a075 and 152), the requirement to issue a reasoned decision and to provide for its judicial review has not been incorporated in the Code of Criminal Procedure or the Defendants\u2019 Detention Act. In the absence of a specific requirement, the courts of general jurisdiction did not consider themselves bound by the case-law of the Constitutional Court and rejected applications for prison visits by means of non-procedural letters without giving relevant and sufficient reasons (compare Chaldayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 15). The manner of proceeding adopted in the Supreme Court of Tatarstan was similar. The applicant\u2019s requests were rejected in generic terms by means of non-procedural letters which contained little motivation, if any at all. Her complaints to the Presidents of the Supreme Court of Tatarstan and of the Supreme Court of Russia were forwarded to the same trial judge whose conduct she impugned. In his reply, he expressly excluded the possibility of having his decision reviewed on appeal (see paragraph 13 above). In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant did not have an effective remedy for her complaints about restrictions on family visits.",
