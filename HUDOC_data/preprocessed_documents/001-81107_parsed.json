In order to ascertain whether such reasoning could be regarded as sufficient, the Court must take into account, among other things, the nature of the dispute concerned. In this connection, it notes that the case did not raise any complex questions. The issue was in fact to determine whether the remarks of the applicant\u2019s immediate superior concerning her professional conduct could be characterised as defamatory or not. In its judgment no. 74941/2001 the Athens Criminal Court considered that the impugned allegations were well-founded and that the accused had never intended to defame or insult the applicant.
