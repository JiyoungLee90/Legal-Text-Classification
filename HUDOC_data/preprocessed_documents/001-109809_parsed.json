Referring to its own constant case-law and to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court, the Court of Appeal considered that the legislature had been entitled to let the interests of the child and of her legal parents prevail over the biological father\u2019s interest to have his paternity legally established and to preclude the biological father from contesting paternity. There was no room for the court to examine in individual cases whether it was necessary in the child\u2019s best interests to allow the presumed biological father to contest paternity.

It was, in particular, justifiable to make acknowledgement of paternity dependent on the mother\u2019s consent. The legislature was not obliged to make acknowledgment of paternity dependent on a genetic examination of descent. It was acceptable to base the granting of legal status on an assumption which was based on specific factual and social situations. Such an assumption existed if a man declared in a legally binding way and with the express consent of the mother of a child born out of wedlock that he was willing to assume parental responsibility. The Court of Appeal further considered that the child\u2019s rights were sufficiently protected by her own right to challenge paternity upon reaching the age of majority.",

A social and family relationship is considered to exist if the legal father has or had actual responsibility for the child at the relevant point in time.

However, following a decision of the  dated 9 April 2003 (no. 1 BvR 1493/96 and 1724/01) the legislature had decided to allow the biological father to contest paternity if no social-family relationship existed between the legal father and the child. The decisive consideration was that, in the interest of the social family and of the required legal certainty in the law on parentage, the biological father had no constitutional right to be granted paternity as a matter of priority, if the legal father exercised his parental responsibility in the sense of social parentage. The decision to grant precedence to the legal family was in line with the case-law of the Court, which had confirmed that it was justifiable for the domestic courts to give greater weight to the interests of the child and the family in which it lived than to the interest of an applicant in obtaining determination of a biological fact (Nylund v.\u00a0Finland (dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999VI).",

The\u00a0reasons why the biological father has not previously established such a relationship are irrelevant; the provisions thus also cover cases in which the fact that such a relationship has not yet been established is not attributable to the biological father (compare Anayo, cited above, \u00a7 67). The Court refers to its findings in the Anayo case that this legal situation led to a violation of the biological father\u2019s right to respect for his private life (see Anayo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-73, also compare Schneider, cited above, \u00a7 104).",

This may imply the establishment, in access proceedings, of biological \u2013 as opposed to legal \u2013 paternity if, in the special circumstances of the case, contact between the alleged biological father \u2013 presuming that he was in fact the child\u2019s biological parent \u2013 and the child were considered to be in the child\u2019s best interests (see Schneider, cited above, \u00a7 103).",

However, this does not necessarily imply a duty under the Convention to allow the alleged biological father to challenge the legal father\u2019s status or to provide a separate action to establish biological \u2013 as opposed to legal \u2013 paternity. Neither can such an obligation be deduced from the Court\u2019s case-law. The present case has to be distinguished from the R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski case relied upon by the applicant, as in the latter case the domestic authorities had refused to deal with Mr R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski\u2019s request to establish his paternity by mere reference to the recognition of paternity by another man, without, however, examining the factual background of the case, as for example the question whether the child lived with his legal father in a social and family relationship (see R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski, cited above, \u00a7 78). In the case of Mizzi v. Malta (no. 26111/02, ECHR 2006I), the Court found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in that the applicant, who was the legal \u2013 but not the biological \u2013 father of a child born in wedlock, and had never lived with the child, was never afforded the possibility of bringing, with reasonable prospect of success, an action aimed at contesting paternity (see Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-111). The Court considers that this case falls to be distinguished from the instant case in that Mr Mizzi alleged that the presumption of legal paternity had not been in line with social reality, as he had never entertained any factual relationship to the child (see Mizzi, cited above, \u00a7 11). Conversely, in the instant case Mr E.\u2019s legal paternity coincided with his factual role as the child\u2019s social father.",

Furthermore, the legal parents and the child were allowed to demand an examination of descent by genetic testing without changing the child\u2019s legal status. According to the applicant, there were no relevant reasons which justified such different treatment. This discrimination was further exacerbated by the fact that the growing intensity of the social and family relationship between the legal father and the child during the paternity proceedings had not impaired the mother\u2019s right to contest paternity. Furthermore, it had to be borne in mind that children, when challenging paternity, did not have to take into account their own social relationship with their mother and legal father. By contrast, the biological father was precluded from challenging paternity even if this would serve the child\u2019s best interests.",

Alternatively, the Government submitted that the groups referred to by the applicant were not comparable. The applicant, who had never lived with the child, was not in a similar position to the legal parents, as the latter lived with the child in a domestic community and bore parental responsibility. The legislature\u2019s decision to grant precedence to the social and family relationship between the legal father and the child fell within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation when weighing the competing interests.",

The Court reiterates that in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, Article 14 affords protection against different treatment, without an objective and reasonable justification of persons in similar situations (see, among many other authorities, Zaunegger, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

Having regard to the above considerations relating to the proportionality of the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life, in particular to the lack of consensus within the Member States (see \u00a7\u00a7 70\u201371 above), the Court considers that the decision to give the existing family relationship between the child and her legal parents precedence over the relationship with the alleged biological father falls, insofar as the legal status is concerned, within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation.",
