Concerning the injuries sustained by the applicants, the NMPPO opined that they had been caused by fights between the prisoners themselves, their falling down the stairs or against the furniture in the course of the operation and/or the prisoners\u2019 resistance to the police who had been trying to restore order to the Ni\u0161 Penitentiary. Lastly, the NMPPO noted that the proportionality of the entire intervention was best evidenced by the fact that despite the large number of prisoners involved, of which some had been armed and dangerous, and the scale of the intervention only a small number of persons had been injured, sustaining, as they did, mostly slight bodily harm.",

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2010; Price v. the United Kingdom, no..33394/96, \u00a7\u00a024, ECHR 2001-VII; and Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a054810/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 11\u00a0July 2006). Treatment has been held to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see\u00a0Labita, cited above, \u00a7 120). It has been considered \u201cdegrading\u201d when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance (see\u00a0Hurtado v.\u00a0Switzerland, 28 January 1994, opinion of the Commission, \u00a7 67, Series A no.\u00a0280, and Wieser v. Austria, no.\u00a02293/03, \u00a7\u00a036, 22\u00a0February 2007). Torture, however, involves deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see, for example, Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18\u00a0December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2279, \u00a7\u00a064; Ayd\u0131n v.

France, no.\u00a067263/01, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2002IX). Any recourse to physical force in respect of a person deprived of his liberty which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the rights set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Sheydayev v. Russia, no.\u00a065859/01, \u00a7\u00a059, 7 December 2006; Ribitsch v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 4\u00a0December 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0336, \u00a7 38; and Krastanov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050222/99, \u00a7\u00a053, 30 September 2004). The Court is, of course, mindful of the potential for violence that exists in penal institutions and of the fact that disobedience by detainees may quickly degenerate into a riot (see G\u00f6mi and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a035962/97, \u00a7\u00a077, 21\u00a0December 2006). It accepts therefore that the use of force may be necessary on occasion to ensure prison security, to maintain order or prevent crime. Nevertheless, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 63, 24\u00a0July 2008).",

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events at issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII). Whilst it is not, in principle, the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts, the Court is nevertheless not bound by the domestic courts\u2019 findings in this regard (see, for example, Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 32).",

Almost 600 prisoners were thus left without any official supervision until 24 November 2006 when, following a large-scale police intervention, the protests were ultimately brought to an end (see paragraphs 8-10 above). In these circumstances, it is clear that any events during that period, up until the very conclusion of the police operation, did not \u201clie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u201d and that any allegations of ill-treatment would have to be substantiated \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d.",

Specifically, there are some indications to the effect that the injuries sustained or allegedly sustained by the applicants might have been caused as a consequence of score-settling between the prisoners themselves or due to the panic which had ensued in the course of the intervention (see paragraphs 8, 12, 22 and 25 above). Furthermore, there are reports to the effect that some prisoners, again possibly including the applicants, had offered resistance during the intervention and it is undisputed that a large number of weapons were seized by the prison authorities on 24\u00a0November\u00a02006 (see paragraphs 9, 12, 14, and 25 above).",
