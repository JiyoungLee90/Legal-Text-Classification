Admittedly the Court had held that \"the word \u2018law\u2019 in the expression \u2018prescribed by law\u2019 cover[ed] not only statute but also unwritten law\" (see the Sunday Times judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, \u00a7 47, the Dudgeon judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 19, \u00a7 44, and the Chappell judgment of 30 March 1989, Series A no. 152, p. 22, \u00a7 52), but in those instances the Court was, so the Delegate maintained, thinking only of the common-law system.

It is therefore not for the Court to express an opinion contrary to theirs on whether telephone tapping ordered by investigating judges is compatible with Article 368 of the Criminal Code. For many years now, the courts - and in particular the Court of Cassation - have regarded Articles 81, 151 and 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as providing a legal basis for telephone tapping carried out by a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire) under a warrant issued by an investigating judge.",

In relation to paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) of the Convention and other similar clauses, the Court has always understood the term \"law\" in its \"substantive\" sense, not its \"formal\" one; it has included both enactments of lower rank than statutes (see, in particular, the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 45, \u00a7 93) and unwritten law. The Sunday Times, Dudgeon and Chappell judgments admittedly concerned the , but it would be wrong to exaggerate the distinction between common-law countries and Continental countries, as the Government rightly pointed out. Statute law is, of course, also of importance in common-law countries. Conversely, case-law has traditionally played a major role in Continental countries, to such an extent that whole branches of positive law are largely the outcome of decisions by the courts. The Court has indeed taken account of case-law in such countries on more than one occasion (see, in particular, the M\u00fcller and Others judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 20, \u00a7 29, the Salabiaku judgment of 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 29, and the Markt Intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165, pp. 18-19, \u00a7 30). Were it to overlook case-law, the Court would undermine the legal system of the Continental States almost as much as the Sunday Times judgment of 26 April 1979 would have \"struck at the very roots\" of the United Kingdom\u2019s legal system if it had excluded the common law from the concept of \"law\" (Series A no. 30, p. 30, \u00a7 47). In a sphere covered by the written law, the \"law\" is the enactment in force as the competent courts have interpreted it in the light, if necessary, of any new practical developments.",

Some have not yet been expressly laid down in the case-law at all, at least according to the information gathered by the Court; the Government appear to infer them either from general enactments or principles or else from an analogical interpretation of legislative provisions - or court decisions - concerning investigative measures different from telephone tapping, notably searches and seizure of property. Although plausible in itself, such \"extrapolation\" does not provide sufficient legal certainty in the present context.",

For example, the categories of people liable to have their telephones tapped by judicial order and the nature of the offences which may give rise to such an order are nowhere defined. Nothing obliges a judge to set a limit on the duration of telephone tapping. Similarly unspecified are the procedure for drawing up the summary reports containing intercepted conversations; the precautions to be taken in order to communicate the recordings intact and in their entirety for possible inspection by the judge (who can hardly verify the number and length of the original tapes on the spot) and by the defence; and the circumstances in which recordings may or must be erased or the tapes be destroyed, in particular where an accused has been discharged by an investigating judge or acquitted by a court. The information provided by the Government on these various points shows at best the existence of a practice, but a practice lacking the necessary regulatory control in the absence of legislation or case-law.",
