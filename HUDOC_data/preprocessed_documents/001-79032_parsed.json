The Court has, for example, not accepted that an extraordinary appeal is an effective domestic remedy in either the civil or the criminal contexts and it has found that the quashing of a final judgment on supervisory review can create problems as to the legal certainty to be afforded to that judgment (see mutatis mutandis Nikitin v. Russia, no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2004VIII). Therefore, the Court considers that the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention raises serious questions of fact and law, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes, therefore, that it is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.

Romania [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII). This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2003-IX).",

In particular, the Court has to assess whether, in a given case, the power to launch and conduct the request for annulment proceedings were exercised by the authorities so as to strike, as far as possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-57).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the grounds for the request for annulment given by the Deputy Prosecutor General in the present case were insufficient to justify challenging the finality of the judgment and using this extraordinary remedy to that end. The Court, therefore considers, as it has found in similar circumstances (see, for instance, Savinskiy v. Ukraine, no. 6965/02, \u00a7 25-27, 28\u00a0February 2006), that the State authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the interests of the applicant and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.",
