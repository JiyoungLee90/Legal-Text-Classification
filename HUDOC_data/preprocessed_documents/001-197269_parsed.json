Notably, under the 2004 Code of Civil Procedure, as worded at the relevant time, a court decision declaring a physical person entirely incapable could be quashed, and the legal capacity of that person restored, by another court decision, provided that the person in question had either been cured or his or her mental state had significantly improved. Such a decision could be taken upon an application being submitted by the guardian or the guardianship authority (\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d \u043e\u043f\u0456\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u043a\u043b\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f), but not by the person who had been declared incapable, and had to be supported by relevant conclusions drawn by a forensic psychiatric expert (Article 241 \u00a7 4). Following amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, which came into effect on 15\u00a0December 2017, Article 300 now provides, inter alia, that a court decision declaring a physical person incapable may be quashed upon an application submitted by, among others, the person who was declared incapable.",

Having regard to the applicant\u2019s submissions showing numerous examples of domestic practice concordant with those legislative restrictions, the Court finds that the remedy referred to by the Government was not sufficiently certain in practice.

It notes, however, that in finding a violation of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, it has taken into account the consequences of the lack of access to a court for the applicant\u2019s civil rights, including her custody rights. Moreover, it has not been shown that the applicant had been actually prevented from communicating with her children or that any alleged difficulties in such communication had been caused by the applicant\u2019s legal incapacitation and not by the other factors existing in the family. In the circumstances of the case, the Court holds that it is not necessary to examine the present complaint separately (see Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2015 and Nataliya\u00a0Mikhaylenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042).",
