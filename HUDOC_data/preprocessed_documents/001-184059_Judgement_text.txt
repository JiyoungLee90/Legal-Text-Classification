The case originated in thirteen separate applications against Serbia (nos. 27471/15, 27288/15, 27751/15, 27779/15, 27790/15, 28156/15, 28418/15, 30893/15, 30906/15, 32933/15, 35780/15, 40646/15 and 55066/15) lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eighteen Serbian nationals.
A list of applicants, as well as their additional personal details, the dates of introduction of their complaints before the Court, and information regarding their legal representation is set out in the appendix. Applications nos. 30906/15, 32933/15 and 40646/15 have two, three and three applicants, respectively.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
Alleging rejections of their civil claims by the domestic courts and the simultaneous acceptance of identical claims lodged by other claimants, the applicants complain that there have been breaches of their right to legal certainty. Relying on essentially the same facts, they also allege violations of their right to a fair trial, their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, and violations of the prohibition on discrimination.
On 30 August 2016 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants were all employees of the Ministry of Justice’s directorate for the execution of criminal sanctions in Serbia. Because of the hardships prison staff endure during service at penal institutions in Serbia, Serbian law provides that they are eligible for certain employment benefits, such as benefits concerning the calculation of their old-age pensions and salary increases.
In general, pension and work-related issues in Serbia are regulated by two laws: 1) the Old-Age Pension and Disability Insurance Act (Zakon o penzionom i invalidskom osiguranju, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia no. 34/2003, as amended); and 2) the Labour Act (Zakon o radu, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia no. 24/2005, as amended). However, in regards to employees of correctional facilities, pension and work-related issues are also regulated by: 1) the Execution of Criminal Sanctions Act (Zakon o izvršenju krivičnih sankcija, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia -OG RS- no. 85/2005, amendments published in the Official Gazette no. 72/2009); and 2) the Directive on personal coefficients for the calculation and payment of salaries to individuals employed within the Ministry of Justice’s directorate for the execution of criminal sanctions (Uredba o koeficijentima za obračun i isplatu plata u Upravi za izvršenje krivičnih sankcija, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia -OG RS- no. 16/2007, amendments published in the Official Gazette nos. 21/2009, 1/2011 – Constitutional Court decision (implementing decision of the Constitutional Court of 18 November 2010), 83/2011 and 102/2011 – hereinafter “the Directive”).
Under Article 262 of the Execution of Criminal Sanctions Act, the director and other employees of the directorate for the execution of criminal sanctions are entitled to an accelerated accumulation of pension rights: this means that twelve months of full-time employment is counted as sixteen months of full-time employment in the civilian economy when their old-age pensions are calculated. Also, the personal coefficient of employees in correctional facilities may, according to the said Article, be increased by up to 30%. The posts to which the accelerated accumulation of pension rights applies are determined by the minister responsible for the judiciary and the minister responsible for pension and disability insurance.
In accordance with Article 7 § 3 of the Directive, in the period between 1 January 2007 and 14 January 2011 the personal coefficients of the applicants and their colleagues were increased by 10% instead of 30% as provided by the Execution of Criminal Sanctions Act.
On 18 November 2010, the Constitutional Court adopted a decision (no. IU 63/2007) stating that Article 7 § 3 of the Directive was unconstitutional. The said Article was struck down. The amendments to the Directive entered into force on 14 January 2011. As of 14 January 2011 the personal coefficients were increased by 30%.
Between 1 January 2007 and 14 January 2011, while this unconstitutional norm (neustavna odredba) was in force, the employees of the Ministry of Justice’s directorate for the execution of criminal sanctions received lower salaries that they had been entitled to. For that reason, their old-age pensions were also reduced.
Throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013 the applicants, as well as many of their colleagues, lodged with various courts of first instance (osnovni sudovi) separate civil claims against the Republic of Serbia, asking for compensation for the damage caused while the four-year-long unconstitutional norm pertained.
Some of the courts of first instance upheld the claimants’ applications for compensation, while others dismissed them. Decisions of the courts of first instance were appealed against either by claimants or the defendant.
Certain claimants were successful before the courts of appeal; yet all the applicants were unsuccessful. In particular, the applicants’ complaints were rejected by the courts of appeal in Belgrade and Kragujevac for the applicants’ failure to pursue the proper avenue of redress. In the view of these courts the applicants should have first initiated administrative proceedings and afterwards lodged a complaint with the civil courts. In any event, the Belgrade and Kragujevac Courts of Appeal also held that they did not have jurisdiction to decide on the applicants’ cases.
In contrast, in the following cases other courts of appeal or chambers thereof ruled in favour of the applicants’ colleagues:
In the above-mentioned decisions the courts of appeal upheld the claimants’ requests, stating that the applicants’ colleagues should be paid the differences in their salaries together with interest on the unpaid amounts, and the contributions in respect of the their old-age pensions, for the period during the which unconstitutional norm had been applied.
Given the differences in adjudication on the matter, on 27 March 2013 the Novi Sad Court of Appeal requested, in accordance with Article 395 of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia – OG RS – 125/04 and 111/2009), that the Supreme Court of Cassation amend its judgment no. Gž1-2352/12 of 12 December 2012 and harmonise the case-law of the courts of appeal in matters concerning the payment of the differences between the salaries claimants had received and those they had been entitled to.
On 26 September 2013, in response to the said request, the Supreme Court of Cassation found, acting in accordance with Articles 395 and 399 of the Civil Procedure Act, that there was an interest of general concern to deal with this issue. It held that the Novi Sad Court of Appeal in delivering the judgment of 12 December 2012 had incorrectly applied and interpreted domestic law. The Supreme Court of Cassation held that the judgment should have been rendered in the claimant’s favour and, accordingly, set the judgment of the Novi Sad Court of Appeal aside.
After the impugned decision, the Courts of Appeal in Novi Sad, Niš and Kragujevac assumed the following approach:
In the period between 26 September 2012 and 13 May 2014 the applicants appealed to the Constitutional Court.
They complained, inter alia, of the inconsistent domestic case-law of the Serbian courts which had caused the rejection of their claims and the simultaneous acceptance of identical claims lodged by their colleagues. Relying on Article 6 of the Convention or Articles 32 and 36 of the Constitution (provisions that correspond to Article 6 of the Convention) the applicants asked the Constitutional Court to find that there had been a breach of the principle of legal certainty as an integral part of the right to a fair trial.
Between 23 October 2014 and 25 March 2015, the Constitutional Court rejected the applicants’ constitutional appeals as unsubstantiated.
The facts relating to each applicant may be summarised as follows:

The Civil Procedure Act was in force from 22 February 2005 until 1 February 2012 (hereinafter “the former Civil Procedure Act”). However, in accordance with Article 506 § 1 of the new Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia nos. 72/2011, 49/2013 – Constitutional Court decision, 74/2013 – Constitutional Court decision 55/2014 – hereinafter: “the new Civil Procedure Act”) provisions of the former Civil Procedure Act are applicable to all proceedings which commenced before the new Civil Procedure Act entered into force.
“This Act shall govern the rules of proceedings for providing legal protection of the court applied in acting and adjudicating upon civil-law disputes arising from personal, family, labour, business, property and other civil legal relations, with and exception of the disputes in respect of which another type of proceedings is provided in accordance with the specific law.”
“Exceptionally, an appeal on points of law shall be permitted against a second-instance decision which is not liable to an appeal on points of law under the provisions referred to in Article 394 of this Law, if, in the assessment of the Court of Appeal on the admissibility of an appeal on points of law, this is required to examine legal issues in the common interest, achieve uniformity of application of the law in court judgments, or when a new legal interpretation is required.”
“The court of revision (revizijski sud) shall examine solely the part of a judgment contested by the application for an appeal on points of law and within the limits of the reasons stated in the appeal on points of law, and shall, of their own motion, take due care of a substantial violation of the civil-procedure rules pursuant to Article 361, paragraph 2, subparagraph 9 of this Act, and about the correct application of the law.”
“(1) If the court of revision establishes that substantive law was applied incorrectly, it shall render a judgment granting an application for review and reverse the contested judgment.
(2) If the court of revision finds that the facts were established incompletely owing to incorrect application of substantive law, and consequently no grounds for the contested judgment to be reversed existed, it shall render a ruling to grant an application for review and, entirely or partially, and set aside the judgments of a court of first instance and a court of second instance, or solely the judgment of a former. The Supreme Court of Cassation shall consequently refer the case for retrial to the same or another court chamber of the court of first instance, or of the court of second instance, or another competent court.”
“An appeal on points of law shall exceptionally be permitted in the event of a wrongful implementation of substantive law and against a second-instance judgment which could not be disputed by an appeal on points of law if, according to the estimates of the Supreme Court of Cassation, it would be necessary to consider legal issues of general interest or legal issues in the interest of equal rights of citizens, for the purpose of the harmonisation of domestic case-law, as well as, if necessary, for the purpose of providing a new interpretation of law (special appeal on points of law) [posebna revizija].
The Supreme Court of Cassation shall decide on the admissibility and legitimacy of an appeal on points of law from paragraph 1 hereof by deliberating in a panel of five judges.”
“The Supreme Court of Cassation shall examine solely the part of a judgment contested by the application for an appeal on points of law and within the limits of the reasons stated in the appeal on points of law, and shall, of their own motion, pay due attention to a substantial violation of the civil-procedure rules pursuant to Article 374, paragraph 2, subparagraph 2 of this Act, and about the correct application of the law. “
The Courts Organisation Act was enacted in 2008 and came into force on 1 January 2010. This Act regulates the judicial system in the Republic of Serbia, as well as the organisation, competence and jurisdiction of the courts.
The Supreme Court of Cassation has its seat in Belgrade, and as set out in Articles 30 and 31 of the Courts Organisation Act it: i) decides on extraordinary legal remedies lodged against decisions of courts of the Republic of Serbia; ii) decides on conflicts of jurisdiction between courts if this does not fall under the jurisdiction of any other court as well as on transfers of jurisdictions of the courts; iii) determines general legal views in order to ensure the uniform application of law; iv) evaluates the application of the laws and other regulations, as well as the work of courts; v) appoints judges of the Constitutional Court, provides opinions on candidates for the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation; and vi) exercise other competences set forth in the Act.
As provided in Article 43 of the Act, the Supreme Court of Cassation must hold departmental meetings of the Supreme Court of Cassation (sednice odeljenja Vrhovnog kasacionog suda) where the issues arising from the scope of work of different courts’ departments are analysed. The departmental meetings of the Supreme Court of Cassation are, in particular, convened when an issue of inconsistency of domestic case-law appears. Legal opinions (pravna shvatanja) adopted at those meeting are binding for all chambers (veća) of the relevant court’ departments.
Articles 27, 28, 29 and 31 provide, inter alia, that: (i) courts with a larger number of judges may have case-law departments entrusted with the monitoring of relevant domestic and international case-law; (ii) courts must keep a register of all legal opinions which are deemed to be of significance for case-law; (iii) courts of appeal may hold joint consultations on case-law related issues, including with the Supreme Court of Cassation; and (iv) the case-law departments shall prepare proposals for judges’ plenary sessions with a view to securing harmonisation of the relevant case-law.
Article 85 § 2 provides that appellants should substantiate their constitutional appeals with any and all evidence of relevance for the determination of their case, provide a copy of the impugned decision, and document that all other effective remedies have already been exhausted.
On 2 April 2015 the Supreme Court of Cassation overturned judgment no. Gž1-2008/13 of the Belgrade Court of Appeal of 20 March 2013 and ruled in favour of the claimant in a matter concerning the payment of the difference between the value of the received and anticipated salaries. It held that, while delivering the judgment of 20 March 2013, the Belgrade Court of Appeal had incorrectly applied and interpreted domestic law.
The Supreme Court of Cassation acted by virtue of Articles 395 and 399 of the former Civil Procedure Act; those were the provisions the Supreme Court of Cassation used when a need to harmonise case-law of the courts of appeal arose.
Acting under Article 404 of the new Civil Procedure Act and with the purpose of harmonising the inconsistency in the domestic case-law, on 17 March 2016 the Supreme Court of Cassation overturned judgment no. Gž1 3851/2014 of the Belgrade Court of Appeal of 30 October 2015 in which the complaint of a certain J.T. concerning the payment of the difference between his anticipated and received salaries was rejected. The Supreme Court of Cassation found that the judgment should have been rendered in the claimant’s favour.
The case was remitted to the Belgrade Court of Appeal.
Acting under Article 404 of the new Civil Procedure Act and with the purpose of harmonising the inconsistency in the domestic case-law, on 21 July 2016 the Supreme Court of Cassation overturned judgment no. Gž1 2644/2015 of the Belgrade Court of Appeal of 25 November 2015 and judgment no. P1 5570/11 of the Court of First Instance in Belgrade of 26 May 2014 in which the complaint of a certain R.R. concerning the payment of the difference between the anticipated and received salaries was rejected. The Supreme Court of Cassation found that the judgments should have been rendered in the claimant’s favour.
The case was remitted to the court of first instance.
On 13 January 2016 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the right to a fair trial in a case with facts similar to the applicants’. In particular, it found that because of the inconsistent domestic case-law in regards to the payment of damages for the delayed payment of the same salary increase granted to employees of correctional facilities, the right to a fair trial of a certain D.B. had been violated.
D.B had been an employee of Belgrade Special Prison Hospital (Specijalna zatvorska bolnica Beograd). On 19 September 2013 the Belgrade Court of Appeal had rejected D.B.’s appeal. On 21 October 2013 D.B. had lodged a constitutional appeal (Už-8442/2013).
D.B. had been represented before the domestic courts by the same lawyer who is representing the first, second, fifth, sixth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and eighteenth applicants before this Court. D.B.’s claims and appeals at the domestic level had been the same as the claims and appeals of those applicants; the time-frame had also been the same. In the course of the proceedings before the Constitutional Court, D.B. referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 2 April 2015.
Finding the violation of D.B.’s right to legal certainty was an integral part of her right to fair trial, the Constitutional Court stated, in particular, that:
