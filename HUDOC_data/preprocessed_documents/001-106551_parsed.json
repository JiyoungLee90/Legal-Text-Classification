Even though there are no CPT reports concerning this specific establishment, the Court has recently analysed the material conditions of detention in this prison for periods of time which overlap with the period in which the applicant was detained there (see Iamandi\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no. 25867/03, \u00a7\u00a7 56-62, 1 June 2010 and Bragadireanu v. , no. 22088/04, \u00a7\u00a7 92-98, 6 December 2007). In both judgments, the Court concluded that the applicants had been held in overcrowded cells, providing them with less than three square metres of personal space, and that they had been deprived of the possibility of maintaining adequate bodily hygiene in prison. In the light of the information submitted by the Government in the instant case in respect of the arrangements for showers, and in the light of its findings in the Iamandi and Bragadireanu cases cited above, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant was also deprived of the possibility of maintaining adequate bodily hygiene.",
