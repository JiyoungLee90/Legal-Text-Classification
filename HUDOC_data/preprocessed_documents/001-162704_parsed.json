Latvia, no.\u00a058442/00, \u00a7 125, 28 November 2002). Thus, the presumption of innocence will be infringed where the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence (see Telfner v.

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, 31\u00a0March 2016).",

(the) large quantity of pure cocaine (which) cannot be for [the applicants\u2019] personal use\u201d (see paragraph 51 above). This judgment followed the reasoning of the Skopje Court of Appeal in its judgment of 18\u00a0April 2008 (see paragraph 49 above).

In such circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the act constituted a criminal offence at the time when it was committed.",
