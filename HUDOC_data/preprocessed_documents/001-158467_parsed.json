Poland (dec.), no. 2912/11, 18 September 2012). In the present case the gist of the Government\u2019s arguments does not actually concern \u201cuntrue facts\u201d allegedly adduced by the applicant before the Court. The Court notes that the applicant did not, indeed, inform the Court about his criminal conviction, even though it related to the same events which constitute a basis for the civil proceedings complained of. It follows that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction does not constitute a part of the present application and as such, cannot be regarded as \u201cconcerning the very core of the case\u201d.",

The second-instance court, however, having examined what was said during the press conference and assessed the applicant\u2019s allegations in the light of statements he made earlier at the same conference, considered that the statements made at the press conference had also infringed the plaintiffs\u2019 personal rights (see\u00a0paragraphs 22 and 23 above).",

In this respect the Court notes that the domestic courts examined the circumstances of the case and found that the applicant had failed to prove the veracity of his assertions either at the time of their publication or thereafter, in the course of the civil proceedings. Moreover, he was not table to provide any evidence in support of his statements (see paragraph 18 above).",

The Court admit that publication of apologies on a TV channel must have entailed considerable costs for the applicant (see paragraph 48 above). It notes however that the domestic courts directed that the apologies should be published in the same mass media in which the defamatory statements had been made by the applicant (see paragraph 24 above) and that the Regional Court dismissed a further request from the plaintiffs that the apologies be published in several other press titles (see paragraph 17 above). It follows that the publication order corresponded to the scope of the publication of the defamatory statements and that the burden imposed on the applicant was mitigated by the second instance court. The Court considers therefore that the manner of publication of the apologies did not exceed the margin of discretion accorded to the domestic courts.",
