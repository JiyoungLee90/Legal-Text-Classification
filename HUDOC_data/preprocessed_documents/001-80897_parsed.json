They submitted that it had been foreseeable that such authorisation would be denied in the applicant party\u2019s case on the basis of those provisions since, although they expressly provided only for \u201crevocation\u201d of the authorisation, they were to be construed as giving the CCFP \u2013 whose discretion was limited \u2013 the possibility of refusing authorisation, even if that entailed granting and subsequently revoking it. Furthermore, it was not disputed that the applicant party had not satisfied the requirements of section 11-4 of the Act of 11 March 1988 and had received donations from a foreign legal entity. Lastly, there was settled case-law to the effect that it was possible to cite the grounds for revoking a permit or authorisation as a basis for refusing to grant such a permit or authorisation, seeing that the result was the same (the Government referred to the Aldana Barrena judgment of 8\u00a0January 1982 of the Conseil d\u2019Etat, from which it appeared that the grounds for revoking refugee status were also capable of justifying a refusal to grant such status).",

They added that, in compensation for the prohibition on certain sources of funding, sections 8 and 9 of the Act of 11 March 1988 afforded national political parties access to State funding, distributed among all parties in accordance with objective and transparent criteria, in proportion to their representation in Parliament or as a lump sum if the donations they had received from individuals reached a certain level. In that way, the law compensated by means of State funding for the acceptance of certain restrictions and contributed to promoting freedom of political expression by providing a balanced and reasonable response to the imperatives of national independence and transparency in political life.",

It emphasised that public funding would be negligible in its case, since such funding depended on results in national elections and, in practice, was distributed among the four main parties at national level. As regards reimbursement of election expenses, this presupposed that the party had funds available in advance, which was not possible without the contribution from the Spanish Basque Nationalist Party. In addition, it argued that there was a contradiction between the prohibition on funding by European parties and the possibility of funding by foreign individuals, given that it was easy to scrutinise funds from the former but not from the latter. In its submission, the prohibition in issue was not based on any \u201cpressing social need\u201d, seeing that it concerned contributions from a party registered in a member State of the European Union, and especially as it contravened the principle of the free movement of capital within the Union.",

It pointed out that national regulations on political parties resulted from history, political tradition and practice and hence differed greatly from one country to another. With regard to funding, approaches ranged from a total lack of regulations (for example, in Switzerland) or non-prohibition of foreign donations (for example, in Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic and Hungary) to an explicit ban on foreign contributions and donations (as in France and the Russian Federation); intermediate solutions included imposing strict limitations (for example, in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova) or providing for exceptions to the rule, to a greater or lesser extent, in the case of funds originating from European Union member States (for example, in Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom \u2013 except Northern Ireland \u2013 and Lithuania). It concluded that each example of the prohibition of financing of political parties from foreign sources had to be considered separately in the light of the political system of the country concerned, its relations with its neighbours, its constitutional law and the general system it had adopted for the financing of political parties.",

As to whether, in particular, it was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for this prohibition to cover funds from foreign political parties, the Venice Commission referred to the principles deriving from the Court\u2019s case-law, as set out in The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 59491/00, \u00a7\u00a7 57-62, 19 January 2006). An analysis of the domestic provisions containing such a prohibition indicated that the reasons varied from one country to another, particularly on account of their specific history and political and constitutional experiences. One such reason related to the internationalist policies of extremist parties between the two World Wars. A second stemmed from similar circumstances during the Cold War and the ensuing polarisation of the world. A third resulted from fear of separatist movements. A fourth concerned the implementation of a system of public funding of parties and the consequent desire for the funds thus allocated to remain within the country. It was more difficult, in the Venice Commission\u2019s opinion, to identify why many States did not impose a prohibition of this kind (for example, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and ). In some countries, the reason was possibly that such a measure had never been thought necessary. Other countries appeared to have adopted this position in order to facilitate politically their own support of political movements in the Third World. A further group seemed reluctant to hinder legitimate cooperation between political parties in the context of the Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, the European Parliament and cooperation organisations such as the Nordic Council.",

It pointed out in particular that Article\u00a0191 of the Treaty of Rome provided that \u201c[p]olitical parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union.\u201d It added in this context that Regulation (EC) no. 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council of 4 November 2003 on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (see paragraph 27 above) afforded such parties the possibility of receiving donations from political parties which were members of them (Article 6), while Article 7 of the Regulation stated that their funding \u201cfrom the general budget of the European Union or from any other source may not be used for the direct or indirect funding of other political parties, and in particular national political parties, which shall continue to be governed by national rules\u201d. The Venice Commission observed that the very existence of the Regulation showed that cooperation and, to some extent, integration of financing systems were necessary for the functioning of political parties both at national level and at the level of the Union. It also referred to Article 56 of the Treaty, which enshrined the principle of the free movement of capital, pointing out that this notion in principle covered all transfers of funds from one  to another, probably including those between political parties. Since this was a fundamental freedom enshrined in the Treaty, the member States were required to respect it. The Venice Commission thus concluded that rules adopted by member States for the funding of political parties had to observe this principle, although the European Union\u2019s powers with regard to political parties were limited to the regulation of \u201cpolitical parties at European level\u201d. The only exceptions permitted in this regard by Community law were those set out in the Treaty itself (for example, in Article 58, which reserved the right of member States \u201cto take measures which are justified on grounds of public policy or public security\u201d) or identified by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.",

It considered, however, that the experience of cooperation between political parties within supranational European organisations and institutions supported a less restrictive approach; such cooperation was itself \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, whereas it was not obvious that the same could be said about the imposition of obstacles to cooperation through the prohibition of all financial relations between political parties established in different countries. Various factors could nevertheless be capable of justifying the prohibition of contributions from foreign political parties: in particular, where contributions were used to pursue unlawful aims (for example, where the foreign party in question advocated discrimination or human rights violations), undermined the fairness or integrity of political competition, destabilised the electoral process, threatened the territorial integrity of the State concerned or hindered its democratic development, or where prohibition formed part of the State\u2019s international obligations. Accordingly, in the Venice Commission\u2019s opinion, to establish whether the prohibition on the financing of political parties by foreign political parties was compatible with the requirements of Article 11 of the Convention, each individual case had to be considered separately in the context of the general legislation applicable in the State concerned on the funding of political parties and of the State\u2019s international obligations \u2013 including, where appropriate, those resulting from membership of the European Union.",

However, this is a somewhat extensive interpretation of that subsection, which is worded: \u201cThe authorisation of any association that has failed to comply with the requirements laid down in sections 11-1 and 11-4 of this Act shall be revoked.\u201d It appears that in reality this provision solely allows ex post facto scrutiny of funding associations that have obtained authorisation. It is therefore permissible to question whether the law, as interpreted by the Conseil d\u2019Etat, was foreseeable in its effect.",

They relied in that connection on the Conseil d\u2019Etat\u2019s Aldana Barrena judgment of 8 January 1982, from which it appeared that the grounds for revoking refugee status were also capable of justifying a refusal to grant such status. In the Court\u2019s view, that judgment is not conclusive in that it simply set aside a decision by the Appeals Board on the ground that it had refused to take into consideration facts occurring after the refusal issued by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons. The Court can, however, see the logic in the Conseil d\u2019Etat\u2019s interpretation of the above-mentioned provisions, given that a strict reading of them would mean granting and subsequently revoking authorisation, since the CCFP \u2013 as the Government submitted \u2013 has limited discretion.

One should also underscore that section 11-4 does not make specific reference to \u201cforeign political parties\u201d, but speaks of a \u201clegal entity\u201d (personne morale), thus leaving some room for the authorities implementing it to consider in individual cases whether the prohibition also applies to foreign parties or groups.",

This interpretation may depend on the circumstances of a particular case or on societal developments at local, national or international level.",

The \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach which had been enunciated by the Conseil d\u2019Etat and adopted by the national courts in the present case, justifying the decision of the National Commission on Election Campaign Accounts and Political Funding, entails a blanket preventive prohibition on the very establishment of a funding association. Such a blanket prohibition, apart from the fact that it imposes an unbearable burden on the party concerned, does not allow any flexibility to an authority or a judge in ruling on financing in a particular case on the basis of wider considerations than the mere fact of the origins of the funding. It would be consonant with the requirements of the Convention if the authorities could rule on the legality of a source of funding, after the establishment of the association, on the basis of various factors, such as the circumstances surrounding the funding (its amount, its use, transparency of the transactions, sphere of activity of both the offering and the receiving entities, etc.). The law itself, providing for repressive measures rather than preventive measures, allows for such supervision to be carried out after the association has been established.",

We should not lose sight of the fact that, while Article 11 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, which provides for limitations to freedom of association, leaves a margin of appreciation to the States Parties to determine certain practicalities of that freedom, in the circumstances of the present case there are two elements which, I believe, have gone beyond a permissible and acceptable margin.",

The second is the total disregarding of the fact that both parties function within the domain of the European Union. This latter element is of primordial importance, and fundamentally changes the parameters of this case in relation to the relevant parameters of other cases, where the financing of a political party by a foreign party takes place in an \u201cunorganised\u201d international environment. In the present case, both the French and the Spanish parties are entities which lawfully work within their respective States, France and Spain, both members of the European Union. Although one may share the reticence of various quarters, including the Council of Europe, when they recommend strict controls on foreign funding of political parties \u2013 which may amount to a total prohibition \u2013 because of the dangers that that may entail for the proper operation of a political party, the situation changes when we are faced with two European Union parties, working within the integrational landscape of the twenty-seven members. Admittedly, even in that context controls and prohibitions may still apply, and section 11-4 of the French Act still has a valid place; however, what seems to me to be unacceptable and to have a direct impact on the extent of the limitations allowed by the second paragraph of Article 11 of the Convention is the total disregard, by those who have applied the national law, of the specificity of the case of two parties working within the context of the European unification process.",
