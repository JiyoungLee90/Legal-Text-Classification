The Bishop of Kitium put some questions to the first witness. Those considered of a political character were ruled inadmissible by the trial judge.

The nature of the ongoing or recent occupation of a particular property is usually the most significant element in the determination of the existence of a \u201chome\u201d in cases before this Court. However, where \u201chome\u201d is claimed in respect of property in which there has never been any, or hardly any, occupation by the applicant or where there has been no occupation for some considerable time, it may be that the links to that property are so attenuated as to cease to raise any, or any separate, issue under Article 8. Furthermore, while an applicant does not necessarily have to be the owner of the \u201chome\u201d for the purposes of Article 8, it may nonetheless be relevant in such cases of claims to \u201chomes\u201d from the past that he or she can make no claim to any legal rights of occupation or that such time has elapsed that there can be no realistic expectation of taking up, or resuming, occupation in the absence of such rights. Nor can the term \u201chome\u201d be interpreted as synonymous with the notion of \u201cfamily roots\u201d, which is a vague and emotive concept (see Demopoulos and Others, Chrysostomi, Lordos and Lordou Anastasiou, Kanari-Eliadou and Others, Sotirou and Moushoutta, Stylas, Charalambou Onofriou and Others and Chrisostomi v. Turkey [GC] (Dec.), nos.\u00a046113/99, 3843/02, 13751/02, 13466/03, 10200/04, 14163/04, 19993/04, 21819/04, \u00a7 135, 1 March 2010).",

For almost his entire life, the applicant has been living elsewhere. The fact that he might inherit a share in the title of that property in the future is a hypothetical and speculative element, not a concrete tie in existence at this moment in time.

The Court therefore concluded that when, as in the Foka case, an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern , it should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention. It does not see any reason to depart, in the instant case, from that finding, which is not in any way inconsistent with the view adopted by the international community regarding the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d or the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus remains the sole legitimate government of Cyprus (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 61 and 90).",

Taking part in an unlawful assembly is an offence under section 71 of the Cypriot Criminal Code and is punishable by up to one year's imprisonment (see paragraph 29 above).

The Court further notes that according to Chapter 155, section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a police officer may, without warrant, arrest any person who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment or who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty (see paragraph 32 above \u2013 see also Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou, Commission's report, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0147).",

Moreover, during the court hearing on the following day, an interpreter was present and the applicant had an opportunity to explain why he was taking part in the demonstration and in what capacity. Another interrogation took place in Ortakeuy Prison after the hearing (see paragraph\u00a014 above).

In the Court's view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators (see Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 110).",
