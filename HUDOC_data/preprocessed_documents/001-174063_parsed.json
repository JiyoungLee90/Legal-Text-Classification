That examination, however, had not been thorough, as no endoscopy of the urinary bladder was performed. The treatment prescribed had been inadequate. Secondly, the doctor noted that the urinary inflammation developed by the applicant showed up shortcomings in the medical care, such as delays in changing the catheter. Lastly, the doctor also noted the lack of adequate post-operative care in December 2010 and the applicant\u2019s belated admission to the Urology Institute, which followed a massive blood loss.",
