Having regard to the facts of the cases, the submissions of the parties, and its findings under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the Court considers that it has examined the main legal questions raised in the present applications with regard to Article 5 of the Convention. It thus considers that the applicants\u2019 complaints are admissible but that there is no need to give a separate ruling on the complaints under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v.
