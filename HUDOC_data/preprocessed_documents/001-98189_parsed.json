The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0296-A, and Remli v. France, 23\u00a0April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports 1996-II). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. To hold otherwise would mean to duplicate the domestic process with proceedings before the Court, which would be hardly compatible with the subsidiary character of the Convention (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 42, 6 November 2008). Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires only that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004, and John Sammut and Visa Investments Limited v.

Article 6 \u00a7 2, in its relevant aspect, is aimed at preventing the undermining of a fair criminal trial by prejudicial statements made in close connection with those proceedings (see Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7 93, 23 October 2008, and Matija\u0161evi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 23037/04, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2006X).

Switzerland, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 41; Daktaras v.

The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 41; B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002; and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. Slovakia, no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89, 27\u00a0February 2007). It has also asserted the importance of respect for the presumption of innocence during press conferences by State officials (see Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-52; Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7 122, 28\u00a0November 2002; and Y.B. and Others v. Turkey, nos. 48173/99 and 48319/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049\u00a051, 28 October 2004). Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Adolf v. , 26\u00a0March 1982, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41, Series A no. 49). In any event, the opinions expressed cannot amount to declarations by a public official of the applicant's guilt which would encourage the public to believe him or her guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 53).",

As to the domestic proceedings concerning the decisions on ordering and extending the applicant' detention, the Court agrees that, as they were essentially aimed at remedying some of the violations of the Convention alleged before the Court, these domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v.\u00a0Italy (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 284, ECHR 2006-V). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR 5,600 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the national authorities. As to the Convention proceedings, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was represented by counsel, the sum of EUR 4,300, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on these amounts.",
