The applicant\u2019s submissions could not serve as the basis for his removal from the blacklist, since a person could not choose his country of residence under either domestic or international law. States were not obliged to respect couples\u2019 choices concerning their country of residence. Nor were there any reasons detected why the applicant\u2019s family could not join the applicant in India and enjoy their family life there. The Minister concluded that the restrictions on the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life were justified in the interests of public order and safety and were proportionate. As regards the procedure for appeal, a reference was made to section 76, paragraph 2 and section 188, paragraph 2 of the Administrative Procedure Law which provided for an appeal to the administrative court.",

It further considered that the contested decision complied with the rule of law, and that it was taken in the interests of national security, public order and safety and for protection of the rights of others, namely the spouse and children. It was proportionate because the protection of the interests of society in assuring national security and public order and safety in the State outweighed the individual interests of the applicant.

In this relation the Court observes that on 7\u00a0June\u00a02005 the applicant was detained for a period of ten days, thus the maximum period for which an official of the State Border Guard Control could detain an alien without a judicial decision, irrespective of the grounds on which the detention had been ordered. The Court emphasises that where detention is ordered by an administrative authority for a period of several days, Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 requires an opportunity to challenge it before a judicial authority (see, mutatis mutandis, Shamsa v. Poland, nos. 45355/99 and 45357/99, \u00a7 59, 27\u00a0November 2003, and \u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02002I.

The Court has already found that decisions adopted by the prosecutor could not be qualified as a decision taken by a \u201ccourt\u201d within the meaning of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 (see \u010calovskis, cited above, \u00a7 222). Moreover, the Court notes that at the time the prosecutor carried out their review, the proceedings leading to the applicant\u2019s inclusion in the blacklist had not yet been terminated. It was only on 13\u00a0June 2005 that the Minister of Interior adopted a decision on the applicant\u2019s request for his inclusion in the blacklist to be re-examined, and that the above-mentioned decision was still amenable to judicial review (see paragraph 23 above). The Court notes that the prosecutor\u2019s decision adopted on 14\u00a0June\u00a02005 did not even mention the ongoing proceedings against the applicant\u2019s inclusion in the blacklist (see paragraph\u00a031 above), and the possible implications the proceedings could have on the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the applicant\u2019s detention. In the light of the above, the Court cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s review complied with the requirements of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04.",

Its competence was limited to the question of whether the applicant\u2019s detention after the expiry of the ten-day period should be granted. The re-evaluation of the detention order adopted by the official of the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs was not amenable to judicial review.",

It is true that in the light of the individual complaint mechanism before the Constitutional Court the applicant could claim that by failing to provide for a judicial review, section 47, paragraph 1, part 2 of the Immigration Law was not compatible with the Constitution. However, even if the Constitutional Court had ruled in the applicant\u2019s favour, there is nothing to show that in the course of constitutional proceedings the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty would be examined speedily and, where appropriate, that his release would be ordered (see, for an identical conclusion, \u010calovskis v. Latvia, no. 22205/13, \u00a7 224, 24\u00a0July 2014, and Taraneks v. Latvia, no. 3082/06, \u00a7 107, 2\u00a0December 2014). In the light of the above, the Court finds that the remedies referred to by the Government did not provide the applicant an opportunity to challenge effectively the lawfulness of his detention. Accordingly, it dismisses the Government\u2019s objection in relation to nonexhaustion of domestic remedies.",
