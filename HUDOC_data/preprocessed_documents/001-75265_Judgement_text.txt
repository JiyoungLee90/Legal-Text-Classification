The case originated in an application (no. 41511/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Ljubinko Radivojević (“the applicant”), on 4 November 2002.
The applicant was represented by the Verstovšek lawyers. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts to which he was a party was excessive. In substance, he also complained about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings (Article 13 of the Convention).
On 15 September 2004 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Velenje.
On 15 February 1996 the applicant was injured at work. The applicant’s employer had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZA.
On 13 October 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZA in the  (Okrajno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 1,512,973 Slovenian tolars (approximately 6,310 euros) for the injuries sustained.
