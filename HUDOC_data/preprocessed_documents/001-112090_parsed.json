However, the Court is not satisfied that the reading out of the documents at the final hearing together with other evidence was sufficient to satisfy this requirement.

In particular, \u201cas a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses\u201d (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, pp. 32-33, \u00a7 33, Series\u00a0A no. 235B). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v.

The Court further notes that the applicant asked the trial court to hear these witnesses to confirm his alleged detention in the period between January and mid-February 2006. However, charges against the applicant concerned the period between 10 August 2005 and 13 December 2005 and also 24 April 2006, in view of which the Court can accept the national court\u2019s opinion as to the probative value of these witnesses for the establishment of the truth in this case.
