After his release the applicant was found to have sustained bodily injuries, which were confirmed by medical evidence \u2013 in particular a contused wound in the parietal area of the head (which caused him to suffer a health disorder for a period of up to twenty-one days), a bruise and abrasion in the area of the right eye, and multiple bruises and abrasions on his upper limbs \u2013 all of which could have been caused, according to the forensic medical expert, at the time of his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 16 above). The circumstances of the case, including witness statements (see paragraph 14 above), indicate that he did not have those injuries before his arrest. The Court considers that the injuries are consistent with the applicant\u2019s allegations of being beaten inter alia, repeatedly on the head with a rubber truncheon.",

The Court reiterates that it has dealt with many applications against Russia concerning illtreatment in police custody that have exposed a systemic problem of delay in documenting the arrest and the status of individuals detained as suspects, during which time those detainees were interviewed without access to a lawyer, were denied other rights due to them as suspects, and fell victim to police abuse (see Olisov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a010825/09 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 78-79, 2 May 2017).",

The explanation that it offered \u2013 that the applicant\u2019s multiple injuries could have been caused by his accidentally hitting a safe after breaking away from the police officer who had grabbed his hand \u2013 is not convincing and is not supported by the forensic medical expert opinion or any other evidence, except for statements by the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated him.",

Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7 129, 24 July 2014).

It is incumbent on the authorities to institute criminal proceedings and to conduct a proper criminal investigation in which the whole range of investigative measures may be carried out, including the questioning of witnesses, confrontations and identification parades (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 132-137).",
