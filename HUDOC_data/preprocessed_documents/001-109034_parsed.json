In the celebrities\u2019 tent the TV star X (... years old, whose real name is ...) came out of the gents tapping his nose and attracting the attention of police officers. They searched the star actor from the TV series Y (of which, by June, there had been more than 60 episodes in five years). COCAINE! X had a packet on him containing 0.23 grams of coke, and was arrested. Public prosecutor W. from  told the Bild: \u201cHe was making suspicious movements with his hand, tapping his nose with his fingers. This of course attracted the attention of our officers. An investigation is under way. Only a small quantity of cocaine is involved though. W. : \u201cRight in the middle of the festival grounds (Wiesn) \u2013 it might have been snuff tobacco, but our men have a flair for this sort of thing...\u201d. X had already had a run-in with the law for possession of drugs. In July 2000 the Superintendent from the TV series had been given a five-month suspended prison sentence and two years\u2019 probation and fined EUR 5,000. He was accused of illegally importing drugs. On a trip to Brazil X had arranged for four grams of cocaine to be sent to his address in . His probation period ended two years ago. The quantity of the drug found in the tent ... is negligible. What can the actor expect? According to a legal expert questioned by Bild: \u201cEven if the probation period is over the previous conviction is recent. X may get an unsuspended prison sentence \u2013 up to six months\u201d. Why prison? \u201cX has apparently not been sufficiently daunted by the suspended prison sentence\u201d. The actor has probably had to submit to a forensic head hair examination. Each centimetre of hair will enable the expert to determine whether and how much cocaine was taken. Yesterday X refused to comment. P.S: \u201cIn every toilet cubicle in the tent ... there are signs saying: \u201cThe use of drugs is liable to prosecution!\u201d",

Any interference with a criminal\u2019s private sphere was limited, however, by the proportionality principle, which involved a balancing exercise between the competing interests. The court held that in the present case the right to protection of X\u2019s personality rights prevailed over the public\u2019s interest in being informed, even if the truth of the facts related by the daily had not been disputed.

The type of offence involved was of medium, or even minor, seriousness, was a very common one and there was no particular public interest in knowing about it. The court added that, unlike serious crimes (such as spectacular robberies, or murders), there were no particular circumstances distinguishing the offence in question from ordinary crimes, even if there was an assumption that drug abuse was more widespread amongst key figures from the arts world and the media than in other circles. Furthermore, the way in which the report had been made by the applicant company confirmed that the offence itself was not an important one. The report had focussed more on X\u2019s person than on the offence, which would probably never have been reported in the press if it had been committed by a person unknown to the public.

The actor merely donned the persona of a superintendent, just as he could don that of any other character, without thereby adopting the conduct of the character in question in his daily life. The fact that an actor did not adopt the lifestyle of the character he played could not in any way be regarded as an extraordinary event worthy of being reported.

It was clear that the actor X could not be identified with the fictitious character of Superintendent Y that he played. The fact that X had his fan clubs and had made public appearances as the actor who played the part of Superintendent Y did not alter that finding. It could well be that X\u2019s appearance, his manner of presenting himself, and the relaxed attitude portrayed in his films appealed to others, particularly a young audience.

Vi ZR 286/04) the Federal Court of Justice reiterated its established case-law according to which the decisive criteria for evaluating the lawfulness of a news report mentioning the name of the person concerned were the nature of the offence and the person of the suspect. The facts of the case were a fine and a prohibition on driving imposed by the French courts for speeding on a motorway (211 instead of 130 km per hour) on a person known to the public. The Federal Court of Justice found, firstly, that the speed limit had been exceeded to such an extent that it could be regarded as an expression of extreme contempt for the highway regulations, and, secondly, that the offence had put other motorists at considerable risk. Moreover, both the manner in which the person concerned had behaved in public in the past and his origins and the fact that he was the husband of a very well-known individual meant that the interest of the press in publishing a news report prevailed over the right to protection of the personality rights of the person concerned. The Federal Court of Justice pointed out that the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Von Hannover v.  of 24 June 2004 (no.\u00a059320/00, ECHR 2004VI) allowed of no other conclusion. The articles (and photos) in that case had concerned only scenes from Caroline von Hannover\u2019s daily life, and had aimed merely to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership regarding her private life.",

That margin depended on the nature of the activities in question and the aim pursued by the restrictions. In its recent case-law, the Court had moreover left the State a broad margin of appreciation in cases concerning Article 8 of the Convention. (Armonien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 36919/02, \u00a7 38, 25 November 2008, and A. v. , no.\u00a028070/06, \u00a7 66, 9\u00a0April 2009). Generally speaking, the margin enjoyed by the States was broader where there was no European consensus. In the Government\u2019s submission, whilst there was admittedly a trend towards harmonisation of the legal systems in Europe, differences nevertheless remained, as evidenced by the failure of the negotiations for the adoption of a regulation of the European Union on conflict-of-law rules regarding non-contractual obligations (Regulation EC No. 864/2007 of 11 July 2007 \u2013 Rome II Regulation). The margin of appreciation was also broad where the national authorities had to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights (Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2007I, and Dickson v. the  [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 78 ECHR 2007XIII).

It was precisely for that reason that one result alone of the balancing exercise of the competing interests was insufficient, and that there should be a \u201ccorridor\u201d of solutions within the confines of which the national courts should be allowed to give decisions in conformity with the Convention. Failing that, the Court would have to take the decision on every case itself, which could hardly be its role.",

That conclusion was confirmed, moreover, by Article\u00a053 of the Convention: where the relationship between State and citizen was concerned, a gain of freedom for the individual concerned involved only a loss of competence for the State, whereas in the relationship between two citizens the fact of attaching more weight to the right of one of the persons concerned restricted the right of the others, which was forbidden under Article 53 of the Convention.",

The definition of what constitutes a subject of general interest will depend on the circumstances of the case. The Court nevertheless considers it useful to point out that it has recognised the existence of such an interest not only where the publication concerned political issues or crimes (see White v. , no. 42435/02, \u00a7 29, 19\u00a0September 2006; Egeland and Hanseid, cited above, \u00a7 58; and Leempoel &\u00a0S.A.

The actor\u2019s popularity was mainly due to that television series, of which, when the first article appeared, 103 episodes had been broadcast, the last 54 of which had starred X in the role of Superintendent Y. Accordingly, he was not, as the Regional Court appeared to suggest, a minor actor whose renown, despite a large number of appearances in films (more than 200 \u2013 see paragraph 22 above), remained limited. It should also be noted in that connection that the Court of Appeal referred not only to the existence of X\u2019s fan clubs, but also to the fact that his admirers could have been encouraged to imitate him by taking drugs, if the offence had not been committed out of public view (see paragraph 32 above).",

In the case of X, that role was, moreover, that of a police superintendent, whose mission was law enforcement and crime prevention. That fact was such as to increase the public\u2019s interest in being informed of X\u2019s arrest for a criminal offence.

In that context, it should also be pointed out that all the information revealed by the applicant company on the day on which the first article appeared was confirmed by the prosecutor W. to other magazines and to television channels. Likewise, when the second article appeared, the facts leading to X\u2019s conviction were already known to the public (see, mutatis mutandis, Aleksey Ovchinnikov v. Russia, no. 24061/04, \u00a7 49, 16 December 2010). Moreover, the Court of Appeal itself considered that the applicant company\u2019s liability did not extend beyond minor negligence given that the information disclosed by the public prosecutor\u2019s office had led it to believe that the report was lawful (see paragraph 35 above). In the Court\u2019s view, it has not therefore been shown that the applicant company acted in bad faith when publishing the articles in question.",

I also agree with the Grand Chamber that the sanctions were provided for by law and pursued a legitimate end, namely, respect for the rights of others, in this case the right to privacy (including the right to respect for one\u2019s reputation) as recognised in Article 8 of the Convention. I also agree with the Grand Chamber\u2019s assertion (see paragraph 76 of the judgment) that the Court\u2019s task was to determine whether those sanctions were necessary in a democratic society pursuant to the terms of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Also, as indicated in subsequent paragraphs of the Grand Chamber judgment, in order to answer this question this Court had to decide whether the domestic courts had adequately weighed the conflicting rights and interests, namely, the right to freedom of expression versus the right to privacy.",

According to our consolidated case-law as cited in this judgment (see Petrenco v. Moldova, no. 20928/05, \u00a7 54, 30\u00a0March\u00a02010; Petrov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 27103/04, 2 November 2010; and Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no. 34147/06, \u00a7 40, 21\u00a0September 2010), it is not the task of this Court to assume the role of the competent national courts in determining the merits of the case, but rather to review the decisions those courts render in the exercise of their powers of appreciation. Concerning compliance with Article 10 of the Convention, the domestic courts have a certain margin of appreciation (see Von Hannover v.\u00a0Germany, no. 59320/00, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2004VI, and Lappalainen v.\u00a0Finland (dec.), no. 22175/06, 20 January 2009) although, as the Grand Chamber underscores in the present judgment (see paragraph 86) their decisions are subject to the scrutiny of this Court. In that regard, this Court has established a series of criteria which must be followed when assessing how the domestic courts have balanced conflicting rights, including, inter alia, the published information\u2019s contribution to a debate of general interest, the previous behavior and degree of notoriety of the person affected, the content and veracity of the information, and the nature of the sanctions and penalties imposed. In balancing the conflicting rights in the cases brought before them, national authorities (in this case, the national courts) must apply these criteria in reaching their decision, whilst appraising, with the benefit of direct examination, the facts and circumstances of the case when applying their domestic law.",

Where these prerequisites have been met, that is, the domestic courts have expressly weighed the conflicting rights and interests and applied the pertinent criteria established in our above-cited case-law, an additional assessment of the competing interests by this Court, examining anew the facts and circumstances of the case, is tantamount to acting as a fourth instance (or, as now, a fifth instance).",

Concerning each of the published articles, on two consecutive occasions those courts assessed the competing interests derived from freedom of expression and the safeguard of privacy. In extensive reasoning they explained their final judgments and their reasons for giving more weight to the protection of the right to privacy and reputation. These judgments exhaustively examined the different aspects and circumstances of the question, including the relevance of the matter for the public interest, the degree of notoriety of the person affected, the nature of the crime of which he was suspected and subsequently accused and sentenced, and the severity of the sanction imposed on the applicant company. Furthermore \u2013 albeit indirectly \u2013 the domestic Court of Appeal consciously applied our Court\u2019s criteria by using as a point of reference the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 15\u00a0November\u00a02005, a judgment which expressly cited and applied the criteria established in our Von Hannover v. Germany judgment of 24\u00a0June\u00a02004.",

The domestic courts did not fail to balance the conflicting interests or to apply the relevant criteria in doing so. They made no manifest error of appreciation; nor did they fail to consider all the relevant factors. Nevertheless, on this occasion and instead of concentrating its assessment on whether the domestic courts applied the above-mentioned criteria effectively, the Grand Chamber has chosen to re-examine the same facts that were brought before the national courts. And this was done in spite of the national courts having extensively assessed the circumstances of the case in a way that was not manifestly unreasonable, and with the added benefit of their direct examination of the context in which the events occurred. Analysing the same facts and using the same criteria and same balancing approach as the domestic courts, the Grand Chamber came to a different conclusion, giving more weight to the protection of the right to freedom of expression than to the protection of the right to privacy. But that is precisely what the case-law of this Court has established is not our task, that is, to set ourselves up as a fourth instance to repeat anew assessments duly performed by the domestic courts.",
