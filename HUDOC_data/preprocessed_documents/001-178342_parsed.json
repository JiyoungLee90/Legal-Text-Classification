The Court discerns nothing in the parties\u2019 submissions to suggest that the applicant was aware, or should have become aware, of the futility of such a course of action.

It reiterates that the word \u201cdomicile\u201d in the French version of Article 8 has a broader connotation than the word \u201chome\u201d and may extend, for example, to a professional person\u2019s office (see Buck v. Germany, no.\u00a041604/98, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2005IV, with further references). It has also found on many occasions that a person\u2019s private life may be\u00a0concerned in measures effected outside a person\u2019s home or private premises (see Uzun v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a035623/05, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2010 (extracts), with further references). Thus, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, telephone calls from business premises, including a Sate official\u2019s office, are covered by the notions of \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d for the purposes of Article 8 \u00a7 1 (see Halford v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7 44, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III). E-mails and communications exchanged via an instant messaging account sent from work are similarly protected under Article 8, as is information derived from the monitoring of personal Internet usage (see Copland v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 62617/00, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2007I, and B\u0103rbulescu v.

Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037-40, 26 July 2007) and that covert filming of a person on police premises was also an interference with private life (see Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, \u00a7\u00a7 3643, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)).",

It has however also noted that a person\u2019s reasonable expectations as to privacy, although a significant factor, was not necessarily a conclusive one. Private-life considerations as a rule arose once any systematic or permanent record had come into existence, even if such an audio or video recording had been made while the person was in a public place (see Uzun, cited above, \u00a7 44, with further references).",

It is also significant that the applicant was filmed and the recordings were stored, examined by third parties without the applicant\u2019s knowledge or consent, and used as evidence in the criminal proceedings.

Foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of surveillance, such as the interception of communications, cannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on interception of telephone conversations, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated. The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (see Malone, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067; Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 116; Huvig v.\u00a0France, 24\u00a0April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 176\u2011B; Valenzuela Contreras v.

However, this margin is subject to European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it. In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance set up to protect national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there are adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. The assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the \u2018interference\u2019 to what is \u2018necessary in a democratic society\u2019 (see Klass and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 50 and 59; Weber and Saravia, cited above, \u00a7 106; Kvasnica v.

The Court has found, in particular, that it is not its role to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law \u2013 were admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see Bykov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 90).",
