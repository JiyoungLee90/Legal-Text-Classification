The Court considers that tax matters still form part of the hard core of public-authority prerogatives, with the public nature of the relationship between the taxpayer and the community remaining predominant. Bearing in mind that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as a whole, the Court also observes that Article 1 of Protocol \nNo. 1, which concerns the protection of property, reserves the right of States to enact such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose of securing the payment of taxes (see, mutatis mutandis, Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 February 1995, Series A \nno. 306-B, pp. 48-49, \u00a7 60).

In the same way as the Court has established an obligation in respect of penalties not to proceed to enforcement before the individual has had the possibility of having the lawfulness reviewed, that aspect seems to me to be also valid in respect of tax proceedings. If the procedure in tax cases in some Contracting States does not provide for a stay of proceedings where the individual disputes his obligation to pay or does not at least give him the possibility of requesting a stay of execution before paying sometimes considerable amounts, the lawfulness of which is disputed, the State is using the predominant position conferred on it by its sovereign prerogatives in a manner which might be deemed excessive.

However, as long as a dividing line between \u201ccivil\u201d and \u201cnon-civil\u201d rights and obligations is maintained in respect of proceedings between individuals and governments, it is important to ensure that the relevant criteria for determining what is \u201ccivil\u201d are applied in a logical and reasonable manner \u2013 and that may make it necessary from time to time to adjust the case-law in order to make it consistent in the light of recent developments.",

Thus in Editions P\u00e9riscope, cited above, the Court noted that the subject matter of the action was \u201cpecuniary\u201d in nature and founded on an infringement of rights which were likewise pecuniary rights. The Court found that the right in question \u201cwas therefore a \u2018civil right\u2019, notwithstanding the origin of the dispute ...\u201d. The pecuniary aspect has been stressed in many other judgments \u2013 even in situations where the background of the dispute was clearly fiscal. Thus, in National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports 1997-VII), the Court held proceedings to attain restitution of monies paid under invalidated tax provisions to be \u201ccivil\u201d with reference to the pecuniary aspect and added: \u201cThis conclusion is not affected by the fact that the rights asserted in those proceedings had their background in tax legislation and the obligation of the applicant societies to account for tax under that legislation\u201d (p. 2379, \u00a7 97).",

France [GC], no. 28541/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR \n1999-VIII).

In the later judgments the Court has not \u2013 at least not expressly \u2013 relied on that general criterion: in Pierre-Bloch the Court simply said that the right to stand for election was \u201ca political one and not a \u2018civil\u2019 one\u201d and that it was not in itself decisive that the proceedings also had an economic aspect for the applicant as that aspect formed part of the arrangements for the exercise of the right in question. In Pellegrin the Court realised that the \u201ceconomic\u201d criterion applied so far had proved not to be suitable to determine the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to disputes between States and their servants. However, the Court did not rely on another general-purpose criterion, but adopted a specific one in such cases. In Maaouia the Court\u2019s majority did not apply the criterion established in Schouten and Meldrum either, but held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was inapplicable on the basis of an interpretation of the intentions behind \nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 7.",

Thus it is difficult to see why, for example, the obligation to hand over property for public use in return for compensation is not a \u201cnormal civic duty\u201d whereas the obligation to tolerate tax-based reductions of the compensation is. How can it be explained that the right to obtain tax concessions and preferential postal charges is not \u201ccivil\u201d, but that a claim for compensation for alleged failure to grant such concessions is? Or how can it be explained that an obligation to pay contributions under a social security scheme is \u201ccivil\u201d, but an obligation to pay income tax is not?

Nor does such a finding restrict the States\u2019 freedom to enforce any such laws as they deem necessary in order to secure the payment of taxes (see Article 1 of Protocol No. 1). Article 6 of the Convention is a procedural guarantee that grants primarily the right of access to a court and the right to have court proceedings determined fairly within a reasonable time. In that respect there have in fact been important developments in the field of taxation since the drafting of the Convention. Whereas at that time it was doubtful in some legal systems to what extent administrative decisions in fiscal matters could be reviewed by a court \u2013 if at all \u2013 it is now recognised, at least in the vast majority of the Contracting Parties, that disputes in fiscal matters can be decided in ordinary proceedings by a court or a tribunal. It is therefore difficult to see why it is still necessary to grant the States a special prerogative under the Convention in this field and thus deny litigants in tax proceedings the elementary procedural guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1. As demonstrated, inter alia, in the concurring opinion of Judge Ress, there is a clear need to grant such protection \u2013 not least against lengthy proceedings combined with an obligation to pay taxes before a dispute concerning the legality of the tax decision is finally settled. In my opinion there is no basis in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the assumption that the intention was to grant States the right to deny individuals any procedural protection in disputes on tax matters. How might it be justifiable to exempt from the Court\u2019s scrutiny the procedural rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 in respect of a dispute whose substance is directly linked to a civil right (in this case the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions)? Such an interpretation would also be contrary to the constantly developing case-law of the Court according to which substantive Articles of the Convention, such as Articles 2, 3 and 8, must be interpreted as also implying procedural obligations on States.",

Since Bendenoun v. France (judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284), the Court has consistently considered proceedings relating to tax disputes to be \u201ccriminal\u201d if tax fines, surcharges, etc., with a deterrent and punitive purpose are imposed or even if there is a risk that they may be imposed (see, most recently, J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III). The result is no different if the proceedings also concern the tax assessment as such (see the admissibility decision of 16 May 2000 in Georgiou v. the United Kingdom, no. 40042/98, unreported). This implies that the level of protection under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention varies depending on how the legal framework for tax proceedings is organised in the different legal systems; and even within one legal system it may be purely a matter of coincidence whether penalty proceedings and tax assessment proceedings are joined or not. An interpretation of the Convention that leads to such random results is far from satisfactory.",
