Furthermore, \u201cthe fact that the State sold a large part of its share in the company it owned to a private person could not release the State from its obligation to honour a judgment debt which had arisen before the shares were sold. If the State transfers such an obligation to a new owner of the shares ... the State must ensure that the new owner complies with the requirements, inherent in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01, that a final, binding judicial decision does not remain inoperative to the detriment of a party\u201d (see Solovyev v.

In other words, the State is directly liable for the debts of State-controlled companies even after their privatisation, on condition that the court decision at issue became final when the company operated as a State-controlled entity (see Marinkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039). The State is directly liable for the debts of State-controlled companies, even if the company was operating as a private entity when the non-enforced court decision became final if the privatisation at issue had subsequently been annulled (ibid).",
