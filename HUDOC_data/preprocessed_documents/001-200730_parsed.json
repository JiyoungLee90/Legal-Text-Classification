Some of the armed men had been wearing uniforms with the FSB insignia. One of them, who had introduced himself as the head of the FSB group, had ordered the ambulance crew to take the injured man, Mr Valibagandov, to Izberbash hospital. The ambulance crew had then taken Mr Valibagandov out of a white minibus and placed him in the ambulance. He had been handcuffed, wearing only underwear and had had a number of bruises and injuries on his arms and hips. The white minibus had escorted the ambulance to the hospital, where around fifteen to twenty police officers had already been waiting. Mr\u00a0Valibagandov had been taken to the operating room, where an old man had approached him and had started speaking in a language Ms Sh.G. could not understand. That man had remained in the operating room.

On their way to the ambulance headquarters the white minibus which had escorted them to the hospital had overtaken them. When the ambulance had been passing the place of the incident, the ambulance crew had seen four to five vehicles there, along with the white minibus and people in civilian clothing and camouflage uniforms.",
