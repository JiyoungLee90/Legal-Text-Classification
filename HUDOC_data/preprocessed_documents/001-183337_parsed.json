As it is clear from the facts of the case the applicant had recourse to civil proceedings for claiming pecuniary damages for the use of its property, and its claims were upheld in full for the period for which they were requested (see paragraph 10 above). In the absence of any explanation by the applicant, the Court cannot speculate about the reasons why the applicant had not used this recourse before, or why the claim was limited in time. The Court therefore rejects the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage. However, the Court accepts that the applicant has sustained some non-pecuniary loss arising from the breaches of the Convention found in this case which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation alone. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
