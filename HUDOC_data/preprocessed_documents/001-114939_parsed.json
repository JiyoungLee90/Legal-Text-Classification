The SSB\u2019s decision to reopen the proceedings concerning the relevant benefit was based on section\u00a0114(1) (see paragraphs\u00a034 and\u00a038 above). While it is true that the Ombudsman\u2019s application was successful (see paragraph\u00a034 above), this does not of itself indicate that a hypothetical complaint lodged by the applicant would have had a similar effect. Moreover, it should be noted that the Ombudsman\u2019s challenge was examined nearly ten years after the events complained of in the present case. In reality, the Government\u2019s objection is based on a theoretical and retrospective, and therefore highly speculative, comparison between the applicant\u2019s situation at the material time and recent developments in the \u2019s caselaw.",

It requires that where an issue pertaining to the general interest is at stake, especially when it affects fundamental human rights, including property rights, the public authorities must act promptly and in an appropriate and above all consistent manner (see Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7\u00a0120, ECHR\u00a02000I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a0128, ECHR 2004XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a021151/04, \u00a7\u00a072, 8\u00a0April 2008; and Rysovskyy v.\u00a0, no.\u00a029979/04, \u00a7\u00a071, 20\u00a0October 2011). It is desirable that public authorities act with the utmost care, in particular when dealing with matters of vital importance to individuals, such as welfare benefits and other such rights. In the present case, the Court considers that having discovered their mistake, the authorities failed in their duty to act speedily and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Moskal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072). The initial decision to grant the applicant an earlyretirement pension appears to have been taken lightly and without appropriate checks having been first undertaken.",

Moreover, the Court is aware of the potential risk that, in view of her age and the economic reality in the country, particularly in the undeveloped Podkarpacki region, the applicant might have considerable difficulty in securing new employment. Indeed it had been impossible for the applicant to find any employment since 2002 (see paragraph 19 above).",
