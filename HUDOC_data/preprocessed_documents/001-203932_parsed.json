The applicant, a journalist and a member of the regional legislature, was a defendant in each set of proceedings; the applicant company, the publisher of the newspaper, was involved in one of them. The first-instance court held the first set of defamation proceedings in camera, at the Governor\u2019s request. The domestic courts made sizeable awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage, referring in their reasoning to the Governor\u2019s social standing. In addition, criminal proceedings for libel were brought against the applicant in connection with the statements that had been found defamatory in the second set of civil proceedings.",

In view of the fact that its only shareholders (Mr Timakov and Mr Leonov) together expressed their interest in continuing the proceedings before the Court in the applicant company\u2019s stead (see paragraph 17 above), there is virtually no risk of any differences of opinion arising among shareholders or between shareholders and the applicant company\u2019s board of directors as to whether an infringement of Convention rights actually occurred or to the most appropriate way of reacting to such an infringement (compare S.C.\u00a0Fiercolect Impex S.R.L. v.\u00a0Romania, no. 26429/07, \u00a7 39, 13 December 2016, and Euromak Metal Doo v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 68039/14, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, 14 June 2018).

They did not seek to balance the interests of Mr D. in protecting his reputation against the interests of the public in (i)\u00a0ensuring the transparency and accountability of the Governor\u2019s office or (ii)\u00a0receiving information on matters of public concern. On the contrary, the domestic courts attached preponderant weight to Mr D.\u2019s social status. Their reasoning appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of the honour and dignity of those vested with public powers prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances. The District Court used a nearly identical wording in its judgments of 25\u00a0August 2009 and 22 September 2009 to emphasise the position of the claimant as \u201cthe highest official of the Tula Region\u201d and implied that the functioning of the whole region depended on the Governor\u2019s \u201cmoral authority\u201d (see paragraphs 9 and 24 above).

Neither did the District and Regional Courts seek to establish whether the defendants in the defamation proceedings under consideration had had some factual grounds to claim that Governor D. had been involved in or condoned corrupt practices despite the latter\u2019s requests to admit the relevant documents into evidence (see paragraphs 9 and 24 above). While the Court acknowledges that the distinction between the two concepts may not necessarily appear clear-cut and may on occasion become a point of contention, it reiterates that, in order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment, it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see, with further references, Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126). Reiterating that its task is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but to review the decisions that they made under Article 10 in order to ensure that the latter applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Perin\u00e7ek v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a027510/08, \u00a7 196, ECHR 2015 (extracts), the Court considers that, where a defendant in defamation proceedings alleges that an impugned statement is a value judgment rather than a statement of fact, it is incumbent on domestic courts to pay heed to her or his argument. However, the District and Regional Courts in the two sets of proceedings at hand failed to attempt to consider whether the impugned statements could be regarded as value judgment having a sufficient factual basis despite the defendants\u2019 insistence (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above), which the Court regards as an important omission.",

It is the Court\u2019s consistent case-law regarding defamation proceedings against journalists that the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are further factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference. Furthermore, the Court must be satisfied that the penalty does not amount to a form of censorship intended to discourage the press from expressing criticism. In the context of a debate on a topic of public interest, such a sanction is likely to deter journalists from contributing to the public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community. By the same token, it is liable to hamper the press in performing its task as a purveyor of information and as a public watchdog (see B\u00e9dat v.

The adverse effect that the large award had on the applicant company \u2013 it was forced into dissolution because of its inability to pay off the judgment debt (see paragraph 16 above) \u2013 is even more salient. Yet nothing in the judgments of 25 August and 22 September 2009 (as upheld on 4 February and 18 March 2010, respectively) suggests that the domestic courts took into consideration, however briefly, the financial situation of the defendants or contemplated whether an award would be proportionate in the particular respective circumstances of each case. Instead they yet again attached preponderant weight to the Governor\u2019s social status \u2013 thus failing to apply the relevant Convention standards.",

The public character of proceedings protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret, with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained.

Furthermore, the Court has previously held that given the possible detrimental effects that the lack of a public hearing before the first-instance court could have on the fairness of the proceedings, the absence of publicity could not in any event be remedied by anything other than a complete rehearing before the appellate court (see Khrabrova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a018498/04, \u00a7 52, 2 October 2012).",

In order to ensure the respect for the defendants\u2019 right to a public hearing, it would have been required that the Regional Court had taken steps by way of ensuring a complete rehearing of the case on appeal. The Court cannot but note that the Regional Court failed to do so. It is of particular importance that in its judgment of 4 February 2010 the Regional Court expressly refused to look into the essential issue of proportionality of the award to Mr\u00a0D. to the alleged damage to his honour, dignity and business reputation and endorsed the findings that the District Court had reached in camera without providing any detailed reasons for doing so (see paragraph 11 above). Accordingly, in the circumstances of the present case the fact that the proceedings before the Regional Court were public is not sufficient to remedy the lack of a public hearing before the District Court (see, for similar reasoning, Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, ECHR 2000XII, and Khrabrova, cited above, \u00a7 52).",
