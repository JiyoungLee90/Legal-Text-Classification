This fact was underlined by the Supreme Court\u2019s reference to the 1994 precedent, according to which a refusal of a compensation claim did not undermine or question an acquittal, but had to be based on a separate assessment using the evidentiary standard applicable to ordinary compensation claims made independently of the criminal proceedings.

According to its established case-law, there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 6, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, their essential nature and the type and severity of the penalty that the applicant risked incurring (see Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2001-VII, and A.P., M.P. and T.P. v. Switzerland, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V, p. 1488, \u00a7 39). Moreover, the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 2 is not limited to criminal proceedings that are pending (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no.\u00a0308, p. 16, \u00a7 35). In certain instances, the Court has also found the provision applicable to judicial decisions taken after the discontinuation of such proceedings (see in particular the following judgments: Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, and Lutz, Englert and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123), or following an acquittal (see Sekanina and Rushiti, cited above, and Lamanna v. Austria, no. 28923/95, 10 July 2001). The latter decisions concerned proceedings relating to such matters as an accused\u2019s obligation to bear court costs and prosecution expenses, a claim for reimbursement of his (or his heirs\u2019) necessary costs, or compensation for detention on remand, matters which were found to constitute a consequence and the concomitant of the criminal proceedings.",

It observes that, in its decision of 25 January 1995, the High Court summarised the charges of sexual abuse brought against the applicant in the criminal trial, as well as reiterating the jury\u2019s verdict and his acquittal by the judges. Then it went on to examine whether the conditions for awarding compensation under Article 444 were fulfilled.

It gives a person who is tried but acquitted or against whom proceedings have been discontinued a right to compensation if it is shown on the balance of probabilities that the person did not carry out the act that formed the basis of the charge.

Conversely, the provision may be relied on also by applicants who are not primarily interested in compensation but want to reopen the legal assessment of the issue of guilt. At the same time, applicants in the latter group invoke the principle of presumption of innocence in an attempt to ensure that the courts trying their cases conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, they were not guilty. The result is that a well-meant provision \u2013 which has proved valuable in a significant number of the cases which it was intended to cover \u2013 turns out to be ill-advised and not compatible with the presumption of innocence. This is so even though Article 444 was never intended to result in the slightest question being raised about an acquittal or a discontinuation of proceedings. The latter can readily be seen from the Norwegian courts\u2019 reasoning in the present case, in which the courts made every possible effort to emphasise that their finding in the compensation proceedings \u2013 the refusal of the compensation claim \u2013 did not mean that the earlier acquittal was undermined or laid open to doubt.",

The reason is that compensation claims from that person are a consequence and concomitant of the criminal proceedings as such, and thus bring the presumption of innocence as enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 into play. In contradistinction to cases in which compensation is sought by a third party, the question \u2013 in cases in which it is the person previously under investigation or charged with a crime and then acquitted who is seeking compensation \u2013 cannot be whether the person carried out the act that formed the basis of the charge because that is no longer in question: owing to the principle of presumption of innocence, there is invariably only one answer, and that is in the negative. The focus in these cases thus has to be limited to:",
