However, the specialists were unanimous in the conclusion that it was safest for a woman to give birth on a maternity ward, even when there was little risk of complications. It was impossible to foresee that any birth would pass without complications, and it was always possible that a woman giving birth or a newborn baby might need urgent medical assistance that could be provided only on a maternity ward.",

For that purpose medical establishments were supplied with modern medical equipment; at the same time, a woman\u2019s family members could be present during birth, and medical institutions were being encouraged to obtain the status of \u201cnewborn-friendly\u201d. Over the previous twenty years Lithuania had achieved good results in significantly reducing the mortality rate of pregnant women, women giving birth and babies. To provide midwifery services at home, where there were not all the facilities necessary to be able to provide help to women giving birth and to the newborn, would constitute a step backwards. Similarly, to shift the legal and financial liability onto the healthcare specialist or healthcare institution in question would likewise not be acceptable. Moreover, the question of home birth concerned not only the woman\u2019s, but also the State\u2019s choice; at the same time, it was necessary to balance the interests of society and the rights of the individual. This view was supported by the Court\u2019s judgment in Ternovszky v. Hungary, (no.\u00a067545/09, \u00a7\u00a024, 14\u00a0December 2010). Accordingly, the Ministry had no plans to initiate changes to secondary legislation that would regulate the provision of midwifery services at home.",

Given that in her request the third applicant insisted on relying on the Court\u2019s judgment in Ternovszky (cited above), the Ministry of Health consulted the Ministry of Justice on the matter. The Ministry of Justice noted that the Court had found a violation in the abovementioned case because of its very particular and specific circumstances, which had led the Court to conclude that the situation in Hungary, in as much as it related to healthcare professionals providing assistance during home births, was surrounded by legal uncertainty that gave rise to arbitrariness. Nonetheless, the Court had acknowledged that, as concerned the provision of healthcare services, the States had a wide margin of appreciation, and regulation had to ensure a proper balance between societal interests and the right at stake. The Ministry of Justice pointed out that the Court\u2019s judgment did not mean that a State was under a general obligation to establish a regulatory framework that would allow healthcare specialists to provide services to women giving birth at home. Taking into account the above, and given that Lithuanian law did not contain provisions regarding the provision of healthcare services to women giving birth at home, the Ministry concluded that a pregnant woman could not require that, upon her request, a healthcare institution or a healthcare specialist provide her with childbirth-related healthcare services outside a healthcare institution. Similarly, a healthcare institution or a specialist had no obligation to provide such services, even if a pregnant woman so wished. That being so, the Ministry also emphasised that the third applicant was welcome to visit the maternity wards in Lithuania and to choose the one which had the environment that most suited her.",

The court referred to Article\u00a052 of the Law on the Healthcare System (see paragraph\u00a039 below), which guaranteed a patient\u2019s right to privacy. For the court, such legal regulation thus empowered the third applicant to give birth in a specialised medical institution of her choice, which was equipped in accordance with the requirements for such institutions, so that the health of the mother and the newborn would be protected and they could receive immediate high-quality and effective help, should any danger arise to their health or lives during childbirth. The Supreme Administrative Court held that such legal regulation maintained a balance between two constitutional values: privacy and the protection of health.",

There was no information in the file to the effect that the third applicant had ever approached any of the maternity wards or that she had faced obstacles in choosing how to make use of that right to privacy (for example, by requesting certain services, such as a private room) and then instituted court proceedings. One also had to bear in mind the fact that privacy in respect of the third applicant\u2019s personal life (which she had sought by demanding to be provided with medical assistance during her home birth) could not be seen as having a greater value than the health of her and the newborn child, for the purpose of which the State had established a system of personal healthcare and qualified medical assistance.",

They noted that only the first, second and third applicants had lodged requests with several healthcare institutions and the Ministry of Health for them to be provided with medical assistance during their home births. Afterwards, only one of them \u2013 the third applicant \u2013 had challenged the Ministry\u2019s response in an administrative court. The Government considered that the administrative courts had the power to decide that certain regulatory acts, such as Medical Regulation MN\u00a040:2006, were not in conformity with higher legal instruments. Alternatively, the administrative court could have also referred the matter to the Constitutional Court, which then would have had an opportunity to assess the existing legal regulation and the alleged need to broaden that regulation in view of the right to give birth outside a hospital. The Government thus concluded that the instant application was premature on account of pending (at the time of the Government\u2019s observations of 26\u00a0April 2013) national proceedings in respect of the third applicant. They also stated that the outcome of those proceedings might have a direct effect on other applicants.",

By a letter of 31\u00a0January 2019 the Government also drew the Court\u2019s attention to the fact that earlier that month the Minister of Health had adopted a follow-up legal act on that issue (see paragraph\u00a047 above).

One of those problems concerned legal uncertainty: although it was legal to give birth at home, the provision of medical assistance was not. The investigation had therefore arguably dissuaded anybody who might be willing to provide particular assistance during home births from doing so. Individuals assisting women at home births were being prosecuted, and the women in question were themselves being called in for questioning by the police.

Furthermore, all those Lithuanian applicants who had been pregnant at the time of lodging their application had already given birth (see paragraphs\u00a013 and 19 above).

Hence, it limited the places in which labour could take place (that is to say to hospitals), whereas if it allowed women the unrestricted right to choose the most emotionally comfortable place in which to give birth, it would not be able to secure its primary goal \u2013 preserving the health and life of the mother and of the newborn. In this context the Government also pointed to the first applicant\u2019s submission that she had given birth to her last child at home, even though she had been aware of the fact that her and her child\u2019s life and health were at risk (see paragraph\u00a010 above), which for the Government showed that this applicant thus failed to act in a manner ensuring that the life of a future human being would not be placed in danger.",

Similarly, the Law on Medical Practice provided that doctors (including obstetrician-gynaecologists) could practise only in a licensed healthcare institution (see paragraphs\u00a040 and 43 above), and the Law on Nursery Practice and Midwifery Practice prohibited a midwife from practising her occupation outside a licensed healthcare institution (see paragraph\u00a041 above). The fact that a midwife could not assist with home births was explicitly stated in Medical Regulation MN\u00a040:2006 (see paragraph 44 above). For the Court, such a reading of explicitly and clearly regulated Lithuanian law unambiguously supports the conclusion that professionally assisted home births were not permitted. It also follows that because of this, for Lithuanian healthcare professionals, including paediatricians, obstetrician-gynaecologists and midwives, to officially assist with home births would be considered as quackery (see paragraph\u00a028 above; compare Pojatina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

On this point the Court also refers to the Ministry of Health\u2019s reply to the first applicant that healthcare specialists were unanimous in concluding that it was safest for a woman to give birth in a maternity ward (see paragraph\u00a08 above). In the case of Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1 the Court also noted that the risk for mothers and newborns was higher in the case of home births than in the case of births in maternity hospitals, which were fully staffed and adequately equipped from a technical and material perspective, and that even if a pregnancy proceeded without any complications and could have therefore been considered a \u201clow-risk\u201d pregnancy, unexpected difficulties could arise during the delivery that would require immediate specialist medical intervention, such as a Caesarean section or special neonatal assistance. The Court likewise noted that a maternity hospital could provide all the necessary urgent medical care, whereas this would not be possible in the case of a home birth, even with a midwife attending (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0186; as to data on perinatal mortality, see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a028 and 29 of that judgment).",

In Vilnius alone, where all the applicants lived, there were three such hospitals (see paragraph 16 above). In fact, in reply to her demand that she be provided with medical assistance during her home birth, the third applicant was explicitly invited to visit one of those hospitals in order to become acquainted with the environment therein (ibid.).

The Court reiterates that, while it would be possible for the respondent State to allow planned home births, it is not required to do so under the Convention as interpreted by the Court. There still remains a great disparity between the legal systems of the Contracting States as well as lack of consensus on the matter (see\u00a0Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0183), and the Court remains respectful of the gradual development of law in the sphere (see, most recently, Pojatina, cited above, 85).",

However, as already noted by the Court, there are no provisions under domestic law criminalising the acts of women who decide to give birth in that setting (see paragraph\u00a094 above). This has also been acknowledged by the applicants (see paragraph\u00a057 above). It is true that the Minister of Health expressed his view on 26\u00a0April 2012 that the law prohibited healthcare professionals from assisting at home birth, as such actions would be considered as quackery (see paragraph\u00a028 above). Indeed, a person who had assisted the applicants at their home births had been prosecuted for such an offence (see paragraphs 31-35 above). Be that as it may, it transpires that the criminal proceedings that the applicants relied on concerned a bigger case regarding the death of a baby born at home and the legality of the actions of a number of persons assisting with home births (see paragraph 30 above), which only further corroborates the Court\u2019s conclusion that there was a public need to investigate those suspicions. Even if it is true that the applicants were questioned as witnesses during those proceedings, this questioning can be seen not only as the consequence of their choice to give birth at home but also as their civic duty.",

Similarly, the applicants never reported having been denied postnatal care to any relevant authority. There is thus no document whatsoever that would allow the Court to verify such an allegation (ibid., \u00a7\u00a087). On the contrary, as noted by the Government, should any emergency arise in cases of planned home birth, healthcare professionals would still come to the patient\u2019s home and either provide medical assistance there or secure their transfer to a hospital (see paragraph\u00a086 above). This also corresponds to the Court\u2019s position that in no circumstances should a child be deprived of his or her right of access to healthcare services on the grounds that he or she was born outside of a medical facility. The best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social-welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies (see the principles enunciated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, cited in Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7\u00a064).",

As a result, the Lithuanian law was amended to include provisions explicitly regulating home births, so that since 1\u00a0January 2019 medical personnel have been allowed to assist at home births (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above). Against this background, the Court also finds that the Lithuanian authorities have made further progress regarding matters relating to home births by keeping the relevant legal provisions under constant review so as to ensure that they reflect medical and scientific developments, while fully respecting women\u2019s rights in the field of reproductive health \u2013 notably by ensuring adequate conditions for both patients and medical staff in maternity hospitals across the country (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1, \u00a7\u00a0189, and Pojatina, \u00a7\u00a082, both cited above).

This is also detrimental to the health of mothers and of course to their newborns.
