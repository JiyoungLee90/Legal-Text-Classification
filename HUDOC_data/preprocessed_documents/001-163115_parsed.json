For persons not raised in Denmark who acquire Danish nationality later in life, the rule implies that the attachment requirement applies until twenty-eight years have passed after the date when any such person became a Danish national. As an example, [the first applicant], who became a Danish national at the age of 31, will be subject to the attachment requirement until he is 59 years old. The 28-year rule therefore implies that the major restriction of the right to spousal reunion resulting from the attachment requirement will affect persons who only acquire Danish nationality later in life far more often and with a far greater impact than persons born with Danish nationality.

In our opinion it is dubious whether there is any basis for such a restrictive interpretation as the provision, according to its wording, comprises any difference in treatment exercised as a consequence of how and when nationality was acquired. As is apparent from the Explanatory Report, the provision is not a prohibition from which no derogation may be made, and the provision must be taken to mean that it may be derogated from if the difference in treatment is objectively justified and proportionate.

In this respect, the Supreme Court referred to paragraphs 84 to 86 of the judgment delivered by the European Court of Human Rights ... in Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali [cited above]. Difference in treatment based on nationality must be seen, inter alia, in the light of the right of Danish nationals to settle in Denmark, and no significance can be attributed to the fact that such discrimination is not considered contrary to Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 when assessing whether it is permissible to implement a scheme implying a difference in treatment between different groups of Danish nationals. In our opinion, no crucial significance can be attributed to paragraphs 87 to 89 of the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment either in this assessment, among other reasons because difference in treatment based on the length of a person\u2019s period of nationality is not comparable to a difference in treatment based on place of birth.",

Such strong attachment to Denmark will exist in most cases where a person has held Danish nationality for twenty-eight years. However, when assessing whether the difference in treatment implied by the 28year\u00a0rule can be considered objectively justified, it is not sufficient to compare persons not raised in Denmark who acquire Danish nationality later in life with the large group of persons who were born Danish nationals and were also raised in Denmark. If exemption from the attachment requirement was justified only in regard of the latter group of Danish nationals, the exemption should have been delimited differently. The crucial element must therefore be a comparison with persons who were born Danish nationals and have been Danish nationals for twenty-eight years, but who were not raised in Denmark and may perhaps not at any time have had their residence in Denmark. In our opinion, it cannot be considered a fact that, from a general perspective, this group of Danish nationals has stronger ties with Denmark than persons who have acquired Danish nationality after entering and residing in Denmark for a number of years. It should be taken into consideration in that connection that one of the general conditions for acquiring Danish nationality by naturalisation is that the relevant person has resided in Denmark for at least nine years, has proved his or her proficiency in the Danish language and knowledge of Danish society and meets the requirement of self-support.",

This pattern contributes to the retention of these persons in a situation where they, more than others, experience problems of isolation and maladjustment in relation to Danish society. The pattern thus contributes to hampering the integration of aliens newly arrived in Denmark.

The dispensation from the aggregate ties conditions for a naturalised citizen, for whom the condition will, inevitably, be harder to meet by virtue of his or her own foreign origin, at so late an age constitutes, in my view, an excessive restriction to the right to family life and clearly discriminates between Danish citizens on the basis of their origin in the enjoyment of this fundamental right.\u201d",

Amendments to the Aliens Act have established further restrictions in the granting of permanent residence and in the area of family reunification. The length of time for which an alien immigrant must have had lawful residence in Denmark has now been increased to six years (instead of the previous five), and certain requirements, including the completion of an introduction programme must normally be met. In the area of family reunification the latest amendments require that persons wishing to bring a spouse to Denmark are over 25 years of age and dispose of a dwelling of reasonable size, unless particular reasons make it inappropriate. The age requirement, which the Danish authorities explain has been imposed in order to protect young people against forced marriage, may be waived if an individual assessment proves without any doubt that the marriage is based on the free will of the person living in Denmark. There has been considerable criticism of this age requirement from members of minority groups who feel that the change is based on negative stereotypes about the marriage practices of certain minority groups and violates their right to private life, including choosing a spouse. ECRI is concerned that such criteria in the area of family reunification may impact in a discriminatory fashion on certain minority groups, such as Muslims and encourages the Danish authorities to give due consideration to this issue.\u201d",

As concerns the rule by which family reunification can only be achieved at the age of 24, with the stated purpose of preventing forced marriages, ECRI notes research indicating that 84% of marriages are contracted with the free will of the parties concerned. Furthermore, ECRI considers that this measure is disproportionate to the aim sought. Even if the requirement that the spouses\u2019/partners\u2019 combined attachment to Denmark should be considerably greater than their combined attachment to any other country is changed to the above-mentioned aggregate ties requirement, it remains a criterion which can be subject to subjective interpretation. The rule that persons who have held Danish citizenship whether it be for over 28 or 26\u00a0years, or who were born in Denmark or came to the country as a small child or have resided legally in the country, whether it be for over 28 or 26 years, are exempt from these requirements, also risks disproportionately affecting non-ethnic Danes. The Danish authorities have informed ECRI that the Aliens\u2019 Act contains an exemption mechanism. An example of an exceptional reason for allowing family reunification although not all the requirements for spousal reunification have been met is when refusing an application would interfere with Denmark\u2019s international obligations (e.g. the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed in Article 8 in the European Convention on Human Rights). The Danish authorities have indicated that exemptions can, for example, be granted if the spouse in Denmark holds a residence permit as a refugee and would otherwise have to enjoy his/her family life in a country where s/he risks persecution. ECRI also notes with concern reports indicating that if a child is not assessed as being able to integrate in Denmark, s/he will not be allowed to join his/her parent(s) in Denmark for family reunification purposes or s/he will be deported from the country.",

Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (C127/08, EU:C:2008:449) the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) clarified the conditions and limits applicable to the right of residence of spouses of EU citizens. The cases concerned four third-country nationals (\u201cTCN\u201d), who had initially unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in Ireland and then married EU citizens who were not Irish nationals but who resided in Ireland. Their applications for residence permits as spouses of EU citizens were rejected by the Minister of Justice on the ground that they did not satisfy the condition of prior lawful residence in another member State laid down in Irish law. Those rejections formed the subject matter of actions for annulment before the High Court which, finding that none of the marriages in question was a marriage of convenience, sought a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on the interpretation of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States in order to establish whether the Directive precluded legislation of a member State which made the right of residence of a national of a non-member country subject to the conditions of prior lawful residence in another member State and acquisition of the status of spouse of a citizen of the Union before his/her arrival in the host member State. The CJEU ruled that these cases were a matter of EU law since the applicants concerned had exercised their right to free movement. Furthermore, it made no difference whether TCNs who were family members of an EU citizen had entered the host member State before or after becoming family members of that EU citizen. According to the CJEU, the Directive did not make its application conditional on the beneficiaries \u2013 family members of a citizen of the EU \u2013 having previously resided in a member State. Nor did the Directive on family reunification require the EU citizen to have founded his/her family before exercising his/her right of free movement in another member State or the national of a non-member country to have entered the host member State before becoming a family member of the EU citizen. In other words, a TCN who was the spouse of an EU citizen and who accompanied that citizen in the host member State could enjoy rights conferred by that Directive irrespective of when and where their marriage took place or of how the TCN had entered the host member State.",

Mr Biao had strong ties to Togo, Ghana and Denmark. His wife had very strong ties to Ghana but no ties to Denmark, apart from having married Mr Biao who lived in Denmark and had Danish citizenship. Furthermore, the couple had never been given any assurances by the Danish authorities that Ms Biao would be granted a right of residence in Denmark. As the attachment requirement had been applicable to Danish nationals from July 2002 onwards, the applicants could not have been unaware when they married, in February 2003, that Ms Biao\u2019s immigration status would make any family life in Denmark uncertain for them from the outset. Moreover, once they had been notified of the authorities\u2019 refusal of July 2003 to grant family reunion, Ms Biao could not have expected any right of abode by simply entering the country on a tourist visa. Lastly, Mr Biao himself had stated that, if he obtained paid employment in Ghana, he and his family could settle there. Thus, the refusal to grant Ms Biao a residence permit in Denmark did not prevent the couple from exercising their right to family life in Ghana or any other country.",

Furthermore, in 2004 Mr Biao had been a Danish national for less than two years when he had been refused family reunion. Refusing to exempt Mr\u00a0Biao from the attachment requirement after such a short time could not, in the Chamber\u2019s view, be considered disproportionate to the aim of the 28year rule, namely to favour a group of nationals who, seen from a general perspective, had lasting ties with Denmark and who could be granted family reunion with a foreign spouse without difficulty, as the spouse could normally be successfully integrated into Danish society.",

The Government reiterated that for spouses whose joint ties with another country were not stronger than the couple\u2019s aggregate ties with Denmark, the attachment requirement would normally be met without further conditions, already when the foreign spouse had visited Denmark once. For spouses who had both been raised in the same foreign country (like the applicants), and where the resident spouse had made efforts to become integrated in Denmark, the attachment requirement would normally be met at the latest when the resident spouse had resided in Denmark (with a residence permit) for twelve years, meaning normally after three years of nationality, and in many cases much earlier. The Government pointed out that the applicants had been made aware of this practice in the decision of 27\u00a0August 2004 by the Ministry for Refugees, Immigration and Integration (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). Accordingly, if Mr Biao had remained in Denmark and the applicants had reapplied for family reunification, they would have had a prospect of success in fulfilling the attachment requirement already in 2005. It was therefore incorrect to assume that the applicants would only be allowed to be reunited in Denmark in 2030, when Mr\u00a0Biao would have reached the age of 59.",

The Government noted that the Danish model of society was based on a universal Welfare State with generous welfare schemes, such as free healthcare and education at all levels for everyone and considerable financial support for families with children, childcare and old-age care. These welfare services were financed to a small extent by insurance schemes and user charges and to a very great extent by general taxes and duties, which were among the highest in the world. Welfare spending on individual citizens would therefore be higher than the citizen\u2019s tax payment in many cases, depending on which of the welfare services offered were used by the individual citizen. By no means were all taxpayers net contributors to the national economy. This also applied to spouses who had been reunited as a family, where the resident spouse provided financial security for the maintenance of his or her newly arrived spouse. The willingness of the Danes to finance the universal Welfare State and the high degree of redistribution was based on values such as a strong spirit of solidarity and community in Danish society. Consequently, if a large number of people were not financially and/or socially well-integrated into society, this might affect support for the existing Danish model of society in the long term. These circumstances gave rise to particular issues with regard to immigration control and integration, and in this connection great importance was attached to the prospect of the successful integration of newcomers, both in each individual case and seen from a more general perspective. The rules on ties with Denmark as a condition for family reunion had to be understood in this light, among others.",

Under Danish law a reassessment of their situation would be made only upon submission of a new application. The domestic court proceedings concerned the situation at the time when the administrative authorities decided the case. Accordingly, in its judgment of 13 January 2010, the Supreme Court, at last instance, had decided that the refusal of 27 August 2004 by the Ministry for Refugees, Immigration and Integration (being the final administrative body) could not be set aside as being in breach of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 8. The Supreme Court\u2019s determination of the case had thus been based on the situation in 2004, and not in 2010. The Government emphasised in this connection that it followed both from the requirement of the Convention as to exhaustion of national remedies as a condition for submitting an application to the Court (Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention), and from the established case-law of the Court, that the time of the decision in dispute, in this case the administrative decision, was decisive for the Court\u2019s assessment of a case under the Convention. Against this background, the Government submitted that 2004 was the relevant time for the Court\u2019s assessment of the case, not 2010 or 2015.",

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background, but the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court.

If the person had not been a Danish national for twenty-eight years, the exception did not apply.

The pattern thus contributes to hampering the integration of aliens newly arrived in Denmark.

Furthermore, the attachment requirement would not automatically be considered fulfilled after three years of nationality or after twelve years of lawful residence. Moreover, it is noteworthy that if a person acquires Danish nationality (category (d)) for example at the age of 28 (and thus after nine years of required lawful residence in Denmark, see paragraphs\u00a014 and 30 above), in general he or she will still have to wait three years before the attachment requirement may be considered fulfilled. However, a 28-year old Danish-born national, resident in Denmark (category (b)) would be exonerated from the attachment requirement immediately at the age of 28, and a 28year old Danish-born expatriate (category (a)) would also be exonerated from the attachment requirement immediately at the age of 28, even if the expatriate had resided in Denmark only for a short period of time. Accordingly, although persons who acquire Danish nationality later in life may not have to wait twenty-eight years to be allowed family reunification, but rather three years or more, this does not, in the Court\u2019s view, remove the fact that the application of the 28year rule had a prejudicial effect on Danish nationals in the applicant\u2019s situation.",

In particular the aim was to ensure that Danish expatriates would be able to obtain family reunion in Denmark since this group had been unintentionally and unfairly disadvantaged by the tightening up of the attachment requirement introduced in 2002.

The answer to this question cannot, in the Court\u2019s view, depend solely on the length of nationality, whether for twenty-eight years or less. Therefore, the Court cannot follow the Government\u2019s argument that because the first applicant had been a Danish national for only two years when he was refused family reunion, the consequences of the 28year rule could not be considered disproportionate as regards his situation. It points out that this line of reasoning seems to overlook the fact that in order to obtain Danish nationality the first applicant had resided in Denmark for at least nine years, had proved his proficiency in the Danish language and knowledge of Danish society, and met the requirement of selfsupport.",

In my view, the reasoning given by the three out of seven minority in the Danish Supreme Court, which included the President, Torben Melchior, is very convincing in this regard. Furthermore, it seems to me that the time has come to revisit the findings and reasoning set out in Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, notably as regards its principled statement made more than thirty years ago that \u201cthere are in general persuasive social reasons for giving special treatment to those whose link with a country stems from birth within it\u201d. Had the Court taken that further step, this case could have provided the ideal occasion to put an end to its casuistic approach to the thorny issue of protection of family life in the context of migration policy, and namely of family reunification or reunion. Unfortunately it did not. In the following opinion I will thus put forward the reasons why I find that Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali is no longer good law in the light of the development of international law and the Court\u2019s own case-law.",

However, the applicants did not reapply for spousal reunification. Danish law does not impose an obligation on the authorities to assess of their own motion and on an ongoing basis whether persons who have previously been refused family reunification may meet the requirements at a later point in time. Such reassessment would be made only upon submission of a new application. Thus, the Government maintained that the relevant time for the Court\u2019s assessment of the case had to be 2004.

Thus, the temporal scope of the Court\u2019s assessment includes the entry into force of Law no. 1204 of 27\u00a0December 2003 introducing the 28-year rule, the transfer of the applicants\u2019 residence to Sweden in 15 November 2003 and the birth of the applicants\u2019 son in Sweden on 6 May 2004. Nevertheless, any events which might have occurred after August 2004 may also be considered for the purposes of the Court\u2019s assessment. In this regard, I note that the applicants still live with their son in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, which since 1 July 2000 has been connected to Copenhagen in Denmark by a 16 km bridge, and that the first applicant commutes daily to his work by train from Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen. Considerable weight must therefore be accorded to this longlasting situation, which involves not only a certain degree of sacrifice for the first applicant, but also for his son, who, despite being Danish, has not been able to live with his family in his own country. I cannot turn a blind eye to this sacrifice of the Biao family.",

It will be recalled that the majority of the Danish Supreme Court found that there had been a difference in treatment between, on the one hand, persons like Mr Biao, who had been a Danish national for less than twenty-eight years and, on the other, persons who had been Danish nationals for more than twenty-eight years. Accordingly, they assessed the case strictly from the perspective of the length of the first applicant\u2019s Danish nationality. In other words, they considered that the first applicant enjoyed \u201cother status\u201d within the meaning of Article 14.",

They found that the 28-year rule entailed two forms of indirect discrimination. Although the rule applied both to persons born Danish nationals and to persons acquiring Danish nationality later in life, its significance in reality differed greatly for the two groups of Danish nationals. For persons born Danish nationals, the rule implied that the attachment requirement applied until they were 28 years old. Thereafter they were exempted from the requirement. For persons not raised in Denmark who acquired Danish nationality later in life, the rule implied that the attachment requirement applied until twenty-eight years had passed from the date when any such person became a Danish national. As an example, the first applicant, who became a Danish national at the age of 31, would be subject to the attachment requirement until he reached the age of\u00a059. The 28year rule therefore affected persons who acquired Danish nationality later in life far more often and with a far greater impact than persons born with Danish nationality. Hence, the 28-year rule resulted in an indirect difference in treatment between the two groups of Danish nationals.",

In the light of the Court\u2019s present case-law, States enjoy, in principle, a wide margin of appreciation when it comes to differences in treatment involving general measures of economic or social strategy, whereas the margin is narrow when the difference is based on \u201cnational\u201d origin, since the latter requires \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d for justification. Finally, no difference in treatment based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person\u2019s \u201crace\u201d or ethnic origin is capable of being justified in a contemporary democratic society, independent of the direct or indirect nature of the discriminatory measure. This point of principle should be emphasised: the indirect nature of a discriminatory measure based on \u201crace\u201d or ethnic grounds does not allow for a less strict criterion of assessment than direct discrimination based on the same grounds. Racial or ethnic discrimination is so obnoxious and degrading that no law, regulation or public policy causing or promoting such discrimination may be justified, regardless of whether the discrimination is direct or indirect and independently of any proven or unproven discriminatory intent. One major caveat should be added to this principle: \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d measures in favour of a disadvantaged group of people based on a racial or ethnic identifiable characteristic may be admitted when such law, regulation or policy is essential to put an end to or attenuate de facto discrimination in the enjoyment of a Convention right.",

I also agree with them when they concluded that the 28-year rule had a far greater impact on persons who had only acquired Danish nationality later in life than persons born with Danish nationality.

Although the minority were, strictly speaking, right to distinguish the present case from Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, the argument could be made that the material similarity of the situation in both cases could justify analogous reasoning. Be that as it may, the fact is that no other judgment or decision of the Court has ever repeated the principle set out in paragraph 88 of Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, according to which \u201cthere are in general persuasive social reasons for giving special treatment to those whose link with a country stems from birth within it\u201d in terms of family reunification. Furthermore, in view of the above-mentioned evolution of international law, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali principle, which was expressed in 1985, no longer holds true.

I submit that differentiation of treatment of nationals and lawfully resident aliens on the basis of their place of birth, nationality or length of nationality is, as a matter of principle, arbitrary, if one reads Article 14 of the Convention in the light of the evolving general principles of international law. The Government\u2019s arguments are too weak to negate such a reading. The somewhat mythical notion that a national by birth has a greater \u201cinsight into Danish society\u201d than a person who came to Denmark as a youngster or an adult is certainly not a convincing argument by way of contradiction.

The day will come, hopefully sooner rather than later, when the Court will take the simple but courageous step of concluding, in an unequivocal manner, that the right to family life does warrant family reunification. Family members are expected to live together, when there are no practical obstacles. Such obstacles should not be created by the State.

The legislative measure is the mature fruit of a policy choice of the respondent State to combat an alleged \u201cmarriage pattern\u201d among foreigners and Danish citizens of foreign origin and to benefit Danish nationals who have opted to live abroad for a lengthy period and who started a family outside Denmark. The fact that this policy choice is pursued by means of an exemption to the attachment rule, and therefore the discriminatory measure has an indirect nature, does not detract from the political and social purposes that it pursued. Accordingly, the pursued differentiation of treatment on ethnic grounds constitutes inadmissible ethnic discrimination, and this suffices for the finding of a violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 8. Even assuming, for the sake of an exhaustive discussion of the case, that only a differentiation of treatment based on the length of citizenship could be established, this would nevertheless constitute inadmissible indirect discrimination on the basis of \u201cother status\u201d, since the Convention does not allow any differentiation of treatment of nationals and lawfully resident aliens on the basis of their birth, nationality or length of nationality for the purpose of family reunification.",

Nonetheless, their inability to overcome the \u201cattachment requirement\u201d in order to reside together in Denmark remained the essence of the applicants\u2019 grievance.",

According to the relevant documents submitted by the Government, when extending the \u201cattachment requirement\u201d to Danish nationals back in 2002 the authorities were concerned that \u201cintegration [was] particularly difficult in families where generation upon generation fetch[ed] their spouses to Denmark from their own or their parents\u2019 country of origin\u201d (see paragraphs 33 and 106 of the present judgment). In other words, according to them, this tradition resulted in a cumulative detachment from Danish society and marginalised part of that society. But this certainly did not concern those Danish citizens who moved for work to foreign countries and raised children there; they remained very much involved in Danish society, as did their children. There was much less risk of marginalisation if such a child, raised abroad, was to bring his/her spouse to Denmark. Therefore the Government introduced the 28-year exemption in issue in the present case, which, as the majority established, had \u201ca disproportionately prejudicial effect on persons ... who were of an ethnic origin other than Danish\u201d (see paragraph 104 of the present judgment).",

However, the prima facie scope of Article 8 alone does not protect the choice of a family to reside in a State if one of the spouses is a non-national of the State concerned, and a State would fall short of its obligations under this provision when it comes to a ban on family reunification for non-nationals only in very serious circumstances.",

Thus the majority extended the protective scope of Article\u00a08, using Article 14 of the Convention. It is true that Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention, but such a broad concept of its ambit without sufficient connection to the substantive Convention guarantee makes it vague and indistinguishable from Protocol No. 12.",

What is surely problematic in respect of the applicants\u2019 right to family reunification in Denmark is the \u201cattachment requirement\u201d of 2002. But, as noted above, we are limited in our examination of the case to analysis of the 28-year exemption rule, which gives preference to a certain group and allows them to \u201cavoid\u201d the general attachment requirement. It is this exemption which was found by the majority to amount to indirect discrimination. As underlined by Judges Villiger, Mahoney and Kj\u00f8lbro, the most evident way of complying with this judgment would be to abolish the exemption from the attachment requirement, so that no one would be equally entitled to avoid the latter. Thus, the equality will be achieved in terms of equal \u201cnon-enjoyment\u201d of a right. The applicants would nevertheless still be unable to enjoy family reunification in Denmark. In other words, what the applicants can gain as a consequence of their victory is not their equal entitlement to family reunification (which was their primarily goal), but equal non-entitlement to family reunification together with others who were formerly so entitled.",

I cannot interpret Article 14 of the Convention as aiming to achieve equality by any means, including by equating incommensurable interests. In the event of revocation of the impugned exemption clause, a feeling of satisfaction for the applicants that they would no longer be differentiated as migrants is perfectly understandable, but it is of the utmost importance that their core Article 8 right will remain intact, whilst the Article 8 rights of the other group of Danish citizens will be significantly impaired.",

Therefore I concur with my dissenting colleagues that \u201cthe majority\u2019s endeavour to secure what they perceive to be the human rights of the individual applicants in the instant case may be at the expense, and to the detriment, of the immigration rights and interests of other persons\u201d who have strong ties with Denmark.",
