The court considered in the first place that the annulment of the decision of 1 December 2004 on 19 January 2005 had been unlawful because \u201conly a hierarchically superior prosecutor, i.e. the Prosecutor General and his inferiors\u201d had the right to do that. Moreover, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there had been no legal grounds to annul the decision of 1 December 2004 because: (a) there had been no elements of rape in V.R.\u2019s actions; and (b) according to Article 63 (2)(3) of the CCP a person can only be considered a suspect for the purpose of that article for three months. The court finally ruled that because the decision of 1\u00a0December 2004 had been declared valid, any further prosecution of V.R. would be in breach of the principle of ne bis in idem and thus contrary to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention.",

The General Prosecutor\u2019s Office failed to lodge such an appeal. In their letter of 16 August 2007 replying to the applicant\u2019s lawyer, the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office admitted that the prosecutor had missed the two-month deadline set by Article 422 of the CCP to appeal against the decision of the B\u0103l\u0163i Court of Appeal. As a result, all proceedings in respect of V.R. were terminated and the final decision in the case concerning the applicant\u2019s allegation of rape became prosecutor C.C.\u2019s decision of 1 December 2004.",

The Court notes that this decision was adopted without some important investigative measures having been conducted. In particular, since the central task in this case was to determine whether the sexual intercourse had been consensual, it was imperative to form an opinion concerning each party\u2019s credibility. That could have been done by questioning people known to the applicant and V.R., such as friends, neighbours, teachers and others who could have shed light on the trustworthiness of their statements. However, none of the above has been done before the adoption of the decision of 1\u00a0December 2004. The Court further notes that two individuals (V.D. and A.S.) out of three who had been with the applicant and V.R. immediately before and after the alleged rape have not been questioned.
