In particular, there is no evidence that the applicant\u2019s or his co-defendants\u2019 statements, which were used for the applicant\u2019s conviction, had been obtained under duress or in breach of the right to silence or the privilege against self-incrimination (see paragraph 6 above). Nor is there evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s allegation of bias on the part of one of the judges in the case. The applicant\u2019s requests for witnesses to be called during the trial were vague and did not contain details or explanations demonstrating that those witnesses could make statements of importance as regards specific charges against him. The applicant\u2019s related submissions in his appeal to the Supreme Court and in his application to this Court were also vague and couched in general terms. His complaint that he was given insufficient time to study the case file after having been convicted on 20\u00a0December 2005 has no basis in the facts. The applicant was given about eleven months to study the case file (see paragraph 11 above), which period, even though the case was voluminous and concerned multiple counts of different crimes, does not appear to be inadequate or insufficient for the applicant to collect the necessary information for the preparation of his appeal. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that this part of the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

The manner in which those guarantees are to be applied in relation to appellate or cassation courts depends upon the particular features of the proceedings involved: account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and the role of the appellate or cassation court therein (see, for example, Dovzhenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 36650/03, \u00a7 60, 12 January 2012).",

He made similar submissions in his appeal to the Supreme Court. None of those courts made assessment as regards the applicant\u2019s eligibility for such assistance. For this Court, there are several principal considerations demonstrating that the applicant lacked sufficient means to pay for his legal representation in the proceedings before the Supreme Court. In particular, prior to his conviction on 20 December 2005 the applicant had been detained for over four years (see paragraph 15 above). There is no information that he had any source of income during that time or any savings. Moreover, the fees of the court-appointed lawyer, who had represented the applicant during the trial, had been paid by the State (see\u00a0paragraph 7 above).",
