However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see, among others, Malikowski v. , no.\u00a015154/03, \u00a7\u00a054, 16\u00a0October 2007).",

However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed and it cannot accept it as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire period. Furthermore, the Court is not persuaded that the risk of absconding based on the fact that the applicant had failed to have a permanent residence in the country registered could serve as a \u201crelevant\u201d ground to warrant the length of his pre-trial detention.",

However, in that context the Court cannot but note that even though the applicant was arrested on 31 January 2001 he was questioned by the prosecutor only on 9 May 2001. Similarly, the first hearing before the trial court took place on 20 June 2002, whereas the bill of indictment had been filed in November 2001. Furthermore, the Court notes that four hearings were adjourned because the police had not brought the applicant from the detention centre. Although the trial court was not responsible for the resultant delays, the lack of a police escort to secure the applicant\u2019s presence at the trial must be attributed to the national authorities.

In respect of the latter, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal appears to have lain dormant before the Supreme Court for a period of approximately 16 months. However, some delays in the procedure before the Supreme Court could be explained by the fact that at the material time it had to deal with an increased workload (see, in respect of civil cases, K\u0119pa v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a043978/98, 30\u00a0September 2003). Furthermore, the impugned delay could not be considered unreasonable in the light of other cases which were characterised by longer periods of delay before the Supreme Court (compare and contrast, Pi\u0105tkowski v. Poland, no.\u00a05650/02, \u00a7\u00a023, 17 October 2006, and Golik v. , no.\u00a013893/02, \u00a7\u00a040, 28 November 2006).
