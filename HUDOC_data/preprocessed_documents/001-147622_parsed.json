Conversely, it has found that an applicant\u2019s detention could not be said to have been arbitrary if the domestic court gave certain grounds justifying the continued detention on remand, unless the reasons given are extremely laconic and without reference to any legal provision which would have permitted the applicant\u2019s detention (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 79, 9 July 2009 with further references).",

Italy, 22\u00a0February 1989, \u00a7\u00a038, Series\u00a0A no. 148). A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify the continued detention (see Smirnova v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a046133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR\u00a02003IX (extracts), with further references). In connection with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the Court has held that an important aspect of judicial supervision is the periodical review where the judge decides that continued detention is justified. This necessarily follows the point that circumstances can change and, while grounds for detention may exist in the early stages of an investigation, these may no longer be compelling at a later stage. It is incumbent on the detaining authorities, therefore, to submit the case for detention to judicial supervision at regular short intervals. The continuous supervision should be as rigorous as the initial examination (see Estrikh v.\u00a0Latvia, no. 73819/01, \u00a7 117, 18 January 2007).",

The \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d must exist not only at the time of the arrest and initial detention, but it must also be shown, in cases of prolonged detention, that the suspicion persisted and remained \u201creasonable\u201d throughout (see Ilgar Mammadov v.

However, they did not examine or even refer to the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d against the applicant as argued by the Government. Rather, they reasoned that the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary \u201cto ensure public safety\u201d and \u201cto prevent another criminal offence\u201d; they found that there was a possibility that the applicant \u201cwould commit another criminal offence\u201d if released (see paragraphs 11 and 14-15 above). The Court notes in this respect that while under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 a person\u2019s detention may be justified \u201cwhen it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence\u201d, that particular ground for detention is not adapted to a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who present a danger on account of their continuing propensity to crime. It does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7\u00a0102, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a039; compare also Eriksen v. Norway, 27\u00a0May 1997, \u00a7\u00a086, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III). This can be seen both from the use of the singular (\u201can offence\u201d) and from the object of Article\u00a05, namely to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of his liberty in an arbitrary fashion (see Guzzardi, cited above).",

The Court reiterates in this connection that while grounds for detention may exist in the early stages of an investigation, these may no longer be compelling at a later stage and a mere suspicion that a person has committed an offence no longer suffices as a justification for detention with a passage of time (see paragraphs 29-30 above).",

There is no indication that they had assessed it or had even taken note of it. The Court has already indicated that in principle it is the judicial orders it is called to assess when examining justification for continued detention (see Svipsta v. Latvia, no. 66820/01, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2006III (extracts), and Estrikh v. Latvia, no. 73819/01, \u00a7 122, 18 January 2007) and not the Government\u2019s posterior submissions in the absence of any domestic court rulings in this regard. The wording of the orders issued by the domestic courts in the present case indicates that it did not fall within the competence of an investigating judge to \u201cexamine and assess the evidence\u201d against the applicant (paragraph 11 above) and that \u201cthere [was] no reason to decide on the lack of evidence for the [applicant\u2019s] conviction\u201d (paragraph 15 above). The \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) does not mean that the suspected person\u2019s guilt must at that stage be established; it does not even presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while the applicant was in custody (see Shannon, cited above, \u00a7 45). What the words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d do mean is the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. What may be regarded as \u201creasonable\u201d will depend upon all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30\u00a0August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182).",
