Finland judgment involved both the civil and criminal heads of Article 6 (see \u00a7 40) and that was one of the reasons why the Court confirmed that it had jurisdiction. No special circumstances of this kind were present in the applicant's case. Therefore, in our opinion, the outcome of this case should follow the Court's conclusion in the case of Nylund v. Finland (dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999-VI where the Court noted that \u201cThe parties have agreed that Article 6 of the Convention is applicable to the present case. However, the Court, which has to examine, ex officio, its competence ratione materiae, is unable to reach the same conclusion\u201d.",

                        "content": "Finally, the approach of the majority that the competence of the Court depends on declarations by the respondent Governments seems hardly compatible with the principle of equality. Those applicants lucky enough not to have the Court's jurisdiction challenged by the Government, would have their cases heard and decided on the merits. Others, when confronted with a more careful position of the Government, would see their applications dismissed as inadmissible. In effect, access to the Court would depend on discretionary (not to say \u2013 arbitrary) positions taken by the respondent parties.",
