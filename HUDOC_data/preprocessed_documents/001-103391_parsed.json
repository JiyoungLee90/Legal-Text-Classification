It held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without judicial authorisation or clear rules governing their situation was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Isayev v. Russia, no. 20756/04, \u00a7\u00a7 131-133, 22 October 2009; Yudayev v.

The Court takes cognisance of the fact that in the present case the Russian Government acknowledged that the applicant's detention during the period from 21\u00a0October to 5 November 2004 had not been based on a judicial decision and had therefore been in breach of domestic law and Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

It did not, however, give any reasons for maintaining the custodial measure or fix a time-limit for the extended detention (see paragraph 9 above). This is a kind of situation that has been examined in many cases lodged against Russia in which the Court has found that the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Avdeyev and Veryayev v. Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009; Bakhmutskiy v.

The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. It considers that the decision of 5 November 2004 did not comply with the requirements of clarity, foreseeability and protection from arbitrariness and that the ensuing period of the applicant's detention was not \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

Afterwards, in seven extension orders between 12 July 2005 and 19 January 2007 the Regional Court repeatedly used the summary stereotyped formula and its reasoning did not evolve with the passing of time to reflect the developing situation and to verify whether the reasons for detention remained valid at the later stages of the proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a017 and 18 above). At no point in the proceedings did the domestic authorities consider whether the length of the applicant's detention had exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d or whether there was any room for applying alternative non-custodial measures to ensure his appearance at trial.",
