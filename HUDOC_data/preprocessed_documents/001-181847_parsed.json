For this reason, the Government further argued that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning his detention in Giurgiu Prison from 13 October 2014 to 25 May 2015 was lodged out of time. Consequently, the Government asked the Court to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the inadequate conditions of his detention in Giurgiu and Jilava Prisons only as of 25 May 2015.",

In the applicant\u2019s case, such aspects included, in particular, an infestation of the cell with insects, poor quality of bedding and bed linen, poor quality of food and a lack of adequate furniture. In this regard, the Court further notes that it is not convinced by the Government\u2019s observations on the adequacy of the aforementioned aspects of the physical conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention and finds that, overall, the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in Giurgiu Prison remained inadequate.
