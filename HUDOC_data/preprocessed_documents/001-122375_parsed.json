Almost a third of the women interviewed indicated having been subjected to multiple forms of violence. The study notes that domestic violence runs across lines of class and education; however, women with a higher level of education or economic status may tend not to disclose incidents of violence. Sexual violence remains the least reported form of violence. This may be due to lack of recognition of sexual abuse within the family as a wrongdoing or the fear among victims that they will be held responsible and become outcasts.",

The Government had continued to treat her case as a minor episode in which she had only herself to blame for not making \u2013 or for withdrawing \u2013 criminal complaints or not providing evidence. However, the nature of domestic violence was such that it often went unreported; even when the crime was reported, the victim was susceptible to intimidation by her aggressor and was less inclined to continue pressing charges. Failure to take this into account and obliging the victim to institute or continue criminal proceedings in order to enforce court orders undermined the efficiency of the legislation designed to protect victims. The applicant asserted that, accordingly, the respondent State had encouraged A.M. to continue ill-treating her with impunity, while relying on his mental illness as an excuse for not enforcing the various protection measures in her favour.",
