B. did not hold such a position in society that the exception in Chapter 27, section 3(a), paragraph 2, of the Penal Code was applicable. The fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to the dismissal of A. from his post as National Conciliator did not justify revealing her identity. The fact that B.\u2019s identity as A.\u2019s friend had previously been revealed in the media did not justify the subsequent invasion of her private life. The Penal Code provision in question did not require that intent be shown; it was sufficient that the dissemination of information about the private life of a person was capable of causing him or her damage or suffering.

The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical. Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation. The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different, and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical. Therefore, and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles, the Supreme Court found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering. The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant\u2019s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences. By associating the complainant\u2019s name and profession with the offences in question, the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering. The disclosure of the complainant\u2019s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult.

As regards a minor or an unaccountable person information should be disclosed with restraint (Article\u00a031).

A journalist shall consider such publication separately in each individual case, weighing the harm that may be caused to the person concerned and to his or her family and close persons against the general importance of publishing the name. Furthermore, the Council stated that the aggravated, cruel or special nature of an act does not alone suffice to justify disclosing the perpetrator\u2019s identity. An offence may, however, arouse so much public attention as to warrant publishing the name. Finally, the Council divided persons into three groups as to the protection of identity: (1) persons exercising political, economic or administrative power; (2) other public persons, for example in the sectors of entertainment, sports, arts or science; and (3) ordinary citizens.

As B. had taken an active and willing part in the events of 4\u00a0December 1996, leading to A.\u2019s conviction and dismissal, it is difficult to see how her involvement in the events was not a matter of public interest. Therefore, the Court considers that there was a continuing element of public interest involved also in respect of B. In this connection, the Court notes that the national authorities and the national courts reached very different conclusions as to whether B. could be considered as having waived her right to privacy when choosing to become involved with a public figure and in being a party to the incident of 4\u00a0December 1996, leading also to her conviction. In the Court\u2019s opinion this indicates that, at least to some degree, the national authorities also considered that the public interest was engaged in the reporting.",

In general, the reasoning in the Appeal Court\u2019s judgment in the present case is quite extensive. As far as the reasoning concerns the restrictions on freedom of expression, the court basically stated that the facts mentioned in the article were those to which the protection of private life typically applied, that B.\u2019s position in society was not such that the exception for public figures applied to her, and that neither the incident nor the fact that her identity had been revealed earlier led to any other conclusion.

Moreover, the Court considers that the applicants must have sustained non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards the applicants EUR 2,000 each in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
