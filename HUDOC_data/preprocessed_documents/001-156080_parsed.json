It must further ensure that the remedy or remedies comply, both in theory and in practice, with the key criteria set by the Court (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 97-101, ECHR\u00a02006VII). In particular, the Court recalls that \u201cthe best solution in absolute terms is indisputably, as in many spheres, prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable-time requirement in Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation\u201d (see S\u00fcrmeli, cited above, \u00a7 100). Article 13 also allows a State to choose between a remedy which can expedite pending proceedings or a remedy post factum in damages for delay that has already occurred. While the former is preferred as it is preventative of delay, a compensatory remedy may be regarded as effective when the proceedings have already been excessively long and a preventative remedy did not exist (see McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, \u00a7 108, 10 September 2010).",
