It did not, however, give any grounds for maintaining the custodial measure or fix a time-limit for their extended detention. This situation has also been examined in many cases against Russia, in which the Court has found that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Avdeyev and Veryayev v. Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009; Bakhmutskiy v.

However, after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty.

In particular, he referred to the fact that some of the stolen objects had not yet been discovered and the defendants might destroy them, to the risk of influence on the accomplice who had been hiding from the police and to the necessity of isolating the defendants from each other to prevent collusion. The Court is prepared to accept that those arguments might justify the first applicant's detention, provided that they were supported by evidence (see Aleksandr\u00a0Makarov, cited above, \u00a7 127). The Court is unable to detect any reasoning in the detention orders showing that the courts checked the validity of the arguments advanced by the prosecutor or verified whether they retained their relevance and validity throughout the entire duration of the criminal proceedings. The detention orders issued during the investigation relied on the risks of the first applicant's absconding, reoffending or interfering with the proceedings, without mentioning any specific factual basis for the existence of such risks, while the two detention orders issued during the trial, in the decisions of 30 April and 2 June 2003, did not refer to any grounds at all. However, the Court considers that it is not necessary to pursue this issue in further detail. Taking into account the contents of the prosecutor's submissions of 14 November 2002, it will proceed on the assumption that the first applicant's detention was based on \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d reasons and will focus its assessment on the issue of whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings.",

During that period, the District Court issued a preliminary decision on 30 April 2003, fixing an opening date for the trial and allocating the case to a judicial formation. However, that decision was quashed on appeal on 27 May 2003 because the District Court had unlawfully rejected the defendants' request for their case to be examined by a bench of three judges. The resulting delay in the proceedings is attributable to the conduct of the domestic authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Falimonov v.

As a general rule, a detainee should have a right to participate personally in a hearing where his detention is discussed (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 113). As regards legal representation, the Court has held on a number of occasions that it is the nature of the proceedings and the capabilities of an applicant which determine whether legal representation is required, in addition to the applicant's personal presence, by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention in an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure (see Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, \u00a7 59, 10 December 2002, and Bouamar v.

The Government did not explain why counsel appointed by the investigator to defend the first applicant did not appear at the hearing of 30 October 2002. The Court sees two possible explanations. The first is that he was not summoned to appear, in which case the fault lay with the District Court. The second possibility is that counsel was summoned but neglected his duty to appear. The Court considers that in that case the court was confronted with a manifest failure by State-appointed counsel to provide effective representation to a juvenile defendant and was therefore required either to adjourn the hearing or to assign another counsel with a view to ensuring that the procedural guarantees contained in Article 5 \u00a7 4 were complied with. Given that participation of counsel was mandatory under domestic law (see paragraphs 47 and 55 above), the Court finds the passive attitude of the District Court unacceptable.",

Indeed, neither the first applicant nor his lawyer was present at the appeal hearing of 3 December 2002, whereas the prosecutor attended and made oral submissions. The Court is of the view that to ensure equality of arms it was necessary to give the first applicant the opportunity to appear at the same time as the prosecutor, either in person or through some form of legal assistance, so that he could reply to his arguments. As the first applicant was not afforded an adequate opportunity to participate in the examination of his appeal on 3 December 2002, the appeal proceedings did not meet the \u201cequality of arms\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4.",

They relied in that connection on the certificate of 24 April 2007 stating that Ms\u00a0G. had never been employed by that court (see paragraph 42 above).

San Marino (dec.), no.\u00a031657/96, 4 May 2000). The Court is therefore required to examine allegations such as those made in the present case concerning a breach of the domestic rules on the appointment of judicial officers. The fact that the allegation in the present case concerned lay judges does not make it any less important as, under the Russian law then in force, in their judicial capacity lay judges enjoyed the same rights as professional judges (see Zakharkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 1555/04, \u00a7 146, 10 June 2010).",

Furthermore, the first applicant produced documentary evidence showing that in January 2003 the lay judge Ms G. had also participated in the examination of an unrelated civil case. This evidence prompts the conclusion that she had been called for service at least two times in the same year, which amounted to a substantive breach of the rules for selection of lay judges provided for in section 9 of the Lay Judges Act (see paragraph 60 above). The apparent failure to observe the requirements of the Lay Judges Act regarding the drawing of random lots and the maximum length of service per year leads the Court to the conclusion that the Krasnoarmayskiy District Court which convicted the first applicant could not be regarded as a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d.",
