The court took the view that the father had \u201csubsequently acquiesced\u201d, within the meaning of Article 13, sub-paragraph (a), of the Hague Convention, in the child's retention, especially because he had taken to Switzerland items belonging to the mother that were to be used by her in her professional activities in Switzerland (see Federal Court judgment of 17\u00a0November 2006, 5P.380/2006\u00a0). Generally speaking, the Federal Court finds it easier to accept the existence of a tacit agreement as to the removal or retention of a child where the party requesting the child's return has actively contributed to the settlement of the child and the accompanying parent in the destination country (ibid., see also the Federal Court judgment of 15\u00a0November 2005, 5P.367/2005).",

The proceedings he brought thus directly concerned the family life of these three persons.

However, in so far as the Court has jurisdiction to review the procedure followed before domestic courts, in particular to ascertain whether the interpretation by those courts of the Hague Convention's guarantees gave rise to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (see Monory, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081, Iglesias Gil and A.U.I, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061, and Guichard, decision cited above, pp.\u00a0414 et seq.), it is required to examine whether and to what extent the manner in which they proceeded was consistent with the object and purpose of the Hague Convention, which are, according to the preamble and Article 1 in particular, to guarantee the \u201cprompt return\u201d of wrongfully removed or retained children (see paragraph\u00a038 above).",

Inspired by a desire to protect children, regarded as the first victims of the trauma caused by their removal or retention, this instrument seeks to deter the proliferation of international child abductions (see Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, \u00a7 69). In this kind of case, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom it does not live (ibid., \u00a7 83). It is therefore a matter, once the conditions for the application of the Hague Convention have been met, of restoring as soon as possible the status quo ante in order to avoid the legal consolidation of de facto situations that were brought about wrongfully, and of leaving the issues of custody and parental responsibility to be determined by the courts that have jurisdiction in the place of the child's habitual residence, in accordance with Article 19 of the Hague Convention (see paragraph 38 above; also see, to that effect, among other authorities, Maumousseau and Washington, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Eskinazi and Chelouche, cited above).",

It should first be pointed out that Article 16 of the Hague Convention requires a stay of the proceedings on the merits of rights of custody until a decision has been taken on the child's return (see paragraph 38 above). The Court shares the view of the third-party intervener that this rule seeks to ensure that the custody proceedings do not prejudge those concerning the child's return. The separation of the two sets of proceedings must enable the court to rule on the possible return of the abducted child with the requisite diligence. In the present case the applicant submitted on 31\u00a0October 2005 a request for her son's return to the . Further to that request, the President of Baden District Court ordered the applicant's wife to surrender the child's passport immediately and prohibited her from leaving . At the same time, it was decided to join the proceedings concerning the child's return to the divorce proceedings, which are also supposed to deal with custody rights and parental responsibility. However, such an approach is not only clearly at odds with Article 16 of  Convention, as the Federal Court indeed recognised (see paragraph 27 above), it also had the effect of prolonging the proceedings before the domestic courts that were to rule on the return of the abducted child.",

The Court observes that this period of time is not consistent with Article 11 of the Hague Convention, which requires the judicial or administrative authorities concerned to act \u201cexpeditiously\u201d in proceedings for the return of children and any inaction lasting more than six weeks may give rise to a request for a statement of reasons for the delay (see, for the text of this provision, paragraph 38 above, and for cases where it has been applied, Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102, Monory, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082, and Bianchi, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

In other words the first-instance court required the applicant to \u201cestablish\u201d that he had not \u201cconsented to or subsequently acquiesced\u201d in the child's removal or retention. In the view of the Court \u2013 which shares the third-party intervener's view that the notions of \u201cconsent\u201d and \u201cacquiescence\u201d should be interpreted restrictively and that they have to be expressed unequivocally and unconditionally \u2013 this approach immediately placed the applicant in a clearly disadvantageous position. It is true that the second court, namely the Court of Appeal, correctly applied the above-cited Article 13. As the Federal Court pointed out, the reversal of the burden of proof did not by itself enable the Court of Appeal to reach the conclusion that the applicant had consented to his child's retention. This fact is not, however, capable of remedying the failure to uphold the equality of arms at first instance, in patent disregard of the clear wording of Article 13, sub-paragraph (a), of the Hague Convention.
