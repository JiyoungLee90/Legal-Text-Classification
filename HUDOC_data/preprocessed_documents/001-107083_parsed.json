As an illustration, they submitted that following the Court\u2019s judgment in the Lelas case (see Lelas v.\u00a0Croatia no. 55555/08, 20 May 2010), the applicant had in the reopened proceedings before the domestic courts obtained compensation that had been, as a result of the accrued statuory default interest, double the capital sum of the special daily allowances owed to him.

In this connection, the Government first argued that the applicants\u2019 new financial expectations were unjustified. However, even if those new expectations were justified, the Government averred that the applicants had had ample opportunities to submit claims for just satisfaction that would reflect those expectations.

If the national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made, Article\u00a041 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (see Iatridis v.\u00a0Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection the Court notes that each applicant may now file a petition for the reopening of his civil proceedings, under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph\u00a014 above), in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and the reasons for which it has found a violation of that Article, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way of repairing the consequences of that violation is to reopen the proceedings complained of. As it follows that the domestic law allows such reparation to be made, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicants any sum in respect of pecuniary damage (see Lelas, cited above, \u00a7 86).",
