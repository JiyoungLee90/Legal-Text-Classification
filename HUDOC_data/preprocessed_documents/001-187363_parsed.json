Early in the morning on 14\u00a0August 2004, Mr V.N. went to work on a farm near the village and was later joined by his son. At the time of the murder, at about 10 a.m., he was working in the farmhouse while his son was outside. As he heard a gunshot, he rushed to the window and saw his son lying on the ground, about forty to forty-five metres from the building. One of the accused was holding a gun, while his brother and the applicant were shouting at him to fire another shot, which he did. The three men then ran off. Mr V.N. first ran up to his son, whose body was shaking, and then ran home to bring his car back to help him. Once he got home, he took out a gun. At that moment he was visited by his neighbours, who told him the news about his son\u2019s death. Mr\u00a0V.N. did not tell the visitors that he had been at the crime scene and witnessed his son\u2019s murder, or that he knew anything about the shooting. He drove them to the farmhouse to see his son\u2019s body and once there started claiming that the brothers and the applicant had killed him, without mentioning that he had witnessed the crime.

He emphasised that unlike his co-accused, no piece of forensic evidence available in the criminal case file implicated him personally in the crime. He argued that the only piece of evidence connecting him to the murder was the eyewitness statement given by the victim\u2019s father. However, it was doubtful whether the latter had even been at the crime scene, given the evident contradictions between his account and the statements given by witnesses M.M. junior and D.M., that they had found him at home shortly after the murder, and that he had not mentioned having witnessed the crime, despite having gone with them to the crime scene to verify the tragic news (see paragraph 9 above). He argued that Mr V.N.\u2019s version that he had gone home after having witnessed his son\u2019s murder without notifying anyone and without telling Mr M.M. junior and Mr D.M. that he had been at the crime scene, without any other evidence corroborating his account, created serious doubts as to the veracity of his claim to have witnessed the event. The applicant further claimed to have an alibi to the effect that he had been seen alone in the centre of the village around the time of the murder, and noted that Mr V.N. might have been implicating him out of revenge. He argued that given the lack of any response to his main arguments, the conviction rendered by the first-instance court had relied on a mere doubt devoid of any evidence, in violation of Article\u00a0503 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 31 below).",

In upholding the lower court\u2019s verdict, the Supreme Court fully relied on the statement of the victim\u2019s father, the statements of the other witnesses who were told by him that the applicant had killed his son, and the forensic evidence, without addressing any of the applicant\u2019s arguments, including that none of the cited evidence had implicated him, and that the lower court had failed to address his arguments in that regard.",

On 17\u00a0December 2008, in view of the applicant\u2019s complaint that the Government had allegedly left his medical complaints \u2013 including those concerning headaches \u2013 unaddressed, the President of the Section decided to indicate to the Government, under Rule\u00a039 of the Rules of Court, to implement all necessary measures to assess his state of health. It transpires from the information submitted by the Government that on 28\u00a0July 2008 the applicant was consulted by a neurologist concerning the headaches. He was diagnosed with neurocirculatory dystonia, hypertensive hydrocephaly syndrome, and post-traumatic brain condition, and the relevant treatment was prescribed. The applicant complained again about headaches on 18\u00a0September and 11\u00a0November 2008. The applicant\u2019s submissions dated 29\u00a0January 2009 revealed that he had been seen by a neurologist on an unspecified date in\u00a0October 2008. As regards the complaint of 11\u00a0November 2008, no immediate reaction followed from the authorities. On 14\u00a0January 2009, the applicant was consulted by a neurologist and a skull X-ray was carried out. The neurologist concluded that no pathological signs could be observed and prescribed treatment for the applicant\u2019s headache. No complaints regarding headaches appear to have been raised following that date. As regards the other health-related complaints, on 28 October 2008 the applicant was examined and diagnosed with a chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. On 19\u00a0November 2008 an ultrasound exam was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of the chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. The relevant treatment was prescribed. The interim measure was lifted on 8 February 2012.",

Without such basic conduct at the domestic level by a person who wished to challenge the conditions of his or her detention under the Convention, the Court would necessarily have difficulty in evaluating the credibility of an applicant\u2019s allegations of fact in that connection (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.
