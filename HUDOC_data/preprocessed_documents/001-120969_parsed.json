The applicant failed to do so. The letter from the applicant\u2019s lawyer of 8\u00a0July 2002 cannot be considered sufficient in these circumstances. The letter only noted where the applicant had his official registered address in Russia, but it did not in any way indicate where he wanted to receive his correspondence. Furthermore, on 2 September 2004 the applicant informed the court that he was unable to attend a hearing because he had health problems and new lawyers, but still failed to give an address for service in Russia.",

I note further that the applicant\u2019s bail conditions were in lieu of his pre-trial detention. Moreover, under the domestic case-law a decision on bail is a decision concerning pre-trial detention (see, for example, the opinion of the Supreme Court no. 4/97 of 11 June 1998). On the facts of the present case it is inconsistent for the State, on the one hand, to grant the applicant a right to compensation for the time spent in pre-trial detention (although the applicant did not apparently apply for such compensation in the present case, he cannot be criticised for that as it is a right and not an obligation) and, on the other hand, to forfeit his bail security which, moreover, represents an amount far in excess of any compensation he could have claimed.
