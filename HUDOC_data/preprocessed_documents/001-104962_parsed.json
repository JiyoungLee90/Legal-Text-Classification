The Court has held that the fact that, when consulting his case file, the lustrated person could not remove his own notes, taken in the secret registry, in order to show them to an expert or to use them for any other purpose, effectively prevented him from using the information contained in them as he had to rely solely on his memory (see Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 58).

It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case because what is accepted as an\u00a0exception must not become a norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depended to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remained classified as secret and the decision to maintain the confidentiality was left within the powers of the current secret services, created a situation in which the lustrated person\u2019s position was put at a clear disadvantage (see, Matyjek, \u00a7\u00a062; Luboch, \u00a7\u00a067; Rasmussen, \u00a7\u00a050, G\u00f3rny \u00a7\u00a040, all cited above).",
