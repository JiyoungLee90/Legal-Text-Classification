In her submission, France had not afforded full redress for the consequences, particularly the financial ones, of the failure to recognise her medical qualifications.

Such measures included, for example, extradition decisions relating to the residence of aliens, in which the administrative courts were intervening more and more and were thus being required to assess the conduct of foreign States. They also included the assessment of the applicability of international treaties within the territory of France. In the current legal context, a decision not to recognise the applicability of an international treaty could no longer be taken unilaterally and in isolation, in the applicant's submission, without regard to the conventions and rules governing the international community. Such an assessment was a judicial rather than a merely political matter and should thus be the task of the courts. ",

Adjudication entailed assessing, above all, the evidence adduced by the parties, but also all the other circumstances of the case and, in particular, the applicable rules.

Otherwise, the court would not be assessing the factual and legal issues before it and therefore did not have full jurisdiction. Although it was entitled to have recourse to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in rather the same way as it might have recourse to an expert, it should not in any circumstances refrain from examining the minister's clarifications.

The validity of the international undertaking entered into by the French State was therefore called into question, in the same way as if the French authorities had unilaterally decided to suspend it. This undoubtedly had a direct impact on France's foreign policy. The State in question could challenge the interpretation of its conduct and envisage retaliatory measures. In terms of its effects, therefore, the assessment of reciprocity also fell within the sphere of diplomatic relations. Furthermore, the reason why the administrative courts refused to deal with such questions, in the Government's submission, was that they considered that they would otherwise be infringing the principle of the separation of powers.

It dismissed the applicant's application purely on the ground that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated that Article 5 of the 1962 Government Declaration could not be regarded as having been in force on the relevant date, as it had not been applied by Algeria. However, even if consultation of the minister by the Conseil d'Etat may appear necessary in order to assess whether the reciprocity requirement has been satisfied, that court's current practice of referring a preliminary question for interpretation, as in the instant case, obliges it to abide by the opinion of the minister \u2013 an external authority who is also a representative of the executive \u2013 without subjecting that opinion to any criticism or discussion by the parties.",

In fact, when the applicant was apprised of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' observations, she produced to the Conseil d'Etat several pieces of factual evidence to show that the 1962 Government Declaration had indeed been applied by the Algerian government. These included statements from Algerian ministries certifying that medical qualifications obtained in France were recognised as being equivalent in Algeria. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not even consider that evidence and was therefore unwilling to assess whether it was well-founded. That is clear from the judgment delivered on 9 April 1999, in which the Conseil d'Etat held that it was not its task to assess whether Algeria had implemented the 1962 Government Declaration or to draw its own inferences in the event that the declaration had not been applied; it based its decision solely on the opinion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In so doing, the Conseil d'Etat considered itself to be bound by the opinion, thereby voluntarily depriving itself of the power to examine and take into account factual evidence that could have been crucial for the practical resolution of the dispute before it.",

She also claimed EUR 100,000 in respect of the non-pecuniary damage resulting from the dispute, which had lasted more than ten years, and from the fact that she had been prohibited from practising her profession from 1987 to 1999 and had therefore had her career destroyed.

As in Beaumartin, although the applicant was seeking compensation for loss of opportunity, the Court should, in the Government's submission, make an award in respect of non-pecuniary damage only. Secondly, the Government observed that the applicant's claims for damages covered the period from 1987 to 2001, whereas she had not relied on the 1962 Government Declaration until 1995 and had been authorised to practise as a doctor from 12 April 1999 onwards.
