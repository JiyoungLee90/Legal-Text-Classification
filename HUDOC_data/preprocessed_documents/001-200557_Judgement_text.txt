The case originated in an application (no. 83399/17) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Mr Vyacheslav Anatolyevich Andreyev and Mrs Svetlana Yuryevna Andreyeva (“the applicants”), on 25 November 2017.
The applicants were represented by Mr V.Ye. Solonovich, a lawyer based in Belogorsk. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 19 December 2018 the Government were given notice of the complaint concerning the quashing of a final judgment in the applicants’ favour following the extension of the time-limit for an ordinary appeal and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The first applicant was born in 1967. The second applicant was born in 1979. Both applicants live in Belogorsk.
On 28 July 2015 the Ministry of Defence (“the Ministry”) brought a case against the applicants claiming compensation for part of the flat allocated to the first applicant as a military officer and his family, as it exceeded the size stipulated under the domestic law.
On 28 September 2015 the Prikubanskiy District Court in Krasnodar dismissed the Ministry’s claims. In its judgment the district court indicated as follows:
“The representative of the Ministry of Defence was summoned to the hearing but failed to attend it. He submitted a request to examine a case without his participation and asked to grant his claim in full.”
It appears that on an unspecified date after the hearing the Prikubanskiy District Court sent the copy of the judgment to the Ministry. There is no evidence as to when the Ministry received the copy of that judgment.
On 13 January and then on 13 April 2016 the Ministry lodged a request to the Prikubanskiy District Court asking to send a copy of the judgment of 28 September 2015.
On 15 June 2016 the Ministry received a copy of the judgment and applied for an extension of the time-limit for appeal on 23 June 2016. They argued that the Ministry received a copy of the judgment after the time-limit for appeal had passed.
On 25 May 2017 the Krasnodar Regional Court granted the Ministry’s request and restored the time-limit for appeal.
On 18 July 2017 the Krasnodar Regional Court quashed the judgment of 28 September 2015 on appeal and granted the Ministry’s claims. The applicants were obliged to pay 589,384.56 Russian roubles (8,700 euros). The applicants unsuccessfully appealed against the judgment. On 31 July 2018 their appeal was dismissed by the single judge of the Supreme Court of Russia.
The relevant domestic law governing the extension of the time limits for appeal is summed up in the Court’s decision in the case of Samoylenko v. Russia (dec.) (no. 58068/13, §§ 27-30, 30 March 2017).
