He observed, in particular, that the French authorities had never demonstrated that the organisation of hunting through ACCAs resulted in better game management or improved safety. While small landowners currently had the option of banding together to create a plot of land with a surface area above the threshold and thus avoid having to join an ACCA, this had not been possible at the time the Louin ACCA had been set up, and the law did not allow landowners to remove their land from the ACCA\u2019s hunting grounds ex post facto, not even with a view to transferring it to a private entity that was coherent for hunting purposes. The principle of collective management of hunting grounds \u2013 which the applicant favoured, as the sole means of ensuring rational management of game stocks \u2013 did not necessitate a system of compulsory transfer of the kind provided for by the Loi Verdeille. That system resulted in the creation of collective hunting grounds on which third parties had the right to hunt against the wishes of the landowners, to the detriment of small landowners alone and on a \u201cvery small part of the country\u2019s hunting land\u201d. While he was not opposed to the creation of collective hunting grounds, the criteria applied for that purpose had to be rational. However, that was not the case with the surface area criterion employed by the Loi Verdeille, particularly since it applied to only a \u201cvery small part of the country\u2019s hunting land\u201d, was the sole criterion, was applied automatically and resulted in an irreversible situation.",

This was a purely subjective view which was contradicted by the fact that the members of the ACCA did not necessarily share the same ideas regarding hunting or even the same hunting practices. It was also mistaken in so far as persons with automatic membership had to pay the annual subscription if they wished to hunt and small landowners whose land had been subjected to compulsory transfer of the hunting rights before they acquired it did not obtain automatic membership of the ACCA.",

This not only deprived them of income but also affected the market value of the property. Furthermore, the ACCA was only required to make good any damage to their land caused by game within the limits of its liability for negligence under ordinary law.",

The Government referred to paragraphs 85 and 95 of the judgment, pointing in particular to the Court\u2019s finding that the difference in treatment between large and small landowners under the Loi Verdeille had been discriminatory and in breach of those combined provisions because the result had been \u201cto give only the former the right to use their land in accordance with their conscience\u201d.

However, that was not the basis on which the Court ultimately found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 read in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. It is clear from paragraph 95 that this finding was based on the fact that, within the category of landowners opposed to hunting for ethical reasons, only small landowners were obliged to tolerate the use of their property against their conscience. It was this fact that made the obligation on small landowners alone to participate in the system of ACCAs, giving rise to the impugned difference in treatment between large and small landowners, disproportionate to the aim pursued. In other words, it was the failure to respect the convictions of the landowners concerned which, in the end, led the Court to conclude that there had been no \u201creasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised\u201d and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention.",

In view of the fact that landowners who hunted and who transferred their rights to an ACCA were entitled, by way of compensation, to automatic membership and had the right to hunt throughout the association\u2019s hunting grounds, the Conseil d\u2019Etat held that this system did not amount to disproportionate interference with the right to property. It also stressed that the difference in treatment between small and large landowners of which the applicant complained was based on \u201cobjective and reasonable\u201d grounds since it had been introduced in the interests of hunters who owned small plots of land, who could thus join together to obtain larger hunting grounds. It added that the system was compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since the owners of small plots of land remained free to use their land for a purpose in keeping with their conscience (see paragraph 17 above).",

The Court reaffirmed this assessment in the Baudini\u00e8re and Vauzelle decision, cited above, stressing that \u201c[i]n thus seeking to control the impact of hunting on the ecological balance, the [French legislation] is aimed at the protection of the natural environment, an aim which, as the Court has held on numerous occasions, is indisputably in the general interest (see, for example, Lazaridi v. Greece, no. 31282/04, \u00a7\u00a034, 13 July 2006).\u201d",

In that regard, the Court finds convincing the explanations furnished in the present case by the Government to the effect that, in establishing the principle of pooling small hunting grounds within ACCAs, the legislature sought to remedy the problem of increasing scarcity of game, particularly in regions where properties were very fragmented. Furthermore, in the Baudini\u00e8re and Vauzelle decision, cited above, the Court acknowledged that the formation of large, regulated hunting entities as the result of the pooling of hunting grounds within the ACCAs was conducive to ecologically balanced game management. As the aim is to ensure better management of game stocks by encouraging hunting over large areas, it is understandable that the legislature should have deemed it unnecessary to impose the pooling of land on landowners who already had a large area enabling this aim to be achieved, even though this resulted in a difference in treatment between small and large landowners.",
