Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.; Ajayi and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999; Solomon v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5\u00a0September 2000).

The Court, seeing no reason for disagreeing with this general approach, observes that during a police interview on 15 November 1996 the applicants\u2019 mother conceded that she had previously given incorrect information to the police and other institutions about her own and her children\u2019s stay in  during this period. Thus, it seems that her children\u2019s family life was created in Norway at a time when she was aware that their immigration status in the country was such that the persistence of that family life would, since their return in 1996, be precarious (see Nunez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 71-76).

The Board merely referred to the reasoning and conclusion in the earlier decisions, and the High Court upholding the Board\u2019s decision did not rely on the argument. Without entering into the justification for the Immigration Appeals Board\u2019s decision of 31 May 2005 to order the second applicant\u2019s expulsion, the Court notes that his conviction in 2003 concerned one incident of aggravated violent assault (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 85) and that a long period of time has elapsed since then.
