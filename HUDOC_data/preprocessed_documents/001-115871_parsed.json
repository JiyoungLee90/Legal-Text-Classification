The final provisions in effect acknowledge that the judicial element in the High Council of Justice should be higher, but the solution chosen is to require the Parliament, the President, the educational institutions and the prosecutors to elect or appoint judges. ... In the current composition, one judge is a member ex officio (the Chairman of the Supreme Court) and some of the members appointed by the President and Parliament are de facto judges or former judges, but there is no legal requirement for this to be the case until the mandates of the present members expire. Together with the Minister of Justice and the General Prosecutor, 50% of the members belong to or are appointed by the executive or legislature. Therefore the High Council of Justice cannot be said to consist of a substantial part of judges. It may sometimes be the case in older democracies that the executive power has a decisive influence and in some countries, such systems may work acceptably in practice. The Ukrainian authorities themselves during the meetings in Kyiv referred to Ukraine as a transition democracy which is happy to use the experience of other countries. As it has been stated in former opinions, \u2018New democracies, however, did not yet have a chance to develop these traditions, which can prevent abuse and therefore, at least in these countries, explicit constitutional and legal provisions are needed as a safeguard to prevent political abuse in the appointment of judges\u2019.",

This body may not be free from any subordination to political party consideration. There are not enough guarantees ensuring that the HCJ safeguards the values and fundamental principles of justice. The composition is set up in the Constitution and a constitutional amendment would be required. The inclusion of the Prosecutor General as [an] ex officio member raises particular concerns, as it may have a deterren[t] effect [on] judges and be perceived as a potential threat. The Prosecutor General is a party to many cases which the judges have to decide, and his presence on a body concerned with the appointment, disciplining and removal of judges creates a risk that judges will not act impartially in such cases or that the Prosecutor General will not act impartially towards judges whose decisions he disapproves of. Consequently, the composition of the HCJ of Ukraine does not correspond to European standards. As a changed composition would require an amendment of the Constitution and this may be difficult, the Law should include, in order to counterbalance the flawed composition of the HCJ, a stronger regulation of incompatibilities. Taking into account the powers granted to the HCJ, it should work as a full time body and the elected members, unlike the ex officio members, should not be able to exercise any other public or private activity while sitting in the HCJ.",

It suggests that there is no uniform approach to the organisation of the system of judicial discipline in European countries. It may nevertheless be observed that in many European countries the grounds for the disciplinary liability of judges are defined in rather general terms (such as, for example, gross or repeated neglect of official duties resulting in the impression that a judge is manifestly unfit to hold office (Sweden)). Exceptionally, in Italy the law provides an all-inclusive list of thirty-seven different disciplinary violations concerning the behaviour of judges both in and outside their office. The sanctions for a disciplinary offence by a judge may include: warning, reprimand, transfer, downgrading, demotion, suspension of promotion, fine, salary reduction, temporary suspension from office, and dismissal with or without pension benefits. Dismissal of a judge as the most severe sanction is usually only ordered by a court; in some legal systems it can also be ordered by another institution such as a specialised disciplinary board of the Superior Council of Magistracy, but, as a rule, it is then subject to an appeal to court. With the exception of Switzerland, Parliament is not involved in the procedure; the system in Switzerland is, however, fundamentally different owing to the limited period of time for which judges are elected.",

While lustration proceedings in Poland leading likewise to the dismissal of the persons concerned may be analogous to a certain extent, the Court has held in that scenario that the relevant provisions of Polish legislation were not \u201cdirected at a group of individuals possessing a special status \u2013 in the manner, for example, of a disciplinary law\u201d, but covered a vast group of citizens; the proceedings resulted in an employment ban for a large number of public posts without an exhaustive list being provided by domestic law (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053-54, ECHR 2006VII). That case is therefore different, as in the present case the applicant, possessing a special status, was punished for failure to comply with his professional duties \u2013 that is, for an offence falling squarely under the disciplinary law. The sanction imposed on the applicant was a classic disciplinary measure for professional misconduct and, in terms of domestic law, it was contrasted with criminal-law sanctions for the adoption of a knowingly wrongful decision by a judge (see Article 375 of the Criminal Code above). It is also relevant to note here that the applicant\u2019s dismissal from the post of judge did not formally prevent him from practising law in another capacity within the legal profession.",

Austria, 24\u00a0February 1993, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 30, Series A no. 255-A, and Wettstein v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2000-XII).",

In particular, the Prosecutor General is placed at the top of the hierarchy of the prosecutorial system and supervises all prosecutors. In view of their functional role, prosecutors participate in many cases which judges have to decide. The presence of the Prosecutor General on a body concerned with the appointment, disciplining and removal of judges creates a risk that judges will not act impartially in such cases or that the Prosecutor General will not act impartially towards judges of whose decisions he disapproves (see paragraph 30 of the Venice Commission\u2019s Opinion, cited in paragraph 79 above). The same is true with respect to the other members of the HCJ appointed by the All-Ukrainian Conference of Prosecutors on a quota basis.

Moreover, one of those members (V.K.) was appointed President of the HCJ and presided over the hearing of the applicant\u2019s case.

Article 8 of the Convention \u201cprotects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world\u201d (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2002III). The notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d does not exclude in principle activities of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz v.\u00a0Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no. 251B). Therefore, restrictions imposed on access to a profession have been found to affect \u201cprivate life\u201d (see Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2004VIII, and Bigaeva v. Greece, no. 26713/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-25, 28 May 2009). Likewise, dismissal from office has been found to interfere with the right to respect for private life (see \u00d6zp\u0131nar v. Turkey, no.\u00a020999/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-48, 19 October 2010). Finally, Article 8 deals with the issues of protection of honour and reputation as part of the right to respect for private life (see Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7\u00a035, 15 November 2007, and A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-64, 9\u00a0April 2009).",

It is a logical consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application that the wording of statutes is not always precise. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR 2004I).",

It follows that a description of an offence in a statute, based on a list of specific behaviours but aimed at general and uncountable application, does not provide a guarantee for addressing properly the matter of the foreseeability of the law. The other factors affecting the quality of legal regulation and the adequacy of the legal protection against arbitrariness should be identified and examined.",

Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2004I; Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no.\u00a071503/01, \u00a7 198, ECHR 2004II; and Ila\u015fcu and Others v.
