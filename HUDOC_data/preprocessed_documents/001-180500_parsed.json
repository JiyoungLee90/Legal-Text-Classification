In particular, the six-month rule is autonomous and must be construed and applied to the facts of each individual case, so as to ensure the effective exercise of the right to individual petition. While taking account of domestic law and practice is an important aspect, it is not decisive in determining the starting point of the six-month period (see Sabri G\u00fcne\u015f v.

The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies therefore requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of his or her Convention grievances. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (ibid., \u00a7 71).",

In particular, the Court held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 \u201csecures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal\u201d (see Golder, cited above, \u00a7 36). This \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is an aspect, may be relied on by anyone who considers on arguable grounds that an interference with the exercise of his or her civil rights is unlawful and complains that no possibility was afforded to submit that claim to a court meeting the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, inter alia, Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, \u00a7 117, ECHR\u00a02005X). The right to a court includes not only the right to institute proceedings but also the right to obtain a determination of the dispute by a court (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 43; Kuti\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 48778/99, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2002-II; Menshakova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 377/02, \u00a7 52, 8 April 2010; F\u0103lie v. Romania, no. 23257/04, \u00a7 22, 19 May 2015; Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2016 (extracts); and Kardo\u0161 v. Croatia, no. 25782/11, \u00a7 48, 26 April 2016). Finally, the Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not compel the States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation. Nevertheless, a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before them the fundamental guarantees contained in Article 6 (see, among other authorities, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, \u00a7 25 in fine, Series A no. 11, and Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 122, ECHR 2000XI).",

France, 26 March 1992, \u00a7 40, Series A no.\u00a0234B). It is further observed that the relevant provision of the Criminal Procedure Code in force at the time clearly entitled an injured party to lodge an appeal against the first-instance judgment relating to the costs, which included the costs and fees of their representative (see paragraph 25 in fine above). The applicants submit, and the Government do not contest, that the Court of Appeal has actually never ruled on such an appeal filed by the applicants as injured parties. This was further confirmed by the President of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 13 above) and by the High Court (see paragraph 22 above).\u00a0Lastly, no information has been submitted to the Court in which the Court of Appeal itself confirms that the applicants\u2019 appeal remains under consideration. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants have been effectively deprived of having their civil claim determined by a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kardo\u0161 v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-58). There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
