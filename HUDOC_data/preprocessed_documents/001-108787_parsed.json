In such circumstances, and given the absence of any \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1(c), the Court considers that the applicants\u2019 detention on false charges that they had resisted arrest and insulted police officers cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Brega, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

Moreover in the light of the Court\u2019s established case law in this field (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8\u00a0June 1976, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, Series A no. 22 and Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7\u00a7 92-95, Series A no. 39) it would appear that the applicant\u2019s situation did in fact amount to such a deprivation. In addition, the Government did not give any explanation for the actions of the police and it would therefore appear that\u00a0the deprivation of liberty did not fall within the scope of any of the exceptions to the rule of personal liberty listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 of the Convention. It is true that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty lasted for a very limited period of time. However, it appears clearly from the materials of the case that the police officers\u2019 intention was to hinder him from taking part in the demonstration by driving him away from its scene. The deprivation of liberty was sufficiently long to make it impossible for the applicant to achieve his goal of participating in the demonstration. In view of the context and of the special circumstances of the case the Court considers that the second applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and unlawful.",
