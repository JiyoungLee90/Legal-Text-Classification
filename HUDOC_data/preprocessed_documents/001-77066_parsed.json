It recalls that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Gizzatova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5124/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 13 January 2005; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004). Having regard to the materials in its possession and the fact that the Government did not furnish any objection to the applicant's method of calculation of compensation, the Court awards the applicant EUR 13,000 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
