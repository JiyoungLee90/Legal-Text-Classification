The letter of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the  of 7 April 2002 stated in this respect that on 9 March 2002 a VAZ\u00a021099 car had approached a checkpoint of military unit no. 3179 situated about 4 km away from the outskirts of Stariye Atagi on the road between Chechen-Aul and Stariye Atagi.

It notes, in particular, that it follows from the decision of the Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the UGA of 9 September 2006 that the car with several persons in it, which had already been shot at and set on fire, was crushed by an APC, which is further supported by photographs of the car submitted by the applicants. No explanation has been provided to the Court as to why an action as drastic as this was necessary in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Court considers that even assuming that Mr\u00a0Ismail Dzhamayev was killed in the circumstances described by the Government, the latter have not justified their submission that the use of force was no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d.",

Furthermore, the investigation was resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times due to the need to take additional investigative measures (see, in particular, paragraphs 38 and 53). However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. This applies even more so to the decision of 26 March 2007 to discontinue the investigation, which was not provided either to the applicants or to the Court.

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee and the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7\u00a064, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III).",
