In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18\u00a0January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch, \u00a7 34, and Salman, \u00a7 100, both cited above).",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. This means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 103 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). They must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7 107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov, cited above, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Further, the investigation must be expedient. The Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). It has also given consideration to the promptness in opening investigations, delays in taking statements and to the length of time taken for the initial inquiry (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

Under Russian law, the applicant's criminal complaint, supported by that information on the elements of a criminal offence, was sufficient grounds for opening a criminal case (see paragraph 41 above). However, a criminal case has never been opened and the refusal to institute criminal proceedings was upheld by the prosecutor's office and the  courts. In the absence of a criminal case the applicant could not be granted the procedural status of victim, which restricted his participation in the investigation and prevented him from exercising the rights attached to that procedural status, including the right to lodge applications or the right to put questions to the medical expert (see paragraph 42 above). It cannot therefore be said that the applicant's right to participate effectively in the investigation was secured (compare Denis Vasilyev v.

After the investigator had accepted the version of events according to which the applicant had been beaten up by persons other than police officers the day before he was taken into custody, he refused to institute criminal proceedings despite abundant medical evidence of a criminal act and did not make any attempt to identify the probable perpetrators, to inspect the crime scene or to examine witnesses who may have seen the applicant on that day.

The investigator saw the visible injuries on the applicant's person but had taken no action in this connection besides noting that the applicant claimed to have been beaten up by unknown persons. The presence of the police officers allegedly implicated in the ill-treatment must have inhibited the applicant's ability to speak freely but the investigator did not remove them from the office and did not open an inquiry into the origin of the applicant's injuries on his own initiative. Since Mr N. was in charge of investigating the criminal case in which the applicant had been a suspect, he obviously had a vested interest in obtaining a statement from him and overlooking the circumstances in which that statement had been obtained. A subsequent verification of the applicant's complaint about the ill-treatment by the police was entrusted to the same Mr N. In the Court's view, the lack of independence of the investigator from those implicated in the events further undermined the effectiveness of the investigation (see Mehmet Emin Y\u00fcksel v.

The applicant and his counsel repeatedly requested that the investigator and subsequently the  courts assess the lawfulness of that situation (see paragraphs 29 and 33 above); however, all the domestic decisions passed over that point in silence. The normal chain of appeals was concluded with the final decision of the  dated 9 November 2004 when the applicant must have become aware of the ineffectiveness of the criminal-law complaint. He introduced his complaint to the Court by letter of 23 March 2005 and then submitted the completed application form on 29 July 2005. For the reasons set out in paragraph 45 above, the Court is satisfied that the application was lodged within six months of the 's judgment of 9 November 2004. In these circumstances, the Government's objection must be dismissed.",

The absence of a record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Fedotov v.
