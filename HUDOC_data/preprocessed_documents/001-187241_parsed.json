Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. , \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV, and Ertak v. Turkey, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-V).",

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government\u2019s position in this regard and assuming that the applicants\u2019 abducted relatives were under the control of State agents after abduction, then the period of time which has elapsed since each person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. The Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere \u201cirregular detention\u201d in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2000VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government\u2019s objection in this respect should be rejected.",

In the cases at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings was plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12325). Each was subjected to several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crimes.
