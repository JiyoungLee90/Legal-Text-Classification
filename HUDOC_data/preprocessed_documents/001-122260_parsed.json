In this latter respect, they referred to Article 134 of the Constitution, which provided that the Constitution may be amended at the suggestion of the Russian President, both chambers of the national parliament, the Russian Government, the legislatures of the regions of Russia, and a group of one fifth of the members of either of the two chambers of the Russian parliament. They further argued that, under Article 33 of the Constitution, Russian citizens had the right to address their suggestions and complaints to the competent authorities in Russia. The Government thus argued that, taking into account the applicant\u2019s active civic position, before applying to the Court, he should have addressed his complaint to the \u201celected institutions of the Russian authorities, such as the Russian President, or the lower chamber of the Russian parliament\u201d.",

The Government stressed that a draft of the Russian Constitution of 1993 had been thoroughly prepared by specially created institutions, such as the Constitutional Commission of the Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, which had comprised public representatives \u2013 legislators and experts \u2013 and the Constitutional Council, the composition of which had been even broader. After years of debate and experts\u2019 work, the draft had then been submitted for nationwide public discussion and debate in which every Russian national could have expressed his or her opinion. Thereafter the Constitution, in its present form, had been adopted following a nationwide vote. The Government thus argued that the majority of the Russian citizens who had taken part in that vote had clearly expressed their support for the provisions of the Constitution, including the one disenfranchising convicted prisoners serving a prison sentence.",

Nor is there any place under the Convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for automatic disenfranchisement based purely on what might offend public opinion (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 70). According to the Court, this standard of tolerance does not prevent a democratic society from taking steps to protect itself against activities intended to destroy the rights or freedoms set forth in the Convention. Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which enshrines the individual\u2019s capacity to influence the composition of the law-making power, does not therefore exclude that restrictions on electoral rights could be imposed on an individual who has, for example, seriously abused a public position or whose conduct threatened to undermine the rule of law or democratic foundations. The severe measure of disenfranchisement must not, however, be resorted to lightly and the principle of proportionality requires a discernible and sufficient link between the sanction and the conduct and circumstances of the individual concerned (ibid., \u00a7 71).",

It found that the provision \u201cimpose[d] a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners in prison. It applie[d] automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances.\u201d It concluded that \u201csuch a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 82).

The Court reiterated, in particular, that when disenfranchisement affected a group of people generally, automatically and indiscriminately, based solely on the fact that they are serving a prison sentence, irrespective of the length of the sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances, it was not compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Scoppola (no. 3) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 96). The Court found no violation of that Convention provision in the particular circumstances of this latter case however, having distinguished it from the Hirst (no. 2) case. It observed that in Italy disenfranchisement was applied only in respect of certain offences against the State or the judicial system, or offences punishable by a term of imprisonment of three years or more, that is, those which the courts considered to warrant a particularly harsh sentence. The Court thus considered that \u201cthe legal provisions in Italy defining the circumstances in which individuals may be deprived of the right to vote show[ed] the legislature\u2019s concern to adjust the application of the measure to the particular circumstances of [each] case, taking into account such factors as the gravity of the offence committed and the conduct of the offender\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 106). As a result, the Italian system could not be said to have a general automatic and indiscriminate character, and therefore the Italian authorities had not overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to them in that sphere (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).",

Indeed, the applicants were stripped of their right to vote by virtue of Article 32 \u00a7 3 of the Russian Constitution which applied to all persons convicted and serving a custodial sentence, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances (compare Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 82 and, compare, by contrast, Scoppola (no. 3) [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105-10). The Court notes the finding of the Lipetsk Regional Court during the examination of the second applicant\u2019s complaint to the effect that, as a convicted prisoner, he was ineligible to vote in elections, that he had served his custodial sentence in prison \u2013 a type of detention facility in which only individuals convicted of particularly serious offences punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding five years were detained (see paragraph 23 above). This finding can be understood as suggesting that the ban on voting rights only applies to convicted prisoners serving their custodial sentence in prison, that is, to those convicted of particularly serious offences and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than five years. However, such an interpretation is not in conformity with the wording of Article 32 \u00a7 3 of the Russian Constitution (see paragraph 31 above), and the respondent Government adduced no domestic case-law indicating that only those convicted of serious offences were disenfranchised.",

In particular, in so far as the Government referred to its wide margin of appreciation in the relevant field and to a historical tradition in Russia of imposing a ban on electoral rights of convicted prisoners in detention dating back to the beginning of the nineteenth century (see paragraphs 87 and 88 above), and contended that the relevant provisions of Article 32 of the Russian Constitution corresponded to Russia\u2019s current democratic vision (see paragraph 87 above), the Court reiterates that although the margin of appreciation is wide, it is not all-embracing (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 82). Moreover, as has already been noted in paragraph 94 above, the right to vote is not a privilege; in the twenty-first century, the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion and universal suffrage has become the basic principle. In the light of modern-day penal policy and of current human rights standards, valid and convincing reasons should be put forward for the continued justification of maintaining such a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote as that provided for in Article 32 \u00a7 3 of the Russian Constitution (ibid., \u00a7 79).",

The Court finds that this is a significant figure and that the measure in question cannot be claimed to be negligible in its effects (ibid., \u00a7 77).",

In fact, as has already been noted in paragraph 101 above, Article 32 \u00a7 3 of the Russian Constitution imposes a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners serving their prison sentence (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 77 and 82).",

However, there is no evidence that, when deciding whether or not an immediate custodial sentence should be imposed, they take into account the fact that such a sentence will involve the disenfranchisement of the offender concerned, or that they can make any realistic assessment of the proportionality of disenfranchisement in the light of the particular circumstances of each case. It is therefore not apparent, beyond the fact that a court considers it appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment, that there is any direct link between the facts of any individual case and the removal of the right to vote (ibid, \u00a7 77).",

With a view to securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Contracting States may decide either to leave it to the courts to determine the proportionality of a measure restricting convicted prisoners\u2019 voting rights, or to incorporate provisions into their laws defining the circumstances in which such a measure should be applied.

In that connection the Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law, a Contracting Party is responsible under Article 1 of the Convention for all acts and omissions of its organs regardless of whether the act or omission in question was a consequence of domestic law or of the necessity to comply with international legal obligations (see, among other authorities, Nada, cited above, \u00a7 168).
