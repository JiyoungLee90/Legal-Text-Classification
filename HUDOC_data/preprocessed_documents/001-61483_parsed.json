In consequence, his appeal was finally rejected on 5\u00a0January\u00a01996 (see paragraph 23 above). Moreover, on 6\u00a0January\u00a01997 the applicant requested the court to re-open the proceedings which ended with the above-mentioned partial decision and following his appeals this set of proceedings ended on 27\u00a0July\u00a01998. In addition, the applicant challenged the presiding judge (see paragraph 26 above), disputed the manner in which the minutes of hearings were taken and requested to record them on audiocassette (see paragraph 31 above), asked to punish a witness and the petitioner (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above), challenged appointment of the court-experts (see paragraphs 21 and 32 above) and asked the court to re-open the proceedings concerning exemption from the court-fees (see paragraphs 17 above).

The Court reiterates that while the applicant is entitled to make use of his procedural rights, he must bear the consequences when it leads to delays (see, Malicka-W\u0105sowska v.

The Court observes that the District Court gave on 8 January 1995 a partial decision, nevertheless, as regards the remaining part of the petitioner's claim no decision had been given yet. The Court further notes that no hearings were held between December 1994 and March 1996 as well as between May 1996 and May 1997, however, these delays were to a certain degree caused by the applicant (see paragraph 56 above). After 23\u00a0August\u00a01999 the District Court waited for expert opinions to be prepared and no hearings were held until at least March 2001 when the first of these opinions reached the court. Although during that time the trial court took some action, it does not explain such long delay between the hearings. In this context the Court notes that the expert's work in the context of judicial proceedings is supervised by a judge, who remains responsible for the preparation and speedy conduct of proceedings (see, the Proszak v.\u00a0Poland judgment of 16\u00a0December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII, \u00a7 44).",
