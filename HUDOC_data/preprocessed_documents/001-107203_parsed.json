It could thus not be said that this conviction amounted to an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d within the meaning of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 2000. The applicant pointed out that she had not sought to conceal her past conviction vis-\u00e0-vis the Netherlands authorities; she had simply answered the questions put to her when she applied for a provisional residence visa and no question had been put to her about any criminal prosecutions or sentences.

The guidelines did apply when the applicant\u2019s objection was determined on 7 June 2004. Furthermore, these sentencing guidelines only related to a very specific group of drug couriers, namely the so-called \u201cbody packers\u201d (\u201cbolletjesslikkers\u201d) arrested at Schiphol airport. The guidelines were drawn up as part of an attempt to deal with the exponential increase as from the end of 2001 in cocaine smuggling by couriers via Schiphol airport, creating capacity problems in various parts of the criminal justice system. The Government further submitted that in any event, under the policy on initial permission for residence, the severity of the sentence played no role in the application of the public order criterion. It was sufficient that the offence of which a petitioner had been convicted was a serious one (misdrijf) under Dutch law and that the comparable sentence in the  would be a term of unsuspended imprisonment or detention order, an alternative sanction or a fine. Therefore, even assuming that in the applicant\u2019s case the lightest prison sentence under the sentencing guidelines, i.e. five months, was applicable, her application for a residence permit would still have been refused.",

A stay in the host country in these circumstances remained uncertain and it did not follow from the fact that such permission enables the alien concerned to establish or intensify family life that the alien was entitled to expect that his/her residence will be tolerated.",

However, the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar. In the context of both positive and negative obligations the State must strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. The Court does not find it necessary to determine whether in the present case the impugned refusal to grant the applicant a residence permit and to impose an exclusion order on her constitute an interference with her right to respect for her family life or is to be seen as one involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation. In the context of both positive and negative obligations the State must strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole.

Another important consideration will also be whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would be precarious from the outset. The Court has previously held that where this is the case it is likely only to be in the most exceptional circumstances that the removal of the non-national family member will constitute a violation of Article 8 (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, no. 50435/99, \u00a7 39 with further references, ECHR 2006I).",

As regards the severity of the offence at issue, the Court reiterates that, in view of the devastating effects of drugs on people\u2019s lives, it understands why the authorities show great firmness towards those who actively contribute to the spread of this scourge (see, for instance, Dalia v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 54, Reports 1998I; and Baghli v. France, no. 34374/97, \u00a7 48, ECHR 1999VIII).",

The severity of this offence must therefore weigh heavily in the balance. In so far as the applicant raises arguments based on sentencing guidelines used in the Netherlands by the Haarlem Regional Court in relation to the decision to impose an exclusion order on her, the Court does not find it necessary to determine these arguments as these guidelines did not exist at the time when the offences of which the applicant was convicted in Germany were committed.",

The latter was issued in view of a positive recommendation from the Aliens Police Service. Only once she was in the , when filing a request for a temporary regular residence permit, did she discover that requirement, which she obviously could not comply with and which explains her refusal to sign the declaration. In our view, it was an honest move on the part of the applicant. Moreover, under the national law \u201can application for a provisional residence visa is in principle assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit\u201d (see paragraph 31). Since August 2001 the applicant\u2019s immigration status has been examined by various authorities. It is in fact this examination of the various factors by the authorities that is of interest for the purposes of Article 8 and not the outcome per se.",

The Deputy Minister considered that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her family life was justified in the interests of public safety. At that stage, no analysis was made of her behaviour since the conviction, the time that had elapsed since the offence was committed, other factors indicating that it was a genuine couple, and so on. Later on the Minister for Immigration also primarily emphasised the conviction factor, adding that the family would have no obvious problems in following the applicant to . Only the Regional Court noted that eight years had elapsed since the conviction, that the marriage and the birth of the child had taken place after the exclusion order was imposed and that the family could move to Venezuela, and drew a distinction with the case of Boultif v. , no. 54273/00, ECHR 2001IX, in which the applicant had been granted a residence permit and was subject to expulsion. We agree that the factors established in the Boultif case, as long as it is recognised that Article 8 also applies to illegal aliens, all have to be taken into account and balanced against each other. The problem that we have in this case \u2013 again as long as it is accepted that Article 8 applies \u2013 has to do with the manner in which the  authorities assessed and weighed up all the factors. It may well be that they would have arrived at the same conclusion and it may well be that the public-order consideration was particularly strong in this case. But the State is required, under Article 8, to have due regard to the other factors. For example, it could very well be the case that the main reason for the applicant giving birth to the child in 2004 was her age. The authorities should have considered that possibility and should not have assumed that this was a deliberate act undertaken on account of the applicant\u2019s difficult immigration situation. In other words, from the facts, as presented in the case, it is difficult to see to what extent the authorities had regard to the personality of the applicant and her true family situation, which should have been balanced against the public-order considerations.",

This was a situation which emerged by virtue of the legislation and, we should say, a certain inconsistency between the administrative-law avenue for challenging an exclusion order of no suspensive effect and the position under criminal law regarding the stay of aliens following an exclusion order (see paragraphs 36-38). The alleged criminal offence of the applicant (see paragraph 59) was not of her doing for as long as, at least theoretically, there were remedies by which she could challenge the exclusion order.",
