Looking at the different reasons and the sequence in which they were given, one can now safely deduce that the first reasons given were only designed to cover up the real reasoning behind the refusal. The same applies to the last reasons given: it would be totally unrealistic to accept that the permission was initially refused because the organisers had not assumed any responsibility as regards the demonstration\u2019s good management. Admittedly, the Supreme Court in its decision of 18 October 2006 paid much attention to this new line of reasoning. But if that had been the real reason behind the refusal, it should have been put forward right at the beginning.

The Government claimed that assemblies were not allowed in general, whereas the applicant association showed that some assemblies had in fact been allowed. The majority consider that this fact indicates a difference in treatment in relation to the applicant association. Second, the majority find that the arguments of the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Mayor\u2019s Office in the court proceedings were of a discriminatory character.

For example, the statement by the Mayor\u2019s Office that it had received protest letters from numerous Moldovan citizens asking it to prohibit the gay parade is most likely true. The fact that the Mayor\u2019s Office brought this fact to the attention of the national courts per se does not confirm that it adopted a discriminatory attitude or, for that matter, that the national courts agreed or disagreed with its request. In the final instance the national courts mentioned two grounds for their decision to uphold the ban imposed by the Mayor\u2019s Office. The first ground was the danger to public order and morality and the second ground was that the organisers had not complied with the prescription of the law requiring them to accept responsibility for the event. These reasons in themselves are neither discriminatory nor unreasonable. The fact that two different compositions of the same court might disagree on the outcome of the case is not arbitrary in itself either.",

Poland (no.\u00a013102/02, 2 March 2010), in which the Court said that where a difference in treatment was based solely on sexual orientation, it constituted a violation of the Convention. In view of this criterion, the majority should have assessed whether the applicant association\u2019s assembly was banned solely on this ground, as compared to the other bans of assemblies that the Government referred to, in relation to which the Court has had the opportunity to render several judgments regarding the same period of time. The Government argued that there was a general atmosphere of intolerance towards different views at the time in . It certainly cannot be said that the applicant association was the only group whose right to assembly was restricted (contrast Or\u0161u\u0161 and Others v. Croatia [GC], no. 15766/03, \u00a7\u00a0155, ECHR 2010). There may indeed be some truth in what the Government stated about the rather intolerant political situation in the country at the time.",

Such a difference in treatment will amount to discrimination if \u201cit has no objective and reasonable justification\u201d, that is, if it does not pursue a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d or if there is not a \u201creasonable relationship of proportionality\u201d between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many other authorities, Larkos v.

Where the difference in treatment is based on race, colour or ethnic origin, the notion of objective and reasonable justification must be interpreted as strictly as possible (see Sampanis and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a032526/05, \u00a7 69, 5 June 2008). We might add that in view of the Kozak case (cited above), sexual orientation should be added to this list.",
