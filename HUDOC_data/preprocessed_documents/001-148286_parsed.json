For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7 66-68, 3\u00a0May 2007). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a020652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 5962, ECHR\u00a02003III).

They also submitted that the applicants had been convicted of an administrative offence for their failure to follow the police instruction to stop the march, imposed in accordance with section 17.4 of the Federal Law on Assemblies. That provision stipulated the imposition of administrative liability on participants of public events for non-compliance with lawful orders of the police.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation.

The Court considers that in the dispute over the key facts underlying the charges where the only witnesses for the prosecution were the police officers who had played an active role in the contested events, it was indispensable for the Justice of the Peace and the Tverskoy District Court to exhaust every reasonable possibility of verifying their incriminating statements (see Kasparov, cited above, \u00a7 64).

Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 \u00a7 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Giulia Manzoni v.

However, instead of being released at 2.30 a.m. on 6 December 2011, the applicants were formally remanded in custody to secure their attendance at the hearing before the Justice of the Peace. The Government argued that the term of the applicants\u2019 detention remained within the forty-eight-hour time-limit provided for by Article 27.5 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences. However, neither the Government nor any other domestic authorities have provided any justification for the choice of that provisional measure. The Court reiterates that the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less stringent measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or the public interest, which might require that the person concerned be detained. It does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold\u00a0Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2000III, and Enhorn v.\u00a0Sweden, no.\u00a056529/00, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2005I). On the face of it, there was no reason to believe that the applicants would abscond or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, and in any event, it fell on the authorities to demonstrate any such risk. In the absence of any explicit reasons against the applicants\u2019 release given by the authorities, the Court considers that the overnight detention at the Kitay-Gorod police station was unjustified and arbitrary.",

In addition to the various artificial procedural constraints that the applicants\u2019 counsels had to face, it is indeed scandalous that the first applicant\u2019s defence counsel was not even allowed to put three very pertinent questions to the detaining police officers: \u201cWhat orders did you personally give to Mr Navalnyy?\u201d, \u201cWho gave the order to arrest Mr Navalnyy?\u201d and \u201cWhy were two policemen\u2019s reports identical?\u201d",

Furthermore, to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on the basis of the procedural shortcomings referred to above, as the Chamber rightly did in paragraph 83, and simultaneously to assume that the police version of the facts was true, is clearly unacceptable. The Chamber criticises the domestic courts for having based their judgments \u201cexclusively on the version put forward by the police\u201d, and yet at the same time it accepts the police version of events. I find this incomprehensible. Put simply, paragraph 67 is logically incompatible with paragraph 83 of the judgment. The exact same reasons which led the Chamber to find \u2013 correctly \u2013 a violation of Article 6 of the Convention should have prevented the Chamber from assuming that the police version of the facts, that is, the Government\u2019s version, was true. On the contrary, the totally discredited manner in which the domestic authorities proceeded during the applicants\u2019 trials is a very strong signal that the police version of the facts could not be assumed to be a truthful and accurate representation of the facts, but a re-construction of the reality in order to frame the applicants. If one adds to the domestic courts\u2019 reproachable conduct the conduct of the police, who dragged the applicants around for six hours between three consecutive police stations without any plausible reason and unlawfully remanded them in custody overnight in the appalling conditions of the Kitay-Gorod police station without access to food and drinking water, the ensuing scenario of arbitrariness is telling of how unreliable the police version of the facts was, and ultimately of how adverse were the circumstances in which the applicants sought to make their voices heard in the public arena.",

By alleviating the Government of their burden of proof, the Chamber sided with the Government\u2019s version of the facts, for no plausible reason. Since the Government did not provide enough evidence that these facts indeed occurred, as the Chamber rightly stated in paragraph 59, the Court should have concluded that the police version of events was unfounded, and therefore no \u201cmarch\u201d had taken place, no police order was given and, consequently, no disobedience ever occurred.

This confusion between the \u201cmarch\u201d and the \u201cperceived march\u201d, as if these concepts could be equated in legal terms, also appears in paragraph 64.

Thus, \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d refer to cases when \u201can immediate response to a current event is warranted in the form of a demonstration\u201d. Put simply, in order to be considered as a spontaneous assembly there must be a common purpose among the members of an assembly to join together and demonstrate in response to a new event. The same applies to spontaneous moving assemblies, such as marches. Such \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d are protected by Article 11 of the Convention.",

In fact, the demonstration had already taken place at Chistyye Prudy and people were simply leaving the place of assembly. No credible evidence was put forward before the Court that the people leaving the place of assembly at Chistyye Prudy had the common purpose of marching together to another place. A fortiori, no case was made out that the applicants and their followers intentionally initiated a march as an \u201cimmediate response\u201d to a new event. Hence, the legal qualification of the facts of the case as a \u201cspontaneous march\u201d is legally flawed. The legal problem raised by this case lies elsewhere.",

The events subsequent to their arrest strongly reinforce the conviction that the applicants were subjected to intentional police arbitrariness, which was then condoned by the domestic courts.
