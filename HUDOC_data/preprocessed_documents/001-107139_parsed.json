The cell in which they were held measured 16.28 square metres. The applicants alleged that six inmates were held in the cell. The Government, while acknowledging that there were six sleeping places in the cell, stated that the number of inmates varied between five and six but provided no official documents to demonstrate that during the period of the applicants\u2019 detention fewer then six inmates were held in their cell. In this connection, the Court notes that the overcrowding in the prison in question has been acknowledged by the prison authorities. During the relevant period the occupancy of the prison twice exceeded its official capacity (see paragraph 44 above). The situation was particularly serious as regards remand prisoners (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). The Court therefore finds that even if occasionally they were afforded a little more than 3 square metres of personal space, the applicants were at least for a significant part of their detention held in a cell in which the personal space available to them was 2.7 square metres, which was further reduced by the furniture in the cell. This state of affairs in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Sulejmanovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 44, and Modarca v. Moldova, no. 14437/05, \u00a7 63, 10 May 2007).",

As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it is hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It is true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell. This, however, cannot make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spent time outside of the overcrowded cell. The Court moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer 2009 were by average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant\u2019s complaint concerning high temperatures in the cell was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 49 above). The Court therefore finds that during the summer the conditions of the applicants\u2019 detention were further exacerbated by the very high temperatures in the cell.",

They were also allowed to shower once a day in a shower room which contained partitions between the shower heads. It further observes that the sanitary annex contained a functioning ventilation system.

In view of these findings, the Court does not find it necessary to undertake the fact-finding measures suggested by the Government (see paragraph 70 above) as these measures would not be able to alter the above conclusion.",

The court found in favour of the plaintiff, a detainee who spent about six months (in the period between July 2006 and March 2007) in  prison as a remand prisoner. For most of that time he was held together with five other detainees in a cell of about 18 square metres. The court found that all four elements of civil tort were established, namely: unlawful act, occurrence of damage, causal link and the defendant\u2019s responsibility. The court noted that there had been no jurisprudence on this matter so far and that this was the first judgment to establish the principles for the future. Referring also to Kalashnikov v. , no. 47095/99, ECHR 2002VI, the court noted that the rights guaranteed by the Convention represented minimum standards and that the protection afforded by the national legislation should go beyond this minimum. It found that the personal space afforded to the claimant was far below the standard of 7 square metres for multi-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT and provided in the section 27 of the Regulation on the Execution of Sentence and was therefore in breach of the claimant\u2019s personal rights. The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect also on other aspects of dentition and found in this connection that the claimant\u2019s personal rights had been breached also on account of poor ventilation, disturbances during night, verbal and physical conflicts in the cell, the impossibility for him to eat his meal at the table and to use the telephone for at least ten minutes as provided in the regulations. Moreover, the court found that these conditions amounted also to a violation of Article 18 of the Slovenian Constitution which prohibited torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. The claimant was awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 2,290\u00a0euros\u00a0(EUR).",

Consequently, noting that the applicants were detained at the time they lodged their applications, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied their situation. However, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts. Therefore, as things stand, the civil claim for compensation cannot be considered to be sufficiently certain in practice as regards compensation claimed in respect of allegedly inadequate prison conditions.",
