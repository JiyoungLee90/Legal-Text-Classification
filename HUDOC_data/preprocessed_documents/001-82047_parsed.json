Russia, no.\u00a036494/02, \u00a7\u00a016, 24\u00a0February 2005). The Court observes that after the authorities' failure to comply with the judgment of 24 May 1999, the applicant brought new successful proceedings seeking damages (see paragraph 7 above). Those decisions, had they been duly enforced, could arguably have constituted a remedy against the State's previous failure to comply with the judgment (see Petrushko v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015-16; compare Derkach v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a03352/05, 3 May 2007). However, the new judgments remained without enforcement for long periods of time.

Consequently, the Government's argument is dismissed. The Court accepts that the applicant suffered distress because of the State authorities' failure to enforce in good time several judgments in her favour. However, the amount claimed in respect of non-pecuniary damage appears excessive.
