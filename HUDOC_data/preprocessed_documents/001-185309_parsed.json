A maintained that he had been beaten by the second applicant and B had told her foster home that she, A and the first applicant had all been beaten by the second applicant. It was mainly the first applicant who had cared for the children. Hospital and Social Council staff, as well as relatives, had for a long time been worried about her psychological health and encouraged her to seek help. She had denied that she needed help and had refused all treatment. All of the children had lacked communication and emotional response from their parents, which had affected their psychosocial development and their ability to interact socially with other children as well as adults. A was hyperactive and had difficulties following rules and functioning in social situations. His behaviour corresponded to several of the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). B was remarkably silent and withdrawn. Psychiatrists had assessed that she was traumatised and had recommended therapeutic treatment combined with a safe environment where she did not have to deny her experiences. Both she and C were behind in their language development and lacked the ability to express their emotions. Several instances had, over the years, emphasised the children\u2019s need for emotional contact with the applicants. The second applicant had failed to compensate for the first applicant\u2019s inability in this regard and neither of the applicants had managed to establish routines for the children\u2019s basic needs such as food, hygiene, clothes and necessary medical care. Thus, the applicants\u2019 ability to care for their children properly was questioned. The applicants\u2019 impulsive behaviour had led to an unstable and insecure living situation for the children, such as when they had suddenly decided to move to Iran. There was an imminent risk that the applicants would again travel to Iran with their children. All of the children were in need of stability and an environment with clear rules and structure, including stable adults who could compensate for their previous lack of emotional care.",

It found that the signs of lack of proper care which had appeared during the investigation in 2007 now appeared even more clearly. The investigations carried out after the decision on public care in June 2009 indicated that all of the children had special needs which had been neglected. Additionally, the court noted that both A and B had told various persons, in different situations, that they had been beaten by the second applicant. Although these accusations had not led to any charges against the second applicant, the court stressed that this information had to be taken seriously, since the main purpose of the 1990 Act was to protect the child. Moreover, the court observed that the Social Council had had difficulties carrying out the investigation correctly, mainly due to the applicants\u2019 unwillingness or inability to cooperate with the authorities. The applicants\u2019 unwillingness to cooperate had also manifested itself in their decision to move twice to another country, which had also jeopardised the security and stability of the children\u2019s environment. Making an overall assessment, the appellate court found that the investigations strongly indicated that the applicants had failed to care for their children properly and that they lacked understanding of the children\u2019s special needs and their own inability to care for them. Thus, there was a real risk of damage to the children\u2019s health and development. Lastly, the court noted that both of the applicants had declared that they were willing to receive help from the Social Council while, at the same time, they had refuted the accuracy of the investigation and claimed that the information was fabricated or much exaggerated. They also opposed the care plan developed for the children. Accordingly, there were valid grounds to take the children into public care.",

Moreover, they were actively involved in an ADHD association and were attending courses to understand the condition better and be able to help A. With assistance from the Norwegian authorities and the school, they could take care of A and meet all of his needs. The applicants further questioned whether the Social Council really had a clear plan for how, in due time, to reunite them with their children and contested the Council\u2019s view that they opposed the plan for visits with the children. In fact, the first applicant\u2019s visit with the children had gone very well and the children had also reacted positively to photographs and letters from their parents. Taking into consideration the children\u2019s very young age, they emphasised the importance of not waiting too long before starting the reunion process, and including more frequent visits, in order to avoid a sudden removal from the foster homes which could cause the children emotional harm. Furthermore, the applicants categorically denied that any violence had occurred in their home and they alleged that if any of the children showed signs of trauma, it was most likely due to the traumatic separation from their parents.

It confirmed that the applicants had cooperated with the authorities and had come to planned meetings with the Council. It attached much importance to the fact that this cooperation needed to continue over time.

Although both of the applicants had demonstrated improvements in their capacity to assess the children\u2019s needs, they still lacked basic understanding of how to care properly for their children. The Council stressed that A had been taken into care due to lack of care at home, not because he had been diagnosed with ADHD. Moreover, A repeatedly spoke about how he had been beaten by the second applicant and he had had to be reassured before the meeting with the first applicant that he would return to the foster home after the meeting. Thus, the decision on public care was partly based on the need to protect him, as well as B and C. The Council further observed that, as concerned B, a psychologist had stated that there were reasons to believe that she had been neglected or traumatised at a preverbal stage of her life and that, consequently, her problems were not linked to being taken into care. Lastly, turning to C, it was asserted that she needed to be protected from neglect in order to develop positively and have her needs met. The Council repeated that there had been concern for the children for a long time and that its findings were based on an overall evaluation of the children\u2019s situation and their parents\u2019 ability to care for them.

The appellate court further observed that Article 8 of the Convention did not contain a general prohibition on complete contact restrictions. Still, it shared the applicants\u2019 concern that the complete contact restriction could harm the children and noted that the Social Council had a great responsibility to ensure that the children\u2019s need for contact with their parents was met.

Moreover, the court had to evaluate whether the combined risks that contact rights would entail for the children\u2019s health and development outweighed the corresponding risks if there were no contact. In the present case, the court considered that the only way to find suitable solutions to avoid the risks involved in contact rights between the applicants and the children was for the Social Council to plan the visits carefully together with the applicants and for the applicants to be willing to receive the help and support that they needed. As long as these conditions were not fulfilled, it would not be possible to arrange the contact.

Moreover, the first applicant had been unable to take an active part and be available to her children during their meetings.

They had, for example, waited outside B and C\u2019s school and followed them to their foster homes, and they had also gone to A\u2019s foster home, making the children afraid and anxious. They had also sent letters and cards directly to the foster homes, despite an agreement that such items should be sent via the social authorities, in order to avoid upsetting the children. The court found that there was therefore no possibility to terminate the public care or transform it into voluntary care.

Also, the second applicant had behaved in a threatening manner towards the social services on several occasions and the seriousness of this was reflected in the fact that he was sentenced to imprisonment for that behaviour. Moreover, A, B and C had developed in a positive manner since being placed in foster homes. It was therefore understandable that the domestic authorities were reluctant to allow more extended contact rights, as it could potentially have a detrimental effect on the children.

It will have regard to the fact that perceptions of the appropriateness of intervention by public authorities in the care of children vary from one Contracting State to another, depending on such factors as traditions relating to the role of the family and to State intervention in family affairs and the availability of resources for public measures in this particular area. However, consideration of what is in the best interests of the child is in every case of crucial importance (see K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 154, ECHR 2001-VII). Indeed, the Court has emphasised that in cases of this type (public care of children and contact restrictions) the child\u2019s interest must come before all other considerations (Gnahor\u00e9 v. France, no. 40031/98, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000IX).",

When a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interests of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited. The Court has indicated that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care (see K. and T., cited above, \u00a7 155). However, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as limitations on parental rights and access (see Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002I).",

A and B had maintained these statements when talking to various adults, including teachers, the foster home parents and social workers. Moreover, all of the children had lacked communication and emotional response from their parents, which had affected their psychosocial development and their ability to interact socially with other children as well as adults. A was hyperactive and had difficulties following rules and functioning in social situations. His behaviour corresponded to several of the symptoms of ADHD. B was remarkably silent and withdrawn. Psychiatrists had assessed that she was traumatised and had recommended therapy combined with a safe environment where she did not have to deny her experiences. Both she and C were behind in their language development and lacked the ability to express their emotions. Several instances had, over the years, emphasised the children\u2019s need for emotional contact with the applicants. The second applicant had failed to compensate for the first applicant\u2019s inability in this regard and neither of the applicants had managed to establish routines for the children\u2019s basic needs such as food, hygiene, clothes and necessary medical contacts. Thus, the applicants\u2019 ability to care properly for their children was questioned. All three children were in need of stability and an environment with clear rules and structure, including stable adults who could compensate for their previous lack of emotional care (see paragraph 17 above).",

In these proceedings, both the Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal observed that the applicants\u2019 behaviour towards the social authorities was an obstacle to cancelling the public care order. The second applicant had been convicted, inter alia, of abusive conduct and threatening the staff of the social authorities (see paragraph 61 above).

They further noted that all of the children were in need of special care and stability in order for their development to progress positively. On the basis of the investigation the domestic court found that, if the applicants were granted contact rights to visit the children, there was a real risk that the second applicant, in particular, would intervene in the public care to the detriment of the children. Moreover, there was a risk that the addresses of the children\u2019s foster homes would be disclosed, even if the first applicant visited the children alone, for which reason the courts considered that she could not be allowed any contact rights by herself either.",

However, for this to be possible, the parents had to cooperate, which they did not fully do. Moreover, the domestic court had the difficult task of balancing and evaluating whether the risk that the contact rights entailed for the children\u2019s health and development outweighed the risk of losing the family bonds if there were no contact. In the present case, the domestic court considered that the only way to find suitable solutions to avoid the risks involved in contact rights between the applicants and the children was for the Social Council to plan the visits carefully together with the applicants and that the applicants be willing to receive the help and support that they needed to help and understand their children. Until these conditions were fulfilled, it would not be possible to arrange the contact. Furthermore, the appellate court carefully considered the possibility of granting only the first applicant contact rights with the children. However, in view of its findings, and the first applicant\u2019s passive attitude, it did not consider this a viable option.

It follows that the Court, bearing in mind its subsidiary role (see, Buchleither v.

The Administrative Court stressed in its judgment of 27 September 2011 that only contact restrictions which were necessary for the purpose of the care were allowed and that the best interests of the children should be paramount when making this evaluation. All three children received extra help and assistance to develop and function in their social settings. They were developing well in their foster homes. The domestic court further noted that the applicants\u2019 meetings with their children had gone well and that their contact rights had been extended as a consequence. However, in the domestic court\u2019s view, the applicants had accepted various measures because the Social Council had told them to do so, not because they felt that they needed them.

A part of this process was the contact between the parents and their children.

In this respect, the Court observes that the children have continued to develop well in their foster homes but still have special needs which need to be satisfied. Although it took a year and half before contact was restored, the domestic authorities have gradually increased the extent of the contact rights.

In the present case, \u201cthe best interests\u201d of the children, represented, in my view, both a private and a public interest. It was a public interest because the applicants\u2019 children were in public care, and the State or community had an interest in protecting them; and the children\u2019s interest, being a private and public interest, had to be weighed in the balance against the private interest of the applicants under Article 8. In the context of this question, some more specific questions may also arise: is the \u201cproportionality test\u201d the same thing as the \u201cfair balancing test\u201d; is it part of the latter; or is it something different, and, if so, when does it take place before or after the \u201cfair balancing test\u201d?",
