The Court will apply those principles to a number of legal avenues the applicant allegedly failed to use with regard to his complaints of delays in issuing a contact order and failure to enforce it.

This means, among other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

Germany, no. 28422/95, \u00a7 54, 5\u00a0December 2002, and S\u00fc\u00df v. Germany, no. 40324/98, \u00a7 100, 10 November 2005), risking that the family ties might never be (re)built. Hence, the Court has held on several occasions that remedies such as those introduced by the 2006 Act, which specifically concern the right to have one\u2019s case examined within a reasonable time, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, do not address situations in which delays are examined in terms of interference by the State with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 8 (see Gobec v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 7233/04, \u00a7 118, 3 October 2013, and the references cited therein). That finding is confirmed by the two domestic cases submitted by the Government (see paragraph 77 above) in which an award of damages was made in respect of violations of the right to respect for family life. In those cases, delays were examined as a separate complaint in accordance with the criteria applicable to the assessment of the reasonableness of the length of proceedings, within the meaning of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7 1.",

The Court has already held in this regard that it is the parents\u2019 own rights and obligations which are at stake in the proceedings and their active participation can hardly be dispensed with in the normal course of events; parental participation in the proceedings concerning children is required by Article 8 in order to ensure protection of their interests (see Glaser v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 32346/96, \u00a7 70, 19 September 2000). However, the Government provided no domestic case-law to show how any of the acceleratory remedies proposed by them operated in practice, and specifically in the circumstances such as those complained of in the present case, which required a particularly prompt response on the part of the authorities (see Prod\u011blalov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 40094/08, \u00a7 52, 20\u00a0December 2011, and, mutatis mutandis, Eberhard and M. v.

Thus, the applicant\u2019s complaints did not concern any specific errors of procedure or application of substantive law, but the overall duration of the contact and enforcement proceedings. Having regard to the domestic judgments in which the delays were examined as a separate complaint in accordance with the criteria applicable to the assessment of the reasonableness of the length of proceedings, within the meaning of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7 1 (see paragraph 77 above), as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s view that the State was not liable for damages if there was, as in the applicant\u2019s case, no withdrawal of parental rights or prohibition of contact (see paragraph 76 above), the Court is unable to agree with the Government\u2019s submission that a civil action for damages could have effectively remedied the applicant\u2019s complaints.

The applicant\u2019s objective was the same in both the contact and the enforcement proceedings, namely to obtain access to P. and thus to assert his right to respect for family life. Moreover, some of the applicant\u2019s requests for enforcement were lodged even before the contact order became final (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above).

It appears that, contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertions, in the absence of an application to the competent Central Authority, the Slovenian authorities were not obliged to apply any measures pursuant to the Hague Convention (see the reference to the P\u00e9rez-Vera Explanatory Report in paragraph 62 above). Yet, considering the obligations imposed on the courts by Article 41 of the Brussels IIa Regulation (see paragraph 63 above), the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the Slovenian authorities were not required to apply that regulation. Nonetheless, although the Court finds it regrettable that those mechanisms of cross-border cooperation do not appear to have been taken into consideration in the applicant\u2019s case, it reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law even when that law refers to international or EU law, the Court\u2019s role being confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such adjudication are compatible with the Convention (see Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

It is true that the Centre repeatedly, albeit unsuccessfully, requested that information from M.P. (see paragraphs 25 and 32 above). However, until February 2003 no other measures were envisaged by which the information could be obtained. What is particularly disconcerting is that although M.P.\u2019s and P.\u2019s residence abroad considerably limited the possibility for the Slovenian authorities to obtain the relevant information about P., that cross-border dimension of the case was largely overlooked by the Centre. Neither the Centre nor any other competent authority at any point sought the assistance of the Austrian authorities in the serving of documents on M.P. or obtaining information on P.\u2019s situation. The Centre eventually requested, but did not receive, assistance from the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in locating M.P.\u2019s Austrian address. In this connection, the Court finds it surprising that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \u2013 which, by virtue of domestic legislation, was at the material time competent to ensure the service of documents on persons residing abroad \u2013 was not able to acquire M.P.\u2019s address. According to the observations of the Austrian Government, such information could have been easily obtained from the Austrian central population register for a low fee (see paragraph 125 below). Even accepting that the Slovenian Embassy in Austria was unable to justify such a payment, it is difficult to see why the fee could not have been charged to the applicant.",

However, in the Court\u2019s opinion those circumstances were not taken into due consideration; on the contrary, two appeals lodged by M.P. against the decisions to issue contact orders allowing the applicant to see P. were granted by the Ministry on grounds arising from her own unwillingness to cooperate with the Centre (see paragraphs 21 and 31 above), which further delayed the already lengthy proceedings. Also, no attempt was made to sanction M.P.\u2019s obstructive behaviour. In this connection, the Court points out that even if the domestic legal order did not allow for the imposition of effective sanctions, each Contracting State must equip itself with an adequate and sufficient legal arsenal to ensure compliance with the positive obligations imposed on it by Article 8 of the Convention (see Maire v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 48206/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2003VII).",

Nonetheless, it was not until November 2005 that the Maribor District Court requested its Austrian counterpart to serve a summons on M.P. (see paragraph 39 above), whereupon her address was finally located (see paragraph 40 above). Moreover, the Maribor District Court did not request the assistance of the Austrian authorities in obtaining information on P.\u2019s situation until February 2006, when it asked for the first time for a report to be drawn up by the Graz Youth and Family Office. However, M.P. again refused to cooperate, and according to the Austrian Government, the Youth and Family Office had no means of forcing her to do so (see paragraph 126 below). While the Court cannot speculate on whether the use of any other legal avenue would have led to a more successful outcome, it notes that the Maribor District Court could have, but did not, request via letter rogatory that M.P. and P. give a statement in accordance with more formal rules of judicial procedure, in the same manner as a statement was later obtained from the applicant for the purposes of the proceedings conducted in Austria (see paragraph 55 above). Eventually, in February 2007, the Maribor District Court issued a contact order without having obtained a statement from P. or any information on her situation, apart from her mother\u2019s assertion that she was opposed to contact with the applicant.",

Moreover, it took the authorities a further four years to decide in the enforcement proceedings, by which time the relationship between the applicant and P. had been irremediably undermined. Struck by the grossly excessive overall duration of the contact and enforcement proceedings, amounting to more than fourteen years in total, the Court finds that the Slovenian authorities did not comply with their duty under Article 8 to deal diligently with the applicant\u2019s requests for a contact order and its enforcement.

The Court has already held with regard to the taking of evidence abroad that the State where evidence is located is under a duty to render any assistance within its competence and means sought by way of a legal assistance request (see, mutatis mutandis, Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no. 25965/04, \u00a7 245, ECHR 2010 (extracts)). This cannot be construed as an obligation of result, but one of means, requiring the State to undertake all reasonable measures to comply with the request for legal assistance. In the present case, the Graz Youth and Family Office made three requests for meetings with M.P. and P. in order to prepare the report; however, it appears that each time M.P. excused herself for work-related reasons, eventually informing the social worker in charge of the case that she and P. would be spending several months abroad. Thus, about three months after having received the request, the Youth and Family Office reported to the Graz District Court for Civil Matters that they were unable to comply with the request. The Maribor District Court subsequently made another request for a report, but was informed, two months later, that M.P. was abroad and could not be reached. While the measures undertaken by the Austrian authorities did not lead to a successful outcome, the Court takes the view that they responded to the requests of the Maribor District Court in an adequate manner and within a reasonable time. In view of the limited extent of the Austrian authorities\u2019 involvement in the case, as well as the fact that they were given no indication by the Slovenian authorities that M.P. was acting in violation of Slovenian law, the Court considers that, once the Austrian authorities had established that M.P. and P. would not be reachable for a prolonged period of time and duly informed the Slovenian authorities about their absence, they were not required to take any further measures of their own motion.",

As regards the question of the finality of the judicial decisions regulating various aspects of the relationships between parents and children, the Court observes that those relationships are of a continuous nature and, accordingly, are subject to numerous changes in the emotional, practical and financial circumstances of the individuals forming them. The changed circumstances, in turn, may call for a reassessment of what is in the best interests of the child. This being the primary consideration in cases involving parent-child relationships, the Court considers that it necessarily limits the res judicata effects of final decisions rendered in this type of cases. In fact, in M.D. and Others v. Malta (no. 64791/10, 17 July 2012), the Court found, inter alia, a violation of Article 8 on the ground that the applicant, whose parental rights had been forfeited as a result of a criminal conviction for cruelty and neglect of her minor children, had no possibility to apply for the restoration of those rights in the light of a possible change in her circumstances (ibid., \u00a7 78).",

However, it appears that the process of reacquainting themselves with each other was not successful (see paragraph 45 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, that development following the issuing of the contact order alone could be regarded by the Austrian authorities as a change of circumstances justifying a new assessment of the applicant\u2019s contact rights. Also, it cannot be overlooked that at the time of the institution of the contact proceedings in Austria, P. had already reached the age of fourteen years and was thus mature enough to be able to formulate her own opinion on the matter at issue. Accordingly, the Court considers that her wishes and feelings had to be given due consideration (see P\u0142aza v. Poland, no. 18830/07, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 86, 25 January 2011).
