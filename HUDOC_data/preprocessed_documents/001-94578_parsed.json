However, the right of \u201caccess to court\u201d does not impose an obligation on a State to execute every judgment of civil character without having regard to particular circumstances of a case (see Sanglier v. France, no. 50342/99, \u00a7\u00a039, 27 May 2003). The State has a positive obligation to organise a system for enforcement of judgments that is effective both in law and in practice and ensures their enforcement without undue delay (see Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 7 June 2005). When the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a judgment and they fail to do so, their inactivity can engage the State\u2019s responsibility on the ground of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Scollo v.\u00a0Italy, judgment of 28 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a044, Series A no. 315-C). It is for each State to equip itself with legal instruments which are adequate and sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of positive obligations imposed upon the State (see Ruianu v. Romania, no.\u00a034647/97, \u00a7\u00a066, 17 June 2003). The Court\u2019s only task is to examine whether measures applied by the national authorities in a given case were adequate and sufficient. In the cases, which necessitate actions of a debtor who is a private person, the State \u2013 as the possessor of the public force \u2013 has to act diligently in order to assist a creditor in execution of a judgment (see Fociac v. Romania, no. 2577/02, \u00a7\u00a070, 3\u00a0February 2005, and Kesyan v. , no. 36496/02, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 65, 19\u00a0October 2006).",
