Italy [GC], no 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV).

The Court observes that measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve an inevitable element of suffering or humiliation. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.

From 8 to 20 August 2002 he was held in cell no. 212, which measured \n21 square metres and accommodated five inmates including the applicant. It follows that the living area per inmate was about 4.2 square metres. In respect of the other four cells where the applicant was detained, namely nos. 311,312, 317 and 402, the Government did not produce information about the number of inmates. They reported, however, that the first two cells measured 12 sq. m and had six sleeping places and the last two measured \n21 sq. m and had fourteen sleeping places. It follows therefore that on any account, the designed floor area per inmate was from 1.5 to 2 square metres. Given the fact that each cell was equipped with bunks, a dining table, benches, a sink and a lavatory, which took up space, it appears that the actual living area per inmate was extremely small. This state of affairs in itself constituted a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see \n\u00a7 66 above).",

It is noted that the national authorities did not indicate the exact period of the applicant\u2019s detention in each cell. Furthermore, they did not specify what furnishings, apart from a lavatory and a sink, was installed in the cells.
