Nevertheless, the applicants did draw attention to the issue submitted to the Convention institutions by filing submissions with the First Civil Division to the effect that it was unnecessary to decide their appeal (see paragraph 19 above).

That analysis could explain why different conclusions had been reached in respect of the different sets of proceedings in the Court of Appeal. Thus, there was a very clear connection between the two sets of proceedings which were transferred to another court, as they both related to the validity of one and the same will and the possible liability of the notary who had drawn up the will and administered the estate. In contrast, the third set of proceedings, which was not transferred, concerned neither the validity of the will nor the administration of the estate, but a transfer of property made to a company in 1958, before Mr and Mrs Brown-Petersen died in 1962 and 1961 respectively. In addition, the composition of the Papeete Court of Appeal was not the same in the three sets of proceedings, since at the hearing on 23 November 1989 in the third set of proceedings the court included a judge who had not sat in the other two cases.

Secondly, the First Civil Division had not deliberately refrained from considering the ground of appeal concerning a violation of the Convention.

It will be seen that the transfer was made before the death of Mrs Mary Higgins, in respect of whose estate an action for payment of a legacy was brought in 1984 and before the action for an order setting aside the 1961 wills, which was dismissed in a decision that became final in 1967. The numerous wills and disputes were at the core of the proceedings. Owing to the complexity of those proceedings and the fact that they overlapped each other, a summary is given:",

To my mind, the Court should either have relied in its decision on a finding of bias in the third set of proceedings (there was, however, no evidence of bias in the case files or documents) or held that there had been no breach, while perhaps considering the decision of 22 March 1990 from an intellectually critical standpoint.",
