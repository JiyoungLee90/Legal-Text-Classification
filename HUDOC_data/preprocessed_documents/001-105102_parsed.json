It also pointed to the discrepancy between the police report, which had stated that the tree was partly rotten, and the prosecutor\u2019s finding that it was healthy.

The photographs taken after the accident also showed that the tree\u2019s root system had already been badly damaged beforehand. On the picture the trunk could be seen to have been completely deprived of its roots, which would not have been the case if the only thing which had caused it to fall had been strong winds.

The tree in question had no roots as they had either decayed or been removed during the laying of a gas pipeline. The municipality had authorised the construction of the pipeline. Accordingly it had known, or should have known, where it ran and that the investment had involved the removal of the roots of trees where they interfered with the pipeline.
