It recalls that civil servants can only be excluded from the protection embodied in Article 6 if the State in its national law expressly excluded access to a court for the category of staff in question and if this exclusion was justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland, [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a762, ECHR 2007...). The Court observes that these conditions were not satisfied in the present cases. The applicants lawfully sued their employer military units, the Ministry of Defence or the Ministry of Interior in domestic courts and the latter initially granted their claims. The cases were later reconsidered by higher courts and the judgments in the applicants\u2019 favour quashed. The Court therefore concludes that the applicants\u2019 access to a court was allowed by domestic legislation and that Article 6 accordingly applied to their cases. That the applicants\u2019 cases fell within the jurisdiction of special military courts cannot alter this conclusion. The Government\u2019s objection must therefore be dismissed.",

The authorities\u2019 negligence in the execution of judgments could thus have been condemned by domestic courts. Second, the applicants could have requested to upgrade the judgment debt under Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In certain earlier cases, the Court had found that the exhaustion of this remedy deprived the applicants of their victim status (see Nemakina v.

The Government submitted that the applicant Kashcheyev had successfully used this remedy (see paragraph 12 above) and lost his victim status under the Convention. Third, the applicants could have lodged a claim for non-pecuniary damage under Chapter 59 \u00a7 4 of the Civil Code.

The Court does not consider its decisions quoted by the Government (see paragraph 38 above) to establish a general principle that mere compensation for inflation losses constitutes full and adequate redress for late enforcement of a judgment. Such an upgrading remedy, however accessible and effective in practice, is thus not capable of affording redress as required by the Convention. The Court cannot therefore agree with the Government that the applicant in the case of Kashcheyev lost his victim status after the award in his favour was successfully upgraded under Article 208 of the Code (see paragraphs 12 and 38 above).",

(no. 2), no. 21071/05, \u00a7\u00a054, 10 April 2008). With the exception of a limited number of cases listed in Articles 1070 and 1100 of the Civil Code, compensation of non-pecuniary damage is subject to the establishment of the authorities\u2019 fault. The Court notes that this condition can hardly be systematically satisfied in non-enforcement cases in view of the complexities of the enforcement proceedings and of possible objective circumstances preventing enforcement, such as the lack of funds on the debtor\u2019s account.",

Russia, no. 30616/05, \u00a7\u00a022, 12 June 2008). Accordingly, the applicant cannot be blamed for not having submitted a certified copy of the judgment. Indeed, since the State authorities were defendant in the proceedings at issue they must have been duly notified of the judgment and have taken the necessary action to ensure the payment the judgment debt within a reasonable time (see Akashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a021). Nor should the applicant be blamed for the alleged lack of clarity as to the amount to be paid (USD\u00a013,004 less RUB\u00a031,000). Even assuming that the competent authorities were unable to calculate the exact amount to be paid, they were well placed to seek any clarification from the competent court.
