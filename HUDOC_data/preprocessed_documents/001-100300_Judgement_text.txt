The case originated in an application (no. 40149/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Dinko Kirilov Madzharov (“the applicant”), on 28 October 2005.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Dimova, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged that he had been deprived of his property in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Articles 6 § 1, 8 and 14 of the Convention.
On 5 May 2009 the President of the Fifth Section decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the applicant's deprivation of property. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 of the Convention).
Judge Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case. On 23 February 2009 the Government appointed in her stead Mrs Pavlina Panova as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1 of the Rules of the Court as in force at the time).
The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in .
In 1966 his grandparents bought from the Sofia municipality an apartment of 73 square metres in the centre of the city, which had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in  after 1946.
After the death of the applicant's grandparents his father inherited from them. In 1995 he conveyed the property to the applicant.
On 19 February 1993 the heirs of the former pre-nationalisation owner of the apartment brought an action against the applicant's father under section 7 of the Restitution Law, arguing that his title to the property was null and void and seeking the restoration of their own title. They also brought a rei vindicatio action.
In 2003 the applicant's father died and the applicant succeeded him in the proceedings.
The proceedings ended with a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 27 May 2005. The courts allowed the plaintiffs' claims, finding that the contract whereby the applicant's grandparents had acquired the apartment had been null and void since the sale had not been approved by the Minister of Finance, as required by the relevant provisions applicable at the time, but by his deputy.
In July or August 2005 the applicant and his family vacated the apartment. In November 2005 they were granted the tenancy of a municipally-owned apartment at a regulated price, where they moved in.
The applicant could apply to receive compensation bonds within two months of the judgment of 27 May 2005. However, he only applied for bonds on 7 October 2005. On 26 March 2008 the regional governor dismissed the request as time-barred. On an appeal by the applicant, this decision was upheld by the courts.
