Hence, the misdemeanour judge was focused on the evidence to establish that offence, namely the discussion and fight and how they had affected the public. Essentially, the fact that the applicant had caused R.C. a number of grievous bodily injuries was not covered by the sanction ordered by the misdemeanour authority. On the other hand, the criminal prosecution of the applicant referred to a physical attack on R.C. that had caused him grievous bodily injury. This crime protects bodily integrity, and the criminal proceedings should have established whether the injuries had been caused or not, regardless of the conduct of the applicant.",

The definition of misdemeanour does not include the infliction of bodily injury, while the consequence and one of the essential elements of the crime in question is the incurred consequence (bodily injuries), irrespective of the action leading to such a consequence. Therefore, the present case should be distinguished from the Tsonev case (see Tsonyo Tsonev v.

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Jussila v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030-31, ECHR 2006XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7 82-86, ECHR 2003X).",

Nevertheless, the Court has previously found that the sphere defined in the other similar legal systems as \u201cadministrative\u201d/\u201dmisdemeanour\u201d, including the protection of public order, embraces certain offences that have a criminal connotation but are too trivial to be governed by criminal law and procedure (see Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 54 with further references therein; see also Maresti and Muslija, both cited above, \u00a7 58 and \u00a7 27 respectively).",

This misdemeanour was imposed by general legal provision applying to all citizens rather than towards a group possessing a special status. Any reference to the \u201cminor\u201d nature of the acts does not, in itself, exclude its classification as \u201ccriminal\u201d in the autonomous sense of the Convention, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the Engel criteria, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104). Lastly, the Court considers that the fine is not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage, but that the primary aims in establishing the offence in question were punishment and deterrence of reoffending, which are recognised as further characteristic features of criminal penalties (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 105).",

The Court observes that at the relevant time that Article 6(3) of the Public Order Act 1992 provided for sixty days\u2019 imprisonment as the maximum penalty, although in fact the applicant was eventually sentenced to a fine in the amount of RSD 4,000. As the Court has confirmed on many occasions, in a society subscribing to the rule of law, where the penalty liable to be and actually imposed on an applicant involves loss of liberty, there is a presumption that the charges against the applicant are \u201ccriminal\u201d, a presumption which can be rebutted in full only exceptionally, and only if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d given their nature, duration or manner of execution (see Engel, \u00a7 82, and Ezeh and\u00a0Connors, \u00a7 126, both cited above).
