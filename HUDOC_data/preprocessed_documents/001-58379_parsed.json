Furthermore, they had not been questioned but had merely made written statements. As regards Mr D.\u2019s interview, the American police officer who had conducted it had been acting without authority, given that the international rogatory letters had been sent to the District Court in . Moreover, no lawyer had been present when the interviews and statements were obtained and the persons concerned had not been asked to take the oath, which showed that the documents did not constitute \u201ctestimony\u201d, but merely \u201cpreliminary investigative acts\u201d. As such, they should not have been used by the Florence Criminal Court as evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt. Lastly, the applicant contended that Article 512 bis CCP was not applicable in the instant case as that provision referred only to statements made in Italy.",

It observed that by virtue of the locus regit actum principle, acts performed under rogatory letters had to be regulated by the law of the foreign State to which the Italian authorities had referred, provided that the foreign law was not incompatible with Italian public order and in particular \u201cdefence rights\u201d. In the instant case, the procedure followed by the Seattle authorities could not be regarded as having infringed those rights as Article 512 bis CCP allowed statements made in Italy or elsewhere by foreign nationals resident outside the national territory to be read out. As regards the fact that G. had not been questioned, the Court of Appeal considered that it was quite understandable that the American police should have wished to prevent the minor, who had been affected psychologically by the violence he had endured, from suffering any further trauma.",

He also maintained that Article 431\u00a0 \u00a7\u00a01 (d) CCP, which requires that a record of acts performed outside the Italian territory by rogatory letters be lodged on the judge\u2019s file (fascicolo per il dibattimento), was unconstitutional. He considered in particular that that provision was incompatible with Articles 3 and 24 of the Italian Constitution, which respectively guarantee the equality of all citizens before the law and the right to defend oneself at every stage of the proceedings. In that connection, he stressed that he had been given no opportunity to question Mr\u00a0D., Mrs D. or Mrs N., whose statements had formed the basis of his conviction.",
