In addition, the remedy in question would not have been sufficient. The Court of Cassation, which has no jurisdiction to review questions of fact, was not in a position to afford any relief to Mr Ciulla, who in the proceedings before the Convention institutions did not dispute that the impugned detention order complied with section 6 of the 1956 Law. At all events, that court could not have given a decision within a period shorter than the duration - sixteen days - of the deprivation of liberty complained of. It suffices to note in this connection that it took the Court of Cassation nearly three months to determine another appeal on points of law by Mr Ciulla which concerned the lawfulness of another period of detention (see paragraphs 12-13 above).",

The Government maintained that in  the Convention had the status of constitutional law or, at the very least, prevailed over all ordinary laws, regardless of date. This argument does not, however, accord with the preponderance of the case-law of Italian first-instance and appellate courts, since none of the decisions brought to the Court\u2019s notice expressly recognises that the Convention prevails over later statutes (see paragraph 22 above). That being so, effective enjoyment of the right guaranteed in Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention is not, in the circumstances of the case, ensured with a sufficient degree of certainty.",

The deprivation of liberty - lasting not more than sixteen days - which he underwent during these complicated proceedings cannot be looked at in isolation and should not be severed from the whole body of judicial proceedings and stages of which it formed part. Furthermore, the fact cannot be overlooked that this deprivation of liberty, even if it was not in itself strictly a decision concerning the application of the law, emanated from a judge who was a member of a judicial body. It seems to me that it would be artificial to isolate this phase from the general course of the trial, however complicated the trial may have been. Looking at the situation as a whole, I find it unreasonable to conclude that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention.",

As to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5), firstly, since I take the view that there has not been a breach of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), I consider that the issue cannot arise. Secondly, the exact import of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) raises, as has been pointed out in other cases, difficult problems. To give only the briefest idea of these, I will say merely that one must proceed on the principle that the Convention cannot impose a national constitutional system providing for automatic incorporation of the Convention - once ratified - into the domestic legal order, and still less can it require that the Convention prevail over ordinary laws. That being so, the issue of the compensation provided for in Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) must be looked at independently of the issue of incorporating the Convention into the domestic order and on the basis of domestic law, whether or not that incorporates the actual terms of the Convention. In any case, even supposing that the domestic law incorporates the terms of the Convention, it is difficult to see how a national court could give effect to the terms of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) unless there were more specific national provisions giving practical expression to the content of those terms. The provision does not seem, subject to the judgment of the national courts, to be self-executing. In the normal course of events, therefore, Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) should be given effect by an express, precise provision of domestic law.",

Can it normally be expected that a government should directly award compensation for an arrest or detention brought about by its authorities in accordance with its own legislation but contrary to Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention before the Court has held that there has been such a breach (unless the government realises it earlier - which is, to say the least, uncertain)? This suggests that the question of implementing Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) cannot really arise until after the Court has found a violation of the substantive provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) and the government - to whom that finding has been notified - has failed to give effect to paragraph 5 of that Article (art. 5-5).
