The courts\u2019 judgments do not contain any indication that they were aware of the reduced evidentiary value of the untested witness statement (see, by contrast, Brzuszczy\u0144ski v\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a023789/09, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, 17 September 2013, and Ben Moumen v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a03977/13, \u00a7 58, 23 June 2016). On the contrary, the statement of the untested witness was listed along with other evidence substantiating the applicant\u2019s guilt, without any assessment of its credibility. The Court therefore considers that the domestic courts failed to examine the reliability of the absent witness\u2019s statement in a careful manner.",

They testify without being under oath, that is, without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could render them punishable for perjury for willfully making untrue statements (see Vladimir Romanov v.

However, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that this confrontation at an early stage of the proceedings was, of itself, insufficient to compensate for the lack of opportunity for the applicant to cross-examine this witness directly at his trial. Moreover, the applicant was not even offered the possibility, at the trial stage, to put his own questions to the witness indirectly. Eventually, although the applicant could give his own version of the events and cast doubt on the credibility of the absent witness\u2019s statement, the trial court failed to actually assess its reliability (see paragraph\u00a063 above).
