Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, p. 65, \u00a7 162). However, in order to determine whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be characterised as torture, the Court must have regard to the distinction, embodied in the provision, between that notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment.
