It appears that no hearings were scheduled in the period between November 1999 and April 2001, and only after the latter date did the trial court begin to examine the case at somewhat regular intervals. The Court also notes that the trial court\u2019s procrastination was confirmed in the replies of the prosecutor\u2019s office and the higher court to the applicant\u2019s complaints (see paras. 15, 18 and 19 above).

It reiterates that the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hold a public hearing is not an absolute one. Thus, a hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v.\u00a0Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 171-A; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263). The Court has previously found that the Russian legal provisions enabling the court to proceed with examination of the appeal if a party did not appear in the hearing after having been duly notified thereof were not incompatible with the fair trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Yakovlev v. Russia, no.\u00a072701/01, \u00a7 20, 15 March 2005). At the same time, it deemed that the right to a fair and public hearing would be devoid of substance if a party to the case were not apprised of the hearing in such as way as to have an opportunity to attend it (ibidem, \u00a7 21).",
