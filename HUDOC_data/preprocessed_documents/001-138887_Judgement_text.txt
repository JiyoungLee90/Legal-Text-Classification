The case originated in an application (no. 42731/06) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Dkd-Union Doo (“the applicant”), a company registered in Serbia, on 12 October 2006.
The applicant was initially represented by Mr M. Milojković and subsequentelly by Mr D. Matić, lawyers practising in Varvarin. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 11 October 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant carried on business with a socially-owned company, HK “Viskoza a.d.-Celvlakno a.d” from Loznica (hereinafter: “the debtor”), which appeared to have failed to pay a certain invoice.
On 5 March 2003 the applicant filed an application for the enforcement of that invoice with the Valjevo Commercial Court.
On 11 March 2003 the Valjevo Commercial Court issued an enforcement order, by virtue of which the debtor was ordered to pay the applicant 2,669,582.39 Serbian dinars (RSD), plus statutory interest as of 21 March 2001 and costs of enforcement proceedings.
On an unspecified day this decision became final.
On 24 November 2003 the enforcement proceedings were stayed, due to the restructuring of the debtor.
On 29 May 2009 the enforcement proceedings were continued.
On 11 June 2009 insolvency proceedings were initiated against the debtor and the Privatisation Agency was appointed to be the insolvency administrator. The insolvency proceedings against the debtor are still ongoing.
On 17 March 2010 the Valjevo Commercial Court recognised the applicant as a secured creditor (razlučni poverilac).
On 15 January 2013 the applicant was partially settled in the amount of RSD 1,178,784.52.
The remainder of the final court decision of 11 March 2003 remained unsettled.
Article 22 of this Act provides that certain legal instruments, such as invoices (verodostojna isprave) are to be enforced through the courts.
The remainder of the relevant domestic law was set out in the Court’s judgments of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 57-82, 15 January 2008); Vlahović v. Serbia (no. 42619/04, §§ 37-47, 16 December 2008); Crnišanin and Others v. Serbia (nos. 35835/05, 43548/05, 43569/05 and 36986/06, §§ 100-104, 13 January 2009); EVT Company v. Serbia (no. 3102/05, §§ 26 and 27, 21 June 2007); Marčić and Others v. Serbia (no. 17556/05, § 29, 30 October 2007); Adamović v. Serbia, (no. 41703/06, §§ 17-22, 2 October 2012); and Marinković v. Serbia ((dec.) no. 5353/11, §§ 26-29 and §§ 31-44, 29 January 2013).
