The working group specifically noted, inter alia, that Article 34 of the Constitution made it impossible to extend the limitation period for criminal prosecution in respect of crimes committed in the past or, indeed, to introduce new, more serious, criminal offences and/or harsher penalties applicable to crimes committed in the past (see paragraph 32 below). The existing Criminal Code already envisaged several criminal offences of relevance to the issue, however, and the new Health Care Act set out a detailed procedure making it impossible for parents to have their newborn babies unlawfully removed from hospital wards (see paragraphs 35 and 41 below).",

As regards disappearances, applicants cannot wait indefinitely before lodging their application with the Court. Where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, it is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen. Allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance. Still, applications can be rejected as out of time where there has been excessive or unexplained delay on the part of applicants once they have, or should have, become aware that no investigation has been instigated or that the investigation has lapsed into inaction or become ineffective and, in any of those eventualities, there is no immediate, realistic prospect of an effective investigation being provided in the future. Where there are initiatives being pursued with regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided (see Varnava and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 162 and 165).",

The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004). The Court has likewise frequently emphasised the need to apply the exhaustion rule with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Ringeisen v. , 16 July 1971, \u00a7 89, Series A no. 13).",

Once this burden has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Dankevich v.

They could also, possibly, have ordered other forms of redress \u201ccapable\u201d of affording non-pecuniary satisfaction. Neither of those measures, however, could have effectively remedied the applicant\u2019s underlying complaint, which was her need for information as to \u201cthe real fate of her son\u201d. The Government have certainly offered no evidence to the contrary. The Court notes, lastly, that neither Parliament nor the Ombudsman addressed this issue in their respective reports. Indeed, if anything, by recommending the enactment of a lex specialis they appear to have suggested that no existing domestic remedies, including the said civil claim, could have been effective (see paragraphs 27 (d), 28 and 29 (f) above).",
