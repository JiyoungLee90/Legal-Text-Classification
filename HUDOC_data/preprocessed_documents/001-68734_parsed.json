Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (Navarra v.\u00a0France, judgment of 23\u00a0November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273B, \u00a7\u00a028; Toth v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224, \u00a7 84).

In that context, the Court also recalls that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",
