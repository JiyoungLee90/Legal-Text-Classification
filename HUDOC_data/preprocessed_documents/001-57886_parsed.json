When the Parole Board consider [the applicant\u2019s] case in 1994 the tariff will have been satisfied and the question of risk will be the overriding consideration. Indeed, the Parole Board will have borne the question of risk in mind in making their recommendation as to the date of the next review.

In fact the mandatory sentence had not been interpreted in this way by Parliament, the courts, the Parole Board or by successive Home Secretaries. Indeed recent court decisions have described the mandatory sentence as composed, like the discretionary life sentence, of a period of punishment (the \"tariff\") to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence as well as a period of preventive detention, following the expiry of the \"tariff\" period. Furthermore, the procedures that have developed to review the mandatory sentence have been founded on the understanding that when the requirements of punishment have been satisfied the only justification for continued detention is dangerousness.

The Government, with whom the Commission agreed, contended that a mandatory life sentence was imposed as punishment for the gravity of the offence of murder, as perceived by Parliament. By contrast, a discretionary life sentence was imposed because of the judicial assessment of the offender as mentally unstable or dangerous, conditions which may change over time. They rejected the applicant\u2019s thesis that the mandatory sentence was handed down in part for reasons of security and risk, pointing out that a trial judge was obliged under English law to sentence a murderer to life imprisonment even if he was satisfied that the murderer posed no danger as, for example, in the case of \"mercy killing\". Parliament had considered that such a grave crime deserved to be punished by life imprisonment and had removed all discretion as to sentencing from the trial court. The sentencing of a murderer could thus not be characterised as a decision of the court to confine a dangerous offender unless and until he was safe to be released. Moreover, it was a matter for the Secretary of State to decide if and when a murderer should be released on licence having regard to the public interest, in the light of stated criteria which govern the exercise of this discretion (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).",

This view was taken because of the very nature of the discretionary life sentence which, unlike the mandatory sentence, was imposed not because of the inherent gravity of the offence but because of the presence of factors which were susceptible to change with the passage of time, namely mental instability and dangerousness.

                                "content": "As observed by the House of Lords in R. v. Secretary of State, ex parte Doody, while the two types of life sentence may now be converging there remains nonetheless, on the statutory framework, the underlying theory and the current practice, a substantial gap between them (see paragraph 23 above). This is borne out by the very facts inter alia relied on by the applicant to support his case, namely that in mandatory life sentences the release of the prisoner is entirely a matter within the discretion of the Secretary of State who is not bound by the judicial recommendation as to the length of the tariff period and who is free under English law to have regard to other criteria than dangerousness, following the expiry of the \"tariff\" period, in deciding whether the prisoner should be released (see paragraphs 19, 21 and 23 above). It is further reflected in the decision of Parliament to limit the application of the new procedures in the 1991 Act to discretionary life sentences only, even in cases like the present where the prisoner is serving both a mandatory and a discretionary life sentence (see paragraph 18 above).",

Against the above background, the Court sees no cogent reasons to depart from the finding in the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell case that, as regards mandatory life sentences, the guarantee of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) was satisfied by the original trial and appeal proceedings and confers no additional right to challenge the lawfulness of continuing detention or re-detention following revocation of the life licence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Cossey v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 184, p. 14, para. 35). Accordingly, in the circumstances of the present case, there are no new issues of lawfulness which entitle the applicant to a review of his continued detention under the original mandatory life sentence.",
