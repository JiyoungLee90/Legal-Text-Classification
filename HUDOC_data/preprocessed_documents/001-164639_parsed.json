The mother had not been right to cut off contact between N. and her father. While she claimed that she had not obstructed the contact arrangements, she was not aware that her passive approach and clear animosity towards her ex-husband had impeded father-daughter contact. The experts stressed that N. had a strong emotional bond with the mother and remained under her influence. She did not feel loved by her father and was afraid of having contact with him. The experts concluded that N. was not able to cope with the emotional consequences of the conflict between her parents and that family therapy was indispensable. Furthermore, despite her negative reaction to the applicant, she should have contact with him. However, contact visits should not take place in the mother\u2019s presence as that would increase N.\u2019s negative attitude towards her father and prevent her from re-establishing a bond with him.

Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 59, Series A no.\u00a0130, and Vojnity v. Hungary, no. 29617/07, \u00a7 28, 12 February 2013). In this context, the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities. There are in addition positive obligations inherent in an effective \u201crespect\u201d for family life. Hence, the Court has repeatedly held that Article 8 includes the right for parents to have measures taken that will permit them to be reunited with their children and an obligation on part of the national authorities to take such action (see, amongst many others, Hokkanen v\u00a0 Finland, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 299\u2011A and Cristescu v. Romania, no. 13589/07, \u00a7 57, 10\u00a0January 2012). This also applies to cases where contact and residence disputes concerning children arise between parents and/or other members of the children\u2019s family (see Zawadka v. Poland, no. 48542/99, \u00a7 55, 23 June 2005). On the other hand, the Court also held that when two persons have lost affection for each other, it cannot realistically be expected from the State to make one of these persons adopt a positive attitude towards the other (see Z.J. v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 60092/12, \u00a7 105, 29 April 2014).",

The key consideration is whether those authorities have taken all the appropriate steps for facilitating such contact as can reasonably be demanded in the particular circumstances of each case (see, mutatis mutandis, Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 58). Another important factor in proceedings concerning children is that time takes on a particular significance, because there is always a danger that any procedural delay will result in the de facto determination of the issue before the court (see P.F., cited above, \u00a7 56). Moreover, the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who do not cohabit (see, for example, Kuppinger v.\u00a0Germany, no. 62198/11, \u00a7\u00a0102, 15 January 2015). Lastly, the child\u2019s best interests must be the primary consideration and may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents (see among many others, Olsson (No. 2), \u00a7 90, cited above and P\u0142aza v.

Firstly, as regards the swiftness of the enforcement proceedings, the Court notes that the domestic court examined the request of 7 March 2011 on 28\u00a0October 2011, when it ordered the mother to comply with the contact order (see paragraph 28 above). Since she continued to prevent the applicant having any contact with N., the court eventually imposed a fine on her on 15\u00a0March\u00a02012, that is, one year later (see paragraph 31 above).\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, the Court points out that the enforcement proceedings initiated by the applicant on 23 August 2011, after several procedural decisions, were eventually discontinued more than two and a half years later, on 24\u00a0April 2013 (see paragraph 30 above). Thirdly, the proceedings instituted by the applicant on 20\u00a0February 2012, in so far as the applicant alleged that the mother failed to comply with the interim contact order, were discontinued a year later, on 28\u00a0February 2013 (see paragraph 41 above).",

The Court finds that even though the applicant\u2019s enforcement requests led eventually to two decisions imposing a fine on the mother, the protracted examination of those requests and the obstruction to his contact resulted, as noted by the experts, in a further deterioration of the emotional bond with his daughter (see paragraph 48 above).",
