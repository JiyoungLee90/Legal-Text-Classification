Sight of the court order would have indicated that it was for \nthe applicant to deliver the property, and not for her former husband to collect it, and moreover that she had three more days in which to do so (see paragraph 11 above). Admittedly, the court order would not have enabled the police officers to ascertain the correctness of Mr McLeod\u2019s genuinely held belief that an agreement had been made between himself and his ex-wife allowing him to remove his property from the former matrimonial home on 3 October 1989 \u2013 a belief that was communicated to the police officers upon their arrival (see paragraph 12 above).

It notes in this regard that the police officers remained outside the property for some of the time thus suggesting a belief on their part that a breach of the peace was not likely to occur in the absence of the applicant\u201d (see paragraph 57 of the judgment). This, however, gives insufficient weight to the fact that, as Tuckey J found, although Ms McLeod was not there when the police officers arrived, they were not to know when she might return. Given that fact, it was not unreasonable (or disproportionate) for them to enter the house initially, when an unexpected return on her part might well be most likely to give rise to trouble, and, subsequently, to remain outside for part of the time as by then the best method of intervening to prevent a breach of the peace should she return while the removal operation was in progress.",

In addition to the considerations touched on above, their presence in the house was, as they \nmade clear, not to assist in the removal of the former husband\u2019s property but to maintain the peace; they remained there, acting discreetly and with restraint throughout, until there was no longer any threat of a breach of the peace; and when the applicant eventually returned, furious (in Tuckey J\u2019s description) and intent on stopping her ex-husband from driving away with his property, their intervention in all likelihood prevented a breach of the peace.",
