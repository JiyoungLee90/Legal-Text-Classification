It notes, firstly, that the domestic courts refused to examine whether the actions imputed to the first applicant were indeed capable of endangering national security, finding that in the absence of a definition of the notion of \u201cnational security\u201d in domestic law, the security services had unfettered discretion in determining what amounted to a danger to it (see paragraph 28 above). The Court accepts that the notion of \u201cnational security\u201d is not capable of being comprehensively defined. It may, indeed, be a very wide one, with a large margin of appreciation left to the executive to determine what is in the interests of that security. However, that does not mean that its limits may be stretched beyond its natural meaning (see C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a01365/07, \u00a7\u00a043, 24 April 2008). While the executive\u2019s assessment of what poses a threat to national security will naturally be of significant weight, the courts reviewing the executive\u2019s decisions must be able to react in cases where invoking that concept has no reasonable basis in the facts or reveals an interpretation of \u201cnational security\u201d that is unlawful or contrary to common sense and arbitrary (see Al-Nashif, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0124). In the present case, however, the national courts did not subject to any meaningful scrutiny the executive\u2019s assertion that national security might be endangered by the actions imputed to the first applicant.",

They simply referred to the applicable legal provisions, some of which, in particular Instruction no. 0300, had never been published, as well as to unspecified information contained in a confidential report by the security services. It is noteworthy that the domestic courts explicitly declined to verify the factual basis for the allegations against the first applicant, finding that the security services\u2019 sources of information were not subject to judicial scrutiny (see paragraph 28 above). The domestic courts confined the scope of their inquiry to ascertaining that the security services\u2019 report had been issued within their administrative competence, without carrying out an independent review of whether the conclusion that the applicant constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact. They rested their rulings solely on uncorroborated information provided by the security services and did not examine any other pieces of evidence to confirm or refute the allegations against the first applicant. They thus failed to examine a critical aspect of the case, namely whether the authorities were able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for their assessment that the first applicant presented a national security risk. These elements lead the Court to conclude that the national courts confined themselves to a purely formal examination of the decision to refuse a residence permit to the first applicant (see, for a similar reasoning, C.G. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 47, and Nolan and K. v. , no. 2512/04, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 72, 12 February 2009).",

The disclosed allegations against him were of a general nature, principally that he was aiding the Chinese security services to collect information about the political, social and economical situation in the Khabarovsk Region, as well as information about the military facilities situated in that region and the roads leading to them. No specific allegations mentioning the locations and dates of the actions allegedly committed by the first applicant were divulged to the applicants, making it impossible for them to effectively challenge the security services\u2019 assertions by providing exonerating evidence, for example an alibi or an alternative explanation for the first applicant\u2019s actions (see A. and Others v. the  [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a7 220-224, ECHR 2009...).",

Thus, it is satisfied that the classified materials from the Federal Security Service were disclosed to the domestic courts and, at least in part, to the applicants. However, the analysis of the domestic judgments reveals that the courts considered themselves incompetent to verify the factual basis for the finding contained in those materials that the first applicant constituted a danger to national security. It also appears that, given the general nature of the allegations against the first applicant, the applicants were not in a position effectively to challenge them.

During most of that time, with the exception of the period from 1996 to 2001, the first applicant lived in  with his wife and children. The Court attaches considerable weight to the solidity of the first applicant\u2019s family ties in Russia and the difficulties that his family would face were they to relocate to . The Court is mindful of the fact that the second, third and fourth applicants are Russian nationals who were born in  and have lived there all their lives. They have never lived in  and have no ties with that country. Even though the case file does not contain any information about whether they speak any Chinese, there is little doubt that in any case it would be difficult for them to re-adjust to life in  if they were to follow the first applicant there. Their resettlement would mean a radical upheaval for them, especially for the third and fourth applicants who are not of an adaptable age and who are attending school in . The first applicant\u2019s family can, of course, continue to contact him by letter or telephone, and they may also visit him in  from time to time, but the disruption to their family life should not be underestimated. It is also relevant that under Russian law the first applicant may not re-enter  for a period of five years after his administrative removal (see paragraphs 47 and 52 above).",

The authority must be competent to reject the executive\u2019s assertion that there is a threat to national security where it finds it arbitrary or unreasonable. There must be some form of adversarial proceedings, if need be through a special representative following security clearance.

The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention (see Lupsa\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a010337/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032 and 34, ECHR 2006-VII; AlNashif\u00a0v.

They define the circumstances in which an application for a residence permit can be rejected and administrative removal can be ordered. In particular, the Acts provide that such measures can be taken against a foreign national if he presents a national security risk or unlawfully resides in . The Foreign Nationals Act also provides that the security services must inform the authority responsible for issuing residence permits of any circumstances within their knowledge which might warrant refusal of a residence permit. Although it is true that Instruction no. 0300, \u201cOn organisation of the activities of the Federal Security Service in respect of the examination of materials concerning residence permits for foreign nationals\u201d, has not been published, this fact is not sufficient to render domestic law inaccessible or unforeseeable. The Instruction seems to be a purely technical document describing the internal organisation of the work of the security services without conferring on them any new powers not already provided for by the publicly accessible Foreign Nationals Act. The Court could therefore have considered that the relevant Russian legal provisions were sufficiently accessible to satisfy the requirements of Article 8 \u00a7 2.",

This requirement does not go so far as to compel States to enact legal provisions listing in detail all conduct that may prompt a decision to deport an individual on national security grounds. At the same time, it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must provide for sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure that the discretion left to the executive is exercised without abuse (see Al-Nashif, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-124).",

It is of decisive importance that the judges were able to study the confidential material from the security services and had the power to quash the decision refusing a residence permit to the first applicant if they considered that decision to be unlawful.
