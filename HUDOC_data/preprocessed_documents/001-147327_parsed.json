Nonetheless, the second and the third decisions contained whole passages copied from the first one, with the addition of some slight new developments in the inquiry. The Court notes that the investigators, when asked to take additional steps to carry out an effective and adequate preliminary inquiry, obtained clearly irrelevant materials, such as statements by exgirlfriends of four fellow inmates of the applicant in the IVS (see paragraph 19 above). In its view, this manner of carrying out an inquiry into serious allegations of ill-treatment while in the hands of police officers points to serious defects in the investigation taken as a whole, because these failings must have adversely affected the capacity of the investigation to collect and assess evidence relevant for the resolution of the case.",

However, it appears that certain crucial steps were not taken at all. For instance, the investigators failed to conduct interviews with important witnesses such as the doctors who had diagnosed the applicant with the chest injury and the rib fracture. Furthermore, as is clear from the wording of the refusal to institute an investigation of 4 April 2007, the domestic investigative authorities did not consider ordering a forensic expert examination of the applicant until it was too late (see paragraph 21 above). Such deficiencies on the part of the authorities caused, in the Court\u2019s view, precious time to be lost and made any further investigation of the applicant\u2019s allegations complicated, if not impossible (see, for similar reasoning, Ablyazov v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a058, 30 October 2012).",
