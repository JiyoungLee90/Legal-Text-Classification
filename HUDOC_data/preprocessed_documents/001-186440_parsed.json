The Court further recalls that a similar complaint was previously examined and declared inadmissible for being manifestly illfounded (see \u00d6kten v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22347/07, \u00a7\u00a7 51-53, 3\u00a0November 2011). The Court finds no reason to decide otherwise in the present case. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and\u00a04 of the Convention.",
