The domestic courts had not verified whether there was a real risk of his absconding or interfering with the course of the criminal proceedings. Nor had they provided the applicant with an opportunity to contest the statement that he was capable of tampering with witnesses or destruction of evidence.

In this respect, the Court accepts that the possession of the passport for travel could be a relevant factor in assessing the risk of flight. However, the danger of an accused absconding does not result just because it is possible or easy for him to cross the frontier: there must be a whole set of circumstances, such as, particularly, the lack of well-established ties in the country, which give reason to suppose that the consequences and hazards of flight will seem to him to be a lesser evil than continued imprisonment (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v. Austria, 10 November 1969, \u00a7\u00a015). The domestic courts did not mention any such circumstance in their decisions or point to any specific aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that the applicant presented a persistent flight risk. The applicant, on the other hand, constantly invoked the facts showing his close ties with Russia, such as his permanent place of residence, work and family in Russia, and cited other factors, for instance his age and poor health, to confirm that there was no danger of his absconding (see, by contrast, W. v.\u00a0Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 254A). The Court also does not overlook the fact, which was not disputed by the Government, that the applicant was not in custody for the first eight months after the criminal proceedings had been instituted on the bribery charge, having complied with the prosecution\u2019s orders and participated in the investigation process, whenever summoned. In any event, the domestic authorities did not explain why the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s Russian passport for travel, a measure explicitly envisaged in domestic law for removing flight risks, would not have been sufficient to prevent him from absconding abroad (see Lind v.\u00a0Russia, no. 25664/05, \u00a7\u00a081, 6 December 2007).",

The Court observes, and the parties did not dispute that fact, that the domestic authorities did not take any actions against either the applicant, his relatives or confidents, that they were never subject to any form of investigation and were not even questioned about the alleged attempts to manipulate witnesses. The Court is therefore not convinced that the domestic authorities\u2019 findings of the applicant\u2019s liability to pervert the course of justice had sufficient basis in fact (see, for similar reasoning, Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, \u00a7 132).",

In exceptional circumstances this factor may therefore be taken into account for the purposes of the Convention, in any event in so far as domestic law recognises the notion of disturbance to public order caused by an offence. However, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the release of the accused would actually disturb public order. In addition detention will continue to be legitimate only if public order remains actually threatened; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 51).",

Apart from the fact that Russian law does not list the notion of disturbance to public order among permissible grounds for detention of accused persons, the Court notes that the Government relied on the alleged danger to public interests from a purely abstract point of view, relying solely on the gravity of the offences allegedly committed by the applicant and insisting on the particular vulnerability of the social group which had suffered damage from the applicant\u2019s criminal activities. They did not provide any evidence or indicate any instance which could show that the applicant\u2019s release could have posed an actual danger to public order.",

Estonia, no. 55939/00, \u00a7 64, 15\u00a0February 2005, and Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 83, 21\u00a0December 2000). During the entire period under consideration the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring the applicant\u2019s attendance by the use of other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d \u2013 such as a written undertaking or bail \u2013 which are expressly provided for in Russian law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings. In this connection, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant offered to post bail and also listed sureties to secure his release. However, that guarantee was rejected without due consideration. Furthermore, the Court finds it particularly striking that the applicant was kept in custody for almost a year, from December 2007 to December 2008, for the sole purpose of studying the case file. However, at no point did either the Basmanniy District Court, the Moscow City Court or the Supreme Court, which examined the issue of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention during that period, consider having recourse to such alternative measures or, at the very minimum, seek to explain in their decisions why such alternatives would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course.",
