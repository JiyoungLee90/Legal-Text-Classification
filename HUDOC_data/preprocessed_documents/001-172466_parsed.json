The Government further explained that the use of an informant as a special investigative measure in respect of the applicant had been authorised only after the relevant information had come to light indicating that the applicant had been engaged in illegal activities in the Fund, which had already been under investigation by the State Attorney\u2019s Office. The Government stressed that it was apparent from the recorded conversation between the applicant and the informant J.K. of 3 April 2007 that the applicant had explained the details of the corruption and that J.K. had remained essentially passive and had not incited him to engage in any illegal activity. The same was true for the other meetings between the applicant and J.K. at which the applicant had taken a bribe in the amount of EUR 50,000 in cash and a deposit of EUR 150,000, and had also requested a further percentage of the overall value of the investment project. In the Government\u2019s view, it was obvious that the informant J.K. had not instigated but merely participated in the applicant\u2019s corruption.

In deciding whether the investigation was \u201cessentially passive\u201d the Court will examine the reasons underlying the covert operation, in particular, whether there were objective suspicions that the applicant had been involved in criminal activity or had been predisposed to commit a criminal offence (see Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, \u00a7 51, 23 October 2014) and the conduct of the authorities carrying it out, specifically whether the authorities exerted such an influence on the applicant as to incite the commission of an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, in order to make it possible to establish the offence, that is, to provide evidence and institute a prosecution (ibid., \u00a7 52; see also Morari v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 65311/09, \u00a7 32, 8 March 2016).",

The failure to afford such access has weighed, in the Court\u2019s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Beraru, cited above, \u00a7 70). In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice. The respect for the rights of the defence requires that limitations on access by an accused or his lawyer to the court file must not prevent the evidence being made available to the accused before the trial and the accused being given an opportunity to comment on it through his lawyer in oral submissions (see\u00a0\u00d6calan v.

Indeed, the applicant\u2019s application for access to the recordings was not denied because he had failed to substantiate it or because he had failed to provide acceptable reasons for his application.

This assessment is highly problematic. The defence cannot gain access to the content of the CDs and DVDs belonging to the second category which may contain evidence capable of affecting the determination of the applicant\u2019s culpability. Without having access to all relevant evidentiary material, how can the applicant form a specific argument about the relevance of material which remained unavailable to him throughout the entire proceedings?

The Court has already found in its case-law that the failure to afford such access has weighed in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached. This is because importance is attached to appearances as well as to increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice. Respect for the rights of the defence requires that limitations on access by an accused or his lawyer to the court file must not prevent the evidence being made available to the accused before the trial and the accused being given an opportunity to comment on it through his lawyer in oral submissions (see paragraph 159 of the judgment, with further references).

It simply decided that, notwithstanding the unlawfulness of the orders authorising the secret surveillance measures, the evidence obtained as a result of these measures could be used in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, as it was not \u201cunlawfully obtained evidence\u201d within the meaning of Article 9 \u00a7 2 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure (see again the quotation in paragraph 71 of the judgment). I do not find such a decision questionable per se. Our Court does not exclude, as a matter of principle and in the abstract, the possibility that unlawfully obtained evidence may be admissible evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a046, Series A no. 140). It has on occasion found that the admission in evidence of information obtained without a legal basis in domestic law, and therefore not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention, did not, in the circumstances of the case, conflict with the requirements of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, for example, Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, \u00a7\u00a7 34-40, ECHR 2000-V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7\u00a7 76-81, ECHR 2001IX; Vukota-Boji\u0107 v.

What went wrong in the present case (and in Dragojevi\u0107, for that matter) is that the investigating judge did not show that he thoroughly scrutinised the request of the State Attorney\u2019s Office, as required by law.
