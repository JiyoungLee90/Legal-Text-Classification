Secondly, out of those thirty-five only thirteen were identified (see paragraph 8 above). It would appear from the case file that the victims found had been identified by their family members on the basis of recognition only, and it is clear that not all the bodies could be recognised owing to the post-mortem changes. The eleventh applicant submitted, and the Government did not contest, that no DNA analysis had ever been performed to identify the rest of the bodies, not even after she had stated in court that she had recognised her brother\u2019s hand on one of the photographs of the bodies found (see paragraph 10 above). Thirdly, the applicant, for her part, claimed from the outset to the domestic authorities that her brother and sister-in-law had been on the boat, she had participated in the domestic proceedings as a witness and given statements to that effect, and had provided the Court with both her and her brother\u2019s birth certificates.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. That means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see \u0130lhan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000VII).",

The Court, for its part, has already found in an earlier case in which applicants had brought a compensation claim against the State on the basis of the provisions of the Obligations Act that the domestic courts neither acknowledged the breach as clearly as should have been necessary in the circumstances of that case nor afforded the applicants appropriate redress (see Mili\u0107 and Nikezi\u0107 v.\u00a0Montenegro, nos. 54999/10 and 10609/11, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76, 28 April 2015). As regards a compensation claim against private individuals, the Court notes that a plaintiff in such a case must, inter alia, identify the person believed to have committed the tort. In the instant case, however, it is still unknown who was responsible for the acts of which the applicant complained. Given the situation, there does not seem to have been any basis on which the eleventh applicant could have pursued a civil claim with any reasonable prospect of success (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

In the present case it was the State prosecutor who had to act whenever there was a reasonable suspicion that a publicly prosecutable offence had been committed (see paragraphs 47, and 11, 16-17, and 22 above). A victim only had the right to take over prosecution if the State prosecutor decided that there was no basis on which to prosecute (see paragraph 48 above), which was not the case here. Given that the investigation had already been started by the State prosecutor of his own motion, the Court considers that the eleventh applicant could legitimately have expected that the necessary investigation would be conducted without an additional specific, formal complaint from herself (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan, cited above, \u00a7 63). Also, it does not consider that a criminal complaint lodged by the eleventh applicant would have been capable of altering to any significant extent the course of the investigation that had been made (see, mutatis mutandis, Tanr\u0131kulu v.

In order to be effective, an investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Although it is not an obligation of result but of means, any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the circumstances of the case or the person responsible will risk falling foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see, inter alia, El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2012). Where an official investigation leads to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. It should in no way be inferred from the foregoing that Article 2 may entail the right for an applicant to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence. On the other hand, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-endangering offences to go unpunished (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, ECHR 2004XII). Given that the criminal trial is still under way, the issue to be assessed is not whether the judicial authorities, as guardians of the laws laid down to protect lives, were determined to sanction those responsible, if appropriate, but whether they had proceeded with exemplary diligence and promptness (see Mu\u010dibabi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 34661/07, \u00a7 132, 12\u00a0July 2016). While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating an alleged infringement of the right to life may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Mu\u010dibabi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0132; see, also, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7 108, 4 May 2001; McCaughey and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 43098/09, \u00a7 130, ECHR 2013; and Hemsworth v. the United Kingdom, no. 58559/09, \u00a7 69, 16 July 2013).",

Moreover, the trial was recommenced on at least three occasions because delays in proceedings necessitated a fresh trial, despite the relevant statutory provision providing that courts have a duty to conduct proceedings without delay (see paragraphs 31-33 and 46 above). The Ombudsman considered unjustified the length of the investigation and the ensuing criminal proceedings as early as in December 2009 and recommended that the High Court terminate the proceedings as soon as possible (see paragraph 35 above).

The Court reiterates that violations have also been found where a trial continued unduly (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, \u00a7\u00a0151, ECHR 2009, a case where the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than six years and were still pending).\u00a0In that regard, the Court would stress that the passage of time inevitably erodes the amount and quality of evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence casts doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts (see Trubnikov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a049790/99, \u00a7 92, 5 July 2005). Moreover, the very passage of time is definitely liable to compromise the chances of an investigation being completed (see M.B. v. Romania, no. 43982/06, \u00a7 64, 3 November 2011). It also prolongs the ordeal for members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002II). The Court considers that in Article 2 cases concerning proceedings instituted to elucidate the circumstances of an individual\u2019s death, lengthy proceedings are a strong indication that the proceedings were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State\u2019s procedural obligations under the Convention, unless the State has provided highly convincing and plausible reasons to justify such a course of proceedings (see Mu\u010dibabi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 135). Indeed, in the present case, the Court considers that the Government have failed to justify such lengthy proceedings following the ratification date.",
