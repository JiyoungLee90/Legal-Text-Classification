Their residence was duly registered and they had been dutifully paying all the applicable fees connected with their occupancy of the flat. The fact that the building owner had failed to comply with certain formalities connected with regularising their occupancy was not their fault. In addition, evicting them on this basis should have become time-barred in 2004 (three years after they had moved into the flat). Lastly, the applicants referred to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy v.

In the present case, it is not clear whether the disputed eviction order has been enforced. This circumstance does not, however, preclude the Court from examining the present complaint, as the obligation on the applicants to vacate the flat amounted to an interference with their right to respect for their home (see, for example, \u0106osi\u0107 v.
