The case originated in seventy four separate applications against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The applicants are all Serbian nationals, and their further personal details are set out in the Appendix to this judgment.
The applicants were all represented before the Court by Mr D. Vasiljević, a lawyer practising in Majdanpek. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Rodić.
On 11 July 2014 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
All the applicants were employed by RTB Bor – grupa Industrija za preradu Majdanpek, a socially-owned company based in Majdanpek (hereinafter “the debtor”).
Since the debtor had failed to fulfil its obligations toward its employees, the applicants brought numerous separate civil suits, seeking payment of salary arrears and various social security contributions.
The applicants obtained final court judgments ordering the debtor to pay them certain sums. The essential information as to the domestic proceedings in respect of each application is indicated in the appended table.
Following a period during which the enforcement proceedings had been suspended, between June and August 2011 the final court judgments in question were all fully enforced in respect of the applicants.
Since October 2011, the debtor is a company predominantly comprised of State or socially owned capital and is still in the process of being restructured.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies and enforcement proceedings is outlined in the case of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008.
