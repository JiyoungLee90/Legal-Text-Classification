In convicting these police officers under Article\u00a0243 of the Criminal Code, the court further found that the police officers had inflicted such treatment intentionally in order to extract confessions (see paragraph 42 above). That decision was quashed by the Court of Cassation on a sentencing technicality. However, the proceedings were subsequently discontinued for being timebarred. In the instant case no cogent evidence has been provided which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact of the first-instance court in this respect.",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In this connection, the Court considers that the treatment complained of was inflicted intentionally by the police officers for the purpose of extracting confessions. In these circumstances, the Court finds that it was particularly serious and cruel and capable of causing severe pain and suffering. It therefore concludes that the ill-treatment involved in this case amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",
