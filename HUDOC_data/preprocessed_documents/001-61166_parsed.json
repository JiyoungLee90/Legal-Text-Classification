As regards the conduct of the domestic authorities, however, the Court observes that there had been a substantial period of inactivity of more than three years and three months before the Administrative Court, i.e. between 27 June 1990, when the applicant lodged his appeal and 12 October 1993, when the Administrative Court gave its decision. The Court considers that this period of inertia is incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement under Article 6, which cannot be made up by the overall duration of the proceedings, during which the case had been dealt with once at three levels of jurisdiction and, in a second round, at four levels of jurisdiction.",
