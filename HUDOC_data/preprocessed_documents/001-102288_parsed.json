The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant's conviction had largely been based on mere presumptions, namely that the  had relied on the confession he had made during the pre-trial investigation in the absence of a lawyer; this confession was not corroborated by any strong evidence against him. It further criticised the first-instance court for its failure to address the applicant's complaint that he had had no access to a lawyer following his arrest as a suspect. Although it disregarded the lawyer's statements made under oath as untruthful, the  did not initiate criminal proceedings against her for perjury. According to the Court of Appeal, the first-instance court had selectively admitted and interpreted evidence (thus, according to the report of the first questioning of the victim's son, he had replied in the negative to a quite suggestive question from the investigator as to whether the intruder looked like the applicant to him, while it was noted in the verdict that he had stated the contrary). Lastly, the Court of Appeal pointed out some issues, which, although pertinent, remained uninvestigated: for example, that the victim was visited by unidentified persons on the eve of his murder, and the disorder in his house, which was not mentioned in the applicant's confession.",

In order to meet that requirement, the national judicial authorities must examine all the factors for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest, justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is not the Court's task to establish such factors and take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant's detention. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the domestic courts' decisions and of the established facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Labita v.

As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first questioning of a suspect by the police, unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used to secure a conviction (see Salduz v.

Both the national courts and the Government attributed specific weight to the fact that on 20 April 2003 the applicant had explicitly waived his right to counsel and had willingly participated in several investigative measures.

Furthermore, the waiver in question concerned only one investigative measure, namely the applicant's questioning by the investigator, whereas the applicant was subjected to other investigative measures thereafter, including at night, without access to counsel. The Court next observes that the lawyer hired by the applicant's parents to represent him was denied access to the applicant, not on the basis of that waiver, but under such artificial grounds as that he was a witness (while at the time he was being questioned as a suspect) and that he had not signed the authority form (which he could not possibly have done as he was in detention). Lastly, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant retracted his confessions immediately once he was in the lawyer's presence and never repeated them while legally represented (see paragraphs 28 and 31 above). In the light of all these considerations, the Court concludes that there was no unequivocal waiver by the applicant of his right to legal assistance in the circumstances of the present case. Neither were there any other compelling reasons for restricting his right to legal assistance. The authorities were thus under the obligation to provide the applicant with access to a lawyer from his first questioning by the police, which they failed to comply with.",
