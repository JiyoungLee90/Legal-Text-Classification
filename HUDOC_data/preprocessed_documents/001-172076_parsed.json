Reviewing the facts of the present case in the light of its wellestablished jurisprudence (see, in particular, Kozinets v.

For the reasons set out below, the Court considers that the difficulty in determining the substance of the applicant\u2019s allegation of ill-treatment stems from the authorities\u2019 failure to investigate her complaint effectively (see, in particular, Timofejevi v.

It appears that none of the aforementioned police officers was suspended from duty for the period of the investigation. In that connection, the Court would once again underline the importance of the suspension from duty of an agent under investigation or on trial on charges of ill-treatment, as well as his or her dismissal if convicted (Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v.
