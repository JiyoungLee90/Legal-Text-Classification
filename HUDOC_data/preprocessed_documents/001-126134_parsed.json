Although the applicant maintained that he had been ill-treated while in police custody, in their observations the Government stated that the police officers had had to use force to arrest the applicant, who had been among the resisting demonstrators. The Court observes in this connection that there are three medical reports in the case file which reveal extensive bruises on the applicant\u2019s back and on the side of his leg. It also notes that in his investigation, the public prosecutor failed to establish the cause of those injuries. For the reasons explained below (see paragraphs 31-34), the investigation into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment allegations cannot be considered effective, as required by Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, in the absence of further information, the Court cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant was ill-treated while in police custody as alleged.",

In reaching this conclusion, the Court has particular regard to the fact that the three medical reports issued while the applicant was in police custody recorded bruises on his back and leg. In the Court\u2019s view, the domestic authorities were thus under an obligation to conduct an effective investigation regarding the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment.",

However, the investigation ended on 27\u00a0October 2008, namely two years after the incident, with a decision not to prosecute. The Court finds it striking that in delivering his decision, the public prosecutor relied solely on the fact that the applicant had not been questioned by the police. The appeal against that decision was dismissed on 26 February 2009. It appears from the documents in the case file that the public prosecutor made no serious attempts to discover the real cause of the injuries noted on the applicant\u2019s body. In their observations, the Government suggested that the applicant had been injured during arrest, as the police had had to use force to disperse the resisting demonstrators. However, the Court notes that in the course of his investigation, the public prosecutor did not take any steps to clarify that assumption. Instead, he merely concluded that as the applicant had not been questioned by the police, his allegations of ill-treatment were unsubstantiated.",

Furthermore, it is striking that the public prosecutor did not take any statements from potential eyewitnesses who had been arrested and held in detention on remand with the applicant. Statements of the police officers involved in the applicant\u2019s arrest could also have provided information establishing the facts of the incident. The Court therefore concludes that the investigation in the present case cannot be considered as complying with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention.",
