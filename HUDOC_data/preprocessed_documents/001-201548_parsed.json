However, given the available evidence, the exact amount of the actual benefits the applicant would have been entitled to for working as a local councillor between October 2010 and 2016 remains unclear. Moreover, it does not seem that he was unemployed or without income over the relevant period of time or that his benefits would have exceeded the income he actually earned following his removal from office. The Court, therefore, rejects the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage (see, mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2000IV).",
