There were many people in shabby clothes. All of us were standing upright, repeating the slogans. Next to me a woman was only mouthing the ovations because she was so tired. So, when I turned my head under the scorching sun, I saw a man grabbing her arm and telling her discreetly to follow him. Only because she had mouthed the words. I was no longer interested in seeing the great leader. We left and after we had left the stadium well behind I kept asking my mum: Why?

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 300/11, \u00a7 42, 6\u00a0September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Margulev v. Russia, no. 15449/09, \u00a7 40, 8 October 2019, with further references).",

In cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the Court. This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media (see, with further references, Sylka v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 19219/07, \u00a7\u00a028, 3\u00a0June 2014).",

Seen in the context of the essential role a functioning justice system has in ensuring the proper functioning of any democratic society (see, among other authorities, Narodni List D.D. v.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may entail excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are a question of practice (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a01), 26\u00a0April 1979, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 30; Perin\u00e7ek v.

It is true that the Government have not disputed that the decision in the code-of-conduct proceedings was permanently included in her professional file and would be taken into account in her professional appraisal for 2011-13, which seems to be still pending. Also, during the 2017 competition for promotion to the Court of Cassation the IJ relied on the aforementioned decision when it produced its negative report concerning the applicant\u2019s professional integrity, which suggests that the impugned penalty was relevant and affected the assessment of the applicant\u2019s applications for promotions (see paragraphs 49-50 above).",
