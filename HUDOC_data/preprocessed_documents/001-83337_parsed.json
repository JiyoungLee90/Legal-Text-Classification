Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II). However, all claims for just satisfaction must be particularised and supported by relevant documentation, failing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part. The applicant has not submitted itemised bills of costs to the Court. Without details of the work done and the hourly rates charged, it is not possible for the Court to determine whether the costs were necessarily incurred and reasonable as to quantum. On the basis of the information in its possession and taking into account that the issues concerning WMA were established in Willis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,000 for legal costs and expenses, in addition to any VAT that may be payable.",
