It was true that the degree of risk to fighting power was not consistent over time, given that attitudes and opinions, and, consequently, domestic law on the subject of homosexuality had developed over the years.

The process of review was ongoing and the Government indicated their commitment to a free vote in Parliament on the subject after the next Parliamentary Select Committee review of the policy in 2001.",

The Government submitted that the armed forces\u2019 personnel (on whose views the HPAT report was based) were best placed to make this risk assessment and that their views should therefore be afforded considerable weight.

Even assuming that the attitudes on which the HPAT report was based were at least in part based on a lack of tolerance or on insufficient broadmindedness, the reality of the risk to effectiveness remained. It was true that many European armed forces no longer excluded homosexuals but the relevant changes had been adopted in those countries too recently to yield any valuable lessons.",

Most of those surveyed displayed a clear difference in attitude towards homosexuality in civilian life. Conclusions could not be drawn from the fact that women and racial minorities were admitted while homosexuals were not because women and men were segregated in recognition of potential problems that might arise, whereas such arrangements were simply not possible in the case of same sex orientation.

The aim of the investigations was to verify the homosexuality of the person suspected in order to detect those seeking an administrative discharge based on false pretences. During the hearing, the Government gave two recent examples of false claims of homosexuality in the army and in the Royal Air Force and three recent examples of such false claims in the Royal Navy. The investigations were also necessary given certain security concerns (in particular, the risk of blackmail of homosexual personnel), in light of the greater risk from the Aids virus in the homosexual community and for disciplinary reasons (homosexual acts might be disciplined in certain cases including, for example, where they resulted from an abuse of authority).

Given the number of homosexuals dismissed between 1991 and 1996 (see paragraph 60 above), the number of homosexuals who were in the armed forces at the relevant time cannot be said to be insignificant.

In any event, the Government themselves recognised during the hearing that the choice between a conduct code and the maintenance of the policy lay at the heart of the judgment to be made in this case. This is also consistent with the Government\u2019s direct reliance on Section F of the HPAT\u2019s report, where the anticipated problems identified as posing a risk to morale were almost exclusively problems relating to behaviour and conduct (see paragraphs 46-47 above).

The Court noted (at paragraph 96 of the judgment) that the HPAT considered that \u201cseparate accommodation for homosexuals would not be warranted or wise\u201d and the Court found that, in any case, \u201cit ha[d] not been shown that the conduct codes and disciplinary rules ... could not adequately deal with any behavioural issues arising on the part either of homosexuals or of heterosexuals\u201d. The fact that separate accommodation is not \u201cwarranted or wise\u201d does not justify communal accommodation if such accommodation is really problematic. On the other hand, \u201cconduct codes and disciplinary rules\u201d cannot change the sexual orientation of people and the relevant problems which \u2013 for the purposes of the issue under consideration \u2013 in the analogous case of women makes it incumbent to accommodate them separately from male soldiers. It is the compulsory living together of groups of people of different sexual orientation which creates the problem. I should add here that if homosexuals had a right to be members of the armed forces their sexual orientation could become known either through them disclosing it or manifesting it in some way.",

This was accepted by the Court. My disagreement with the majority relates to the question of whether the interference in the present case can be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for the aim in question. The majority underlined the principle that when the relevant restrictions to a Convention right concern a most intimate part of an individual\u2019s private life there must exist particularly ",

This, I think, is the logical connotation of the principle that in assessing the pressing social need in cases of interferences with the right to respect for an individual\u2019s private life from the standpoint of the protection of national security, the State has a wide margin of appreciation (see the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, \u00a7\u00a059). ",

As I have already stated above, the sexual orientation of homosexuals does create the problems highlighted by the Government as a result of the communal accommodation with heterosexuals. There is nothing patently disproportionate in the approach of the Government. On the contrary, it was in the circumstances reasonably open to them to adopt the policy of not allowing homosexuals in the armed forces. This condition was made clear to the applicants before their recruitment. It was not imposed afterwards (cf. the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 25, \u00a7 62). In this respect it may be useful to add that the Convention does not guarantee the right to serve in the armed forces (see Marangos v. Cyprus, application no.\u00a031106/96, decision on admissibility, 3 December 1997, p. 14, unpublished). ",
