The case originated in an application (no. 75280/10) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Dragan Petrović (“the applicant”), on 2 December 2010.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 30 March 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Šabac.
The applicant was employed by “Zorka -mineralna đubriva” AD, a socially/State-owned company based in Šabac (hereinafter – “the debtor”).
On 3 July 2003 the Šabac Municipal Court ordered the debtor to pay the applicant certain sums in respect of salary arrears and procedural costs. On the same date the judgment became final.
On 17 May 2007 the applicant lodged an application for the enforcement of the above court decision with the Šabac Municipal Court.
On 18 May 2007 the court allowed the application and issued an enforcement order.
On 19 February 2008 the enforcement proceedings were stayed because the debtor was undergoing restructuring.
On 2 March 2010 the applicant urged the court to continue the enforcement proceedings.
On 1 June 2010 the court informed the applicant that the debtor was still undergoing restructuring and that therefore the enforcement proceedings could not be continued.
On 10 July 2002 the Privatisation Agency ordered the restructuring of the debtor as part of privatisation process. The restructuring of the debtor is still ongoing.
