Slovakia, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, \u00a7 75). The Court further observes that the applicant provided receipts and vouchers to substantiate her expenses for preparation of documents and sending them to the Court. Regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a0125 covering costs under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
