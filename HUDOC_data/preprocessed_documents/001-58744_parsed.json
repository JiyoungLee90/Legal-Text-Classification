It is indeed the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder. But the sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary sentence of which part is punitive (retribution and deterrence) and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety when the test of dangerousness is satisfied. The fact that the mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its period: see R. v. Secretary of State, ex. p. Doody & others [1993] Q.B. 157 and Wynne v. UK (E.C.H.R. 1st December 1992). The order for detention under section 53 is by its terms both discretionary and indeterminate: it provides for detention \u2018during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure\u2019. (Section 53(4) which expressly authorised the Secretary of State to discharge the detainee on licence \u2018at any time\u2019 was repealed by the Parole Board provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, but this does not, in my judgment, alter the nature of the sentence in any material respect.) I would decide the present case on the narrow ground that, notwithstanding Home Office and Parole Board practice, the applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether Wilson rather than Payne governs his case.\u201d",

It also notes the length of time - ten years - during which the applicant did not receive a review by a body complying with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. In these circumstances, it considers that the applicant must have suffered feelings of frustration, uncertainty and anxiety which cannot be compensated solely by the findings of violations. It does not, however, consider that the domestic scales of compensation applicable to unlawful detention apply in the present case where there has been no equivalent finding of unlawfulness. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, it awards 1,500 GPB for non-pecuniary damage. ",

It is not apparent therefore that there were any increased costs resulting from the nominal change in representation. Nonetheless, it finds the amount of costs claimed in respect of the period after the case was declared admissible disproportionate. Accordingly, making an assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the sum of 2, 264.40 GBP in respect of the initial work done in the case and 1,400 GBP in respect of the period after admissibility, together with any VAT which may be payable. This makes a total of 3664.40 GBP, less the sum of 4100 French francs received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe.",
