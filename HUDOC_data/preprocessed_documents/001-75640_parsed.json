The first delay was caused by the bailiffs service which returned the writ to the applicant instead of forwarding it directly to the competent State agency. Further significant delays were occasioned by the difference of opinion between the two Ministries as to which one should pay the award. Finally, the applicant was never informed of the bank transfer to his account.
