HRK 50,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the injury to his reputation (see paragraphs 14-15 above).

The Court is aware that under certain circumstances slandering someone or reiterating earlier libellous statement in a courtroom may constitute a separate cause of action for defamation. However, in the present case the cause of action was the applicant\u2019s statements to the media, and not those he made before the first-instance court in the ensuing civil proceedings. In particular, the domestic courts held the applicant liable for damages because the word \u201cmachinations\u201d was used in the title of the article to describe A.H.\u2019s actions, and not because the applicant subsequently agreed with that description at the hearing before the first-instance court (see paragraph 23 above).

In that conversation the applicant also allegedly accused A.H. of threatening him that he would not become a professor as long as A.H. was the Minister. The domestic courts found that these allegations were both untrue and defamatory. However, they had difficulties to establish, with the requisite degree of certainty, whether the applicant had actually made those allegations, and if so whether he had authorised the publication of the article, both of which the applicant denied. The courts eventually found, basing themselves exclusively on the testimony of the journalist of Imperijal who had interviewed the applicant, that the applicant had retold the content of the telephone conversation to the journalist, precisely so that he could publish it. They therefore held the applicant (together with the publishing company jointly and severally) liable for tarnishing A.H.\u2019s reputation. The domestic courts also held that even if the two defamatory statements were a complete fabrication by the journalist, this could not have exonerated the applicant from liability, as he, knowing that the article contained untruths, had not denied them nor asked the magazine to publish a denial (see paragraph 20 above).",

In particular, while the applicant testified that during the telephone conversation with Dr\u00a0I.V. he had indeed mentioned A.H.\u2019s threats that he would never become a professor (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above), there is nothing in that testimony that would suggest that the applicant also said that in doing so A.H. had used the words \u201cas long as I am the Minister\u201d, as was reported in the second article. Whether the applicant said that A.H. had threatened him by using those words or not, is important because the answer to that question is decisive for the issue of whether the applicant\u2019s statement may be regarded as a factual statement or a value judgment. In this connection the Court reiterates that drawing inferences from the existing facts, such as, for example, attributing or imputing motives or intentions to someone\u2019s behaviour, is generally intended to convey opinions, and is thus more akin to value judgments (see Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no.\u00a023118/93, \u00a7 50, ECHR 1999VIII). Therefore, if the applicant in the telephone conversation at issue told Dr I.V. that A.H. had threatened him by using the words \u201cas long as I am the Minister\u201d, his statement is to be viewed as a statement of fact and thus susceptible of proof. On the other hand, if the applicant told his interlocutor during that conversation about A.H.\u2019s threats without referring to the impugned phrase, his statements are to be seen as value judgments. If the latter is the case, he cannot be blamed for having understood what A.H. said to him at the round table on health care of 15\u00a0October 1996 as a threat because, having regard to the minutes of that round table (see paragraph 13 above), he had, in the Court\u2019s view, a sufficient factual basis to support that belief.",

However, having regard to the importance of the principle that an individual\u2019s liability in defamation must not extend beyond his or her own words, as well as the potential chilling effects which breaches of that principle can have on freedom of expression (see paragraph 39 above), the Court finds that there are cogent elements leading it to depart from that factual finding of the domestic courts in the present case. Firstly, from the domestic courts\u2019 finding that the applicant retold the content of the telephone conversation to the journalist so that he could publish it, it does not necessarily follow that the journalist reported it accurately. As Dr\u00a0I.V. and three other witnesses were unable to confirm that the applicant had used the impugned phrase, and since the applicant categorically denied having done so, it would seem that in the absence of other evidence (such as audio recording of the telephone conversation in question or of the subsequent discussion between the applicant and the journalist) this finding was based exclusively on the testimony of the journalist, whose credibility appears dubious, as he clearly had an interest in proving that what he had published was accurate. To defer to the factual findings of the domestic courts in such circumstances and to accept that plaintiffs in defamation cases would have to meet such a low standard of proof would render meaningless the principle that liability in defamation must not go beyond one\u2019s own words. Their finding that during the telephone conversation at issue the applicant had told his interlocutor that A.H. had threatened him by using the phrase \u201cas long as I am the Minister\u201d, was therefore not based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts. As a consequence thereof, the domestic courts mistakenly qualified the applicant\u2019s statement as a statement of fact, rather than as a value judgment the veracity of which is not susceptible of proof. While it is true that value judgments may be excessive in the absence of any factual basis, the Court has already found this was not so in the present case (see paragraph 69 above).",

The Court is unaware, and the Government did not furnish any evidence, of any statutory provision or any case-law of the domestic courts requiring defendants in defamation cases (civil or criminal) to deny or retract defamatory statements in order to be exempted from liability. On the contrary, as correctly pointed out by the applicant (see paragraph 55 above), it was A.H. who should have denied the published defamatory statements as he was, pursuant to section 31(2) of the Public Information Act (see paragraph 29 above), the only person in the present case who had the right to have such a denial published.",
