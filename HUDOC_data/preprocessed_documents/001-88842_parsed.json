However, in 2006 the proceedings against the officers were dropped as they were time-barred. The Court notes in the first place that, although the public prosecutor filed his indictment with the  on 4 July 1997, the first-instance court pronounced its judgment on 2 December 2002, almost five years and five months later. In the Court\u2019s view, the length of the proceedings was excessive and the Government have not provided any explanation for this state of affairs. Despite the fact that the assize court found four police officers guilty of torture at the end of the proceedings, the case was then dropped as the statutory time-limit of five years had elapsed. In this context, the Court reiterates its earlier finding in a number of cases that the Turkish criminal law system can prove to be far from rigorous and have no dissuasive effect capable of ensuring the effective prevention of unlawful acts perpetrated by State agents if criminal proceedings brought against the latter are dropped for being time-barred (see among others, Ye\u015fil and Sevim, cited above, \u00a7 42, and H\u00fcseyin Esen v. , no.\u00a049048/99, \u00a7\u00a063, 8 August 2006).
