The fact that the migration authorities did not maintain offices within transit zones and the fact that no relevant information was available therein limited individuals\u2019 capacity to apply for refugee status on their own. Where UNHCR became involved, the migration authorities refused to accept applications, arguing that these should be lodged through the BGS. Lately, only international staff of UNHCR had been able to gain admission to transit zones without prior authorisation.

The difference between deprivation of and restriction on liberty is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see Nolan and K. v. Russia, no. 2512/04, \u00a7 93, 12 February 2009). Holding aliens in an international zone of an airport involves a restriction on liberty which is not in every respect comparable to that which obtains in detention centres. However, such confinement is acceptable only if it is accompanied by safeguards for the persons concerned and is not prolonged excessively. Otherwise, a mere restriction on liberty is turned into a deprivation of liberty. Account should be taken of the fact that the measure is applicable not to those who have committed criminal offences but to aliens who, often fearing for their lives, have fled from their own country. The mere fact that it was possible for the applicants to leave Russia voluntarily cannot rule out an infringement of the right to liberty (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 48, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, and Riad and Idiab v. Belgium, nos.\u00a029787/03 and 29810/03, \u00a7 68, 24\u00a0January 2008).",

In my view, none of those three factors has anything to do with the deprivation of liberty. The only general remark that I can add here is that the above consideration reflects a neo-liberal concept of social life, where liberties prevail over the public interest and individual responsibility, so it appears that the State becomes responsible for any difficulties in private life even if those difficulties were provoked by the individuals themselves.",

To my mind they were not, because the necessary factual circumstances were lacking. Obviously, the applicants placed themselves in a difficult situation (and this was their own choice), but we cannot say that the situation was degrading for their human dignity (compare Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, 10 January 2012). The applicants complained that the authorities did nothing to take care of them. In my view, this is a strange statement, but the Court has again agreed with this shifting of the burden from irresponsible aliens to the State authorities. This neo-liberal concept prevents the Court from raising the question: did the applicants try to solve their problems themselves? This is how the arbitrary shifting of responsibility starts to become an institutionalised interpretation of the Convention as an international instrument.",

The approach based on the above-mentioned concept makes it possible to require more from governments than is necessary. This approach does not encourage individuals to seek independence and responsibility, but instead develops completely opposite human qualities. Thus tolerance is expressed for those who would leave their home country for a better place rather than try to improve their life at home, make their own contribution to the national economic situation or fight for peace in their homeland. Why do we expect ourselves to be constantly active, to be involved in the education process, to show responsibility and initiative, to develop culturally, but not require such ambitions from others, or at least expect others to also be motivated to demonstrate those qualities?",

His situation could be classified as detention and it was even worse than in the present case: he could not return to his home country because all flights had been cancelled for security reasons; his passport was not recognised as valid owing to the uncertain political situation in the country of origin; he had a valid visa, but it was arbitrarily cancelled by the \u201cmost democratic\u201d authorities in the world, and he did not travel to a third country to look for a job.",

This approach automatically (and therefore arbitrarily) shifts the responsibility onto the State for actions which are not within its control (general, or personal, unfavourable situation in the home country). Let me demonstrate how far (up to the fundamental elements of a State) the Court may go in its controversial considerations. This is an extract from the Riab and Idiab judgment (see Riad and Idiab v.
