He could not remember their names. He was certain that the identity papers were genuine, as he had often seen such documents before. In accordance with the instructions on access of unauthorised personnel into the airport security zone, V.T. accompanied the two men to the waiting area. The police officer on duty there, Ts., called Mr Yanayev to the room used for personal searches. The two RUBOP officers entered the room together with Mr Yanayev, while V.T. waited outside.

By that time, three vehicles \u2013 one Niva and two UAZ \u2013 had crossed the airport security perimeter and were parked by that exit. The witness did not recall their registration numbers.

Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing persons by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aziyevy v. Russia, no. 7626/01, \u00a7 74, 20 March 2008; Utsayeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a029133/03, \u00a7 160, 29 May 2008; and Khutsayev and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a016622/05, \u00a7 104, 27 May 2010). If the Government failed to rebut this presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no.\u00a020303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a049379/09, \u00a7\u00a071, 3 May 2012).",

The Court notes, in particular, that he was detained in the security zone of an airport which persons and vehicles were allowed to enter only after undergoing a thorough check by the police and the airport security services and upon presentation of valid identity documents. The proceedings in respect of V.T., who was in charge of the airport security services and was himself an officer of the FSB, failed to establish any fault in his actions when he had allowed the men whom he believed to be officers to enter the security zone and carry out the arrest (see paragraphs 12, 20, 28 and 35 above). There is nothing in the documents reviewed by the Court to support the Government\u2019s assertion that the identity documents had been forged. Finally, the Court remarks that the domestic criminal proceedings have treated Mr Yanayev\u2019s disappearance as murder (see paragraph 20 above).",

It appears too that this line of inquiry was pursued by the domestic criminal investigations. As can be seen from many previous judgments involving allegations of disappearances, such security operations in the region have taken place without prior or subsequent acknowledgment, and have been routinely denied by the authorities (see for example, Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a068007/01, \u00a7\u00a059, 5\u00a0July 2007; Vakhayeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a01758/04, \u00a7\u00a0134, 29\u00a0October 2009; Mutsolgova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a02952/06, \u00a7\u00a0100, 1\u00a0April 2010; and Malika Alikhadzhiyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a037193/08, \u00a7\u00a088, 24\u00a0May 2011). Bearing this in mind, the Court finds that the theory that the crime might have been committed by imposters is at variance with the established facts in this case. The Court rejects it as mere conjecture which is not supported by any evidence. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s arguments are insufficient to discharge them of their burden of proof in a case where there is prima facie evidence of State control over the disappeared person.",
