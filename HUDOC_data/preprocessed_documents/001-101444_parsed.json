Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a7 19, 27 May 2004, and Arat and Others v. Turkey, nos. 42894/04, 42904/04, 42905/04, 42906/04, 42907/04, 42908/04, 42909/04 and 42910/04, \u00a7 19, 13 January 2009). In such cases, the  authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed of the judgment and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for execution. However, a successful litigant may be required to undertake certain procedural steps in order to recover the judgment debt, be it during a voluntary execution of a judgment by the State or during its enforcement by compulsory means (see Shvedov v. Russia, no. 69306/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029\u201337, 20\u00a0October 2005). In this connection, the Court notes from the documents in the case file that contrary to the Government's allegations, the applicant in the instant case made a number of appeals to the authorities over the years to obtain his money, virtually all of which were left unanswered until the payment was finally made in June 2005. Moreover, the applicant sought a decision of clarification from the  regarding the amount he was due with the aim of bringing execution proceedings against the Ministry for that amount. The rejection of his request by the administrative court, however, removed any possibility of compulsory enforcement of the judgment in question. In these circumstances, the Court considers that for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies. The Government's preliminary objection must therefore be rejected.",

Bearing in mind that the payment was made on 30 June 2005 and the instant application was lodged with the Court on 30\u00a0December 2005, the Court finds that the applicant has complied with the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and, therefore, rejects the Government's objection (see Akku\u015f v.
