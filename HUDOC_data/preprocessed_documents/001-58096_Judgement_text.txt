The case was referred to the Court by the Greek Government (“the Government”) on 6 August 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 18996/91) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by Garyfallou AEBE, a company registered under Greek law, on 12 October 1991.
The Government’s application referred to Articles 44 and 48 of the Convention. Its object was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant company stated that it wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent it (Rule 30).
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr N. Valticos, the elected judge of Greek nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 2 September 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr B. Repik and Mr P. van Dijk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5). Subsequently Mr F. Matscher, substitute judge, replaced Mr Gölcüklü, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant company’s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the memorials of the applicant company and the Government on 14 and 18 March 1997 respectively.
On 4 April 1997 the applicant company informed the Registrar that it did not wish to be represented at the hearing.
In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 May 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Mr Rozakis and Mr Kondolaimos.
The applicant company, Garyfallou AEBE, an international carrier, has its registered office in Kavala (Kavala).
On 24 March 1986 the Deputy Minister of Commerce, using powers under section 8 (2) of Law no. 936/1979 (see paragraph 17 below), ordered the applicant company to pay a fine of 500,000 drachmas for having violated the rules concerning import and export trade, when importing glass panels from Romania of a total value of 15,050 German marks.
On 9 April 1986 the applicant company challenged the imposition of the fine before the First Instance Administrative Court (Diikitiko Protodikio) of Athens. In its judgment of 8 April 1987 (no. 5214/1987) the court considered that the applicant company's appeal (prosfigi) did not give rise to a dispute coming within the competence of the lower administrative courts (diikitiki diafora usias); it was in reality an action for annulment (akirotiki diafora) and as such it came within the competence of the Supreme Administrative Court (Symvoulio tis Epikratias). As a result, the case was referred to that jurisdiction.
On 24 August 1987 the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court fixed a hearing for 19 April 1988. This hearing was, however, adjourned as were the hearings fixed for 7 February and 5 December 1989 and 6 February, 5 June and 4 December 1990. A hearing eventually took place on 8 January 1991.
In the meantime the Supreme Administrative Court, sitting in plenary, had issued judgment no. 149/1990 in which it considered that there did not exist any general principle or specific legal provision providing for the referral to the Supreme Administrative Court of actions for annulment which had been wrongly introduced before the lower administrative courts.
On 14 April 1991 the fine was paid together with a 100% increase as a penalty for late payment.
On 16 April 1991 the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court, applying the findings of the Plenary, held that the applicant company’s action for annulment had not been introduced in accordance with the law and decided to refrain from examining the case further (judgment no. 1260/1991).
On 11 October 1991 Law no. 1968/1991 was promulgated, allowing by virtue of section 40 (2) (see paragraph 21 below) for the reintroduction before the competent court of legal actions previously rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court or the lower administrative courts on a number of grounds, including lack of competence.
The applicant company reintroduced its action for annulment before the Supreme Administrative Court on 10 February 1992 and a hearing was fixed for 18 October 1994. On that date the examination of the case was adjourned until 30 May 1995, when a further adjournment was ordered.
On 28 November 1995 a hearing was held. The judge rapporteur considered that the Supreme Administrative Court was not competent to deal with the applicant company’s case, which was not an action for annulment. He proposed that it be referred to the Athens First Instance Administrative Court. In its judgment no. 1776/1996 of 9 April 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court decided to follow the rapporteur’s proposal. The case was referred to the Athens First Instance Administrative Court before which a hearing took place on 27 September 1996. On 18 June 1997 the Athens First Instance Administrative Court notified its decision to the applicant company. The ministerial order of 24 March 1986 was held to be ineffective.
By section 8 of Law no. 936/1979:
“1.  Persons who contravene the rules concerning import and export trade are punishable with imprisonment of a maximum duration of two years or with a fine which cannot exceed the total value of the goods concerned or with a combination of the two penalties ... Criminal proceedings are instituted ex officio by the public prosecutor ...
The Minister of Commerce ... may impose a fine, which shall not exceed the total value of the goods concerned, on the persons who have contravened one of the rules mentioned in the previous paragraph. The fine is imposed independently of the criminal prosecution of the offender or of his eventual acquittal ...”
According to the case-law, the fine provided for in section 8 (2) of Law no. 936/1979 is imposed to enforce rules which aim at “the control of the balance of trade and payments and [at] the protection of monetary stability and of the foreign currency reserves of the country” (Athens Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment no. 1241/1988, Diikitiki Diki, vol. 1989, p. 318). The imposition of such a fine involves the disapproval of the offender (Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment no. 2912/1986, To Sindagma, vol. 13, p. 366; Athens Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment no. 1241/1988).
Fines imposed by the Minister of Commerce on persons who contravene the rules concerning import and export trade are collected in accordance with the Code for the Collection of Public Revenues (Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment no. 2912/1986; Athens Administrative Court of Appeal judgment no. 1241/1988).

20.  According to Articles 7 and 9 of the Code for the Collection of Public Revenues, a person who fails to pay a debt to the State, the existence of which has been certified by a competent administrative authority, may be subjected to seizure of his goods and deprivation of his liberty. The above-mentioned measures of coercion are ordered by the competent administrative authority. When the debtor is a legal person, Article 69 provides for the detention of its directors for a period of up to one year (Article 70).
Section 40 (2) of Law no. 1968/1991, published on 11 October 1991, allows for the reintroduction within four months from publication of actions which had not been examined by the Supreme Administrative Court or any other administrative court on the ground, inter alia, of lack of competence.
The applicant company applied to the Commission on 12 October 1991. It alleged a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention with regard to its right of access to a court. An additional complaint concerning the alleged unreasonable length of the proceedings in question was introduced on 16 January 1995.
On 24 October 1995 the Commission (First Chamber) declared the application (no. 18996/91) admissible only as to the latter complaint. In its report of 11 April 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the separate opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
In its memorial, the applicant company asked the Court to hold that its rights under Article 6 § 1 had been violated and to award it compensation in respect of damages and legal costs and expenses.
The Government, for their part, requested the Court to dismiss the application as inadmissible or as unfounded on the merits. Likewise, every claim for compensation under Article 50 of the Convention should be rejected.
