Similar to paragraph\u00a04 of Article 16 of the European Convention on Extradition, Article 62 of the Minsk Convention establishes an additional guarantee against an excessive duration of provisional arrest pending receipt of a request for extradition. It does not indicate that a person may be detained for forty days but rather requires that the person should be released upon expiry of the fortieth day if the request has not been received in the meantime. In\u00a0other words, even though under domestic law detention could be ordered for a period exceeding forty days (for instance, Article 108 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure provides for an initial two-month period of detention), Article 62 of the Minsk Convention requires the domestic authorities to release anyone who has been detained for more than forty days in the absence of a request for extradition.

As the Court has already found in a similar Russian case, although the detainee had the right to take part in these proceedings, make submissions to the court or plead for his or her release, there was nothing in the wording of Article\u00a0108 to indicate that these proceedings could be taken on the initiative of the detainee, the prosecutor's application for the custodial measure being the required element for institution of such proceedings (see Nasrulloyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0656/06, \u00a7\u00a088, 11\u00a0October 2007). In the instant case it transpires that the proceedings under Article 108 were instituted more than a month after the applicant's arrest and followed an application by a prosecutor. In these circumstances, the Court cannot find that Article 108 secured the applicant's right to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of her detention would be examined by a court.",

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must, for a violation to be found, go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.
