Shortly after they had seized power, the mujahideen proclaimed an amnesty for persons who had worked for the KhAD/WAD. He had returned to work, had been given other tasks and had worked for the mujahideen until 18 or 19 January 1996, when the Taliban seized power in Herat. Until that moment, Herat had been governed by a commander who, like the applicant, was of Tajik origin.

The new elements on which the first applicant based his fresh asylum request were his relationship with a woman in 1993 in Afghanistan out of which a child might have been born, his past work for the KhAD, and various documents, including a copy of a judgment handed down in October/November 1995 in which a Taliban Islamic Court in Herat - in proceedings held in absentia \u2013 had convicted the first applicant and seven others of conspiracy against the Taliban and sentenced them to death.

The first applicant did not know how or when his mother had obtained the judgment, but he assumed that it had been put up around his neighbourhood at some point in time, as local custom prescribed. The first applicant had also been informed, in a letter from his mother, that his brother had been captured and tortured in order to locate him.

She noted that the KhAD/WAD was considered to be an elite unit of the communist regime, and that only those whose loyalty was beyond doubt were eligible for recruitment to the service. Furthermore, newly recruited officers were initially placed in departments of the KhAD/WAD specifically responsible for investigating \u201celements of State security\u201d, where \u2013 in order to prove their loyalty unequivocally \u2013 they were directly involved in the human rights violations. In the light of the above, and noting that KhAD\u2019s Directorate 5, for which the first applicant had worked in Herat, had two interrogation centres in Kabul, the first applicant\u2019s plea that he had never been involved in any human rights violations and had worked his whole career for one department only was dismissed. The Deputy Minister dismissed the first applicant\u2019s claim that he had only performed tasks of an administrative nature. The Deputy Minister found, on the basis of the first applicant\u2019s statements, that he had actually been involved in activities of an operational nature: persuading enemies of the regime to cooperate by accompanying his superiors on field missions and taking minutes of meetings that had taken place between the KhAD and those enemies, namely the mujahideen. The Deputy Minister did not attach credence to the first applicant\u2019s claim that he had been ignorant of the human rights violations committed by the KhAD/WAD. In this regard it was held that the first applicant had worked directly for the commanders in chief of his Directorate and had accompanied them on field missions. It was therefore highly implausible that he would have had no knowledge whatsoever of the human rights violations for which the KhAD/WAD was responsible. The Deputy Minister held that it should be concluded from the first applicant\u2019s functions and work effected for the KhAD/WAD that he had been specifically implicated in the human rights violations committed by the KhAD/WAD.",

Accordingly, Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention was held against the first applicant, and as a consequence his application for a residence permit for asylum purposes was denied.",

Basing himself on the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines (Vreemdelingencirculaire), the Minister held that, according to a letter of the Deputy Minister of Justice of 3 April 2000, knowing participation was in principle to be assumed in cases of persons who had worked for certain categories of organisations, to which the KhAD/WAD belonged. Having regard to the official report of 29 February 2000 (see paragraph 17 above) and other international materials, the Minister considered that the systematic and large-scale commission of human rights violations by KhAD/WAD under the PDPA\u2019s rule was a fact of common knowledge and that therefore the first applicant could not have been ignorant of those acts. The first applicant\u2019s argument that, given his low rank, he had had no knowledge of and could not be held responsible for human rights violations attributed to the KhAD/WAD, was thus not accepted by the Minister, who emphasised that the first applicant had declared that everyone had feared the regime and that he had successfully found an administrative post during his mandatory military service. The Minister found that, by admitting to the ubiquitous fear of the regime, the first applicant had admitted to having known of atrocities committed by that regime. As regards the first applicant\u2019s personal participation in human rights violations attributed to KhAD, the Minister found that he had failed to establish that he had not committed the alleged crimes himself or that his conduct, by act or omission, had prevented those crimes from being committed.

However, as regards Article 3 of the Convention and with reference to case-law of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State, it held that the Minister should, wherever possible, avoid creating a situation in which an asylum seeker was refused a residence permit but could not be expelled to his or her country of origin for reasons based on Article 3 of the Convention. For that reason, the decision should demonstrate that the Minister had examined whether Article 3 of the Convention would lastingly (duurzaam) stand in the way of expulsion to the country of origin and of the possible consequences for the residence situation of the person concerned. This, the Regional Court found, the Minister had failed to do in the present case, for which reason it quashed all decisions appealed against as regards both the first and second applicants, and remitted the case to the Minister in order for her to take a fresh decision.",

To determine the level of risk, the official report enumerated a set of factors which would need to be balanced in each individual case: the extent to which the person in question was likely to be identified with communist ideology, his or her rank in the former regime, and the existence of any ties which family members might have with the former communist regime. The Minister noted that mere membership of the PDPA did not suffice to establish a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",

As to the first applicant\u2019s fear of execution of the death sentence pronounced against him by the Taliban, the Minister held, basing herself on the most recent official report of the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that the population register, which had already been inaccurate, had not improved during Taliban rule due to illiteracy or a lack of interest in maintaining it. Furthermore, many courts of law had been destroyed during armed conflict. It was, therefore, not likely that the present authorities would be aware of the judgment against the first applicant. Moreover, judgments delivered under the Taliban rule were not executed without prior verification by a court of law of their compliance with current Afghan law. In this light the Minister did not attach much credence to the first applicant\u2019s submissions that his mother had not been allowed to collect her possessions in Afghanistan due to her son\u2019s conviction by the Taliban court. In addition, the Minister considered that it was unlikely that the first applicant would again be sentenced to death by Afghanistan\u2019s present courts, in view of the fact that the conviction had been based on an alleged conspiracy against the Taliban. The first applicant\u2019s submission that his being branded an infidel in the judgment could still have value before today\u2019s Afghan courts was dismissed by the Minister, who found that, under the Taliban regime, the mere denunciation of the Taliban government in itself already constituted infidel status.",

Since the United Kingdom had not recognised the Taliban as Afghanistan\u2019s lawful government, the Afghan embassy in the United Kingdom still represented the Government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who had been president from 1992 to 1996, thus until the capitulation of Kabul to the Taliban. The Minister took note of the fact that Mr Rabbani\u2019s political party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, was currently well represented in the present Afghan Government. As the first applicant had successfully applied for a passport from an embassy represented by that party, the Minister held that he could not have come to Jamiat-e-Islami\u2019s negative attention. Moreover, the passport had been issued more than three years after the death sentence had been handed down. In addition, as it did not appear that the first applicant had converted to another religion or had in other ways offended Islam, the Minister did not find it likely that he would be deemed an infidel again in today\u2019s Afghanistan.",

The mere fact that he was associated with the former communist regime by the Afghan public corroborated the existence of this risk. He further emphasised that the authenticity of the judgment in which he had been sentenced to death had not been disputed in the domestic proceedings and thus should be accepted as authentic in the present proceedings before the Court. He further pointed out that the Taliban were still, if not increasingly, exercising considerable influence in Afghanistan, notably also in the area of Herat from where he originated. Consequently, the continuing presence and activities of the Taliban in the Herat region were conducive to him running a real risk of being treated by the Taliban in violation of Article 3 and this also diluted the idea that a death sentence needed to be endorsed by the President before it could be executed. Moreover, according to the first applicant, death sentences imposed under Sharia law did not require Presidential approval before being executed and, in areas controlled by the Taliban, extra-judiciary sentences by stoning had been carried out in 2011 and 2012.",

Furthermore, in February 1999, the Afghan Embassy in London had issued the first applicant with a passport. While the Taliban had at that time been in power in Afghanistan, the embassy had continued to be staffed by representatives of the former mujahideen government of Burhanuddin Rabbani. If the first applicant had attracted the adverse attention of the mujahideen at the time, they would not have issued him a passport. As Mr Rabbani\u2019s party, Jamiat-e-Islami, was well represented in the current Afghan government, the issuing to the first applicant of a passport indicated that he was not an object of suspicion in the eyes of the current central authorities of Afghanistan.

On this point, they referred, inter alia, to the Court\u2019s findings in the cases of N. v. Sweden (no. 23505/09, \u00a7 52, 20 July 2010); Husseini v. Sweden, (no. 10611/09, \u00a7 84, 13 October 2011); J.H. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (cited above, \u00a7 55); S.H.H. v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a060367/10, 29 January 2013); and H. and B. v. the United Kingdom (nos.\u00a070073/10 and 44539/11, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93, 9 April 2013). Further pointing out that both the International Organisation for Migration and the UNHCR were assisting Afghans who wished to return voluntarily to Afghanistan, the Government considered that the general security situation in Afghanistan was not such that for this reason the first applicant\u2019s removal to Afghanistan should be regarded as contravening Article 3.",
