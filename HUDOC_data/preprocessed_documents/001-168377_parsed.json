It noted that the first applicant had not applied for family reunification immediately after his arrival in Switzerland, that the second applicant was cared for by his mother and his grandmother in Egypt until he turned 18\u00a0years, that the second applicant had lived almost all of his life in Egypt and had more important social and personal ties to his country of origin, which would be negatively affected if he moved to Switzerland, and that he had returned to Egypt after having stayed with his father in Switzerland for one and a half years. It observed that the first applicant had, thus, at that time, preferred that the second applicant lived with his mother and that the second applicant would face even more severe challenges to integration now than he had during his first stay in Switzerland, given his age. While noting that the first applicant had a close relationship to his daughter in Switzerland and that he could, thus, not be expected to relocate to Egypt to live there with the second applicant, the court noted that the applicants had not submitted sufficient reasons to justify the second applicant\u2019s reunion with his father in Switzerland.",

The assessment must take particular account of the personal situation of the child, such as family and social ties to and care available in the country origin, his or her chances to integrate in Switzerland in light of his or her age, level of education and language skills, the duration of the separation from his or her parent living in Switzerland, that parent\u2019s personal situation and the intensity of the ties between the child and that parent (ibid.). Where alternative care arrangements in the country of origin existed that corresponded better to the best interests of the child, because the child would not be taken out of his or her familiar environment and network of relationships, reunification with the parent living in Switzerland would, as a rule, not be granted (Federal Supreme Court, no. 2C_8/2008, judgment of 14\u00a0May 2008).",

In such cases, it must determine whether, in refusing to issue residence permits for the applicants, the Government can be said to have struck a fair balance between their interest in developing a family life in the respondent State on the one hand and the State\u2019s own interest in controlling immigration on the other. In conducting this assessment, the Court has first asked whether the parents irrevocably decided to leave their children in the country of origin, and thereby abandoned any idea of a future family reunion (see, for example, \u015een, cited above, \u00a7 40). Secondly, it has asked whether allowing the children to enter the Contracting State would be the most adequate means for them to develop their family life with the parents settled in that State. In answering this question, it has had regard to the existence of any \u201cinsurmountable obstacles\u201d or \u201cmajor impediments\u201d to the parents\u2019 return to the country of origin (see Tuquabo-Tekle and Others, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 135, ECHR 2010; M.P.E.V. and Others v. Switzerland, no. 3910/13, \u00a7 52, 8 July 2014; see also Tarakhel\u00a0v. Switzerland [GC], no. 29217/12, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). For that purpose, in cases regarding family reunification the Court pays particular attention to the circumstances of the minor children concerned, especially their age, their situation in their country of origin and the extent to which they are dependent on their parents (see Tuquabo-Tekle and Others, cited above, \u00a7 44). While the best interests of the child cannot be a \u201ctrump card\u201d which requires the admission of all children who would be better off living in a Contracting State (I.A.A. and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046; see also Berisha, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61), the domestic courts must place the best interests of the child at the heart of their considerations and attach crucial weight to it (see, mutatis mutandis, Mandet v. France, no. 30955/12, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 14 January 2016).",

To that end they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, which remains subject, however, to European supervision whereby the Court reviews under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of that power (ibid., with further references; X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2013). In line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the competent authorities in determining the best interests of the child, but to ascertain whether the domestic courts secured the guarantees set forth in Article 8 of the Convention, particularly taking into account the child\u2019s best interests, which must be sufficiently reflected in the reasoning of the domestic courts (Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 133, 141; B.\u00a0v. Belgium, no. 4320/11, \u00a7 60, 10 July 2012; X. v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-107). Domestic courts must put forward specific reasons in light of the circumstances of the case, not least to enable the Court to carry out the European supervision entrusted to it (X. v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7 107). Where the reasoning of domestic decisions is insufficient, with any real balancing of the interests in issue being absent, this would be contrary to the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention (ibid.; see also, mutatis mutandis, Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft SRG\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 34124/06, \u00a7 65, 21 June 2012). In such a scenario, the domestic courts, in the Court\u2019s opinion, failed to demonstrate convincingly that the respective interference with a right under the Convention was proportionate to the aim pursued and thus met a \u201cpressing social need\u201d (Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft SRG, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

The Court observes, however, that the first applicant did not lodge a request for family reunification as soon as he got a residence permit in Switzerland after his marriage with a Swiss national in\u00a01999, but brought the second applicant to Switzerland only in 2002 for three months on a tourist visa. In July 2003 the second applicant relocated to Switzerland for purposes of family reunification. However, in January 2005 the first applicant sent him back to Egypt in light of conflicts between the second applicant and the first applicant\u2019s spouse. Following the couple\u2019s separation, the first applicant lodged another request for family reunification in March 2006.

While this legal status suggests that it would be in the best interests of the second applicant to live with his father in Switzerland, it cannot be the sole decisive factor. The Court considers that the second applicant\u2019s had lived almost all his life in Egypt and had strong social, cultural and linguistic ties to his country of origin. In Egypt he was cared for by his mother and later, after his mother\u2019s relocation to Kuwait, by his grandmother. The Court also notes that the second applicant was fifteen and a half years old at the time the request for family reunification was lodged and that he was not as much in need of care as young children. The Court previously rejected cases involving failed applications for family reunion where the children concerned had reached an age where they were increasingly able to fend for themselves (see\u00a0I.A.A.\u00a0and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 46; Berisha, cited above, \u00a7 56; Benamar, cited above; Chandra and Others, cited above). The Court notes that there were no major threats to the second applicant\u2019s best interests in his country of origin, unlike in the case of Tuquabo-Tekle and Others, where the grandmother who cared for the fifteen year old girl in Eritrea took her out of school against the mother\u2019s will and the girl was at risk of being married off (Tuquabo-Tekle and Others, cited above, \u00a7 50).",

It further notes that the applicants in the case of \u015een\u00a0(cited above, \u00a7 44) had not claimed non-pecuniary damage. It considers that the applicants in the present case must have suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violation that has been found, which is not sufficiently compensated for by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41, the Court awards the applicants together EUR 8,000.",

Regard should have been had during the balancing test to whether the interference imposed would prevent the second applicant from retaining or establishing relations with her half-sister.
