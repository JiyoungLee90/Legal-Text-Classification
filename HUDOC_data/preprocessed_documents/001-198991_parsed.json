The litigants\u2019 standpoint is important but not decisive; what is decisive is whether any fears in that respect can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef v.

Such rules manifest the national legislature\u2019s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes of such concerns. In addition to ensuring the absence of actual bias, they are directed at removing any appearance of partiality and so serve to promote the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see\u00a0Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 99, and Me\u017enari\u0107 v.

In Piersack (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31) the fact that a judge had presided over a criminal trial after having been the head of the public prosecutor\u2019s office in charge of the prosecution in the same case was capable of casting doubt on the tribunal\u2019s impartiality, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In Wettstein v. Switzerland (no.\u00a033958/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2000-XII) there was an overlap of time between the two sets of proceedings in which one person had exercised both the function of a judge in one case, and that of the legal representative of the party opposing the applicant in the other. As a result, in that case the applicant had reason to be concerned that the judge in question would continue to see him as the opposing party. The Court concluded that this situation could have raised legitimate fears in the applicant that the judge would not approach the case with the requisite impartiality. Lastly, in Me\u017enari\u0107 (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28-37), the judge played the dual roles of a judge at third instance and a lawyer for the applicant\u2019s opponents at an early stage of a single set of proceedings, a fact which was also reinforced by the involvement of the judge\u2019s daughter as the lawyer for the applicant\u2019s opponents during the proceedings. These elements were sufficient for the Court to conclude that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in that case.",

His appeal was dismissed by the bench of the Ni\u0161 District Court at second-instance. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s fear of a lack of impartiality in the instant case stemmed from the fact that Judge B.K. held the position of deputy municipal public prosecutor in the Aleksinac Municipal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the time of the applicant\u2019s indictment for the offence in question by that same office, and later took part in the second-instance criminal proceedings against the applicant as the judge rapporteur (see paragraph 9 above).",

The Supreme Court upheld the reasoning of the lower court and dismissed the appeal concerning impartiality, finding that Judge B.K. had not taken part in the investigation or the applicant\u2019s indictment as a deputy prosecutor and had therefore not needed to be removed from the bench simply because he had held that prosecutor role in Aleksinac during the first-instance proceedings (see paragraph 11 above).",

As regards the judge B.K.\u2019s earlier position, the Court considers that in the present case Judge BK. did not in fact play a dual role in the single set of proceedings which forms the object of the present application. The information provided by the Government (see paragraph 30 above) confirms that Judge B.K. had not been actively or formally involved in the preparatory stages of the criminal proceedings or in the drafting of the indictment by the prosecutor\u2019s office. In contrast with Piersack (cited above), which concerned a judge who had previously performed the duties of senior deputy to the public prosecutor and had had the power to supervise the activities of the deputy prosecutors, in the present case Judge B.K. had in no way been hierarchically superior to the deputy prosecutors acting in the applicant\u2019s case, nor had he given them any instruction on how to act. He had neither authority to review or correct submissions of other deputies nor authority to affect the activities of the deputies acting in the applicant\u2019s case in any way. The Court concurs with the Government and recalls its finding in the Piersack case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a030(b); see also Jerino\u2019 v. Italy (dec.), no. 27549/02, 2 September 2004):",

So radical a solution, based on an inflexible and formalistic conception of the unity and indivisibility of the public prosecutor\u2019s department, would erect a virtually impenetrable barrier between that department and the bench. It would lead to an upheaval in the judicial system of several Contracting States where transfers from one of those offices to the other are a frequent occurrence. Above all, the mere fact that a judge was once a member of the public prosecutor\u2019s department is not a reason for fearing that he lacks impartiality\u201d.",
