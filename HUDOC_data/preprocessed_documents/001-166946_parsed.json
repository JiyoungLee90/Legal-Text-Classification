The applicant also asked D. to guarantee that he would persuade the trial court to order three new measures in order to obtain evidence. According to the applicant, the following measures would prove his innocence in relation to the murder charge: searches of other unspecified witnesses, polygraph testing, and another psychiatric examination. The applicant stated that if D. did not wish to defend him, then he had the opportunity to withdraw from the case, which would provide a satisfying solution for them both. However, if D. acted in the same way as his previous defence lawyer, the applicant would ask the trial court to discharge D. from his duties.",

Referring to the reasoning of the first-instance court, the Regional Court agreed that his refusal to accept the services of the two lawyers had been unjustified. Having examined the content of the applicant\u2019s submissions, applications and complaints in the criminal proceedings, it did not find that any of the conditions of section\u00a083 of the Criminal Procedure Law had been fulfilled. The appellate court concluded that the applicant had been able to defend himself. The first-instance court had called the witnesses twice, however the applicant had refused to put any questions to them, citing unfounded excuses.",

Nevertheless, the interests of justice are to be judged with reference to the facts of a case as a whole, having regard, inter alia, to the seriousness of the offence, the severity of the possible sentence, the complexity of the case, and the personal situation of an applicant (see Quaranta v. Switzerland, 24\u00a0May\u00a01991, \u00a7\u00a7 32-36, Series A no. 205; see also Zdravko Stanev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).",
