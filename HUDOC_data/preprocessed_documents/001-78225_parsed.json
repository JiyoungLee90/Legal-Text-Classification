The complexity of the case was, in their view, corroborated by a number of elements: the three expert opinions obtained during the proceedings; the bank's counter claim; the fact that the applicant had twice clarified its claim and the suspension of the proceedings pending the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings. Concerning the applicant's conduct, the Government maintained that it had failed to request the court to speed up the proceedings, despite its earlier requests which had proved effective. They argued that it had contributed to the length of the proceedings by failing to attend two hearings in a row which caused the suspension of the proceedings for about five months and a half; by failing to clarify its claim and by not paying in advance the expert's costs. Moreover, it had the applicant taken over eight months to request the court to resume the proceedings after they had been stayed because of the insolvency proceedings. The Government also noted that the bank's behaviour had contributed to the length of the proceedings, e.g. its failure to attend seven hearings; its failure to comply with the court's instructions in time and to pay the expert's costs for over a year. As regards the conduct of the national authorities, the Government submitted that the proceedings should be considered as including differing enforcement and civil procedures. They averred that the courts had held the hearings without any interruption or delays, except for the one-year's inactivity before the proceedings resumed in March 1997. They stated that the delays in obtaining the expert opinions had been attributable to the parties to the proceedings. The strike of the court's administrative staff had delayed the proceedings for four months, a period which had not added much to the length of the proceedings. They argued that the lapse of eight months in 1999 to transmit the case-file to the expert institution had been due to the applicant's late submission of the additional comments to the previous expert opinion. The Government submitted that although it took over two years and a half for the court to fix a hearing in the proceedings against the State, it had been the applicant who caused that delay, as it had not requested the court to speed up the proceedings and it had lost interest in pursuing the case against the State.",

It stated that duration of eight years after the ratification of the Convention had been sufficient to find a violation of the reasonable-time requirement. It maintained that by 10 April 1997, the case had been ready for adjudication, as two expert opinions had been already obtained in its favour. It claimed that the courts had unnecessarily upheld the bank's request for a third expertise and that, although the expert's costs were the responsibility of the bank, it had paid them to avoid any further delays. It contested the Government's argument that the case had been complex and that it had contributed to the length of the proceedings. Its failure to attend some hearings did not cause much delay. It submitted that it had not lost interest in pursuing the case against the State, but that there had been no reasonable alternative as the latter had declined to take over the proceedings as a defendant. In conclusion, the applicant maintained that the unreasonable length of the proceedings had been wholly attributable to the State which should be found responsible and ordered to pay the amount owed by the bank.",

The Court further observes that the applicant endeavoured to speed up the proceedings by paying the expert's costs, although this had been the bank's responsibility (see paragraph 27) and by requesting the court to hold a hearing at its earliest convenience (see paragraph 34). It could not be held responsible for any failure to request the court more often to speed up the proceedings as such submissions could not be considered as an effective remedy concerning the length of proceedings (see Atanasovic, cited above, \u00a7 31).",

The concept of \u201cpossessions\u201d is not limited to \u201cexisting possessions\u201d but may also cover assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he has at least a reasonable and \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.
