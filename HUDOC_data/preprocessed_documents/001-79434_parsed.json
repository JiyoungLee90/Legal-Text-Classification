Such rights are implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c) and (e) of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (see, among other authorities, Stanford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23\u00a0February\u00a01994, Series\u00a0A no. 282-A, pp. 10\u201311, \u00a7 26).",

Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (Kamasinski v.

That information should be detailed (P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 51, ECHR 1999-II; Dallos v.
