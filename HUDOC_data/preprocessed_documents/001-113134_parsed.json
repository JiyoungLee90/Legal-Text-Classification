Finally, the Court notes that this conclusion makes it unnecessary to ascertain whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community, on the one hand, and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights on the other (see Iatridis\u00a0v.

However, the nature of those common premises is such that some of their parts were equally used by all the tenants, while some others have been used by only some or none of them. As it transpires from the decision of 14 July 1999 (see paragraph  26 above) allocation of the common areas to the tenants concerned was done in relation to small and limited parts of the common premises, apparently without prejudice or disturbance to other tenants, including the applicant herself \u2013 indeed, the allocation of some of these surfaces appeared to have been aimed at securing more privacy for certain tenants (i.e. niches adjacent to certain tenants\u2019 bathrooms), while some others would appear to have no longer been used for their original purpose (garbage shaft). Furthermore, the right of use was made strictly personal, not allowing the tenants concerned to transfer this right in case of transfer of possession over their respective flats. Finally, the applicant has never claimed that the apparent restriction in the use of these particular areas has ever been to her disadvantage or discomfort, nor has she sought to demonstrate that the enjoyment of her property rights over her own flat, or the common premises which she actually used, has in any way been impaired by the fact that a portion of the common premises has been occupied by any particular tenant.",

Moldova (dec) \u00a7 19, 24\u00a0May 2011).
