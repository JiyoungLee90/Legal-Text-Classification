On the other hand, where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused. The principle that hearings should be held in public entails the right for the accused to give evidence in person to an appellate court (see Forcellini v.
