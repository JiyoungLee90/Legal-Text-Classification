Consequently, the detainees, including the applicant, had to share the sleeping facilities, taking turns to rest, and had to stand around in the cell for the rest of the time. The overcrowding also meant that the only wash basin and the only toilet in the cell were used by at least twice as many inmates as they were intended for. Accordingly, access to them was quite limited and maintaining hygiene in the cells was scarcely possible. It also appears that, when it came to using the communal showering facilities, no allowance was made for the excessive number of detainees or for the broken equipment; this further contributed to the poor standard of hygiene. Likewise, no arrangements were made to provide the cells with additional furniture for the increased number of detainees, which meant that inmates did not have sufficient space for taking their meals, reading or writing.",

Furthermore, the Court takes note of the medical certificates submitted by the Government which disclose that the applicant was diagnosed with what appeared to be pneumonia within three days of his placement in SIZO 32/1. About three weeks later advanced symptoms of tuberculosis were discovered during the CT scan. It follows that the disease began to manifest itself in the early part of the applicant's detention, making it more than likely that he had already been infected at the time of arrest.
