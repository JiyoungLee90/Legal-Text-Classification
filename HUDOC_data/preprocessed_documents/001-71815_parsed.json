The Court of Cassation quashed this judgment on points of law in that the first-instance court had delivered its judgment without having respect for the rights of defence concerning some of the co-accused of the applicants, and that the copies of the family registry documents of some of the accused, including the fourth applicant, were without the necessary stamps and signatures.

The Court observes that as far as the criminal proceedings against the applicants were concerned, after the remission of the case, the only procedural requirement which the trial court should have complied with was to obtain a stamped and signed copy of the fourth applicant\u2019s family registry document.
