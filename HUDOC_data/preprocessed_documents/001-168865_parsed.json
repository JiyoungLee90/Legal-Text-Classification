Furthermore, having examined the circumstances in which the applicants had been arrested and convicted, the Court concluded that the administrative proceedings against them had equally sought to deter them from protesting and to punish them for doing so (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 92-97). Consequently, the Court concluded that the applicants\u2019 arrests and administrative detention had amounted to arbitrary and unlawful interference with their right to freedom of assembly (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 98-101).",

There are many international reports alleging that in 2014 (the year in which the applicants in the present cases were arrested and convicted) the authorities continued to resort to various arbitrary measures against those expressing critical opinions (see paragraphs 32-36 above). For example, the PACE in its Resolution of 23 June 2015 stated that \u201cdubiously motivated criminal prosecutions and disproportionate sentences remain[ed] a concern\u201d and called on the authorities in Azerbaijan \u201cto end the systemic harassment of those who [were] critical of the government and to release those wrongfully detained\u201d (see paragraph 33 above).",

Secondly, all of the applicants were arrested within a short time frame (see paragraph 9 above) on dubious grounds and in similar circumstances (see paragraph 10 above). Thus, the first applicant was accused of \u201cswearing aloud\u201d at no one in particular and for no apparent reason. All the other applicants were suspected of either \u201csuspicious behaviour\u201d or some offence. However, none of those suspicions received any follow-up whatsoever and they were quickly forgotten once the applicants had been charged with disobeying police orders. No specific sources or reasons for those initial suspicions were ever indicated. Thirdly, the domestic courts failed to establish facts that were disputed between the parties \u2013 the police and the applicants \u2013 by carrying out an objective and thorough examination. They ignored the applicants\u2019 submissions that the arrests had been politically motivated, and merely recapitulated the circumstances and the charges as presented by the police (see paragraphs\u00a02021, 26-28 and 30 above).",

Azerbaijan, no. 60259/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-96, 15 October 2015; and Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and\u00a069335/11, \u00a7 93-115, 11 February 2016). As in that case, the applicants in the present cases were arrested and convicted following an accelerated procedure under the CAO. They were held in police custody without any contact with the outside world, presented with charges, without receiving a copy of the administrative offence reports, and shortly afterwards (in a matter of hours or in the case of the fourth applicant in two days) taken to a court and convicted. None of the applicants was given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing at the pre-trial stage or for the proceedings before the first-instance court. In the cases where the applicants did not refuse State-funded legal assistance, representation by the appointed lawyers was purely formalistic: they did not put forward any reasoning and limited themselves to simply orally asking the respective courts \u201cto discontinue the case\u201d or \u201cto consider the young age of the applicant\u201d (see Huseynli and Others, cited above, \u00a7 133). Neither the first-instance courts nor the Court of Appeal took note of the applicants\u2019 arguments that they had been arrested for their activities as members of the opposition. The courts failed to clarify the facts that were disputed between the parties: they merely accepted the police\u2019s versions of the facts and the charges as presented in the relevant police reports. In view of the similarities between the present cases and Huseynli and Others, the Court sees no particular circumstances that could compel it to deviate from its findings in that judgment, and finds that the administrative proceedings in the present cases, considered as a whole, were not in conformity with the guarantees of a fair hearing.",
