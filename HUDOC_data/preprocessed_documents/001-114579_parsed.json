The applicant drew the Supreme Court\u2019s attention to its ruling of 7\u00a0December 2005 (see paragraph 29 below), arguing that the lower courts should have taken the above factors into account. She also argued that the lower courts had wrongly established that M.B. had caused the car accident merely by not being careful. In the applicant\u2019s view, M.B. had been openly reckless: he had had no driving licence and had been speeding. She did not argue that M.B. had been driving drunk.

In this case, M.B. had not questioned his liability, the dispute thus concerning only the sum to be awarded in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The Supreme Court also observed that the applicant\u2019s grandson had died not because of M.B.\u2019s premeditated actions, but because of his being reckless when driving and violating traffic rules. The lower courts had taken all the circumstances into account when assessing the amount of compensation. It was also noteworthy that the award of LTL 3,000 was close to the initial sum that the applicant had asked for in bringing the claim on 5 April 2005. Only later had she raised that claim by LTL 5,000 (paragraph 14 above).

This right of a court, as opposed to an obligation upon it, is to be exercised in compliance with the other principles of civil proceedings, such as the principle that the parties control the litigation (principle of disposition), and after having assessed the particular circumstances of each case. Above all, the applicant herself had not made any submissions to the civil court of first instance about her inability to submit certain evidence or inability to represent herself effectively, in which case the court could have examined such submissions and possibly advised the applicant to seek legal representation.

In the instant case, the applicant had claimed damages for the wrongful death of her grandson. The Court also gives some weight to the Government\u2019s argument that, unlike in Steel and Morris (cited above, \u00a7\u00a063), the applicant in the instant case was the claimant, and not a defendant. In other words, it was the applicant who chose to commence the proceedings for damages.",

Given that M.B.\u2019s liability for dangerous driving had already been proved in the criminal proceedings, the civil proceedings initiated by the applicant required her to prove that her grandson\u2019s death had caused her suffering and enable the domestic courts to quantify it. As is evident from the materials submitted by the Government, there was, at that time, domestic legislation and case-law concerning damages for wrongful death (paragraphs 35-37 above). Neither can the Court hold that the civil proceedings were of significant scale, given that only three hearings were held and the entire judicial process took a little over one year (paragraphs\u00a010 and 24 above; see, by contrast, Steel and Morris, \u00a7 65).",

Furthermore, on the issue of the applicant\u2019s inability to speak Lithuanian, the Court, bearing in mind that the Convention does not provide for a right to have court proceedings conducted in a language of one\u2019s choice, observes that the applicant, being a Russian speaker, at all four court hearings, including the criminal proceedings in respect of M.B., had an interpreter (paragraphs 9, 13, 15 and 20 above).

It is not for the Court to state with certainty whether this was a fee for the civil claim she had submitted a day earlier, although the Government appear to suggest so. That being so, the Court, along with the Government, notes that the applicant\u2019s appeal lodged with the Vilnius Regional Court did indeed contain legal language making specific references to the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure. Lastly, the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law was drafted by a lawyer (paragraphs 10 and 18 above).",

The applicant made at least three requests that the calculation of her expenses be included in the case file; each of them was granted. She did not make any further requests (paragraphs 13, 15 and 20 above).",

On the contrary, the applicant\u2019s civil claim was based on her own personal circumstances, which the applicant was in the best position to present and substantiate most effectively. As regards pecuniary damage, the applicant was faced with the burden of having to submit invoices for M.B.\u2019s burial costs. Similarly, her claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage was based on loss and suffering she had to describe. The Court believes that the applicant should have understood what was expected from her in terms of those two issues. It is also noteworthy that neither before the domestic courts, nor before this Court, did the applicant argue that some specific evidence was not made available to her or that the domestic courts refused to assist her in obtaining it (see paragraph 28 above). Neither can the Court fail to observe that when arguing M.B.\u2019s case at the hearings of 14\u00a0June and 8\u00a0July 2005 at the \u0160al\u010dininkai District Court his lawyer merely admitted her client\u2019s liability, although in part, and did not, for example, cite any domestic case-law in an attempt to challenge that the applicant had been close to her grandson (paragraphs 13 and 15 above). On this last point, the Court notes that when determining the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage the emotional relationship between a victim and the deceased is a factor to be taken into account under Lithuanian law and jurisprudence (paragraphs 35-37 above). For the Court, it is also important that it was only the applicant who took part in the appellate court\u2019s hearing and presented her arguments at that hearing (paragraph 20 above).",

The Court does not consider that this argument, in itself, can be accepted. In addition, whilst noting that there have been occasions when the Lithuanian courts have awarded larger sums of money in compensation for wrongful death, the Court observes that in the instant case the applicant had claimed a sum that was not as high and the courts were bound by the principle of non ultra petita (see paragraph 27 above). Above all, the applicant was fairly consistent as regards the sum she claimed and the civil courts granted the major part of that claim. Thus, in her first civil claim of 20\u00a0June 2003 submitted in the course of the criminal proceedings, the applicant claimed LTL 12,311 and 5,000 in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, respectively. Two years later, on 5\u00a0April 2005, the applicant lodged a civil claim, asking the courts to award her LTL 11,260 and 3,740 in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, respectively, raising the amount sought under the latter head of claim by LTL 5,000 two months later. The civil courts granted her claim to the greater extent, given that they awarded her LTL 7,936 and 3,000 under those two heads. Accordingly, the Court cannot hold that the applicant faced any serious difficulties in proving her claim. Furthermore, it may not be held that in the instant case the Lithuanian civil courts awarded the applicant a sum which was plainly unreasonable. Provided that this is the case, it is not for the Court to speculate whether any particular sum would have been awarded to the applicant if she had been represented by a legal-aid lawyer in court.",
