The nanny would only come to take care of AG when the applicant left for a few days. AG expressed her wish to live in  with her father and sister IG. The Agency's workers also interviewed AG's kindergarten teachers. According to them, AG was often sad about not seeing her sister and father. AG would also be picked up from the kindergarten by some fifteen year old girl, but at the time of the interview she was going home on her own. The Agency's workers suggested to the applicant that she find another place to live where AG would feel safer.

The appellate court had regard to the expert's conclusion of 9\u00a0December 2003 that the environment in which the applicant lived was unsafe, whereas the applicant's husband was able to provide good living conditions for AG. The recommendation by the Kaunas District Child Rights Protection Agency to fix the place of residence of both daughters with the father was taken into account.

Certain instances of inadequate care were noted, namely, the applicant's failure on one occasion to arrange for AG's medical assistance or to ensure her attendance at school.

When determining the place of residence of the two children, whose parents live separately, the Court of Appeal gave priority to the interests of the children, took into account their wishes, the ability and efforts of each parent to guarantee the basic rights of the children, and each parent's living conditions, that is to say, those conditions in which the children would have to live once their place of residence was decided. The decision of the appellate court did not contain any indication that the resolution of the dispute was influenced by the fact that the applicant was a member of [Osho/Ojas] ... The appellate court only noted that the first-instance court had not assessed all the evidence regarding the meditation centre. However, that does not presuppose that the appellate court considered the applicant's membership of the centre important in the resolution of the dispute. Had that been so, such a consideration would require an assessment of whether the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion was observed. In its judgments in the cases of Hoffmann v. Austria and Palau-Martinez v. France, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion, enshrined in Articles 14 and 8 of the Convention, had not been respected in cases where the courts had attached decisive importance to the [applicant's] religious affiliation.

Overall, the Government argued that there had been no interference with the applicant's Article 8 rights as a result of the decision in question, given that the applicant retained her parental rights and duties in their entirety, and could freely participate in the education and upbringing of her daughters. If the Court found that an interference existed, the Government submitted that it would be justified under the second paragraph of that Convention provision. According to the information received from the social services, the children were living and studying at their father's home in much better conditions than in the apartment where their mother lived. The Government also stressed that the applicant's religious affiliation had in no way been a decisive factor capable of affecting the decision as to the daughters' place of residence. On the contrary, the Lithuanian courts made an explicit distinction between the applicant's situation and that in the case of Hoffmann v. Austria (23\u00a0June 1993, Series A no. 255C, p. 58). They affirmed that their verdict on the children's place of residence had only been reached with the girls' best interests in mind.",

AG had even alleged that the applicant had not taken proper care of her. The Court notes that the child protection experts had qualified the living conditions offered by the applicant to her daughter AG as \u201cunsafe\u201d, apparently because of the lack privacy, the fact that AG was often left alone and was scared, that the mother did not take proper care of her, etc. (paragraphs 12-13 above). The father, however, was able to provide more fitting living conditions. Finally, the Court takes into consideration the policy which was pursued in the present case not to separate siblings, especially as they have close emotional ties (paragraphs 22 and 27, point 6, above).",

It can be seen from the court decisions that their primary concern was the children's best interests, particular account being taken of the factors enumerated in paragraph 38 above. It is true that in a couple of paragraphs of the judgments the domestic courts did touch upon the applicant's religious affiliation. However, that text was an isolated reference and was unrelated to the applicant's ability to bring up her children.",

The Court shares the Supreme Court's view in the present case and notes that the applicant's suitability to have her daughters live with her was not assessed in abstracto (see, by converse implication, Palau-Martinez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43). Unlike in the Hoffmann judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a032), the domestic courts did not attribute any particular weight to the applicant's religious affiliation or hold it against her. In sum, nothing in the present case regarding the reasoning of the Lithuanian courts suggests that it might have been decided differently had it not been for the applicant's religion.",
