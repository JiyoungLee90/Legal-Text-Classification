However, as the investigation drew close to completion, criminal case no. 80308 was gradually split into several cases, eventually dividing the accused into fifteen separate groups. It appears that the only reason formally given by the prosecution for splitting up the case was the concern that the sheer number of defendants involved (more than 100) would prolong the proceedings and that it would be impractical to hold a single trial involving so many defendants (see Huseyn and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 35485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, \u00a7 28, 26\u00a0July 2011). Furthermore, it appears that no significant investigative steps were taken after the cases were split (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029 and 166). Each of the fifteen defendant groups thus created was tried separately. Fourteen of those trials concerned the events of 16 October 2003: they were all conducted by the  and were completed in March and April 2004 (one trial concerned the events of 15 October 2003, and this trial was conducted by the Sabail District Court).

The criminal case remained unified essentially for the whole of the investigation stage of the proceedings. The same main body of evidence, in essence, and other material collected by the prosecuting authorities, was used at the trial of each defendant. This single criminal case was eventually split into fifteen different groups only for the purposes of practical expediency of holding several smaller-scale trials instead of one large-scale trial involving a very large number of defendants (see paragraph 12 above). No other reason for splitting the case has been cited. All the defendants were still facing the same criminal charges relating to the same events and based on largely the same or similar incriminating evidence (almost all of which was collected while the case was still formally unified). All the trials involving all the applicants in the present case and the applicants in the Huseyn and Others case were conducted by the same firstinstance court, the Assize Court, and some of the judges forming the panel (and sometimes the entire panel of judges) were often the same in different \u201ctrial groups\u201d. It is apparent from the case materials that a small group of  judges was assigned to deal with these trials on some sort of rotation, so that each judge sat on the bench in more than one trial dealing with essentially the same or very similar factual and legal issues. It appears that a similar arrangement was followed in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, as in each of those courts a relatively small group of judges dealt with several appeals each. Accordingly, all the applicants faced the same charges, which were based on largely the same evidence, were convicted by the same court, and had their appeals examined by the same appeal courts, while judges sitting in those courts were often the same as in several other \u201ctrial groups\u201d.",

In order to comply with this rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The Court notes that the application of this rule must make due allowance for the context of the individual case, including, among other things, the personal circumstances of the applicant. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66 and 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV).",

Applicants Dashdamirli and Jafarli submitted that, despite the defence\u2019s calls for serious scrutiny of the evidence presented by the prosecution, they had been convicted on very weak and unreliable evidence, consisting of statements from two witnesses (a police officer and a soldier) who had identified him from a photograph as a violent demonstrator.

In particular, although there were hundreds of prosecution witnesses, most of whom testified about the demonstrators in general, each applicant\u2019s individual conviction was based mainly and decisively on statements from a very few prosecution witnesses (almost always police officers or military personnel). However, these statements were not subjected to sufficient scrutiny in the light of serious and substantiated objections by the defence concerning the reliability and probative value of this evidence and the manner in which it had been obtained (compare Huseyn and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 204-07). Moreover, the Court reiterates that defence rights under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention require an accused to be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either at the time the witness was making his statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see, among many other authorities, Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20 November 1989, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 166, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the  [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7\u00a7 118-19, ECHR 2011). However, in the present cases, there were recurring problems with the defence\u2019s right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution. In particular, a relatively large number of prosecution witnesses whose statements had been taken at the pre-trial stage did not attend the trials and, instead, their statements were read out at the hearings. This deprived the defendants of the opportunity to question those witnesses in person, either at the time those statements were made or during the trial. It has not been convincingly shown that there were good reasons for the non-attendance of those witnesses, that the courts made a reasonable effort to secure their attendance, or that there were sufficient counterbalancing factors permitting a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of those statements. While the applicant\u2019s convictions might not have been based solely and decisively on the statements of non-appearing witnesses, the above-mentioned shortcomings, coupled with a number of other defects in the proceedings, affected the effective exercise of defence rights in the present case.",

The Court of Appeal conducted very brief hearings in respect of the applicants\u2019 appeals and, despite having jurisdiction to review all aspects of a case on points of both fact and law, refused to conduct a new judicial examination of the available evidence and the parties\u2019 legal and factual arguments. Both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court merely reiterated the trial court\u2019s findings, and did not address recurring complaints by defendants concerning various defects in the trial, summarily rejecting those complaints as unsubstantiated without giving any reasoning (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0214). Moreover, despite the public prosecutor\u2019s presence at appeal hearings, it appears from the material in the case file that most of the applicants\u2019 presence at the Court of Appeal hearings was not ensured, while it cannot be established from the available documents that any of them had unequivocally waived their right to attend the appeal hearings as guaranteed by the domestic law (compare, mutatis mutandis, Nefedov v. Russia, no.\u00a040962/04, \u00a7\u00a7 42-47, 13 March 2012). It further appears that at least some of the applicants and their lawyers (for example, applicant Guliyev) were not informed of the subsequent Supreme Court hearings (compare Abbasov v. , no. 24271/05, \u00a7\u00a7 29 et seq., 17 January 2008). Furthermore, it appears that the appeals of applicants Aliyev and Huseynli were not examined by the Supreme Court at all. The letter of 3 September 2004 sent to applicant Aliyev by the Supreme Court did not constitute a formal judicial decision declaring the appeal inadmissible under the domestic law (compare, mutatis mutandis, Hajiyev v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a05548/03, \u00a7 36, 16\u00a0November 2006). It follows that the appeal was simply left unexamined. Similarly, although the Government claimed that applicant Huseynli had been summoned to a hearing to be held on 5 April 2005, they failed to inform the Court whether that hearing had actually taken place or to produce any copy of a Supreme Court decision on examination of the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no. 336, and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000VII). In particular, where an individual is in good health when taken into police custody but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11, Series A no. 241A, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V).",
