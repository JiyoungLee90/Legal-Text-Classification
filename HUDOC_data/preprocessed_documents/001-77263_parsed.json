Moreover, some pecuniary loss must have been occasioned on account of the period that elapsed from the time the judicial decisions had become enforceable until the Court's award (see Grinberg v. , no. 23472/03, \u00a7\u00a039, 21 July 2005). The applicants' assessment of that loss does not appear excessive or unreasonable. In any event, the Government did not suggest a different method of calculation of interest. Accordingly, the Court awards the first applicant EUR 450 and the second applicant EUR 1,250 in respect of the pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on those amounts.",

The first applicant also submitted a copy of the contract with Mrs R. for provision of legal consultations in the course of the  proceedings. The Government did not dispute the fact that Mrs R. had provided the first applicant with legal and translation services. The contracts between the first applicant and Mrs R. had not been declared null and void by any court. They were enforceable under the Russian law and bound the first applicant to pay the amounts indicated therein. The sums indicated in the contracts do not appear excessive or unreasonable. The first applicant also submitted documents supporting his claims in respect of postal and copying expenses.
