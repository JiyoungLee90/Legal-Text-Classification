Bulgaria (nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, 15 March 2007), which concerned a similar situation. They argued that their being deprived of their property had not been \u201clawful\u201d, as required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, because the addition of section\u00a010(13) to the Agricultural Act in 1997 had been unforeseeable and in breach of the rule of legal certainty and had interfered with fundamental legal principles such as the protection of good-faith buyers and the application of acquisitive prescription. Moreover, the applicants pointed out that the taking of their property to satisfy other parties\u2019 restitution claims could not be associated with the social and economic transition of Bulgaria following totalitarian rule and that their title to the disputed land had not been found to be in any way defective. Lastly, the applicants noted that they were not entitled to any compensation for the land taken from them, and that they could not claim back the price paid for it at the time of its purchase, because the seller (the local agricultural co-operative) no longer existed and because in any event the figure paid in 1968 had lost its real value over the years since.",

In the Velikovi group of cases (see for example the case of Tsonkovi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a027213/04, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27, 2 July 2009) it has already held that challenging property titles, sometimes decades-old, could in principle be seen as justified only when associated with the unique transitional period which started in Bulgaria in 1989. Moreover, under the provisions of the Agricultural Land Act, the possibility for former owners benefitting from positive restitution decisions to challenge the titles of persons who had bought the land after the collectivisation was definitely not subject to a time-limit, and the post-collectivisation owners could not rely on acquisitive prescription (see Tomov and Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 48). Lastly, it was significant that, unlike in the cases of the Velikovi group, in the case at hand it was not necessary for the persons claiming the restitution of the applicants\u2019 land to show that the latter\u2019s title was in any way defective; rather, it had been sufficient for them to rely on section 10(13) of the Agricultural Land Act, which quite simply wiped out the legal force of contracts of sale concluded many years earlier (ibid., \u00a7 49). On that basis the Court concluded in Tomov and Nikolova that the taking of the applicants\u2019 property had breached the principle of legal certainty and did not fall within the scope of legitimate aims such as restoring justice and the rule of law, which the restitution provisions of the Agricultural Land Act could have pursued in principle (ibid., \u00a7 51).",

However, the applicable legislation did not provide for compensation for persons in a situation such as that of the applicants. In addition, as pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 21 above in fine), they could not seek the repayment of the price paid for the land in 1968, because the seller at the time, the agricultural co-operative, apparently no longer existed, and in any event they could have only obtained a token amount, given the domestic courts\u2019 practice of refusing to re-evaluate monetary claims (see, on the latter point, Tomov and Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 24, with further references).",

Greece (Article 50), 31\u00a0October 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 36-39, Series A no. 330B, and Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7\u00a7 21-24, ECHR 2001I). This should also be the approach in the present case, in view of the Court\u2019s finding above that the taking of the applicants\u2019 property was in breach of the principle of legal certainty and in view of its approach in earlier similar cases (see Tomov and Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 60, and the just satisfaction judgment in the cases examined in Velikovi and Others, in which the Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 \u2013 Todorova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria (just satisfaction), nos. 48380/99, 51362/99, 60036/00 and 73465/01, \u00a7 11, 24 April 2008). As it is impossible to order the return of the land to the applicants because it has passed to private parties, the Court is to make a monetary award reasonably related to its current market value. The Court notes in this respect the lack of clarity as to the potential use of the property and the rather general character of the information, particularly that provided by the Government, on the basis of which it has to establish its market value. Taking into account the information provided, the Court awards the applicants EUR 80,000 under the present head.",
