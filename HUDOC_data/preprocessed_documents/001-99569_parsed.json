In that case, the Court found that the applicant had had a real possibility of satisfying the requirements for the use of acceleratory remedies, having regard to the fact that the 2006 Act had been published in the Official Gazette on 12\u00a0May\u00a02006 and that the impugned domestic proceedings were finally resolved on 9\u00a0May\u00a02007.
