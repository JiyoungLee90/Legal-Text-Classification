The case originated in seven applications (nos. 14594/07, 14597/07, 14976/07, 14978/07, 15221/07, 16369/07 and 16706/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 19 Georgian nationals (“the applicants”), whose names, dates of birth and places of residence are shown on the list appended to this judgment. The applications were lodged on 2 April 2007, 30 March 2007, 5 April 2007, 4 April 2007, 5 April 2007, 6 April 2007 and 10 April 2007 respectively.
The applicants were represented by several lawyers, whose names are shown on the list appended to this judgment. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants alleged that they had been arrested, detained and collectively expelled as part of an administrative practice that was in place in autumn 2006 in the Russian Federation directed against Georgian nationals. According to the applicants these acts resulted in violations of Articles 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Articles 2 and 4 of Protocol No. 4 and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7.
The applications were allocated to the former Fifth Section of the Court. On 9 February 2010 a Chamber of the former Fifth Section decided to communicate the applications to the Government for information and to adjourn their examination pending the outcome of the proceedings in the inter-State case Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC] (no. 13255/07).
On 5 February 2014 the President of the Court decided to allocate the applications to the former First Section, which, on 27 January 2015, decided to invite the Government to submit observations on the admissibility and merits of the applications and to produce the relevant documents. Subsequently the applications were allocated to the Third Section.
The Government and the applicants each submitted observations on the admissibility and merits of the cases. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of the Republic of Georgia (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
During the period from the end of September 2006 to the end of January 2007 identity checks of Georgian nationals residing in Russia were carried out in the streets, markets and other workplaces and at their homes. Many were subsequently arrested and taken to police stations. After a period of custody in police stations, they were grouped together and taken by bus to a court, which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from Russian territory. Subsequently, after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test, they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time, and then taken by bus to various airports in Moscow, and expelled to Georgia by aeroplane. Some of the Georgian nationals against whom expulsion orders were issued left the territory of the Russian Federation by their own means (for further details as to the background of the case see Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC], no. 13255/07, § 45, ECHR 2014).
The applicant entered the territory of the Russian Federation on 1 June 2006 on a multiple entry business visa, valid until 27 May 2007. On 4 October 2006 immigration officers stopped the applicant on the street, checked his identity documents and brought him to the Department of the Interior in the Vykhino District of Moscow, where he was detained. On 5 October 2006 the Kuzminskiy District Court of Moscow fined the applicant (RUB 1,000) for failure to observe the applicable registration procedure and ordered his administrative expulsion from the Russian Federation. He was subsequently, around midday, released. On 8 October 2006 the applicant left the Russian Federation by his own means.
The applicant entered the territory of the Russian Federation on 12 August 2006 on a multiple entry business visa. Subsequently he registered at his place of residence with the competent authority and worked as a driver in Moscow. On 1 October 2006 the applicant was detained in the Cheremushkinskiy militia department. On 3 October 2006 the Cheremushkinskiy District Court of Moscow found the applicant liable under Article 18.10 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences, as he had not applied for a work permit. The court fined the applicant (RUB 1,000) and ordered his administrative expulsion from the Russian Federation. He was subsequently transferred to the Kankova militia department, where he was detained until the next day. On 4 October 2006 he was transferred to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no.1, where he stayed until his deportation. On 6 October 2006 the applicant was taken to a military airport and was flown to Georgia with a cargo plane.
The applicant entered the territory of the Russian Federation on 6 July 2000 under the visa-free regime and settled in the village of Mescheryakovka in the Arkadakskiy District of the Saratov Region. On 10 October 2006 the applicant was arrested by police officers during an identity check operation in the area of his residence. Later that same day the Arkadakskiy Disrtict Court of the Saratov Region found him guilty of staying in the country without the required residence permit. The court fined the applicant (RUB 1,000), ordered his detention and his expulsion. Subsequently the applicant was transferred to a detention centre for aliens. On 12 October 2006, after friends of the applicant had paid the administrative fine and bought him an aeroplane ticket to Armenia for the next day, the applicant was released. On 13 October 2006 the applicant left the territory of the Russian Federation, leaving behind his property and belongings.
The applicant entered the territory of the Russian Federation in 2004 and worked on a market in Moscow. On 4 October 2006 the market was raided by a special unit of the police and the applicant, together with around twenty other Georgian nationals, was arrested. The applicant was brought to the Department of the Interior in the Southern Orekhovo-Borisovo District of Moscow. On 5 October 2006 the Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow found her guilty of staying in the country without the required residence permit. The court fined the applicant (RUB 1,000), ordered her detention and her expulsion. Subsequently the applicant was transferred to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 2. On 17 October 2006 the applicant was taken to a military airport and flown to Georgia with a cargo plane.
The applicants entered the territory of the Russian Federation in December 2002/January 2003 and lived there without the required visa, at the latest since 25 December 2003. On 6 October 2006 both applicants were apprehended by the police and brought to the Ivanovskoye police station of the Department of the Eastern Administrative District of Moscow. On the same day the Perovskiy District Court of Moscow fined both applicants (RUB 1,500 each) for staying in the country without the required registration and ordered their expulsion. Subsequently both applicants were released. On 16 October 2006 the applicants left the Russian Federation by their own means with their son, leaving behind most of their belongings.
An alleged detention of the applicants’ son and the fact whether the applicants owned a car, which they had to leave behind when leaving the Russian Federation, are matters of contention (see paragraphs 50-52 below).
The applicant entered the Russian Federation on an unknown date on a multi-entry business visa, valid until 15 August 2007. She had registered her place of residence through a private agency and received a certificate valid until 16 March 2007. On 11 October 2006 the applicant was apprehended by police officers for an inspection of her identity documents and was brought to the Vykhino police station in Moscow, where she was subsequently detained. On 12 October 2006 the Kuzminskiy District Court of Moscow fined the applicant (RUB 1,000) for not complying with the applicable registration obligation, ordered her detention and expulsion. On 13 October 2006 the applicant was transferred to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 2, where she was detained until her expulsion. On 17 October 2006 she was brought by bus to Demododova airport and was flown to Georgia.
The first applicant stayed in the Russian Federation on a multi-entry business visa, valid until 13 February 2007, and had registered his place of residence through a private agency. The second applicant had a temporary document issued by the Consulate of Georgia, authorising his residency in the Russian Federation until 5 November 2006. On 11 October 2006 the applicants were apprehended by police officers for an inspection of their documents and brought to the Vykhino police station in Moscow, where they were subsequently detained. On 12 October 2006 the Kuzminskiy District Court of Moscow fined the applicants (RUB 1,000 each) for not complying with the applicable registration obligation and ordered their detention and expulsion. On 12 October 2006 the applicants were transferred to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 1, where they were detained until their expulsion. On 28 October 2006 the applicants were brought by bus to Demododova airport and were flown to Georgia.
The applicant had lived in Russia since 2005 and had a visa and registration valid until 19 October 2006. On 18 October 2006 the applicant left the Russian Federation by her own means.
An alleged detention of the applicant in the beginning of October 2006 is a matter of contention (see paragraphs 53-55 below).
The applicant had lived in Moscow since 1992. He worked as an engineer, had a visa valid until 28 October 2006 and a registration certificate, issued by a private agency, valid until the same day.
It is a matter of contention, whether the applicant had been detained, whether his expulsion was ordered by a court and whether he was deported (see paragraphs 56-59 below).
The applicants had lived in the Russian Federation since 1993, most recently in Moscow. The first applicant had a visa valid from 8 May 2006 until 7 May 2007. The second applicant had a visa valid from 30 June 2006 until 19 June 2007. Both applicants were in possession of registration certificates, valid until respectively 8 November 2006 and 30 December 2006. The applicants left the Russian Federation on 19 October 2006 by their own means.
An alleged detention of both applicants is a matter of contention (see paragraphs 60-62 below).
The applicant had lived in the Russian Federation since 2001. He had a visa valid until 30 August 2007 and a registration certificate that had expired on 18 September 2006. On 11 October 2006 the applicant was arrested by police officers and was brought to the Department of the Interior in the Vykhino district of Moscow, where he was detained. On 12 October 2006 the Kuzminskiy District Court of Moscow fined the applicant (RUB 1,000), ordered his detention and subsequent expulsion. After the decision of the District Court the applicant was transferred to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 1, where he was detained until his expulsion. On 28 October 2006 the applicant was brought by bus to Demododova airport and was flown to Georgia.
The applicant had lived in Moscow since 1997. She had a valid visa and a registration, but no work permit. On 27 September 2006 she was apprehended by police officers in a grocery store, and, after her identity papers had been checked and an administrative report had been drawn up, the applicant was released. On 6 October 2006 the Simonovskiy Court of Moscow found the applicant guilty of working without the required work permit and fined her (RUB 1,000). In addition the court ordered her detention and subsequent expulsion. After the court hearing the applicant was detained and brought to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 2, where she was detained until her expulsion. On 10 October 2006 the applicant was brought to Demododova airport and was flown to Georgia.
The applicant entered the Russian Federation in May 2005 and settled in Moscow. He had a valid visa until 1 March 2007. On 3 October 2006 the applicant was apprehended by officers of the Department of the Interior of the Mozhayskiy district of Moscow and brought to their station, where he was detained. On the same day the Kuntsevskiy District Court of Moscow fined the applicant for not observing the applicable registration procedure and ordered his detention and expulsion. The applicant was brought to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 1, where he was detained until his expulsion. On 11 October 2006, after the applicant’s relatives had bought him an aeroplane ticket to Georgia, he was brought to the airport and released. The applicant left the Russian Federation on that day.
The applicant had arrived in Moscow for the first time in February 2002. Since then he had lived, with short interruptions, in the Russian Federation and worked as a driver. After the last interruption he entered the Russian Federation on 4 March 2006 on a one month visa. On 6 October 2006 the Litkarinskiy Town Court of Moscow Region discontinued proceedings against the applicant for not observing the applicable registration procedure. On 23 October 2006 the Kuzminskiy District Court of Moscow fined the applicant (RUB 1,000) for not observing the applicable registration procedure. The court also ordered his expulsion from the Russian Federation. On 24 October 2006 the applicant left Russia by aeroplane.
The arrests and detentions surrounding the two court decisions are matters of contention (see paragraphs 63-66 below).
The applicant arrived in the Russian Federation in 1993 for the first time. On 6 September 2004 she was expelled from the Russian Federation due to a violation of visa-related regulations. On 8 October 2004 the applicant returned to Moscow. For the relevant time the applicant had a visa and registration, valid until respectively 8 October 2006 and 28 February 2007. The Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow decided that the expulsion decision of 2004 had included a five year ban from entering the Russian Federation. Consequently it fined the applicant (RUB 1,500), ordered her detention and expulsion. After several days of detention the applicant was expelled from the Russian Federation.
The exact circumstances and dates of the applicant’s arrest, detention, court decision and expulsion are matters of contention (see paragraphs 67-70 below).
The applicant entered the territory of the Russian Federation on 12 August 2006 on a multiple entry business visa. Subsequently she registered at her place of residence with the competent authority through a private agency. On 11 October 2006 the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow fined the applicant (RUB 1,000) for not having a valid, but a counterfeited, registration certificate. The court also ordered her detention and expulsion. At the latest on 12 October 2012 the applicant was transferred to the Centre for Temporary Detention of Aliens no. 2, where she was held until her expulsion. On 17 October 2006 the applicant was taken to a military airport and was flown to Georgia with a cargo plane.
The date of the applicant’s arrest and her detention before 12 October 2006 are matters of contention (see paragraphs 71-73 below).
The conditions of detention in the different places of detention are a matter of contention (see paragraphs 111-112 below).
The entry and residence of immigrants are governed by two laws: Federal Law no. 115-FZ of 25 July 2002 on the Legal Status of Foreign Nationals in the Russian Federation and Federal Law no. 109-FZ of 18 July 2006 on the Registration in the Russian Federation of Migrants who are Foreign Nationals or Stateless Persons.
Since the entry into force on 29 October 2002 of the Law on the Legal Status of Foreign Nationals, all citizens of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) – including Georgian nationals – are required to regularise their situation by applying for a residence permit, although they were previously lawfully resident on Russian territory. Under sections 20 and 21 of that Law, they must also submit a registration application to the local offices of the Russian Federal Migration Service, in order to obtain a registration certificate indicating their place of residence. If they want to carry on a professional activity they are required to obtain a work permit and a migrant worker’s card in accordance with section 13. A business visa (деловая) of variable duration is issued to foreign nationals wanting to take part in a seminar or having business contacts in the Russian Federation, but does not authorise them to work there legally.
In addition, since 5 December 2000, following the denunciation of the Bishkek Agreement of 9 October 1992 on visa-free travel for the citizens of several member States of the CIS, including Georgia, all Georgian nationals must apply for a visa to enter Russian territory.
Any foreign national who infringes the immigration regulations of the Russian Federation (Articles 18.8, 18.10 and 18.11 of the Code of Administrative Offences) is liable to administrative penalties and risks expulsion (Article 3.2). In addition, pursuant to Article 18.10 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences, a foreign national who engages in work activities without a work permit is also liable to an administrative fine and risks administrative expulsion.
Any decision concerning an accusation of an administrative nature that may result in expulsion from the Russian Federation is to be taken by a judge of an ordinary court (Article 23.1 § 3). An appeal lies to a court or appeal court within ten days (Article 30.1 § 1, 30.2 § 2 and 30. 3 § 1). This deadline may be extended at the request of the appellant (Article 30.3 § 2). An appeal against an administrative expulsion order is to be examined within one day of the lodging of the appeal documents (Article 30.5 § 3), is exonerated from court fees and is of suspensive effect (Articles 31.1, 31.2 § 2, and 31.3 §§ 1, 2 and 3). Lastly, a foreign national may also lodge an appeal with the courts of review against an administrative expulsion order that has become enforceable (judgments of the Constitutional Court of 22 April 2004 and 12 April 2005 on the constitutionality of Articles 30.11 §§ 1, 2 and 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences).
