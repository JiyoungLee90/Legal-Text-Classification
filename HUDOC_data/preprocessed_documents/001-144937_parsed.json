He argued that he had not exceeded the speed limit since he had been driving together with his friends during a Sunday trip and the bends on the relevant part of the road prevented a speed which exceeded the speed limit. In this regard, B. and G., who were driving behind him with their motorcycles, could confirm that he had not exceeded the speed limit. Firstly, in his view, the road could have been covered with sand, as it was the end of the winter time. Secondly, he argued that the road could have been slippery. Whatever the nature of the obstacle on the road, it was that obstacle that caused the traffic accident. In his further submissions he stressed again that he had been driving within the speed limit. He further drew attention to the fact that a sign should have been installed earlier, considering that many accidents involving motorcycles had happened in the past on that road. According to the applicant, one or two days after the accident a slippery road sign had been installed. Therefore, he requested the hearing of the responsible person of the Slovenian Roads Agency. Finally, he pointed out that he was a careful and experienced driver who had followed several trainings on road security.",

The Local Court held that the applicant should have expected a slippery road and the presence of sand but he failed to adjust his speed accordingly.

It is similar to Flisar v. Slovenia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a033-39, 29 September 2011) which concerned a conviction for offences against public order on the basis of the case-file forwarded by the police. The Court considers that in his request for judicial review the applicant challenged certain factual aspects of the case and expressly requested a hearing. It is true that he mainly challenged the fact that he had not exceeded the speed limit. However, he also drew attention to the fact that the road might have been slippery or covered with sand and with no proper traffic signalisation, proposing in this respect the hearing of three witnesses, two of which had witnessed the accident. The Court further notes that the observations of the police were the sole basis of the applicant\u2019s conviction and the Local Court provided no reasoning as to why the hearing was considered unnecessary. In those circumstances, given the nature of the factual questions to be addressed by the Local Court and the fact that the evidence was not obtained by means of an objective method (see, a\u00a0contrario, Suhadolc v. Slovenia, cited above) the Court is of the view that the Local Court could not, as a matter of fair trial, have properly determined the facts or the applicant\u2019s guilt without a direct assessment of the evidence at an oral hearing, or, in the alternative, without giving reasons for not doing so (see, mutatis mutandis, Flisar v.
