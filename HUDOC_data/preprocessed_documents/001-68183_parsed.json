In particular, Amnesty International\u2019s briefing for the United Nations Committee against Torture, which was made public in October 1999, found a failure on the part of Uzbekistan fully to implement its obligations under the Convention against Torture. The briefing recorded, inter alia, a growing number of reports of ill-treatment and torture by law enforcement officials of persons perceived to be members of Islamic congregations since 1997 and noted especially reports of the arrest, ill-treatment and torture of suspected supporters of the banned political opposition parties and movements (specifically Erk and Birlik) in the wake of bomb explosions in the capital, Tashkent, in February 1999. The briefing further cited independent and credible reports that self-incriminating evidence reportedly extracted by torture was routinely included in trial proceedings and served in many of the cases reviewed by Amnesty International as the basis for the finding of guilt. The briefing also referred to public statements by Uzbek officials, including the President of Uzbekistan himself, which, if not directly sanctioning the use of violence by State agents, could be perceived at the very least as condoning the use of torture and ill-treatment.",

Moreover, an assurance, even one given in good faith, that an individual will not be subjected to ill-treatment is not of itself a sufficient safeguard where doubts exist as to its effective implementation (see, for example, Chahal, cited above, p. 1861, \u00a7 105). The weight to be attached to assurances emanating from a receiving State must in every case depend on the situation prevailing in that State at the material time. The evidence as to the treatment of political dissidents in Uzbekistan at the time of the applicants\u2019 surrender is such, in our view, as to give rise to serious doubts as to the effectiveness of the assurances in providing the applicants with an adequate guarantee of safety.",

As the Court has emphasised, Article 1 cannot be read as justifying a general principle to the effect that a Contracting State may not surrender an individual unless satisfied that the conditions awaiting him in the country of destination are in full accord with each of the safeguards of the Convention (see Soering, cited above, pp. 33-34, \u00a7 86).

The Amnesty International briefing document afforded, in our view, credible grounds for believing that self-incriminating evidence extracted by torture was routinely used to secure guilty verdicts and that suspects were very frequently denied access to a lawyer of their choice, lawyers often being given access to their client by law enforcement officials after the suspect had been held in custody for several days, when the risk of torture was at its greatest.

We note at the outset that, while the Turkish Government received assurances concerning the property rights and treatment of the applicants in Uzbekistan, no assurances appear to have been sought by the Turkish Government or obtained from the Uzbek authorities as to the fairness of the criminal proceedings to which the applicants were to be subjected. More particularly, despite the gravity of the charges faced by the applicants, no attempt appears to have been made to safeguard the applicant\u2019s continued contact with their legal representatives or to ensure that, once returned to Uzbekistan, they would have access to legal advice and assistance from independent lawyers of their own choosing. In fact, according to the undisputed evidence of their legal representatives, once the extradition had taken place, they were unable to have any contact with either applicant, by letter or by telephone, prior to their trial or thereafter. The Uzbek authorities have asserted that the self-incriminating statements on which their convictions were principally based were made of the applicants\u2019 own free will, that their trial was held in public and that the trial was attended by, among others, \u201crepresentatives of human rights organisations\u201d. However, these assertions must be viewed in the light of the other material before the Court, notably the evidence of the third-party interveners \u2013 Human Rights Watch \u2013 which was the only human rights organisation in fact permitted to be represented at the applicants\u2019 trial. According to that evidence, the applicants were denied the right to be represented by counsel of their own choice, defending counsel being appointed by the public prosecutor; the applicants were held incommunicado until the commencement of their trial in June 1999; the trial was closed to the general public, to all family members of the applicants and to attorneys hired on behalf of the defence; and the self-incriminating statements used to convict the applicants included those signed during the pre-trial police investigation, while the applicants were in custody and without access to their own lawyers.",

In that case, the applicants had argued that, while the Convention contained no specific rules on interim measures indicated by the European Commission of Human Rights (whose Rule of Procedure 36 contained a text similar to Rule of Procedure 39 of the present Court), it was necessary to attribute binding force to such measures in order fully to secure the right to present individual applications guaranteed by Article 25 \u00a7 1 [now Article 34] of the Convention. The Court replied that \u201c[i]n the absence of a provision in the Convention for interim measures an indication given under Rule 36 cannot be considered to give rise to a binding obligation on Contracting Parties\u201d (p. 35, \u00a7 98), that \u201c[i]t would strain the language of Article 25 [now Article 34] to infer from the words \u2018undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right\u2019 an obligation to comply with a Commission indication under Rule 36 [current Rule 39 of the Rules of Court]\u201d (pp. 35-36, \u00a7 99), and that \u201cthe power to order binding interim measures cannot be inferred from either Article 25 in fine, or from other sources\u201d (p. 36, \u00a7 102). This was so, added the Court, even though there had been, in practice, \u201calmost total compliance with such indications\u201d (p. 36, \u00a7 100; see also, on this point, paragraphs 7 and 18 below). This \u201csubsequent practice\u201d \u201ccould be taken as establishing the agreement of Contracting States regarding the interpretation of a Convention provision [reference is being made here to the Court\u2019s Soering judgment and to Article 31 (3) (b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969] but not to create new rights and obligations which were not included in the Convention at the outset [reference to the Johnston and Others judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, pp.24-25, \u00a7 53]\u201d (emphasis added). \u201c[T]he practice of complying with Rule 36 indications\u201d, concluded the Court, \u201ccannot have been based on a belief that these indications gave rise to a binding obligation ...

The Court has done exactly that and has inserted Rule\u00a039 in its Rules of Procedure. It is obvious that it was allowed to do that, given that the Rule in question did not contravene the Convention by imposing on States Parties obligations not provided for by it. It is also obvious that the Parties, when drawing up the Convention, had no intention whatsoever of asserting a duty to comply with interim measures indicated by the Court on the sole strength of the Rules of Procedure it would enact; nor did they have any intention of doing so later on, as is shown by the absence of any mention of interim measures and of their binding nature in the Additional Protocols and by the non-acceptance of proposals to introduce in a protocol a provision on the binding character of interim measures (see paragraph 18 below).",

In Cruz Varas, that method had not even been expressly mentioned. Moreover, regarding the nature of interim measures, nothing much has changed between the time when that judgment was adopted and now: binding interim measures were as desirable then as they are today, yet they cannot be justified without an enabling provision in the Convention, the Court\u2019s constitutive instrument. Furthermore, Cruz Varas was confirmed, regarding measures issued by the Court itself, in the \u010conka decision, only three months before the LaGrand judgment of the ICJ.",

It has in fact been said that, domestically as well as internationally, a right of application without the possibility of attracting binding interim measures is not an effective right at all. This may be so on the domestic level, where the principle of compulsory jurisdiction of the courts prevails. It is certainly not on the international level. Firstly, States are entirely free to accept or to refuse compulsory jurisdiction of international courts and, if they do accept it, to limit its scope, for instance by not including rules on the binding character of provisional measures. This is the case in the framework of the arbitration procedure instituted by the Washington (World Bank) Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (Article\u00a047). Secondly, one should not forget that for many years international tribunals such as the Permanent Court of International Justice (1920-39) and its successor, the ICJ, for most of its existence (1946 to 2001), confined themselves to indicating provisional measures without specifying their binding character. Thirdly, Article 34 of the Convention requires States \u201cnot to hinder in any way the effective exercise of [the right to make individual applications]\u201d (emphasis added). By not providing for interim measures and, a fortiori, by not vesting them with binding force, the right of individual application is \u201chindered\u201d in no way; and to say the contrary would stretch the interpretation of Article 34 to a point at which the Court ceases to interpret and assumes legislative functions. That this is so is shown by other instruments of dispute settlement: nowhere else have jurisdiction and the right of application been linked to the issuance and the binding force of interim measures. Thus, in LaGrand, the Hague Court refrained from relying on Article 35 of its Statute \u2013 the approximate equivalent of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights \u2013 to determine the nature of its interim measures. It interpreted Article 41 of its Statute, finding that that provision would not meet its aim if the measures indicated were optional. If the Convention of 1950 contained a provision comparable to Article 41 of the Statute of the Hague Court, we would likely have concluded, on the basis of that provision, that to \u201cindicate\u201d interim measures must, as a matter of teleological interpretation, mean to \u201corder\u201d or \u201cprescribe\u201d such measures. In the case of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, whose constituent instrument \u2013 not Rules of Procedure! \u2013 contains a provision similar to Article 41 of the ICJ Statute, this is not even an issue since Article 63 \u00a7 2 of the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights enables the Court to order interim measures. The problem in the present case is that there is no reasonable legal basis for drawing a similar conclusion. Article 34 of the Convention cannot serve as such, which makes it impossible to read the notion of binding interim measures into the text of the Convention.",

Article\u00a031 \u00a7 3 (b) of that convention refers to \u201cany subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the Parties regarding its interpretation\u201d. This practice was equally considered in Cruz Varas. After describing early unsuccessful attempts of the Convention institutions at adopting recommendations in the matter (pp. 34-35, \u00a7 96), the Court found that the prevailing \u2013 but not complete \u2013 compliance with provisional measures was inspired by the desire of States Parties to cooperate. There was, in other words, no evidence that that practice, as is required by the Vienna Convention, \u201cestablished the agreement of the Parties regarding its interpretation\u201d. That the contrary is true is first shown by the fact that, at its extraordinary meeting in early 1994, the Committee of Experts for the Improvement of Procedures for the Protection of Human Rights (DH-PR) received reform proposals from the European Commission of Human Rights on 31\u00a0January 1994 (docs. DH-PR(94)2 and DH-PR(94)4). Both the Commission and the Court considered that the new Court should have the power to issue interim measures with legally binding effect and that this should be provided for in the Convention. The Court\u2019s proposal was similar to Article 63 \u00a7 2 of the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights. The Commission\u2019s preference was for the interim-measure rules of the Commission\u2019s (Rule 36) and the Court\u2019s (Rule 36) Rules of Procedure to be included in the text of the Convention. The Swiss delegation also submitted a proposal with a view to including an Article in the Convention on provisional measures to the effect that \u201cthe Court may ... prescribe any necessary interim measures\u201d (doc. DH-PR(93)20, 22\u00a0November 1993).",

All three proposals were, however, rejected by the government experts. Later on, the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Demography suggested that interim measures indicated pursuant to Rule 36 of the Court\u2019s Rules of Procedure be made obligatory for member States (Draft Report, AS/PR(1997)2 revised, 19\u00a0February 1997). The Committee of Ministers declined to include a provision on interim measures in the Convention. This can only mean that the widespread acceptance of the practice in question rests on courtesy, cooperation and convenience, but not on an agreed interpretation. Nor has the Committee of Ministers seen fit to suggest the introduction of a provision on binding provisional measures in Draft Protocol No. 14. Again this must have been so because there was no agreement on making such measures compulsory and not because the Committee thought it superfluous to do anything on the assumption that provisional measures were binding.",

Regarding general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, there may well be a widespread rule on obligatory interim measures on the domestic level, based on the rule of compulsory jurisdiction applicable on that level. By contrast, as pointed out earlier (see paragraph 16 above), that rule does not prevail on the international level, which is why it cannot be applied as such on that level.
