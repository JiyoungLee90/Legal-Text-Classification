However, the right of access to a court is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others, cited above, \u00a7 89, and Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 230, ECHR\u00a02012). Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others, cited above, \u00a7 89).",

In situations such as the one in the present case, where the matter was already examined by two lower courts who had jurisdiction to, and did examine all questions of fact and law, limiting jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to question of law only, cannot in itself raise any issue under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Indeed, the Court has stressed that there is no right under Article 6 to lodge an appeal in civil matters (see Cibicki v. Poland, no.\u00a020482/03, \u00a7 30, 3 March 2009).",

However, the Court notes that the applicant in the present case only complained to the Constitutional Court about the Supreme Court decision to declare his appeal on points of law inadmissible, a complaint the Constitutional Court dismissed as manifestly ill-founded. He did not allege that there had been any violation of his rights in the proceedings before the lower courts (see paragraph 16 above).",
