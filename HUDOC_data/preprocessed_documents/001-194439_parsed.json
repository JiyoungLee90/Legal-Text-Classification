At around 9.45 a.m., the moment the black car driven by Z.V. had stopped at a red traffic light, and an undercover police van had artificially created a traffic jam ahead of it, I.P. and eight officers of the special unit, led by K.N., had started approaching the car. K.N. had been the first one to reach the car, from the front passenger side, and, after having attempted to open the closed door from the outside, he had started shooting with his service pistol in the direction of the front passenger and the driver. The latter had started manoeuvring his car in order to escape the traffic jam created by the police van. In that manoeuvre, the car had crossed the lane into the traffic lane in the opposing direction; at that moment all the nine officers had opened heavy fire. Eventually, Z.V. had lost control over his vehicle which had crashed into a lamp post on the kerb, but the shooting at the car had continued after the crash. The trial court also established that, after the heavy shooting at Z.V.\u2019s vehicle had stopped, G.Ts., a senior officer of the criminal police unit, who had been I.P.\u2019s closest confidant at work, had approached the car from the driver\u2019s side and fired two shots from his service pistol through the rolled-down window of the car into the heads of the driver, Z.V., and the front passenger, A.Kh.

The trial court concluded that the only reason why the criminal police unit had launched that criminal investigation had been to be able to get control of the very first investigative measures conducted at the scene of the crime, as I.P. had been conspiring to cover up his and his team\u2019s wrongdoings. In that connection, the trial court established, on the basis of the statements received from a number of former officers of the Ministry of the Interior, including those who had participated in the police operation of 2 May 2006, that, when preparing the armed ambush on Z.V.\u2019s car, I.P. had thought of bringing along from the carpark of the Ministry of the Interior a police car that had already received bullet damage in a previous and unrelated police operation (\u201cthe damaged police car\u201d). I.P. had ordered the driver of the damaged police car to place it right behind Z.V.\u2019s car after the termination of the police operation of 2 May 2006. Those facts were confirmed to the trial court by the driver of the damaged police car himself.",

The latter fact was further confirmed by the results of a ballistics examination conducted during the reopened investigation. The City Court further established that, in another attempt to fabricate evidence of having been under fire from Z.V.\u2019s car, I.P. had ordered one of his subordinates, L.B., who had participated in the police operation of 2 May 2006, to inflict a light injury on himself, and the latter had duly obeyed. Furthermore, I.P. had ordered his subordinates to plant four different types of guns, balaclavas and police radio scanners in Z.V.\u2019s car immediately after the termination of the police operation. A subsequently conducted ballistics examination confirmed that no shot had ever been fired from any of the four planted guns. The trial court also established that I.P. had made prior arrangements with an undercover police informer, who had been collaborating with the criminal police in a number of unrelated cases, to come forward in the case at hand and pretend to be a victim of the robbery attack purportedly planned by Z.V. and his two friends. Lastly, it was also established that I.P. had induced a former convicted criminal, who had been released on parole and under the criminal police\u2019s close supervision during the probationary period, to claim falsely that he had been the three young men\u2019s fourth accomplice in their intention to commit the robbery.",

I.P. was found to have fabricated, possibly in complicity with other unidentified senior law-enforcement officers of the Ministry of the Interior, the relevant documents in order to justify the mobilisation of police units. The trial court established that the mens rea behind I.P.\u2019s criminal actions had been to take personal revenge against A.Kh. (see paragraphs\u00a03739 above). The police operation of 2 May 2006 had thus been mounted with the sole aim of assassinating the passengers of Z.V.\u2019s car. The trial court also concluded that G.Ts. had been the direct perpetrator of the killings of the two young men.",

The trial court also underscored the clearly disproportionate nature of the force used by the police \u2013 whilst no resistance whatsoever had been received from the passengers in Z.V.\u2019s car, within the fifteen seconds that followed K.N.\u2019s initial unwarranted gun shots, at least five police officers fired from their Kalashnikov automatic rifles, each of them fully discharging their high-capacity magazines. Overall, more than hundred shots were fired, with some of the stray bullets damaging a public-transport bus. The trial court stated that, even assuming that the passengers of Z.V.\u2019s car had put up resistance to the police\u2019s lawful orders, the use of such overwhelming armed force had been clearly disproportionate.",

When reaching the latter conclusion, the City Court suggested that it was not unreasonable to assume that other officers of the Ministry of the Interior, who had not been identified during the reopened investigation, could have been involved in perverting the course of justice. Furthermore, given that the initiation of the criminal proceedings for attempted robbery and unlawful transport of firearms against the passengers of Z.V.\u2019s car had been unlawful (see paragraph\u00a040 above), the trial court concluded that the arrest of B.P., the only survivor, by G.K., the investigator in charge of the fabricated robbery case, had been unlawful.

The court qualified the method of the assassination to have been particularly vile and cynical given the sanctity and significance that the son\u2019s grave, who had in his turn been killed by police officers, had represented for the mourning father and because G.S. had eagerly assumed the risk of creating an excessive and indiscriminate danger to other peoples\u2019 lives when planting such a large explosive device. The mens rea behind the crime had been G.S.\u2019s wish to punish the first applicant for and/or prevent him from carrying out his public activities that had been directed against the officers appearing on the police blacklist (see paragraph 54 above). In that connection, the City Court noted, as a suspicious fact, that telephone conversations had taken place between I.P. and G.S. both a few days before and after the first applicant\u2019s assassination. However, as they did not know the content of those conversations, the trial court refrained from making any further inferences. G.S. was sentenced to twenty years in prison.",

These considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude, even without enquiring into other relevant circumstances, that the part of the original investigation carried out by the Tbilisi city prosecutor\u2019s office manifestly lacked the requisite thoroughness, objectivity and, as was subsequently revealed by the results of the reopened investigation, integrity (compare, mutatis mutandis, Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 250-58, and Medova v. Russia, no.\u00a025385/04, \u00a7\u00a0109, 15 January 2009).",

However, the Court is not convinced that the outcome of the reopened criminal proceedings constituted sufficient redress for the applicants. The belated acknowledgement of the fact of the aggravated murder of the applicants\u2019 son, more than nine years after the killing had taken place, coupled with the significant periods of total inactivity on the part of the investigation authorities (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 1934 above), clearly amounted to procrastinated justice. The Court reiterates that justice delayed is often justice denied (compare Lopatin and Medvedskiy v.\u00a0Ukraine, nos. 2278/03 and 6222/03, \u00a7 75, 20 May 2010), as the existence of unreasonable periods of inactivity and a lack of diligence on the authorities\u2019 part in conducting the proceedings renders the investigation ineffective irrespective of its final outcome (compare \u0160ilih, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0211; Merkulova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-62; \u015eandru and Others v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a022465/03, \u00a7\u00a7 73 and 77-80, 8\u00a0December 2009; Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek and Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 v.

However, after the reopening of the investigation on the latter date, the Court observes that it was the first applicant who, even in the absence of the relevant victim status, still bore the burden of the investigation, by interviewing the various key witnesses and collecting other evidence, for a considerable period of time (see paragraphs 19-34 above, and compare, for instance, \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 209). After the reopening of the investigation, and despite the fact that there already existed substantial evidence implicating the relevant police officers in the unlawful use of the lethal force against the applicants\u2019 son, it still took the relevant domestic authorities almost three years to terminate the investigation and transfer the case for trial (compare, mutatis mutandis, Agache and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079, and \u015eandru and Others, cited above, \u00a7 74). It should be noted in this connection that it was partly on the basis of the evidence collected by the first applicant himself that the conviction for his son\u2019s murder was later secured (see paragraph\u00a036 above). Although this issue does not obviously fall within the scope of the present application, the Court cannot fail to note that, as was established by the relevant domestic courts (see paragraphs 54 and 58 above), the first applicant\u2019s assassination \u2013 in a bomb blast caused by a device planted at his son\u2019s grave \u2013 was prompted by his incessant public activities aimed at shining a light on the activities of the police officers responsible for the killing of Z.V. on 2\u00a0May 2006. By taking over the investigative role, which should normally have been the responsibility of the relevant authorities, the first applicant put himself at almost certain risk of retaliation. The Court underlines that the tragic development in the present case can be seen as yet another vivid example of how tangibly deleterious the consequences of a lack of due diligence on the part of the authorities investigating lifeendangering crimes can be, particularly where police corruption is involved (compare, mutatis mutandis, Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0276 and 277).",

Georgia, no. 21571/05, \u00a7 108, 1 June 2017; Dimitrova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 87 and 88; and Trufin v.

According to the relevant domestic law and practice, the second applicant\u2019s inability to take part in the trial, after her husband\u2019s death, deprived her, amongst other things, of an opportunity to testify before the domestic courts about the degree of anxiety and distress caused by the commission of the crime, which would have assisted her in the subsequent and separate procedural steps aimed at obtaining civil redress from the perpetrators (see, in this connection, Article 57 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 30917 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cited in paragraphs 60 and 62 above). In other words, the second applicant\u2019s inability to attend the trial impaired the possibility of seeking and obtaining adequate compensation for the damage which she and her already late husband had sustained as a result of the killing of their son by the police\u00a0(see the references cited in fine of paragraph 74 above, and also Yeter v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 33750/03, \u00a7 58, 13 January 2009).",

This is essential for maintaining public confidence, ensuring adherence to the rule of law and preventing any appearance of tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts committed by State agents (compare, for instance, with Bekta\u015f and \u00d6zalp v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a010036/03, \u00a7 50, 20 April 2010, and Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 61). In the present case, although domestic law permitted the trial court to impose a higher sentence \u2013 either twenty years in prison or life imprisonment \u2013 it initially handed down sixteen-year prison sentences for the two authors of the aggravated murder of the applicants\u2019 son (Article\u00a0109 of the Civil Code, cited in paragraph 64 above). Furthermore, when handing down those sentences, the trial court obviously knew that the terms were not real as they were subject to a further reduction, by a quarter, pursuant to the automatic application of section 16 of the Amnesty Act of 28 December 2012 (see paragraphs 46 and 67 above). The Court regrets that the domestic legislator, when enacting the Amnesty Act, did not apparently give a due consideration to the need to punish serious police misconduct with unbending stringency. In this connection, the Court reiterates that when an agent of the State, in particular a law-enforcement officer, is convicted of a crime that violates Article 2 of the Convention, the granting of an amnesty or pardon should not be permissible (compare, amongst many others, Nina Kutsenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 25114/11, \u00a7 149, 18 July 2017; Yeter, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070; and Ali and Ay\u015fe Duran v. Turkey, no. 42942/02, \u00a7 69, 8 April 2008). Indeed, the Court expects States to be all the more stringent when punishing their own law-enforcement officers for the commission of such serious lifeendangering crimes than they are with ordinary offenders, because what is at stake is not only the issue of the individual criminal-law liability of the perpetrators but also the State\u2019s duty to combat the sense of impunity the offenders may consider they enjoy by virtue of their\u00a0very\u00a0office, and to maintain public confidence in and respect for the law-enforcement system\u00a0(see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0274, and, mutatis mutandis, Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

In other words, the two convicted former police officers could potentially join the law-enforcement system of the respondent State anew after they have served their twelve-year prison sentences. In this connection, the Court emphasises that, as a matter of principle, it would be wholly inappropriate and would send the wrong signal to the public if the perpetrators of the very serious crime in question maintained eligibility for holding public office in the future (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, \u00a7 274; T\u00fcrkmen v. Turkey, no. 43124/98, \u00a7\u00a053, 19\u00a0December 2006; and Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v. Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7\u00a055, 2\u00a0November 2004). In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the sentences imposed upon the two police officers who murdered the applicants\u2019 son and his friend in the egregious circumstances \u2013 with malice aforethought, employing the law-enforcement machinery for that unique purpose \u2013 did not constitute fully adequate punishment for the crime committed.",

The opposite is the case with respect to the fees of a representative who, without waiving them, has simply taken no steps to pursue their payment or has deferred it. The fees payable to a representative under a conditionalfee agreement are actually incurred only if that agreement is enforceable in the respective jurisdiction (see Merabishvili v.

In the present case the applicants did not submit documents showing that they had paid or were under a legal obligation to pay the fees charged by their British representative or the expenses incurred by him. In the absence of such documents, the Court finds no basis on which to accept that the costs and expenses claimed by the applicants have actually been incurred (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 361-62, 364-65 and 372-73).",
