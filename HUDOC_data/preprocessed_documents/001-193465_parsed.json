He complained that, inter alia, the Lustration Commission had not held an oral hearing and it had not provided sufficient reasoning for its findings, in particular to show that his alleged collaboration had satisfied the criteria specified in section 18 of the 2012 Lustration Act. In support of this complaint, he referred to P.K.\u2019s statement, which he appended to his claim. He also argued that according to the documents in his case file, no measures had been taken against the persons in respect of whom he had allegedly provided information to the security bodies. He further challenged the veracity and authenticity of the documents in question, claiming that only copy documents had been admitted into evidence, that they had not been signed by the handler or himself and that no official stamp had been affixed on them. In that connection, he subsequently submitted a letter from the Intelligence Service (\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435) dated 2013, in which it was confirmed that the applicant had not been registered in its records and that the documents used in the impugned proceedings had not been from its archives. Given the complexity of the case, the applicant requested that the court hold a public and oral hearing in order to establish the relevant facts. In that regard he requested that the court hear oral evidence from P.K. and an expert (\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0447), V.P., a university professor and former intelligence officer, regarding the reliability of the documentary evidence against the applicant and whether he could be regarded as a collaborator within the meaning of the 2012 Lustration Act. In this respect, he submitted a copy of a statement made by V.P. and published on a news portal in which V.P. had underlined the qualitative criteria of such collaboration and the difference between \u201can informant\u201d and \u201ca collaborator\u201d. In that statement V.P. defined \u201can informant\u201d as \u201ca person who had not established a relationship of collaboration (\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441), but had provided information to the security services without having signed a collaboration agreement\u201d.",

The reasoning provided by the lower bodies in that respect had not been sufficient. Furthermore, there was no evidence that in return for providing information he had obtained any favours in getting promoted, which was a requirement for the alleged collaboration to fall within the meaning of section 18(4) of the 2012 Lustration Act. On the other hand, there was evidence that the materials on which the impugned decisions were based had not been reliable (see paragraph 9 above) and that he had not been aware that the information would reach the State Security Office. The authenticity of the files used against him had also been compromised in that they had not been from the archives of the Intelligence Service on the one hand, but that they had seemingly been drawn up by handlers at the State Security Office \u2013 which was the predecessor of the Intelligence Service \u2013 on the other hand. Furthermore, they had been admitted into evidence as copy documents, without having their authenticity confirmed by the security bodies. He asked for an oral hearing to be held.",

Accordingly, in the judicial review proceedings he limited his complaints in this respect to the admissibility and authenticity of those documents.

The applicant\u2019s request to consult the originals pending the proceedings before the Higher Administrative Court, which was not accompanied by such an argument, cannot be regarded as sufficient in this respect (see paragraph 12 above). In the Court\u2019s opinion, that explains the scope of the domestic courts\u2019 examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint under this head (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). Owing to the manner in which the applicant formulated his complaint, the domestic courts were deprived of the opportunity to examine the alleged impact of those limitations on the applicant\u2019s Article 6 rights.

The examination of P.K. and V.P. had been requested in order that they could provide oral evidence about the reliability of the documentary evidence on the basis of which the Commission had established that he had collaborated with the security bodies. Owing to the absence of an oral hearing during the proceedings, the applicant had been prevented from presenting his defence and challenging the authenticity and veracity of the evidence against him. Whether there had been collaboration with the former security bodies was a fact to be determined in each case separately on the basis of concrete evidence and facts. Accordingly, no general approach, as the Government seemed to have suggested (see paragraph 32 below), could have been applied. He further reiterated his arguments that the impugned decisions had lacked sufficient reasoning. The additional evidence (see paragraph 16 above) confirmed that his lustration had been politically motivated and had violated his rights.",

Both courts had taken into consideration P.K.\u2019s written statement in which he had confirmed the authenticity and veracity of the notes which he had drawn up. The Government further stated that the domestic courts had extensive experience (having decided over sixty lustration cases) regarding the working methods of the State Security Office at the time and had an established practice that had focused on de facto collaboration, irrespective of whether there had been a formal arrangement in that respect. V.P.\u2019s definition of a \u201csecret informant\u201d in his interview had been in line with that approach (see paragraph 10 above). For those reasons, it had not been necessary to examine them. Furthermore, it had been possible to decide all the issues of fact and law, the latter not being complex, on the basis of the documentary evidence and so holding an oral hearing would have been in conflict with the principles of economy and efficiency. The Government maintained that the courts had provided sufficient reasons for their decisions. Lastly, they asked the Court not to take the additional evidence submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 16 above) into consideration since it had neither been submitted to any domestic authority, nor had its authenticity and veracity been verified.",

The Administrative Court confirmed the facts established by the Commission by relying solely on the documents against the applicant. It made no reference to the conflicting evidence contained in P.K.\u2019s written statement. The Higher Administrative Court confirmed those findings, holding that \u201creports drawn up by handlers in [such bodies] are to be regarded as facts\u201d (see paragraph 14 above). The Court, however, notes that the documents used against the applicant were not from the archives of the Intelligence Service (see paragraph 10 above), which was the successor to the State Security Office, the agents of which had drawn up the records in question. Furthermore, and more importantly, P.K., who was the handler to whom the applicant had allegedly provided information about third persons, clearly stated that he had drafted the records \u201caccording to his interpretation\u201d and \u201cwithout [the applicant\u2019s] knowledge\u201d and that they \u201c... [were] not truthful\u201d (see paragraph 9 above). Those elements, in the Court\u2019s view, required more detailed scrutiny by the domestic courts. A mere declaration that P.K.\u2019s statement would not be taken into account (see paragraph 11 above), without enabling that witness to provide first-hand information relevant to the applicant\u2019s complaints, is not sufficient. Given the particular circumstances of the case, similar considerations apply to the court\u2019s failure to hear oral evidence from V.P., an expert. Accordingly, Article 6 of the Convention required the domestic courts to provide a more substantial statement of their reasons rather than simply saying that \u201c[the applicant] had not submitted any evidence that led to different facts\u201d (see paragraph 11 above). The Government\u2019s own arguments that it had not been necessary for the national authorities to adduce the evidence presented by the applicant (see paragraph 32 above) cannot offset that deficiency.",
