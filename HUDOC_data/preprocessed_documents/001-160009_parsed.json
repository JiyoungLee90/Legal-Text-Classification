A private prosecutor (privatni tu\u017eitelj) was an injured party who brought a private prosecution in respect of criminal offences for which such a prosecution was expressly allowed by the Criminal Code (these were offences of a lesser degree). An injured party acting as a subsidiary prosecutor (o\u0161te\u0107eni kao tu\u017eitelj) was a person taking over criminal proceedings in respect of criminal offences subject to public prosecution where the relevant prosecuting authorities, for whatever reason, had decided not to prosecute (Article 55). When acting as a subsidiary prosecutor, the victim had all rights in the proceedings which the State Attorney\u2019 Office would have had as public prosecuting authority, save for those vested in the State Attorney\u2019s Office as a state body.",

Bulgaria, no. 59548/00, \u00a7 83, 17 January 2008). In this respect the Court reiterates that in the case of unintentional deprivation of life, an effective procedural response may be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and/or for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7 194, 9 April 2009). However, a remedy should exist not only in theory; it must operate effectively in practice, within a timespan allowing the case to be examined without unnecessary delay (see Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 53; Byrzykowski, cited above, \u00a7 105; Dodov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 95; and \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0195).",

Therefore, the Court\u2019s task is to examine whether there was an adequate procedural response on the part of the State to the infringement of the right to life (see Konczelska v.

In other words, the Court must assess whether the available legal remedies, taken together, as provided in law and applied in practice, could be said to have secured legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (see Byrzykowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104-118; and Dodov, cited above, \u00a7 83).",
