It therefore ordered the child protection authority to identify a suitable person and to make a proposal to the city council, which in turn was ordered to provide the necessary funds from its budget to cover the salary of the personal assistant.

The class teacher asked her to leave the classroom, warning her that her presence was no longer tolerated and that the authorities had been alerted. The second applicant refused to leave and was eventually removed by force by two police officers and taken to the police station. She was given a formal warning for refusing to leave the school premises. She left the police station three hours later and went back to the school to collect her son. According to the Government, during the second applicant\u2019s stay in the police station, the first applicant remained in school, in the presence of the school nurse and a teacher on duty.",

The school headmaster, supported by parents\u2019 statements, also lodged a complaint against the second applicant, alleging that she had repeatedly disturbed the learning process. The second applicant and the school headmaster gave statements to the police. On 4 April 2017 the prosecutor\u2019s office attached to the Bucharest District Court closed the investigation. It found, based on the evidence in the file, that the force used by the police officers had been necessary in order to put an end to the second applicant\u2019s disruptive behaviour and had been proportionate to her reactions. It observed that the second applicant had disturbed lessons and had refused to leave the classroom, to show her identity papers to the police and to accompany the police officers to the police station. The prosecutor concluded that the injuries suffered by the second applicant had been the result of the use of force and of her own opposition to the police officers\u2019 actions. On 18 October 2017 the objection lodged by the applicants against the prosecutor\u2019s decision was dismissed as out of time by the chief prosecutor from the same prosecutor\u2019s office. The applicants\u2019 appeal was subsequently dismissed by the Bucharest District Court (final decision of 11\u00a0December\u00a02017).",

Furthermore, the authorities had an immediate obligation to provide reasonable accommodation from the moment it was requested; this could serve as a temporary solution for an individual when accessibility was lacking. The Special Rapporteur referred to the following as examples of reasonable accommodation in education: providing mobile ramps to enable access to the facilities; changing the location of a class; customising the timing of studies; adapting or acquiring the necessary equipment to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, including full physical and mental capacity; and allowing support persons (personal assistants, parents or any other person of their choice) to accompany them and assist during lessons.

It cannot ignore the fact that some of these difficulties were created by the applicants themselves, and in particular by the second applicant, who, by insisting that the personal assistants perform tasks incompatible with their job description, jeopardised the relationship between the parties concerned (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). It also notes that the authorities renewed their efforts to find a suitable personal assistant (see paragraph 54 above), thus striving to comply with the domestic courts\u2019 findings in that regard (see paragraphs 50, 58\u00a0(d) and 66 above).",

The national authorities, by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions in this regard (see \u00c7am, cited above, \u00a7 66). It is, however, important that those authorities take great care with the choices they make in this sphere, in view of the impact of those choices on persons with disabilities, whose particular vulnerability cannot be ignored. Bearing this in mind, the Court notes that, in the present case, the authorities did not turn a blind eye to the first applicant\u2019s needs, but allocated resources to the schools attended by him in order to help accommodate his special requirements. It notes, for instance, that various adaptations were made to render his physical environment more accessible (see paragraphs 16, 25-26 and 30-33 above) and that support teachers and various therapists were assigned to him (see, for instance, paragraphs 37-39, 42, 45 and 46 above).",
