The Court has certain doubts in this respect. It notes, in particular, that the Supreme Court had not been prepared to equate the excessively lengthy examination to a breach of one of the essential elements of a criminal procedure. In this respect it noted that the quashing of the lower-courts\u2019 decisions would only further prolong the proceedings (see paragraphs 43 and 47 above). Even assuming that there has been an acknowledgement of the breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court observes that no reference to any possible redress was made by the domestic courts. This leads to the second question which the Court has to answer - whether any possibility of redress was accessible to the applicant.",
