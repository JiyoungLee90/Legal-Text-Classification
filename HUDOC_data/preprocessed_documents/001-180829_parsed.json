According to Rule 47 \u00a7\u00a05 in force at the time, the date of such first communication was considered to be the date of introduction of an application interrupting the six-month timelimit set by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court has already found that the six-week time-limit in the Practice Direction of 1\u00a0November 2003 was an indicative, rather than a mandatory one (see Smertin v. Russia, no. 19027/07, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28, 2 October 2014, with further references). It has no reason to depart from that conclusion in the present case. The applicant submitted his application form within eight weeks after the Registry\u2019s letter on 5 August 2009, in compliance with the instructions contained therein. Therefore, the Court considers 5\u00a0May 2009 as the introduction date for application no.\u00a041644/09. The criminal proceedings in Mr Kel\u2019s case ended on 24\u00a0February 2009 (see appended table below). Thus, he introduced his application within the established six-month time-limit.",
