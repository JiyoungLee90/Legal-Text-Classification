It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. Moreover, the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities (Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, ECHR 2000-X). In the above mentioned Daktaras case the Court emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence. Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (ibid.).",
