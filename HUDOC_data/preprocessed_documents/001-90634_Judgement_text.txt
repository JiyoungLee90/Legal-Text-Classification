The case originated in an application (no. 33928/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Austrian nationals, Mr Karl and Mrs Christine Klug (“the applicants”), on 16 September 2005.
The applicants were represented by Mr E. Fritsche, a lawyer practising in . The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that that the land consolidation proceedings concerning their property had lasted an unreasonably long time.
On 28 September 2007 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1955 and 1961 respectively. They are farmers residing at Ginsenberg, Styria.
On 8 June 1972 the Graz District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbehörde, "the District Authority") opened the Mooskirchen land consolidation proceedings (Zusammenlegungsverfahren) which also concerned the applicants’ land.
On 16 November 1984 the District Authority adopted the consolidation scheme (Zusammenlegungsplan) and on 10 December 1984 the parties to the proceedings were notified.
Subsequently, on 20 December 1984 K. and A., the applicants’ predecessors (the first applicant’s parents), lodged an appeal, alleging that they had not been duly compensated.
On 19 September 1990 the Regional Agricultural Panel (Landes-agrarsenat) dismissed their appeal as unfounded. By decision of 25 February 1991 the  refused to deal with the case for lack of prospect of success and upon the applicants’ predecessors’ request remitted the case to the .
Thereupon K. and A. lodged a complaint with the , which, on 21 September 1995, quashed the decision of 19 September 1990 for failure to comply with procedural rules and remitted the case back to the Regional Agricultural Panel.
Since the Regional Agricultural Panel failed to decide within a reasonable time K. and the first applicant on 12 January 1998 lodged a request for transfer of jurisdiction (Devolutionsantrag).
On 1 April 1998 the Supreme Land Reform Board (Oberster Agrarsenat) granted the request and assumed competence. By decision of 3 May 2000 it granted the appeal of 20 December 1984 and remitted the case to the District Authority.
As the District Authority failed to take a decision within the statutory period of six months, K. and the two applicants on 16 January 2001 lodged another request for the transfer of jurisdiction (Devolutionsantrag).
Having granted the request the Regional Agricultural Panel issued a new consolidation scheme on 26 September 2001. Subsequently the applicants lodged another appeal.
On 4 December 2002 the Supreme Land Reform Board dismissed the applicants’ appeal. Hence the applicants, on 29 January 2003, lodged a complaint with the .
On 30 September 2004 the  dealt with the applicants’ complaint. It found that the proceedings had lasted an unreasonably long time and that this constituted a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in this respect. However, it held also that for this reason alone it could not quash the impugned decision and dismissed the complaint. Upon the applicants’ request it referred the case to the .
On 24 February 2005 the , upholding the lower-instance decisions, dismissed the applicants’ complaint. It found that the consolidation proceedings were in conformity with the regulations as set out under the consolidation scheme and that the applicants had been duly compensated. As regards plot no. 278a which had initially been of inferior value it noted that in the meantime measures for improving its value by constructing an appropriate drainage system had been adopted. The decision was served on the applicants’ counsel on 18 March 2005.
On 8 May 2006 the applicants lodged public liability proceedings with a view to receiving reimbursement of the remaining difference between the compensation which had been granted by the Supreme Land Reform Board on 3 May 2005 and the amount claimed by them. According to the applicants’ allegations the proceedings are still pending before the .
In a different set of proceedings, on 8 January 2003 the applicants lodged a request for compensation under Section 27 § 9 of the Land Consolidation Act (Zusammenlegungsgesetz). They claimed loss of profits because for a period of some twenty-five years, the time of the provisional transfer of land, they had to cultivate land, in particular plot no. 278a, which was of inferior value and yielded less than their original plots.
On 25 May 2005 the Regional Agricultural Panel granted the applicants 4,282 Euros (EUR), rejecting any further requests. It found that it could not grant compensation for the period before the entering into force of Section 27 § 9 of the Land Consolidation Act in 1995. Thereupon the applicants appealed. On 7 December 2005 the Supreme Land Reform Board dismissed the applicants’ appeal.
On 1 March 2007 the  quashed the Supreme Land Reform Board’s decision and referred the case to the subordinate authorities. It found that from the object and purpose of the amendment of the Land Consolidation Act of 1995 it was evident that this amendment should also extend to compensation claims concerning losses incurred in years before that act had entered into force.
On 18 June 2007 the Supreme Land Reform Board partly granted the applicants’ appeal and awarded them EUR 21,719.17.
Land consolidation proceedings in Styria are regulated by the Land Consolidation Act of 1982 (Zusammenlegungsgesetz), a regional act (Landesgesetz) for Styria. Under this Act a party to consolidation proceedings is normally entitled to receive land corresponding in value to the land the party owned prior to the consolidation proceedings as compensation in kind. In exceptional cases compensation in kind is partly or fully replaced by compensation in money. The calculation of the compensation claims is specified in Section 27 of the Act. Section 27 § 9, introduced in 1995 (Regional Law Gazette no. 26/1995), provides for a special compensation claim in money in case compensation in kind had been calculated incorrectly. According to Section 27 § 10 the calculation of such compensation is based on the difference in profit drawn from farming of the land brought into the consolidation proceedings and the profit drawn from land which has been assigned in breach of the relevant provisions (gesetzwidrige Abfindung).
