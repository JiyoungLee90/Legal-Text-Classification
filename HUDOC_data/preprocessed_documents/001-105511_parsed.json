In cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of the situation (B. and D. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9303/81, Commission decision of 13\u00a0October 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 49, p. 44). The concept of a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State so as to render the applicant a victim (see, Montion v. France, no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14\u00a0May 1987, DR 52, p. 227, and Hilton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a012015/86, Commission decision of 6 July 1988, DR 57, p. 108). Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of (see D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38719/97, 26 June 2001).",

In that case the Court found that the main negative feature of each period of detention was different and therefore concluded that each period of detention referred to specific events which occurred on identifiable dates and could not therefore be construed as a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d (see I.D. v.\u00a0, cited above, \u00a7 30).

His complaints are similar for both detention facilities and he does not put an emphasis on any particular negative feature of his detention specific to a particular detention facility. In such circumstances, the Court considers it necessary to follow the approach taken in Guliyev and to conclude that in the present case the first two detentions amounted to a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d with the result that the six-month time-limit started running from the last day of the applicant\u2019s detention in Prison no. 13, that is, from 17 January 2007.

Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s description of the conditions of his detention was accurate and that they could potentially raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, it is to be observed that the applicant was only confined there for a period of twelve days. The Court therefore considers that in the particular circumstances of the case the applicant\u2019s alleged suffering did not attain the threshold of severity required by Article 3 of the Convention. In reaching this conclusion the Court pays attention, inter alia, to the applicant\u2019s age, sex and medical condition (see, among other authorities, Gorea v. , no. 21984/05, \u00a7 49, 17 July 2007).

Indeed, unlike the applicants in the above cases, the applicant in the present case did not have a permanent residence, a family or any other ties with . Moreover, the domestic courts\u2019 fear of the applicant\u2019s absconding appeared to have not been unreasonable, since after the applicant\u2019s release on 21 February 2007 he fled  and has not returned to date.

Thus, in the absence of any other evidence to the contrary, the Court shall consider 12 February 2007 as the date the applicant\u2019s appeal was lodged. Accordingly, the appeal was examined by the Court of Appeal nine days later and two hearings were necessary. The Court also notes that the first hearing took place three working days after the appeal was lodged and the second hearing took place two working days after the withdrawal of the initial panel of judges from the case.",

In that case the Court attached particular importance to the applicant\u2019s poor state of health and the absence of medical care in the remand centre. Since no similar circumstances were present in the present case and since the delay was considerably shorter, the Court considers it possible to distinguish it from Sarban. Although it would have been desirable for the Court of Appeal to act faster, the Court is prepared to accept that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 4 were not breached. It follows that this complaint must also be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

In the present case there were three separate detention periods with longer or shorter periods of liberty in between (see paragraph\u00a012 of the judgment). In the Guliyev case, the applicant was detained in two different facilities in immediate succession \u2013 that is, the Court was faced with the simple transfer of the applicant from one place to another. The question of how to apply the six-month rule did not arise in the same way as in the case before us. In the I.D. case, the different places of detention were characterised by different problems. Where the Court, as in the case before us, has gone so far as to say that the main criterion for a continuing situation is its character, even if the applicant\u2019s detention has not been continuous, I find it difficult to say that a three-week gap such as that between the second and the third period \u2013 as opposed to, for example, a seven-day gap \u2013 disqualifies the last period from being part of a continuing situation. Certainly, this was not the approach taken in the Guliyev case since the facts were different; it is thus difficult to consider that that case should provide the solution to be followed in our case. In any event, I find that the case-law on the question of what constitutes a continuing situation with respect to conditions in different detention facilities at different periods of time remains very unclear.",
