It considered that this could not be justified by the concomitant publication of these facts in a German magazine, or by the media impact caused by the content of the article, or by the fact that other publications had subsequently repeated these reports (which had become common knowledge through the fault of the publishing company), or by the alleged legitimacy of such a disclosure.

In the present case, the requirements of the protection of the Prince\u2019s private life and the debate on the future of the hereditary monarchy were thus in competition.

It also (contained) numerous digressions derived from the confessions made by the child\u2019s mother regarding the circumstances of their meeting, the (Prince\u2019s) feelings, his most intimate reactions in response to the news of the pregnancy and his attitude towards the child during private encounters in her flat\u201d. Such facts come within the sphere of private life. The majority does not contest this (see paragraph 63).",

For its part, the court of appeal noted that \u201calthough the photographs which ... showed the respondent with the child had been taken ... with the Prince\u2019s consent, he had not consented to their publication\u201d. The publication of photographs of the Prince in his role as the child\u2019s father not only strengthened the message in the article, but also added a separate dimension to it, considerably increasing the degree of intrusion into the Prince\u2019s private life.",

However, this seems to us of little importance in a case of this type, in which the invasion of privacy has been created through the disclosure of a fact that the person concerned wished to keep secret for some time longer.",

Apart from the fact that imputing a given motive to Ms C. amounts, to a certain extent, to speculation, we wonder what weight should be attached to the aim alleged pursued by Ms C. We note that, although the Prince had not yet \u201cpublicly\u201d recognised his child at the relevant time, Ms C.\u2019s own statements indicate that he had already formally recognised the child before a notary (see paragraph\u00a09).",

In addition, the reasons given by them are in our opinion relevant and seem sufficient to determine that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between, on the one hand, the restriction on that right in respect of the applicants, and, on the other, the protection of the Prince\u2019s right to respect for his private life.",
