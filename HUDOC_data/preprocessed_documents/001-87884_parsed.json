Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

In response to the findings in the medical reports, the Government claimed that the applicant had been injured as a result of a fall either from a bench or from \u201chis own height\u201d. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s explanation sits ill with the nature of the applicant\u2019s injuries as recorded in the medical reports. While the Court does not exclude the possibility of accidents occurring in detention, it does not find it convincing that the applicant could have sustained multiple haematomas and injuries on the left side of the chest and back and at the same time received injuries of the right leg and behind the right ear through a single accidental fall from a bench or from another height. The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant himself had cited a fall as a cause of his injuries. However, the Court has doubts about the credibility of the applicant\u2019s statements. It is not surprising that the applicant did not disclose the real cause of his injuries to the emergency doctors while still in the presence of the alleged offenders. The Court cannot rule out the possibility that the applicant felt intimidated by the persons he had accused of having ill-treated him (see Colibaba v. , no.\u00a029089/06, \u00a7\u00a049, 23\u00a0October 2007, and Bat\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, nos.\u00a033097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2004IV (extracts)). The Court must also have regard to the fact that the applicant, in his complaints to the prosecution authorities and later to the district and regional courts, was unequivocal in his account that he had been ill-treated by police officers during the arrest and while in custody. The applicant consistently denied the accuracy of the statement which he had made to the police and emergency doctors (see paragraphs 13 and 20 above).",

However, the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s injuries were caused by the treatment he underwent under the control of the authorities and the fact that the Government have not furnished any arguments which would provide a basis to explain or justify the force used make it unnecessary for the Court to inquire into the specific circumstances surrounding the use of violence against the applicant. The Court, nevertheless, considers it necessary to stress that it has never been argued that the applicant resisted arrest, attempted to escape or did not comply with lawful orders of the police officers. Furthermore, there is no indication that at any point during his arrest or subsequent detention at the police station he threatened the police officers, for example, by openly carrying a weapon or by attacking them (see, by contrast, Necdet Bulut v. Turkey, no.\u00a077092/01, \u00a7\u00a025, 20\u00a0November 2007, and Berli\u0144ski v. , nos.\u00a027715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7\u00a062, 20 June 2002). The Court therefore does not discern any necessity which might have prompted the use of violence against the applicant. It appears that the use of force was retaliatory in nature and was aimed at debasing the applicant and driving him into submission.

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. An obligation to investigate \u201cis not an obligation of result, but of means\u201d: not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimant\u2019s account of events; however, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v.

Firstly, no evaluation was carried out with respect to the quantity and nature of the applicant\u2019s injuries.\u00a0The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s mother asked for the applicant to be examined by a forensic doctor. The Court reiterates in this connection that proper medical examinations are an essential safeguard against ill-treatment. The forensic doctor must enjoy formal and de facto independence, have been provided with specialised training and been allocated a mandate which is broad in scope (see Akko\u00e7 v. , nos.\u00a022947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7\u00a055 and \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000X). In the instant case, the Court notes with regret that the assistant prosecutor omitted to request a medical examination of the applicant or at least to take statements from the emergency and hospital doctors attending the applicant. In delivering his decision of 10\u00a0November 2000, the assistant prosecutor did not even mention the medical reports which listed injuries sustained by the applicant. In this connection the Court is concerned that the lack of any \u201cobjective\u201d evidence - which medical reports could have been \u2013 was subsequently relied on by the assistant prosecutor as a ground for his decision not to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers (see paragraph 14 above).",

                                        "content": "44.\u00a0\u00a0Further, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s right to participate effectively in the investigation was not secured. It transpires from the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision of 10 November 2000 that the investigator did not hear the applicant in person and that he did not even consider mentioning his version of events in the decision. In fact, it is apparent from the decision of 10 November 2000 that the assistant prosecutor based his conclusions solely on the testimonies given by the police investigator who had been assigned to the applicant\u2019s criminal case and a police officer who had taken part in the applicant\u2019s arrest. The assistant prosecutor accepted too readily their denial that force had been used against the applicant.\u00a0The Court also cannot but note the glaring contradictions in the assistant prosecutor\u2019s findings and his selective and somewhat inconsistent approach to the assessment of evidence. Without statements from the truck drivers or the applicant or any evidence from independent sources the assistant prosecutor, nevertheless, assumed that the applicant could have sustained injuries in the fight with the truck drivers. The Court notes that while the assistant prosecutor may not have been provided with the names of individuals who may have witnessed the applicant\u2019s arrest at the bus stop on 29 October 2000 or who could have seen the applicant at the police station, he could have been expected to take steps of his own initiative to ascertain possible eyewitnesses. Furthermore, he took no meaningful measures to determine the identity of other police officers who had taken part in the applicant\u2019s arrest and his subsequent interrogation in the police station. The Court therefore finds that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s failure to look for corroborating evidence and his deferential attitude to the police officers must be considered to be a particularly serious shortcoming in the investigation (see Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI, \u00a7\u00a0106).",

As regards the judicial proceedings, the Court finds it striking that while dealing with the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment complaints the domestic courts considered it unnecessary to call on and take into account the medical reports pertaining to the applicant\u2019s injuries (see paragraphs 19-21 above). They concluded that the applicant\u2019s allegations were \u201cnot convincing\u201d by endorsing testimonies given by the police investigator and an emergency doctor. Neither the District nor Regional courts manifested interest in identifying and personally questioning eyewitnesses to the applicant\u2019s arrest and hearing the police officers involved in the incident (see Zelilof v. , no. 17060/03, \u00a7\u00a062, 24\u00a0May 2007 and Osman v. , no.\u00a043233/98, \u00a7\u00a075, 16 February 2006). For the Court, this unexplained shortcoming in the proceedings deprived the applicant of an opportunity to challenge effectively the alleged perpetrators\u2019 version of the events (see Kmetty v. , no.\u00a057967/00, \u00a7\u00a042, 16 December 2003). The Court also observes that the domestic courts paid no attention to the applicant\u2019s submission that he had had no choice but to cite a fall as a cause of his injuries while still in the hands of the persons who had ill-treated him. Both the District and Regional courts relied heavily on the assistant prosecutor\u2019s decision of 10 November 2000. In fact, it appears that the domestic authorities did not make any meaningful attempt to bring those responsible for the ill-treatment to account.",
