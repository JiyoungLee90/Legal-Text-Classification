The accused\u2019s attendance facilitated the proper administration of justice, was necessary to protect the interests of victims and witnesses, allowed sentences to be adapted to the individual offender and was essential if the sentence was to have a deterrent effect. Giving an accused a right to evade justice would seriously undermine the authority of the courts.",

The Belgian system struck a proper balance between the various interests requiring protection. Mrs Van Geyseghem had had four opportunities of submitting her defence. It had depended entirely on her whether she had the advantage of adversarial procedure on appeal; but she had repeatedly and deliberately obstructed the holding of adversarial proceedings and her conduct had amounted to an abuse of process. The right to be defended by a lawyer could not be absolute and therefore could not be relied upon if the defendant refused to appear on three occasions, as had happened in the instant case. In any event, a court giving judgment in absentia was under a duty to investigate the case and examine of its own motion all possible defences, including those relating to statutory limitation. That Mr\u00a0Verstraeten had been unable to represent his client and make submissions to the effect that the prosecution was time-barred had had no effect on the outcome of the proceedings. In conclusion, there had therefore been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.",

The legislature accordingly had to be able to discourage unjustified absences (see the Poitrimol judgment cited above, p. 15, \u00a7 35). In the other two cases, it stated however that it was also \u201cof crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended, both at first instance and on appeal, the more so if, as is the case under Netherlands law, no objection may be filed against a default judgment given on appeal\u201d (see the Lala and Pelladoah judgments cited above, p. 13, \u00a7 33, and pp. 34-35, \u00a7 40, respectively). The Court added that the latter interest prevailed and that consequently the fact that a defendant, in spite of having been properly summoned, does not appear, cannot \u2013 even in the absence of an excuse \u2013 justify depriving him of his right under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention to be defended by counsel (ibid.). It was for the courts to ensure that a trial was fair and, accordingly, that counsel who attended trial for the apparent purpose of defending the accused in his absence was given the opportunity to do so (ibid., p. 14, \u00a7 34, and p. 35, \u00a7 41).

The clause beginning with the adverbial phrase \u201cthe more so\u201d (see paragraph 33 above) was added as a secondary consideration. On the contrary, the Court stated that the interest in being adequately defended prevailed. The right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer is one of the basic features of a fair trial. An accused does not lose this right merely on account of not attending a court hearing. Even if the legislature must be able to discourage unjustified absences, it cannot penalise them by creating exceptions to the right to legal assistance. The legitimate requirement that defendants must attend court hearings can be satisfied by means other than deprivation of the right to be defended. The Court notes that Article 185 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 20 above) provides that in any event the Criminal Court may order an accused to attend and that no appeal lies against such a decision.

Mr Verstraeten intended to plead statutory limitation, an issue which the Court has described as crucial (see the Artico v. Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, p. 17, \u00a7 34). Even if, as the Government maintained, the Court of Appeal must have examined of its own motion the issue of statutory limitation, the fact remains that counsel\u2019s assistance is indispensable for resolving conflicts and his role is necessary in order for the rights of the defence to be exercised. Furthermore, it does not appear from the judgment of 4 October 1993 (see paragraph 17 above) that any ruling was given on the issue.",
