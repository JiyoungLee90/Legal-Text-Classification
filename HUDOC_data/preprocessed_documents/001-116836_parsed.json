The court\u2019s final decision [i.e. to suspend the witnessvictim\u2019s examination and replace it with the reading out of the statements she had made to the police and the investigating judge] was not arbitrary, but was made in the light of what had happened at a prior hearing which had also had to be suspended \u2013 for the same reason \u2013 and at which the psychological treatment of the victim had been ordered, the court\u2019s perception having been confirmed by a valuable therapeutic procedure, which nonetheless did not result in the victim overcoming her incapacity. Both the persistence in the witness\u2019s condition during the new hearing and the failure of the therapeutic procedure, which did not lead the court to feel optimistic in the short run (the proceedings concerning an accused person in prison on remand), justified the final decision to declare the victim\u2019s examination impracticable. The court had previously attempted \u2013 perhaps to the point of excess \u2013 to exhaust all remedies to obtain her statement. It had made use of all the psychological support that the presence of officials from the victims\u2019 service could provide to the witness, relaxation exercises during the trial, suspensions and recesses. It had also attempted, \u2013 as a kind of safety valve \u2013 to fragment her account regarding the most violent events and to redirect her attention to other events that had been less emotionally intense. The efforts were fruitless, however, and the witness\u2019s resolved will to collaborate was prevented by one of the most horrific cases of psychological annihilation of a victim that this court has ever witnessed in its long professional experience. The witness rightly started her statement by giving a detailed description of the evolution of her relationship with the accused, the process of rupture and how their personal relations had developed in its aftermath in the light of their common child. Her determination began to weaken when, with slightly shaking hands, she began to describe the assaults she had suffered on the second day. The shaking later developed into an uncontrollable trembling of her mouth and her entire body as soon as she started to describe the specific aggressions she had been subjected to. Whether she was encouraged to stand up, sit down, drink water or have her hands held, nothing was of the slightest help to calm her down. Only continuous breaks and recesses and an excessive effort on her part enabled her to make, in more that an hour, some progress in her statement, which came to a dramatic end as she was telling the court about the episode of a cold-water bath with which she had been tortured. Her testimony essentially corroborated her pre-trial statement and proved the authenticity of her post-traumatic stress, which was later confirmed by an expert report. The continuation of the witness\u2019s examination would have been incompatible with Article\u00a08 \u00a7 4 of the Protection of Victims Statute approved by a European Union Framework Decision of 15 March 2001, which states that \u2018Each Member State shall ensure that, where there is a need to protect a victim - particularly those most vulnerable - from the effects of giving evidence in open court, victims may, following a decision taken by the court, be entitled to testify in a manner which will enable this objective to be achieved, by any appropriate means compatible with its basic legal principles\u2019.\u201d",

Upon leaving the apartment, he had twice knocked a car belonging to J., a close male friend of N., causing damage to the vehicle. The court also found that on 6 April 2004 at around 1 a.m., the applicant had returned to N.\u2019s apartment and broken in through a window. Upon entering the apartment against N.\u2019s will, he had punched J., who had been there with N., and then hit N. repeatedly. It also found that the applicant had remained in N.\u2019s apartment for the next three hours against her will, had stubbed out a cigarette on N.\u2019s left hand and had threatened her with a penknife, with which he had cut her finger. He had prevented J. and N. from leaving the apartment unless they brought him his son, who had been staying elsewhere that night. The court also found that after those three hours had elapsed, the applicant had abducted N. He had forced her into his car after having ordered J. to take the child to an address which he would provide later by telephone. The applicant had driven N. to a petrol station where, with the assistance of two other people \u2013 who could not be identified \u2013 she had been immobilised, gagged and blindfolded before being introduced into another vehicle and driven to an apartment where she had been subjected to further aggressions. They had culminated in her hands and feet being tied, being immersed in icy water, thrown on a bed and raped vaginally and anally. Afterwards she had been obliged to phone J. and give him the address to which he should bring the child. At the time of the arranged meeting, the applicant had left the apartment for a short time in which N. had been given dry clothes by a hooded man who had left the room before the applicant had come back with J. and the child. They had remained together in the apartment for approximately an hour, after which the applicant had let them go under death threats. Lastly, the court found that, when the applicant had been arrested at Prat de Llobregat Airport (), he had been carrying false identification documents.",

The credibility of her testimony was enhanced by the weakness of the applicant\u2019s statement. The trial court also relied on other evidence. In his statement the applicant had admitted the veracity of the details in N.\u2019s account that did not have or had minor criminal implications, such as her changing into clothes belonging to him during her kidnapping, the damage inflicted on J.\u2019s car, and the fact that J. had eventually brought him his child at an absolutely inappropriate time. It also relied on J.\u2019s statement at the hearing; the contradictions of a hearsay witness for the defence as to the way in which the applicant had entered N.\u2019s apartment; a medical report stating that the bodily injuries presented by N. were fully consistent with the aggressions she had reported; the forensic medical opinion that the bodily injuries presented by the victim fifteen days after the facts were temporarily and causally consistent with the aggressions reported; the expert opinion that N. was suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder consistent with the facts reported; and, lastly, the court\u2019s direct assessment of N.\u2019s psychological inability to relive the facts that she had described \u2013 albeit only in part \u2013 at the hearing sufficiently accurately and coherently to evoke clearly what had actually happened. The court considered that the use as evidence of the victim\u2019s pre-trial statements had not infringed the applicant\u2019s right to defend himself, as that form of evidence had been introduced only once it had become clear that N.\u2019s cross-examination was impracticable and it had been open to challenge by the applicant during the hearing. The court further considered that the reliability of N.\u2019s statement had been enhanced when confronted with the applicant\u2019s implausible statement.",

Firstly, the Audiencia Provincial had decided not to pursue N.\u2019s cross-examination only once it had become clear that it would not be feasible to attempt to proceed. The trial court had first tried to resolve the problem by staying the hearing and ordering a medical examination of the witness with a view to excluding any possibility of feigning on her part and to adequately assess her apparent inability to give a statement before the court.When the same difficulties had recurred at the final hearing, the trial court had ordered that N. should be provided with medical support with a view to obtaining a direct testimony, which in the end proved impossible despite the efforts in that regard. Secondly, although the general rule was that witnesses should always be available for cross-examination at a hearing, the law permitted that pre-trial statements could be read out in the courtroom as an alternative when a witness\u2019s testimony could not be produced owing to circumstances beyond the parties\u2019 control, such as a physical or psychological impediment on the part of the witness to give a statement at the hearing, provided that the alleged impediment had been tested. Thirdly, the applicant\u2019s counsel had been duly summoned to the judicial interview with N. during the investigative stage of the proceedings, but had failed to attend without providing a justification.",

It further reiterated its advice that trial courts should identify further evidence to corroborate those statements so that they may assess them objectively. The trial courts should be satisfied that those statements have not been capriciously changed during the proceedings and that there are no prior relations between the victims and the accused that could put into question the credibility of their statement. In the light of those considerations, the Supreme Court was satisfied that the Audiencia Provincial had acted cautiously enough when assessing N.\u2019s statement, since it had relied on corroborating evidence to convict the applicant. The Supreme Court added that the delay with which N. had reported the facts to the police could be explained by her fear and by the fact that she had had a child with the applicant. It further contended that it did not find in N.\u2019s statement any alteration or substantial change which could be deemed as rendering it inconsistent and thus weakening its validity.",

It is also normally for the domestic courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness, since Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of the witness in the court (see S.N. v. , cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). The task of the Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 67, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, and Gossa v.

As a rule, those rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he or she was testifying or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Unterpertinger v. , 24 November 1986, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 110). When a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see, in particular, Luc\u00e0 v.

The first context concerns the case of so-called \u201canonymous witnesses\u201d, in which the identity of a witness is concealed in order, for instance, to protect him or her from intimidation or threats of reprisals (see, for example, Doorson, cited above). The second context concerns cases of \u201cabsent witnesses\u201d, where use is made in evidence of the statement of a witness who does not appear before the court to give evidence in person because he or she has died, cannot be traced or refuses to appear out of fear or for some other reason (see, for example, Craxi v. Italy (no. 1), no.\u00a034896/97, 5\u00a0December 2002, S.N. v. Sweden, cited above, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and 22228/06, ECHR 2011). Those categories are not mutually exclusive, since witnesses may be both anonymous and absent (see, for example, L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23\u00a0April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III). The third context concerns cases of witnesses who invoke their privilege against selfincrimination (see, for example, Vidgen v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a029353/06, 10 July 2012).",

Ukraine, no. 17444/04, \u00a7\u00a7 54-57, 21 October 2010; Caka v.\u00a0Albania, no. 44023/02, \u00a7\u00a7 112-16, 8 December 2009; Guilloury v.\u00a0France, no. 62236/00, \u00a7\u00a7 57-62, 22 June 2006; Luc\u00e0, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04043; and Vidgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46), and of the counterbalancing measures taken by the judicial authorities to compensate the handicaps under which the defence had laboured (see Doorson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073-76; S.N. v.

The Court has thus considered that where a conviction was based solely or decisively on evidence given by absent witnesses who had not been available for cross-examination by the defence, the admission as evidence of those hearsay statements will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1. In those cases, however, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable, given its importance in the case (ibid., \u00a7 147).",

He had been duly summoned to the interview but had failed to attend without providing a justification (see paragraph 9 above). It is thus clear that the applicant was given an opportunity to have N. examined but that his counsel unjustifiably missed that opportunity. The Court considers that the domestic authorities cannot be reproached on account of the investigating judge\u2019s decision to carry out the interview in the absence of the applicant\u2019s counsel.

As has already been said, the Court\u2019s role under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair. In the circumstances of the case, this requires that the Court examine whether positive steps were taken by the judicial authorities to enable the applicant to examine or have examined N. at the hearing, where evidence must be normally produced.",

Although a medical examination conducted before the final hearing took place established that N. was able to give evidence, N. broke down before the public prosecution had finished examining her. Only after countless unsuccessful efforts, including medical support, had been made to enable N. to continue with her statement, the court decided that her pre-trial statements would be read out as an alternative to direct cross-examination by the parties. The trial court took into account that N. would not be available for cross-examination within a reasonable time and that the applicant was in prison on remand. An expert report confirmed after the hearing that N. had been suffering from a posttraumatic stress disorder. In the light of the circumstances, the Court considers that the trial court cannot be accused of lack of diligence in its efforts to provide the defendant with an opportunity to examine the witness. Neither can the Court agree with the applicant\u2019s argument that the trial court unduly exempted N. from cross-examination.",

Thus, in many such cases the sole or decisive evidence for the defendant\u2019s conviction is the victim\u2019s statement, the truthfulness and credibility of which may be put in question by the defence at the hearing by means of his or her cross-examination.

The Court observes that those statements were read out before the trial court and that the applicant was allowed to challenge their truthfulness by giving his own account of the facts, which he duly did. The Court further observes that the domestic courts carefully compared both versions of the facts, which partially coincided, particularly those aspects that did not involve the commission of any criminal offence or that had minor criminal implications. They deemed the applicant\u2019s version weak and inconsistent, and that of N. logical and sufficiently detailed to eliminate any suspicion of simulation or revenge. The Court notes in this respect that the domestic courts also took into account the statement given by N. at the hearing which, although incomplete, served to corroborate her pre-trial statements (see paragraph 11 above). The reliability of N.\u2019s statements was further supported by indirect evidence, such as the fact that she had been abducted from her apartment by the applicant and that when she had been released by the applicant she had been wearing different clothes belonging to the latter, and by the medical opinions and reports confirming that her bodily injuries and psychological condition were consistent with her account of the facts (see paragraph 15 above). Indeed, the use of all this corroborating evidence led the Supreme Court to conclude that the trial court had acted cautiously enough in the treatment of N.\u2019s statements (see paragraph 18 above).",
