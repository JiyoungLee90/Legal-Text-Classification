The second type is in ordinary prisons, where convicted prisoners are accommodated. Once sentenced to a prison term a convict is not transferred to a prison automatically, but only on the basis of a specific order, and on his or her admission to a prison an individual prison regime and programme is set up (see Dervishi v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7 67, 7\u00a0April 2005). It remains to be ascertained whether the domestic authorities established and convincingly demonstrated the existence of specific facts in support of their conclusions.",

However, they did not refer to any specific final judgment finding the applicant guilty, but in some of the decisions extending his detention relied on the fact that parallel criminal proceedings were pending before some other courts. However, as there was no formal finding of a previous crime in a final conviction, the principle of the presumption of innocence demands that merely pending proceedings could not be referred to as a proof of one\u2019s propensity to commit criminal offences.

However, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the accused\u2019s release would actually disturb public order.

However, the Court notes that the practice of the Constitutional Court is to declare inadmissible each constitutional complaint where, before it has given its decision, a fresh decision extending detention has been adopted in the meantime. Thus, the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint of 22\u00a0January 2009 against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 14 January 2009 was declared inadmissible by the Constitutional Court on such grounds on 19\u00a0February 2009 (see paragraph 51 above). The same is true for the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 28\u00a0September 2009, declared inadmissible on 15 December 2009 (see paragraph 68 above); and the constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 16 December 2009, declared inadmissible on 25\u00a0February 2010 (see paragraph 73 above). The Court therefore has to address the question of the compliance of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
