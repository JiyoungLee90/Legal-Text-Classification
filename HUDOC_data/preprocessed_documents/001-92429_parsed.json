Belgium, no. 8403/78, Commission decision of 15\u00a0October 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 27, p.\u00a061; Foucher v.\u00a0France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, \u00a7\u00a034; and Bulut v.

(extracts)). In particular the Court held in that judgment that, unless the contrary is shown on the facts of a specific case, it cannot be assumed that there remains a continuing and actual public interest in imposing limitations on access to materials classified as confidential under former regimes. This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies, the selection and disclosure of which documents is at the discretion of the current security service. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, the possibility of his or her contradicting the security agency\u2019s version of the facts will be severely curtailed.",

The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depends to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remain classified as secret and the decision to maintain their confidentiality falls within the powers of the current secret services, creates a situation in which the lustrated person is put at a clear disadvantage.",

The purpose of lustration was to prevent people who had collaborated with the communist secret services in the past from holding public office. In her case, the institution of the lustration proceedings had been unjustified, because when the 1997\u00a0Act had entered into force she no longer occupied a judicial post. Hence, none of the reasons for which the Lustration Act had been enacted, namely to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they could not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, had applied to her situation. The fact that she had been deprived of her status as a retired judge had to be regarded as an act of a punitive character, incompatible with the abovementioned 1996 Resolution.",

No one could reasonably contest after 1996 that Poland was a stable and relatively mature democracy, no longer threatened by the possibility of a post-communist coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Therefore, the severity and scope of acceptable lustration measures adopted in 1997 should have been less than what might have been acceptable in the early 1990s. In any event, in 1997 and later, the subjection to this requirement of retired judges, who no longer decided cases, could not be justified by the need to secure a new democracy.",

In rejecting the applications, the Commission recalled that Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 could not be interpreted as conferring a right to a pension of a particular amount and noted that, although being deprived of their special social insurance benefits, the applicants had retained their rights to their ordinary retirement benefits due under the general social insurance system. It was observed that the 1991 Act was partly intended as a condemnation of the political role which the communist security service had played in repressing political opposition to the communist system and that such considerations of public policy, even if they resulted in the reduction of social insurance benefits, did not affect the property rights stemming from the social insurance system in a manner contrary to Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a0I. (see Styk v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a028356/95, 16\u00a0April 1998; Szumilas v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no\u00a035187/97, 1\u00a0July 1998; Bie\u0144kowski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a033889/97, 9 September 1998).

The Court recalls in this regard that, although Article\u00a01 contains no explicit procedural requirements, an applicant who is liable to be deprived of property rights must be afforded a reasonable opportunity of putting his or her case (see, AGOSI v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 24\u00a0October 1986, \u00a7\u00a055). The Court has found above that the applicant was not deprived of a property right. Insofar as the applicant complains that the procedures which led to the finding by the National Judicial Council that she had submitted a false declaration were unfair, and that she was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to assert her claim to retain her special status and retirement pension, the Court considers that the complaint is directly connected with that already examined under Article 6 of the Convention. Having regard to its conclusion that there was an infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that it is not necessary to examine the applicant\u2019s further complaint based on Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see, for example, Glod v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a041134/98, \u00a7 46, 16\u00a0September 2003; Albina v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a057808/00, \u00a7\u00a043, 28 April 2005; Mitrevski v.\u00a0The , no.\u00a033046/02, \u00a7\u00a041, 21\u00a0June 2007).",
