Greece, no.\u00a018785/13, \u00a7 68, 27\u00a0November 2014). This positive obligation requires that the manner and method of the execution of the measures taken do not subject those concerned to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Mouisel v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a067263/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002-IX).",

France, no.\u00a010401/12, \u00a7\u00a048, 19 February 2015). The Court requires, firstly, that appropriate medical support be available to the patient and that the medical treatment prescribed be relevant to his or her particular situation (see Gorodnichev v. Russia, no.\u00a052058/99, \u00a7\u00a091, 24\u00a0May 2007). In addition, the diligence and frequency with which medical care is provided to the individual concerned are two aspects to be taken into consideration in assessing whether the treatment is compatible with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. These two aspects are not assessed by the Court in absolute terms; rather, it takes account in each case of the prisoner\u2019s particular state of health. In general, deterioration in the prisoner\u2019s health does not in itself pay a decisive role as regards compliance with Article\u00a03 of the Convention. The Court will examine in each case whether the deterioration in the applicant\u2019s health was attributable to shortcomings in the medical care provided (see Cirillo v. Italy, no.\u00a036276/10, \u00a7\u00a037, 29 January 2013).",

The Court considers, firstly, that the requirements on a State with regard to detainees\u2019 health could differ depending on whether the disease contracted was transmissible (see, for example, F\u0171l\u00f6p v. Romania, no.\u00a018999/04, \u00a7\u00a034, 24\u00a0July 2012, and Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a023204/07, \u00a7 86, 3 March 2009, in which the applicants alleged that they had contracted tuberculosis in prison) or non-transmissible (see the case of Iamandi v. Romania, no.\u00a025867/03, \u00a7\u00a065, 1\u00a0June 2010, in which the applicant suffered from diabetes). The Court considers that the spread of transmissible diseases and, in particular, of tuberculosis, hepatitis and HIV/Aids, should be a public health concern, especially in the prison environment. On this matter, the Court considers it desirable that, with their consent, detainees can have access, within a reasonable time after their admission to prison, to free screening tests for hepatitis and HIV/Aids (see, to this effect, Jeladze v. Georgia, no.\u00a01871/08, \u00a7\u00a044, 18\u00a0December 2012, in which the Court held that a three-year delay before submitting the applicant to screening for hepatitis C amounted to negligence on the part of the State in respect of its general obligations to take effective measures to prevent the transmission of hepatitis\u00a0C or other transmissible diseases in prison). Such a possibility could have had consequences for the burden of proof. No such opportunity having been available to the applicant, the Court must examine the allegations that he contracted hepatitis C in prison in the light of the evidence adduced by him.",

According to the documents in the Court\u2019s case file, no blood test was carried out when the applicant entered prison to establish whether he was carrying the hepatitis C virus. Furthermore, according to the Government\u2019s assertions, which have not been contested by the applicant, his statements were taken into account when the above-mentioned medical report was prepared. In consequence, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s allegations that he contracted hepatitis C in prison are not substantiated by sufficient evidence (see Vartic v. Romania (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a014150/08, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, 17\u00a0December 2013). Moreover, there is no evidence in the case file pointing to the time or the manner of the applicant\u2019s contamination with hepatitis C (see Ghavtadze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079). Accordingly, although the disease in question was diagnosed while the applicant was under the State\u2019s responsibility, the Court cannot deduce from that circumstance that the disease developed as a result of a failure on the State\u2019s part to honour its positive obligations.",
