Equally, it had been established that the risk connected with the accumulation of heavy elements or cyanide could persist for twenty to fifty years and was likely to infringe the right of the area\u2019s inhabitants to a healthy environment.

Law no. 6384 provided for the establishment of a Compensation Commission empowered to award compensation to individuals to deal with the Convention complaints falling within its scope (see Sayan v.

However, in the circumstances of the present case, the award of compensation would not be a sufficient redress for the applicants\u2019 Convention grievances since their complaint pertains to the nonenforcement of binding final judicial decisions to stop the operation of Ovac\u0131k gold mine (see Okyay and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 36220/97, 17 January 2002). Besides, the Turkish Government did not submit any decision showing that recourse to the Compensation Commission had led to the cessation of the activities of a gold mine or a similar mining or industrial activities in respect of which national courts had annulled operation permits. Against this background, the Court finds that the applicants were not required to apply to the Compensation Commission set up by Law no. 6384.
