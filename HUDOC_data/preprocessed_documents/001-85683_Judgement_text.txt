Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. On 11 October 2005 the Court put additional questions to the parties.
The applicant, Mr Viktor Vasylyovych Ponomaryov, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1953 and lives in the village of Rogan, Kharkiv region, .
On 18 February 1991 the applicant was dismissed from the State-owned farm KhTZ.

On 10 February 2004 the defendant Company again lodged an appeal against the judgment of 5 October 2001. It also requested that the time-limit for the appeal be renewed, on the ground that at the time of the impugned judgment of the first-instance court it had been in a difficult economic situation and had been using all its funds to pay off debts to avoid insolvency and, therefore, it had not been able to afford the court fees for an appeal.

On 1 March 2006 the Kharkiv Court of Appeal issued a new decision along the same lines as its previous decision of 21 April 2004.

The Act (Закон України “Про введення мораторiю на примусову реалiзацiю майна”) aims at protecting State interests in the sale of assets belonging to undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital. A moratorium on the enforcement of judgment debts has been introduced until such time as the mechanism for the forced sale of the property of such undertakings has been improved. No time-limit has been set. Section 2 of that Act provides that the prohibition on the forced sale of property includes the execution of writs by the State Bailiffs’ Service on property belonging to such companies. The Act therefore stays the execution of all writs by the State Bailiffs’ Service against the assets of undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital.
Under section 2 of the Act (Закон України “Про виконавче провадження”), the enforcement of judgments is entrusted to the State Bailiffs’ Service. Under section 85 of the Act, a creditor may make a complaint against actions or omissions of the State Bailiffs’ Service with the head of the competent department of that Service or with a local court. Section 86 of the Act entitles a creditor to institute court proceedings against a legal person, entrusted with the enforcement of a judgment, for the inadequate enforcement or non-enforcement of that judgment, and to receive compensation.
Section 11 of the Act (Закон України “Про державну виконавчу службу”) provides for the liability of bailiffs for any inadequate performance of their duties, and compensation for damage caused by a bailiff when enforcing a judgment. Under section 13 of the Act, acts and omissions of the bailiff can be challenged before a superior official or the courts.
Article 68 of the Code provided for delayed payment of the court fees or their payment by instalments. These methods of court fee payment could be allowed by a judge with regard to the property status of a party. Such an extension or delay in payment could be granted for a maximum period of three months.
Article 89 of the Code provided that the procedural time-limits could be extended or renewed if the court found valid reasons for such an extension or renewal. A refusal to renew a time-limit was subject to appeal.
Article 292 of the Code provided for a one-month period for lodging appeals against decisions of the first-instance court and a fifteen-day period for appeal against its rulings. It further provided that these periods could be renewed if the court found valid reasons for their renewal.
The new Code of Civil Procedure, as well as the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Code of Administrative Justice provide similar provisions as to the renewal of the procedural time-limits. The Code of Commercial Procedure, however, limits the possibility of renewal to three months.
