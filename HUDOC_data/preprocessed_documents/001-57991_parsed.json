As far as the child was concerned, Mr Boughanemi had not formally recognised him until 5 April 1994, ten months after his birth - on 19 June 1993 - although under French law he could have done so even before the birth and without the mother\u2019s being able to prevent him.  Nor had the applicant indicated that the child\u2019s birth was imminent in his application lodged with the Commission on 3 June 1993; he had mentioned the birth for the first time in his observations of 5 May 1994.  Furthermore no relationship that could have been compromised by the deportation had developed between the applicant and his son.  Finally, Mr Boughanemi had not shown that he provided for his son, or that he contributed to his education or that he enjoyed parental rights.",

A source of embarrassment since it obliges the Court to make well-nigh impossible comparisons between the merits of the case before it and those which it has already decided. It is - to say the least - far from easy to compare the cases of Moustaquim v. Belgium (judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 193), Beldjoudi v. France (judgment of 26 March 1992, Series A no. 234-A), Nasri v. France (judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 320-B) and Boughanemi v. France.  Should one just make a comparison based on the number of convictions and the severity of sentences or should one also take into account personal circumstances ? The majority has, obviously, opted for the latter approach and has felt able to make the comparison , but - with due respect - I cannot help feeling that the outcome is necessarily tainted with arbitrariness.",

I argued in favour of that approach in my concurring opinion in Beldjoudi .  This approach has, moreover, been advocated by Judges De Meyer, Morenilla  and Wildhaber.  In my opinion the Court would already considerably improve its doctrine if it accepted this approach. I very much hope that the wording of paragraph 42 of the Court\u2019s judgment - where it refers to \"the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life\" - shows the Court\u2019s willingness to do so.",

Judges De Meyer and Morenilla start from the idea that integrated aliens - that is, aliens who have lived all, or practically all, their lives within a State - should no more be expelled than nationals.  Expulsion of nationals is forbidden by Article 3 para. 1 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-3-1), and Judges De Meyer and Morenilla assert that expulsion of integrated aliens is forbidden under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.  Accepting this thesis would, obviously, remove all uncertainty since Article 3 (art. 3) does not allow exceptions. Under this approach expulsion of an integrated alien per se constitutes a violation, whatever the crimes committed.",

I have the feeling that Judge Wildhaber\u2019s concurring opinion in the Nasri case  goes in the same direction, although he would probably be inclined to be less severe as to what comes within the scope of the exception.",
