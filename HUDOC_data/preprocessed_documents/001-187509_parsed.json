Therefore, in line with section 145 of Law\u00a030/1992 and the relevant subordinate legislation, within such proceedings neither the authorities nor civil servants could be sued nor, accordingly, could they be a party to the proceedings. The national legislature had set up liability proceedings against the public administration excluding the possibility of its authorities or staff becoming interested parties to them even though in all cases the public officials concerned were identifiable; their professional conduct was being judged and hence their honour and moral integrity could eventually be affected; there was a possibility that the administration concerned would institute a \u201crecovery action\u201d against them; and the administrative or judicial decisions were subject to potential media coverage.",

Lastly, the court stated that the public official concerned would only be considered to be an interested party in a recovery action (acci\u00f3n de repetici\u00f3n) under section 145(2) of Law 30/1992, in which each and every one of the elements constituting the liability for which recovery was sought could be contested, including the acts attributed to him or her.",

The restriction on public officials being a party to such (administrative or judicial) proceedings was however justified by the special nature, purpose and scope of liability proceedings brought against the public administration. According to the court, such proceedings were set up to facilitate redress and compensation for those affected by the acts of public officials. Otherwise, the proceedings would require each and every public official concerned (including, for example, the school management board and education inspectorate, or doctors, nurses, porters and so forth in cases related to healthcare) to be summoned to appear in proceedings in their own defence and with their own representatives, contrary to the regulatory developments, that essentially simplified the proceedings for the benefit of those injured or affected by the public administration.",

The national courts justified such restrictions by the special nature, purpose and scope of that type of proceedings. As described in paragraphs 13 and 19 above, the courts held that such proceedings solely concerned the public administration\u2019s strict liability for the \u201cnormal or abnormal\u201d functioning of public services. Therefore, the rights and legitimate interests affected were those of the injured party who brought the action to obtain compensation for damage sustained as a result of acts by public officials in the exercise of their duties. The possible liability of the public officials who had intervened in the situation at stake or had allegedly caused damage was not the subject of the proceedings, and consequently they could not participate in them. It was only the public administration concerned which was obliged to pay compensation as a result of the administrative or judicial decision, which was why it was the only party responsible for defending its acts and, therefore, the acts of its authorities and staff. A declaration of liability of the public administration did not entail any automatic benefit or damage to the public officials\u2019 rights. Hence, according to the courts, the applicant could have defended himself in person and contested all the constituent elements of liability, including the acts attributed to him, in a possible recovery action (acci\u00f3n de repetici\u00f3n) under section 145(2) of Law 30/1992. As the Constitutional Court noted, neither the reasoning nor the statement of facts set out in liability proceedings against the public administration had under any circumstances the force of res judicata with regard to subsequent proceedings judging the liability of the public official concerned.",

The Court is of the opinion that in the instant case it can reasonably be supposed that the applicant could not have foreseen the consequences that the judgment of the High Court of Justice entailed for him. On the one hand, he was reportedly unaware of the proceedings. He had not been summoned to appear and was not a party to the proceedings, which in addition were solely aimed at determining the strict liability of the public administration concerned as a result of professional acts and omissions by public officials in the exercise of their duties. Furthermore, the complaint lodged against him by his colleague for psychological harassment in the workplace had been previously dismissed (see paragraph 6 above), and the colleague concerned had not taken further action against him. The Court also lays emphasis on the fact that the applicant was never charged with or proved to have committed any criminal offence. It follows that the disclosure of the applicant\u2019s identity in the reasoning of the judgment of the High Court of Justice cannot be considered to be a foreseeable consequence of the applicant\u2019s own doing.",

It means that he would not have been aware of the proceedings until around a month after the judgment had been rendered. That is, more than five years after the complaint against the applicant had been dismissed by the competent education authorities (see paragraph 6 above) and after his colleague had filed a claim requesting that the administration be found liable for alleged psychological harassment in the workplace (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above). Nor does it emerge from any of the documents in the case file that the applicant was informed, questioned, summoned or in any other way notified by any other domestic authority of her colleague\u2019s latter complaint. The Court further observes that his colleague did not reportedly take any (criminal or other) judicial action against the applicant after the complaint of harassment lodged with the education authorities had been dismissed. Accordingly, the applicant did not have the opportunity to request the non-disclosure of his identity or personal information by the High Court of Justice before its judgment was passed. The interference with the applicant\u2019s private life was thus not accompanied by effective and adequate safeguards.",

The High Court of Justice\u2019s judgment itself made reference to its own publication.

The manner in which the media had access to the information has not been established. Nonetheless, the case had a significant impact and repercussions in media.

Therefore, once the judgment was delivered, the access to the judgment was beyond the control of the High Court of Justice.
