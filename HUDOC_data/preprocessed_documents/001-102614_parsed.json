The Court further observes that by virtue of the judgment of 7 December 2000 the applicant's food allowance was considerably increased and he received a lump sum relating to compensation for health damage. The quashing of the enforceable judgment frustrated the applicant's reliance on a binding judicial decision and deprived him of an opportunity to receive the money he had legitimately expected to receive. Furthermore, following the quashing, on 3 April 2003, as upheld on 3 June 2003, the domestic court ordered the applicant to return to the respondent authority the amount he had already received pursuant to the judgment of 7 December 2000, and the applicant reimbursed the respective sum to the Welfare Office. In these circumstances, even assuming that the interference was lawful and pursued a legitimate aim, the Court considers that the quashing of the enforceable judgment of 7 December 2000 by way of supervisory review placed an excessive burden on the applicant and was incompatible with Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",
