The first-instance court took into consideration in its judgment, inter alia, the document dated 20\u00a0March 1999. The court considered that, by refusing to give any information to the police except for the details of his identity, to make statements or to sign the document drawn up by the police officers, the applicant had acted as a member of an illegal organisation. The court further noted that the applicant had participated in a number of demonstrations in support of the PKK and that his fingerprints had been found on the paper used for wrapping two Molotov cocktails thrown into a supermarket on 24\u00a0February 1999. The first-instance court also established, in the light of the police statements of one of the accused, V.\u0130., that the applicant had ordered V.\u0130. to rent a flat where the police had found several explosives put there by the applicant. Taking into account the length of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand and the fact that he was a student and had a fixed domicile, the first-instance court ordered his release from prison.",
