The Court has accepted on a number of occasions that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems (see the following judgments: Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 33, \u00a7 61; Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, Series A no.\u00a0300-A, p. 27, \u00a7 58; Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2282, \u00a7 78; Sak\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, 26 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, pp. 2623-24, \u00a7 44; and Demir and Others v. Turkey, 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2653, \u00a7 41). That does not mean, however, that the authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 to arrest suspects and detain them in police custody, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, in the final instance, by the Convention's supervisory institutions, whenever they consider that there has been a terrorist offence (see, among other authorities, Demir and Others, ibid.).",

That refusal was set aside by the National Security Court on the basis of Legislative Decree no. 430.",

It further considers that handing a remand prisoner over to gendarmes for questioning amounts to circumventing the applicable legislation on the periods that may be spent in police custody. That was what happened in the applicant's case when he was subjected to further questioning a few hours after being placed in pre-trial detention. Furthermore, his detention in the gendarmes' custody was extended until 12\u00a0December 2001 for no apparent reason. That in itself must be regarded as a breach of the requirements of lawfulness in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention since all the safeguards that should be provided during questioning, especially access to legal advice, were rendered inoperative.",
