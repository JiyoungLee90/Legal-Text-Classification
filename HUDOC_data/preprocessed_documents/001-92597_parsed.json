The letter then referred to the results of expert examination no. 615-C conducted on 12 September 2002 and stated that the above hypothesis had proved to be unfounded. The experts had found fragments of detonating devices for artillery shells of 122-mm calibre in the shell craters, but it had been established that those shells had been transformed into home-made explosive devices and dug into the ground by members of illegal armed groups rather then launched from artillery ordnance. Moreover, the federal troops stationed in Khankala had not conducted any artillery shelling on 7\u00a0September 2002 and, in any event, they had no shells of 122-mm calibre. The letter concluded that \u201cthe series of explosions\u201d in Chechen-Aul was due to \u201cterrorist activities of members of illegal armed groups, who had buried and then blown up the explosive devices\u201d, but not to artillery shelling by the federal military forces.

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324, and Andronicou and Constantinou v.

It is clear from the documents submitted by the Government that the assumption of military involvement in the artillery shelling of the applicants\u2019 house was again used by the investigators as a working hypothesis in 2003 (see paragraphs 54 and 58 above). It appears that this version has not been dismissed as implausible by the investigators to date. The Court considers therefore that implication of federal troops in the crime has not been disproven throughout the proceedings. In such circumstances it is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s assertion that the investigators merely cited in the official documents the applicants\u2019 allegations that the  had been fired at by the artillery on 7 September 2002.",

However, it remains unknown what authority established the military commission and on what date its report was drawn up. The Court is thus disinclined to consider this document as irrefutable evidence to support the allegation that the Taysumovs\u2019 house had been destroyed by self-made explosive devices rather than by artillery shelling. Moreover, it is not convinced by the assertion that the military units had not possessed ammunition of the type found at the scene of the incident, as it has not been provided with a copy of the report on the explosives examination referred to by the Government (see paragraph 77 above).",

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7 88, ECHR 1999III). In particular, there is an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, 2\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-04, Reports 1998VI, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, ECHR 2000-III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case.
