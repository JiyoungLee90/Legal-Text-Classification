They contended that the national courts had dealt with the case without unreasonable delay and had given their decisions within a reasonable time within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Government submitted that the duration of the proceedings was, to some extent, due to the workload of the national judges dealing with the applicant\u2019s case. They also pointed out that between 4 May and 1 June 1992, 9 November and 14 December 1992, and 4 November 1994 and 16 January 1995 the judge of the District Court was absent due to illness. This fact did not, however, affect the length of the proceedings. Moreover, it would not have been reasonable to replace the judge because of the complexity of the matter. A new judge would have had spent a considerable time to acquaint himself with the case. The Government further contended that the applicant\u2019s lawyer had contributed substantially to the overall length of the proceedings by his unprofessional and incompetent conduct when he had not acted, on several occasions, upon the advice or instructions of the judge of the District Court. The Government referred particularly to the amended claim which the applicant had been requested to submit. They noted that the latter\u2019s amended claim had been presented improperly on 16 February 1994. His rectified amended claim submitted on 19 August 1994 had not complied with the procedural requirements. It had contained only a copy of the original claim in which the new defendant had not been mentioned. Despite the advice of the judge on 25 November 1994, the applicant\u2019s lawyer had insisted on maintaining the claim. The Government also contended that the applicant\u2019s lawyer had failed to inform the District Court about the death of one of the co-plaintiffs.",
