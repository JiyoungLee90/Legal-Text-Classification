On 2 February 2001 the applicant\u2019s lawyer O. Kh. had requested a medical examination of the applicant on account of his allegations of ill-treatment, but this request had remained unanswered. He argued that following the removal of his lawyer and further intimidation by the investigative authorities he was afraid to complain about the ill-treatment and did so only after he felt he was in relative safety. When he did complain about ill-treatment in March 2001 the authorities had conducted an investigation in the framework of the criminal proceedings against him and therefore he had raised his complaints of illtreatment before the trial court, which was competent to act on those complaints. That practice was recommended by the Resolution of 25\u00a0March 1988 issued by the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Ukraine (see paragraph 53 above).",

The prosecutor\u2019s decision of 28 February 2001 referred only to the fact that, during questioning on 9 February, that is, prior to his wife\u2019s complaint of 12\u00a0February, the applicant had denied having any injuries. Furthermore, none of the alleged perpetrators of the offence were questioned at that time. In this connection the Court cannot agree with the Government that the applicant\u2019s wife, in February 2001, and the applicant himself, in March 2001, provided information of so general a nature that the identity of the alleged perpetrators could not be established. In her complaint of 12\u00a0February the applicant\u2019s wife referred to the investigating prosecutor G. and unnamed officers of the Kharkivsky District Police Department.

France, no. 29731/96, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-II). Furthermore, Article 6 may also be relevant before a case is sent for trial and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with it (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, \u00a7 36, and \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2005...). The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) are applied during the investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings and the facts of the case. Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports 1996I, pp. 54-55, \u00a7 63, and \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7 131).",

As can be seen from the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure cited in the Domestic Law part, there is a limited number of situations in which the legal representation of the suspect is obligatory. One of the grounds for obligatory representation is the seriousness of the crime of which a person is suspected, and hence the possibility of life imprisonment as a punishment. In the present case the law-enforcement authorities, investigating the violent death of a person, initiated criminal proceedings for infliction of grievous bodily harm causing death rather than for murder. The former was a less serious crime and therefore did not require the obligatory legal representation of a suspect. Immediately after the confession was obtained, the crime was reclassified as, and the applicant was charged with, murder.",

It may be recalled that the applicant had a lawyer in the existing criminal proceedings, yet waived his right to be represented during his questioning for another offence. These circumstances give rise to strong suspicion as to the existence of an ulterior purpose in the initial classification of the offence. The fact that the applicant made confessions without a lawyer being present and retracted them immediately in the lawyer\u2019s presence demonstrates the vulnerability of his position and the real need for appropriate legal assistance, which he was effectively denied on 1 February 2001 owing to the way in which the police investigator exercised his discretionary power concerning the classification of the investigated crime.",
