In particular, he argued that the police had started to search for him on the morning of 19 November 2005, when it had been discovered that he had not returned to prison the previous evening. Two police officers had immediately been sent to his parents\u2019 home to look for him.

The kind of investigation that will achieve those purposes may vary according to the circumstances. However, whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when, strictly speaking, no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that torture or ill-treatment has been used (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zbey v. Turkey (dec.), no. 31883/96, 8 March 2001). The authorities must take into account the particularly vulnerable situation of victims of torture and the fact that people who have been subjected to serious ill-treatment will often be less ready or willing to make a complaint (see Aksoy v.

No traces of alcohol or drugs were found in his blood at the time he was admitted to hospital (see paragraph 12 above). In such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s allegation that the two nights he had spent in the open air were the result of having been assaulted on 19\u00a0November 2005 does appear to be arguable.
