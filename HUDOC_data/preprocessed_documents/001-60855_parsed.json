The applicant filed the present application against these interlocutory proceedings on 21 January 2000. There followed another application by the applicant lodged with the Court on 17 May 2000 (no.\u00a060804/00), whereby he complained that his trial was in breach of his right under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 to a fair hearing.",

The Vaseline so extracted was separately preserved by that expert in a tube which was produced as an exhibit before the Court. Consequently such an expertise would have been ineffective.

The other elements consisted of the evidence of two witnesses to whom the complainant made her first complaint soon after the incident of rape for which the applicant was found guilty. The Assize Court also accepted the evidence of these witnesses as credible. (According to Cyprus legislation, the first complaint is evidence of the truth of the matters stated therein.)\u201d",
