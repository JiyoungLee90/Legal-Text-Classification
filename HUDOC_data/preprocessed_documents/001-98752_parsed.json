The Court reiterates in this connection that, whereas the right of a foreigner to enter or remain in a country is not as such guaranteed by the Convention, immigration controls must be exercised consistently with Convention obligations (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, Series A no. 94). Thus, in the context of freedom of religion, in its judgment in the case of Perry v.

More recently, the Court examined a ban imposed by the Portuguese authorities on a ship whose crew was about to launch a campaign in  in favour of the decriminalisation of abortion. The ban which effectively prevented the ship from entering Portuguese territorial waters was held by the Court to amount to an interference with the applicants' right to freedom of expression (see Women On Waves and Others v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly.

In this connection the Court has consistently held that Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the need for interference, but this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, whose extent will vary according to the case. Where, as in the instant case, there has been an interference with the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in paragraph 1 of Article\u00a010, the supervision must be strict, because of the importance of the rights in question; the importance of these rights has been stressed by the Court many times.
