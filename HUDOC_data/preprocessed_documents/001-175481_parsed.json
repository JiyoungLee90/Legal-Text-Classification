It further ordered that the three younger children were to spend weekends with their mother in the following manner: from Friday after school to Sunday afternoon, and every other weekend from Friday after school to Sunday evening. The eldest son, who had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, was to go to a day centre for children with special needs after school, and he was free to choose which parent he wanted to stay with at night. The court also ordered that during the approaching Christmas holidays the children were to spend a week with their father and the following week with their mother.",

This exercise, carried out in the period between January and May 2011, showed that compliance with the court order of 6 December 2010 was rather good. After certain difficulties initially, the three younger children adapted quite well to their new schedule and accepted their new rhythm of life, which was more regular and settled. Dr C.\u2019s report further mentioned that the children continued to experience psychological discomfort, partly owing to the difficult family situation (acute tensions and conflict between the parents), partly owing to their age (two children were approaching adolescence), and partly owing to M.G.\u2019s actions (her continuing to \u201cuse\u201d the children as \u201cinstruments\u201d in her dispute with the applicant). Despite the remaining difficulties in the relationship between the children and their parents, the arrangement of the children\u2019s life at that stage was assessed by the expert as being the best possible from a psychological and material point of view. The main problems which came to light during the monitoring exercise were: the situation of the applicant\u2019s eldest son, who was not receiving therapy for his condition; the behaviour of M.G., who was unpredictable and eccentric and motivated by a paranoid delusion that she was a victim of plotting and persecution by the court and state institutions in general, and who gave the impression that she was suffering mentally; and M.G.\u2019s relationship with the children, in particular, her attempts to involve the children in judicial proceedings and seek \u201callies\u201d in them against the father, who she represented as cruel, dangerous and violent, all of which was harming the psychological well-being of the children. In the expert\u2019s opinion, in order to prevent further psychological trauma being inflicted on the children by the mother\u2019s behaviour, it was necessary not only to put a distance between her and the children, but also to have recourse to psychotherapy and improve the quality of the children\u2019s psychological environment at their father\u2019s home.",

In particular, it found that the eldest son had been living with her during the previous months. As he had refused to see his father, she had been the only parent who had had effective access to him. However, she had refused to bring him to the monitoring meetings with social services or ensure his attendance at the day centre for children with special needs, as ordered by the court. Moreover, she had sent the child to Venice in April without his father\u2019s permission and without notifying social services. Given that M.G. had not respected the arrangements fixed by the court, it was necessary to modify them. Accordingly, the court confirmed the previous arrangements in respect of the younger children in relation to who had care of them, their place of residence and contact. It further confirmed that the applicant should have sole care of the eldest son, and that the eldest son should reside with him. The eldest son was no longer given the choice as to whether he wished to stay with his father or mother at night. The court further confirmed the order for the eldest son\u2019s attendance at a day centre for children with special needs, and noted that if M.G. continued to not comply with that order, the matter would be reported to the Minors Court for the adoption of measures limiting parental authority. It also held that the children were not allowed to leave Italy without the consent of both parents. Lastly, it fixed the manner in which the children should spend the approaching summer holidays. In particular, it ordered that from 25 August to 1 September 2011 the four children were to stay with M.G.",

The Florence District Court further ordered that the applicant should pay child maintenance to M.G. As regards who should have care of the children and where they should live, the court noted that M.G. had taken the children to Russia in breach of a court order, and for over a year had thereby deprived the father of any possibility of seeing the children. M.G.\u2019s having sole care of the children, as requested by her, was therefore excluded as an option. The court ordered that the applicant and M.G. should have joint care of the children and that the children should reside with their father. After the children\u2019s return to Italy, M.G.\u2019s contact rights would be fixed by social services so as to prevent the children being wrested once again from the environment in which they lived. Lastly, the court ordered that the applicant should bear all financial expenses in respect of the children, except medical expenses not covered by medical insurance, which should be divided between the parents. The judgment was \u201ctemporarily enforceable\u201d (provvisoriamente esecutivo) pending a decision in appeal proceedings.",

That decision was therefore not a decision rendered in civil matters within the meaning of Article\u00a0409 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and accordingly was not enforceable in Russia. The court further held that enforcement of the decision of 6 December 2010 should be refused by reference to Article\u00a0412 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Article 13 of the Bilateral Convention. It found that the decision of 6 December 2010 was manifestly incompatible with Russian public order because it ordered that the father should have sole care of the children. Russian law did not provide for one parent to have sole care unless the other parent had been formally stripped of his or her parental authority. Given that M.G. had not been stripped of her parental authority, the decision to award sole care to the applicant was incompatible with Russian law.",

Referring to Article\u00a015 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the Family Code, he submitted that international treaties took precedence over national law. Under Article\u00a024 of the Bilateral Convention the Italian courts had jurisdiction over the case, because at the time when the proceedings had been instituted he, M.G. and the children had all been permanently residing in Italy. The fact that M.G. had then abducted the children and taken them to Russia had no bearing on the jurisdiction of the Italian courts to proceed with the case. Further, referring to decisions by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 74-75 below), the applicant argued that the City Court had not indicated what basic principles of the economic, social and legal organisation of Russian society had been infringed by the judgment of 18\u00a0September 2012. Moreover, the Russian courts had no competence in relation to verifying whether that judgment was lawful and justified. The applicant also submitted that the Florence District Court had taken into account the children\u2019s wishes, and proof of this had been produced before the City Court. The applicant further argued that the prohibition on deporting Russian nationals was irrelevant to the present case, because the children were not to be deported or extradited from Russia. They were to be handed over to their legal guardian and would enjoy freedom of movement, including the freedom to leave Russia. Lastly, the applicant complained under Article 8 of the Convention that the refusal to enforce the judgment of 18\u00a0September 2012 violated his right to respect for his family life.",

It further found it established that, despite the applicant\u2019s wish to take care of the children and support them financially, he was being prevented from doing so by M.G. There were therefore no reasons to strip him of his parental authority in respect of the children. As regards residence arrangements, the court noted that the Florence District Court had already examined similar claims and had ordered by its judgment of 18\u00a0September 2012 that the children were to live with the applicant. That judgment was final and enforceable and the procedure for its enforcement in Russia was established by the Bilateral Convention and Article 409 of the Code of Civil Procedure. All the arguments raised by the parties in the present proceedings had already been examined by the Florence District Court. The parties had not produced any new evidence which could warrant changing the residence arrangements determined by the Florence District Court. Moreover, the court had been hampered in its examination of the issue by M.G.\u2019s refusal to have the children examined by court-appointed experts. In the absence of a psychological expert report it was impossible to ascertain effectively the children\u2019s attachment to each of the parents, the parents\u2019 moral character and other relevant qualities, and the relationships between the children and each of the parents. Lastly, the court rejected M.G.\u2019s claim for child maintenance. The parties appealed.",

The experts\u2019 conclusion was that the applicant was polite, communicative, sincere, easy-going, in control of his emotions, sentimental, sensitive to emotional nuances, and that he wanted friendly harmonious relationships. He had broad interests. Rudeness, hostility and a dominating attitude were not part of his character. He could easily adapt to different environments. The experts did not have sufficient material to fully assess the individual psychological features of M.G. and the children. However, on the basis of an analysis of M.G.\u2019s behaviour and the reports by the Italian specialists, and taking into account the ongoing conflict and the children\u2019s being in a psychotraumatic situation for a very long time, the experts recommended that M.G. underwent a comprehensive psychological and psychiatric expert examination. The experts further noted that, owing to the mother\u2019s behaviour, the children had a negative image of their father, which created a substantial risk for their normal mental development. In such a situation, determining the children\u2019s place of residence in accordance with their wishes could contradict their true interests.",

The City Court granted M.G.\u2019s claims in part by ordering that the children were to live with her and that the applicant was to pay her child maintenance, and granted the applicant\u2019s claims in part by determining his contact rights in respect of the children.

During public holidays and school holidays the applicant was allowed to travel with the children both in Russia and abroad. The remaining claims by the applicant and M.G. were dismissed. In taking that decision the City Court took into consideration that: the children had been living with their mother for a long time, and they had been cared for and raised by her during this time; while living in St Petersburg they had acquired a circle of friends and teachers; the material in the case file proved M.G.\u2019s conscientious attitude towards her parental obligations; and the children, questioned by both the court and the childcare authority, had expressed their wish to live with their mother.",

Furthermore, the applicant had not informed the Court about the developments and outcome of the proceedings in Russia. He had also withheld from the Court the fact that on 30\u00a0October 2012 the Dzerzhinskiy District Court had granted him contact rights in respect of the children while the examination of the case in Russia in relation to parental authority, residence arrangements and child maintenance was ongoing, and that he had had contact with the children after they had been taken from Italy to Russia by their mother in August 2011. Lastly, the applicant had failed to inform the Court that he had not returned one of the children after exercising his contact rights, and that he was keeping the child in Italy in the absence of any court decision. He had thereby prevented the Court from ruling on the case in full knowledge of the facts.",

The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not always lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In both contexts, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, including other concerned third parties, and in both cases the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Kosmopoulou v.

That Convention sets out criteria for defining whether the removal of a child to another country by one parent was \u201cwrongful\u201d and whether it required appropriate measures to be taken by the authorities of the State where the child was retained.

This decision was taken following an incident of 27\u00a0November 2012 in which the applicant\u2019s youngest son fiercely resisted the meeting with the applicant, and was based on a letter by the Children\u2019s Psychiatry Centre for Recovery Treatment of 29\u00a0November 2012 to the effect that, in circumstances where there was bitter parental conflict, meetings between children and the parent from whom they were living apart were psychologically highly traumatic for the children, and the letter by the school principal with firm objections to having the meetings between the applicant and the children take place on the school premises. It does not however appear from the case file material that when taking the decision to cancel the temporary contact arrangement between the applicant and his children the domestic authorities took any measures to ascertain whether all four children resisted contacts with the applicant, to identify the causes of such resistance and to try to address them accordingly. As a result, the applicant was deprived of his right to see his children or establish regular and meaningful contact with them while the proceedings were ongoing and this drifted them further apart.",

The Court notes, however, that it was not until the divorce judgment of the Florence District Court 18\u00a0September 2012 was quashed on appeal by the Florence Court of Appeal on 25 March 2014 (see paragraphs\u00a043, 50 and 57 above) that the City Court finally decided on the matter on 13 May 2014 ordering that the children were to live with M.G., that the applicant was to pay her child maintenance, and determining the applicant\u2019s contact rights in respect of the children. In taking this decision the City Court took into account that the children had been living for a long time with their mother and settled in their new environment and that they expressed their wish to live with their mother. The Court considers that the time it took the domestic court to finally determine the dispute, along with the absence of any temporary regulation of the applicant\u2019s contact rights since December 2012, had irremediable consequences for relations between the applicant and his children and resulted in de facto determination of the matter.",

An oral hearing may not be necessary, owing to the exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations. Provided that an oral hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, where the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leavetoappeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention even though an appellant has not been given an opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see Gankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a026, with further references).
