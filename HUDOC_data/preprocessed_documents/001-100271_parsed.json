It is enough for the purposes of Article 3 that a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a021906/04, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2008...). Thus, where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, notwithstanding the non-judicial character of the procedures to be followed, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3 (ibid. \u00a7 103). The Court considers that the principles set forth in the above-cited Kafkaris judgment must be applied to the instant case and that it must seek to establish whether, in spite of the fact that he is serving a life sentence without commutation, Mr Iorgov may be considered to have any chance of release.",

It notes that the penalty of a life sentence without commutation was not introduced into the Criminal Code until December 1998, as a result of the abolition of the death penalty (see paragraph 13 above), a very important act for the development of domestic law and of the State's penal policy. The Bulgarian Parliament opted to introduce two types of life sentence: one with a possibility of judicial commutation to thirty years' imprisonment and one without commutation, which is considered the heaviest penalty and is reserved for crimes of exceptional gravity (see paragraph 29 above). It must be remembered that at the time of these legislative changes the applicant had been sentenced to death by the courts for exceptionally serious crimes, even if his execution had been suspended by virtue of a moratorium decreed by Parliament. In January 1999 the Vice-President used his power of clemency to commute the applicant's death penalty to a life sentence without the possibility of judicial commutation (see paragraph 13 above).",

The sentences of eighteen other prisoners sentenced to death during or just prior to the moratorium on executions were also commuted to life sentences without commutation. Forty-one more offenders have incurred the same penalty since 1998 (see paragraphs 13 and 30 above). In view of the date of introduction of the moratorium on executions (see paragraph 13 above) and the time that has elapsed between the introduction of the life sentence without commutation and the examination of the present application, the Court considers it unlikely that a large number of prisoners in this category have already spent more than twenty years in detention. The Court notes that under domestic law even an ordinary life sentence, which is considered a less severe penalty, cannot be commuted by the courts until the offender has served twenty years of his sentence \u2013 and even then only to a thirty-year sentence (see paragraph 28 in fine above). That being so, the Court considers that, while it is true that by November 2009 there had been no decision to grant clemency to any prisoner sentenced to life without commutation, that does not suffice to prove that that penalty is irreducible de facto. In the Court's view, the absence of any measures of clemency at this stage cannot give rise to the conclusion that the Bulgarian system is not functional. An examination of practical situations as they unfold in the future will be necessary to determine how applications for clemency by persons sentenced to life imprisonment without commutation are examined by the Vice-President and in what circumstances, if any, measures of clemency are granted. Since the Court is confined to reviewing the circumstances of the case, it cannot accept the applicant's claim that the system in question will not be effective. It must also be borne in mind that by the time the applicant lodged his complaint \u2013 in August 2002 \u2013 he had served only thirteen years of his life sentence, which is much less than the maximum fixed-term prison sentence provided for under domestic law (see paragraph 30 above).",

While it is true that shortcomings in the clemency procedure may be identified, such as the lack of reasons for decisions not to grant clemency (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 91 and 105), it nonetheless appears that the applicant's request was examined by the advisory committee and rejected on the strength of his personal file and the negative opinion formulated by the prison authorities (see paragraph 47 above).",

Deciding which particular sentence should be imposed is a matter for the national courts, which are best placed to establish the facts and apply the domestic law. What matters in the instant case is that when the applicant was sentenced the domestic courts took into account all the relevant circumstances in deciding whether or not to impose the harshest sentence provided for in domestic law.",
