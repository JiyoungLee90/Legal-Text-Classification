Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, 31 March 2016).",

It is true that the Court of Appeal did not reach a new conclusion on the applicant\u2019s guilt. However, having full jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s judgment as to the facts and the law, the Court of Appeal not only based its conclusions on witness evidence which had not been tested in the appellate proceedings but also the witnesses in question had never been examined by the District Court (see, a contrario, Kashlev v.
