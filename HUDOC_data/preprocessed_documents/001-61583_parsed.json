In addition, the applicant was charged with possession of a forged passport. The Regional Prosecutor considered that the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was warranted by the fact that he was charged with several criminal acts which caused a significant danger to society (stopie\u0144 spo\u0142ecznego niebezpiecze\u0144stwa jest znaczny), as he had acted within a criminal organisation and had obtained valuable goods.

The court considered that the evidence collected in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against the applicant. It also relied on a significant danger to society caused by the criminal offences in question and the necessity to ensure the proper course of criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the court pointed out that the investigation of the case would have to be continued in order to clarify the applicant\u2019s role in the commission of the criminal offences and to identify individuals who would be charged with receiving stolen goods from the applicant. Finally, the court considered that the applicant\u2019s case did not disclose any of the grounds for release from detention listed in Article\u00a0218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, i.e. danger to the detainee\u2019s life or health and extreme hardship caused to either the detainee or his family.
