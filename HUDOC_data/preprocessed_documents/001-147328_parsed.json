They cited the following examples from domestic practice.

The Court concluded in that case that it had not been shown that the Russian legal system offered an effective remedy that could have been used to prevent the alleged violation or its continuation and could have provided the applicants with adequate and sufficient redress for their complaint of inadequate conditions of detention. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the Government\u2019s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and found that the applicants had not had at their disposal an effective domestic remedy for their complaints, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention.

It further takes into account that, according to the certificates submitted by the Government and not contested by the applicant, the number of inmates assigned to the same dormitory as the applicant varied between thirty and fifty-seven. Accordingly, the personal spaced afforded to each inmate was from 0.80 to 1.53 square metres. The Court is mindful of the fact that this figure is below the domestic statutory standard of 2\u00a0square metres for male convicts in correctional colonies (see paragraph 31 above). It reiterates that this figure must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by the applicant from the wake-up call in the morning to lights out at night, when he would have been able to move about a substantial part of the correctional colony, including the rest of the prison block and adjacent grounds (compare Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16\u00a0September 2004). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the level of privacy available to the applicant was insufficient to comply with the standards set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. For approximately a year and seven months, during the night, the applicant was housed in a dormitory with at least thirty other persons where he was afforded no more than 1.53 square metres of personal space. At times the personal space afforded to him was as low as 0.80 square metres. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, the sanitary facilities available were not sufficient to accommodate the needs of the detainees. In each unit there were no more than ten wash sinks and six toilets available for approximately 150 detainees living in the same block as the applicant (compare Klyukin v. Russia, no. 54996/07, \u00a7\u00a065, 17 October 2013).",
