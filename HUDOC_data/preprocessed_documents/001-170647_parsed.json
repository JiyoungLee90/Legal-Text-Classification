The applicant further alleged that his request for a lawyer on 30 January 2003 had been ignored and that, on that night, he had been questioned, beaten and forced to give self-incriminatory statements in exchange for the investigator\u2019s promise not to harm his family and to release him on the grounds that he was mentally disabled. The applicant reiterated that he had been forced to repeat his confession in the presence of his lawyer and that he had informed his lawyer of his ill-treatment at the hands of the investigator. However, the investigator had not kept his promise and the applicant\u2019s confessions had been used as a basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction. The applicant further complained, inter alia, that his arrest and detention on remand had been unlawful; that he had not been able to communicate with his representative confidentially during the court hearings because he had been held handcuffed in a cage; that he had not been granted enough time and facilities to prepare his defence because the hearings had been held on a daily basis and he had not been granted full access to the case file; and that the authorities had unlawfully refused to allow his wife to visit him in the Kyiv SIZO on 14 February and 10 March 2005.

It noted, inter alia, that in his \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d of 1 February 2003 the applicant had provided details about the murder which he could not have known without being a direct perpetrator. At the time, those details had not been known to the police and therefore, contrary to the applicant\u2019s statement, could not have been dictated to him by the officers. The credibility of his statements had been further confirmed by the applicant on a number of occasions in the presence of the lawyer of his choosing, as well as by a number of other pieces of evidence in the case. The court noted that the applicant had been apprehended on 30 January 2003 but stated that no investigative actions had been taken in respect of his case before 3 February 2003 and that after that date all investigative actions had been carried out in the presence of a lawyer. For those reasons and having further found that the Court of Appeal had duly examined the applicant\u2019s complaints of illtreatment and lack of legal assistance, it dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations as ill-founded. The applicant\u2019s allegation regarding lack of access to the case file was likewise dismissed as ill-founded; detailed reasoning was given for that dismissal.",

The cell had had a toilet that was not separated from the rest of the space and no ventilation or furniture. At about 7.30 a.m. the applicant had been taken to a transit cell, measuring about 14 sq. m and housing about 20 detainees at a time, where he had usually had to wait for several hours before being escorted onwards. The transit cell had had poor ventilation, two bunks with room for eight seated detainees, and a table. At 9.30 a.m. the applicant had been taken to a special room where he had had to undergo a strip search in front of other people. At 9.40 a.m. he and some twenty other detainees had been locked, for about half an hour, in a toilet with no ventilation or windows and then taken to the prison van. The van had measured 6 sq. m, had afforded insufficient access to fresh air and had not been heated. The applicant had thus been exposed to high temperatures in summer and freezing temperatures in winter. There had been instances when upon returning to the Kyiv SIZO the applicant had had to wait in the van for up to three hours while security checks had been carried out. During the hearings, which had normally been held between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., the applicant had been held in a metal cage guarded by three armed officers, and nobody \u2013 including his defence counsel \u2013 had been allowed to come closer than within one metre of him. Once each day\u2019s hearing had finished, the applicant had been taken either to a special transit cell measuring 0.8 sq. m or, with four other detainees, to a cell measuring 2\u00a0sq.\u00a0m, where he had had to wait for several hours without food before being escorted to the prison van. Upon his return to the Kyiv SIZO, the applicant and nine other detainees had had to wait for an hour in an unventilated transit cell measuring 3\u00a0sq.\u00a0m before being publicly strip-searched again and placed in another cell measuring 12 sq. m and housing up to twenty detainees at a time, with no windows and poor ventilation. At about 11 p.m. the applicant had been escorted to his cell.",

When the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3 square metres of floor space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (see,\u00a0amongst many authorities, Karalevi\u010dius , no.\u00a053254/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03940, 7\u00a0April 2005, Ananyev and others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0145-147 and 149, and Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0136-139).

In accordance with the generally recognised international norms, which the Court accepts and which form the framework for its case-law, an accused person is entitled, as soon as he or she is taken into custody, to be assisted by a lawyer, and not only while being questioned (see Dayanyan v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 7377/03, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33, 13\u00a0October 2009, with further references therein). Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will, in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during questioning by police without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction. Accordingly, the test for assessing whether a restriction on access to a lawyer is compatible with the right to a fair trial is composed of two stages. In the first stage the Court must assess whether there were compelling reasons for the restriction. In the second stage, it must evaluate the prejudice caused to the rights of the defence by the restriction in the case in question (see Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, \u00a7\u00a7 256 and 257, 13\u00a0September 2016). Where there are no compelling reasons for restricting access to legal advice, the Court must apply a very strict scrutiny to its fairness assessment. The onus will be on the Government to demonstrate convincingly why, exceptionally and in the specific circumstances of the case, the overall fairness of the trial was not irretrievably prejudiced by the restriction on access to legal advice (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0265).",
