It noted that it had on several occasions instructed the applicants to rectify deficiencies in the registration papers, the latest such instruction having been given on 29 November 2011. The applicants\u2019 subsequent filing of papers on 5 January 2012 had, however, failed to deal satisfactorily with the court\u2019s concerns. The applicants had not clearly set out the competences of the association\u2019s constituent bodies and had not made it clear which of the several copies of the articles of association filed with the court, in which differences appeared, had been the ones adopted at the founding meeting. Also, Ilinden\u2019s aims, as defined in its articles of association, contravened Article 44 of the Constitution (see paragraph 22 below). It was true that Ilinden intended to use peaceful means to attain those aims. But the aims were themselves contrary to the State\u2019s security and sought to stir up national hatred. Ilinden asked that Bulgaria \u201cstop carrying out its policy of assimilating Macedonians\u201d, \u201cstop supporting nationalist propaganda that [has] sow[n] discrimination, hostility and threats against Macedonians\u201d, \u201cstop preventing Macedonians from holding peaceful rallies\u201d, and \u201cnot [to] discriminate against Macedonians\u201d. Those aims were directed against the security of the rest of the citizens and would lead to hostile relations between allegedly \u201cdiscriminated Macedonians\u201d and other Bulgarian citizens. They were therefore unlawful and precluded Ilinden\u2019s registration.",

It held that its aims, as set out in its articles of association, were political, which was not permissible for an association seeking registration under the Non-Profit Legal Persons Act 2000 (see paragraphs 19-21 and 23 below). For instance, in clause 2 of its articles of association, Ilinden proclaimed itself as successor to \u201cthe national liberation struggle of the Macedonian nation\u201d, and in clause 3 stated that it would \u201cexpress and protect the civic, political, national, social and economic rights of Macedonians living in Bulgaria\u201d. Clause 4 spoke of the protection of Macedonians subjected to racial and ethnic assimilation by the Bulgarian State\u2019s nationalistic policies and demanded that Pirin Macedonia be given cultural autonomy, that the assimilation of Macedonians be stopped, and that Macedonian identity, religion, language, traditions and heritage, allegedly being subjected to ethnocide by the Bulgarian authorities, be protected. Clause 5 said that Ilinden would strive to free Macedonians from the sense of fear engendered by the Bulgarian State\u2019s policy of discrimination and assimilation and to outlaw Bulgarian racism against Macedonians. According to the Sofia Court of Appeal, the lower court had been correct to find these aims contrary to the unity of the nation. They overtly pitted one group of citizens against another and engendered national and ethnic hatred, contrary to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 22 below)",

However, that was not the case under the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure, which had come into effect on 1 March 2008. The court analysed in detail the relevant provisions of the new Code and found that, when properly construed in the light of its overall scheme and the provisions governing similar registration proceedings, the rules governing the manner of appealing against a refusal to register a non-governmental organisation were to be construed as permitting an appeal to a court of appeal against a first-instance decision refusing registration but precluding an appeal on points of law against the court of appeal\u2019s decision.",

Under the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure, appellate decisions in non-contentious judicial proceedings for the registration of nongovernmental organisations had not been amenable to appeal on points of law. In support of that assertion, the Government relied on two decisions of the Supreme Court of Cassation. They went on to say that since it was unclear when the Sofia Court of Appeal\u2019s decision had been served on the applicants, one could also take as a starting point of the six-month timelimit the date on which the applicants had appealed against it: 4 June 2012.

More importantly, at that time the question of whether under the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure appellate decisions in non-contentious judicial proceedings had been amenable to appeal on points of law had been novel and far from settled. The applicable provisions had been ambiguous and leading legal commentators had expressed the view that they had had to be construed to mean that such decisions were amenable to appeal on points of law. The Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s case-law on the point had been inconsistent, a fact which prompted its President to seek an interpretative decision on it (see paragraph 26 above).

This does not mean, however, that the application was lodged out of time. Since it is not evident whether the Sofia Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was amenable to appeal, the point must be resolved by reference to the principle that when an applicant attempts an apparently existing remedy which later transpires to be ineffective, the six-month time-limit under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention runs from the point when he or she became or ought to have become aware of that (see, among other authorities, Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 157, ECHR 2009; El-Masri v.\u00a0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2012; and Chapman v.

Applicants cannot be required to apply to this Court before their position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at domestic level (see Varnava and Others, cited above, \u00a7 157).
