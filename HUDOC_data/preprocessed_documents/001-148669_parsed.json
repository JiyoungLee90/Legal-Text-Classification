In particular, the applicant had applied to adjourn the inquest listed to begin in February 1998 pending the outcome of a legal aid judicial review challenge in which judgment was ultimately given a year later in March 1999; there was a delay of just under two years from 1999 to 2001 while issues concerning the inquest, including disclosure, were in the process of resolution between the Coroner and other parties to the inquest; the inquest was listed in March 2001 but was adjourned awaiting the judgment of this Court in Hugh Jordan, cited above; and between 2000 and 2007 the delay was attributable to the decision to await a number of decisions of the House of Lords.",

The applicant was not notified of the DPP decision until she made specific inquiries, via her solicitor, in 2002 (see paragraph 24 above). Following the decision of the DPP in May 1997 not to prosecute, an inquest hearing was set for a date nine months later (see paragraph 29 above). Thereafter the inquest was adjourned pending domestic litigation and litigation before this Court (see paragraphs 29, 36 and 38 above). The first preliminary hearing in the inquest did not take place until April 2008 (see paragraph 41 above), some twelve years after the death of Mr McDonnell and over a year after the final House of Lords judgment which was the reason for the adjournment had been handed down (see paragraph 39 above). Thereafter, further delays were encountered as a result of applications for anonymity made on behalf of the prison officer witnesses and a failure to disclose by the PSNI, for which no explanation has been provided. There is no evidence in the documents before this Court that steps were taken, in recognition of the delay to date, to expedite proceedings and resolve the outstanding preliminary issues. In the event, full disclosure was not finally made until September 2011 (see paragraph 55 above) and a decision in the anonymity applications was not taken until the commencement of the inquest itself in spring 2013 (see paragraph 64 above).",

The fact that it was necessary to postpone the inquest so frequently and for such long periods pending clarifying litigation demonstrates that the inquest process itself was not structurally capable at the relevant time of providing the applicant with access to an effective investigation which would commence promptly and be conducted with due expedition (see McCaughey, cited above, \u00a7 138; and Hemsworth, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

To this extent, the foregoing finding of excessive investigative delay, of itself, entails the conclusion that the investigation was ineffective for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention.

Given the accumulated and potential future delays, this approach may logically pose the question whether and at what point the Court might deem such complaints mature for examination, or in the alternative might find itself pressed to carry out periodic examination of the same complaints at certain intervals in the course of potential additional delays. As for the applicant\u2019s concession that she might re-introduce her complaints at a later point of her dissatisfaction, the Court will at least have to specify the moment as of which it might consider the introduction of such new complaints to be compliant with the six-month time-limit, etc.",
