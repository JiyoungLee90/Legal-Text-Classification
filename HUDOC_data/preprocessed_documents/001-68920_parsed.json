Any purported further motives for the order remain a matter about which the Court does not wish to speculate. It finds that the order issued with a view to finding and seizing documents that would reveal the identity of the company's employees at the relevant time pursued aims that were consistent with the Convention, namely the prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the rights of others, notably the rights of other road users to protection of life and limb.",

He should first have been asked to name the employees to be taken into consideration and to present the relevant material voluntarily. In his view, the search was disproportionate in view of the loss of his good reputation and the reduction in sales. According to him, this was particularly true considering the petty nature of the contravention in question, purportedly committed by a first offender, and the fact that the District Court, in its decision, made no use of the results of the search and seizure. From the evidence thereby obtained, it emerged that a large number of employees could have been driving the company car at the relevant time; however, none of them had been questioned or compared with the photograph taken on the occasion of the radar check.

The applicant's employees could be excluded as potential drivers at the relevant time due to their sex or age. It did not appear appropriate to discontinue the proceedings in such circumstances, considering general prevention purposes and the risks to life and limb for other road users inherent in speeding. Finally, the seizure order, which explicitly referred to documents concerning the company's staff at the relevant time, limited the search order to the least serious interference with the applicant's rights. The effectiveness of the investigation would have been impeded if the search order had been restricted to the applicant's business premises, which were located at the same address as his residential premises.

The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue have been, inter alia, the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected, the manner and circumstances in which the order was issued, in particular further evidence available at that time, the content and scope of the order, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the safeguards taken in order to confine the impact of the measure to reasonable bounds, and the extent of possible repercussions on the reputation of the person affected by the search (see, mutatis mutandis, Chappell, cited above, p. 25, \u00a7 60; Niemietz, cited above, pp. 3536, \u00a7 37; Funke, cited above, p. 25, \u00a7 57; and Camenzind, cited above, pp. 2894-95, \u00a7 46).",

It subsequently served a decision on the applicant with an identical reasoning, notwithstanding that the applicant himself had not been charged with a contravention of a regulation, and rejected his complaint against the search warrant as inadmissible because devoid of purpose (prozessual \u00fcberholt), the search having been effected in the meantime. According to the , it was not decisive that the  had rejected the applicant's complaint as inadmissible contrary to its new jurisprudence as of April 1997, as the reasoning concerning the seizure order was to cover also the search order, which it regarded as obviously lawful.

The competent judge had ordered the police to question the applicant about his company's employees at the relevant time before the search and seizure warrant was executed on the same day.
