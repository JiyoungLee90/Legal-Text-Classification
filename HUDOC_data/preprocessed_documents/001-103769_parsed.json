The failure to refer, in the transcript of the audio recording, to the request for the use of special surveillance means, the surveillance warrant or the Minister's decision authorising their use, or to specify in the transcript the time when the recording had ended, were not in breach of the statutory requirements either, and the procedure followed by the authorities to obtain permission for the covert recording and to carry it out had been proper. The transcript fully complied with the applicable rules, and there was no indication that phrases spoken by the applicant or Ms A.G. had been taken out of context. Both of them had heard the recording during the trial, and had stated that the voices in the recording had been theirs and that the recorded phrases had been spoken by them. The expert reports had been prepared in line with the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, and there were no grounds to disqualify the expert who had drawn them up. Her conclusions had been based on the presence of a special material produced by the technical services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the applicant's hands and on the two banknotes.

Its distinguishing feature was that the covert surveillance of the applicant had not been tainted by irregularities and that on its basis she had later been convicted of bribery. The recording of her conversation had been lawful and carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by the president of a regional court. She had learned about the surveillance when acquainting herself with the material in the criminal case against her, and had been able to challenge the authenticity of the recording and point out any irregularities that might have tainted the covert operation. While there was no indication as to whether the officers who had carried out the operation notified the regional court's president when the surveillance came to an end, it was clear from the transcript that they had later noted that the recording had started at 9 a.m. on 7 February 2001 and come to an end at 2\u00a0p.m. the same day, because it had fulfilled its purpose. That situation was comparable to the one in L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland (15 June 1992, Series A no.\u00a0238). Moreover, one could not lose sight of the latest amendments to the 1997 Special Surveillance Means Act and the 1988 Act. In particular, the new point 7 of section 2(1) of the 1988 Act made it possible to seek damages in respect of unlawful interception of communications.",

Moreover, when implementing surveillance measures against the applicant the authorities had failed to observe certain formalities prescribed by that Act and the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure: the surveillance warrant did not mention the number of the request or the applicant's name, and the transcript of the audio recording did not refer to the request, the warrant or the Minister's permission to proceed with the surveillance operation.",

The lack of adequate safeguards noted in that judgment was evinced by the fact that it was unclear who, and when and in how much detail, had informed the chief secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the covert operation by telephone. That lack of safeguards had not been remedied with the adoption in 2008 and 2009 of legislative amendments. They did not address situations in which resorting to covert surveillance was formally lawful but unwarranted. The setting up of a special parliamentary commission to oversee the implementation of such measures had not been enough, because the law did not lay down in detail the manner in which that commission was to carry out its task and did not enjoin it to do so. It was unrealistic to believe that the commission's five members would be able to review all instances \u2013 about ten thousand a year \u2013 in which such surveillance measures were being applied. In fact, the amendments had, paradoxically, lessened the amount of control over the implementation of covert surveillance measures. The 2008 amendments had envisaged the creation of a special body, the National Bureau for Control over Special Surveillance Means. However, before it could become operational, the 2009 amendments had abolished it and replaced it by the special parliamentary commission. The commission's members had already been elected, but it had not started work. Thus, even the minimal degree of supervision exercised by the Minister of Internal Affairs before the 2008 amendments no longer existed and had not been replaced by a working mechanism. The Bulgarian State, in breach of its duty under Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to abide by the Court's judgment in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above), had not taken adequate measures to put in place sufficient safeguards against the improper use of covert surveillance.

The basis of her complaint, which was raised on 22 March 2005, was a specific instance of such surveillance which took place in January 2001 in connection with criminal proceedings which came to an end in 2004 (see paragraphs 8 and 21 above and compare with Iliya Stefanov v.

The district court dealing with the criminal case against the applicant specifically considered that question and found that the covert operation against the applicant had not been unlawful (see paragraph 17 above, and contrast Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). Its ruling on that point was upheld by the appellate court and the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above). It is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see Kruslin v. , 24 April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 176A, and Huvig v.\u00a0France, 24 April 1990, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 176B). While the Court should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 8, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law, except in cases of flagrant nonobservance or arbitrariness (see Weber and Saravia v. Germany (dec.), no. 54934/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2006XI).

It found that the statutory procedure for authorising covert surveillance, if strictly adhered to, offered sufficient protection against arbitrary or indiscriminate surveillance (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 7984). However, it went on to find problems with (a) the lack of review by an independent body of the implementation of surveillance measures or of whether the material obtained through such measures would be destroyed within the statutory timelimit if the surveillance had proved fruitless; (b) the lack of sufficient safeguards in respect of surveillance carried out on national security grounds and not in the context or criminal proceedings; (c) the lack of regulations specifying with an appropriate degree of precision the manner of screening of such material, or the procedures for preserving its integrity and confidentiality and the procedures for its destruction; (d) the lack of an independent body to oversee and report on the functioning of the system of secret surveillance; (e) the lack of independent control over the use of material falling outside the scope of the original application for the use of covert surveillance measures; and (f) the lack of notification of the persons concerned, even where such notification could be made without jeopardising the purpose of the surveillance (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 8591).",

Therefore, the concerns that the Court has expressed in relation to surveillance on nationalsecurity grounds, unauthorised surveillance, the lack of notification of the persons concerned, the lack of independent review of whether material is destroyed within the statutory timelimit if the surveillance has proved fruitless, the lack of safeguards in respect of material which falls outside the scope of the original request, and the lack of an effective mechanism of oversight of the system of secret surveillance (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84, 85 and 8791) are of no relevance to the present case. Similarly, no problem arises in relation to the lack of an independent body empowered to verify whether the services carrying out surveillance comply with the warrants which have authorised it, or whether they faithfully reproduce the original data in the written record (ibid., \u00a7 85). The courts dealing with the criminal case against the applicant reviewed whether the surveillance had been carried out lawfully (see paragraphs 17, 19 and 21 above, and contrast , cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01216 and 44). The trial court had at its disposal the material obtained as a result of the surveillance, and was able to check whether it had been correctly reproduced in the ensuing transcript (see paragraphs 14 and 17 above, and contrast Dumitru Popescu v. Romania (no. 2), no. 71525/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078, 80 and 81, 26 April 2007, and Kirov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 1216 and 44).",

The regulations governing the storage of evidence in the courts at that time, while not containing specific provisions on how to handle classified information, laid down a number of rules concerning duration, storage, usage and destruction of material in court case files and access of third parties to them. They also put in place a number of safeguards designed to ensure the integrity and the confidentiality of such material (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above).

First, the Bulgarian courts seem to have consistently construed amendments to the liability provisions of the 1988 Act as conferring substantive rights and not having retroactive effect (see paragraph 31 above).

The charges against her were finally determined by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 28 December 2004 (see paragraph 21 above). The duration of the period to be taken into consideration was therefore slightly less than four years for a preliminary investigation and three levels of jurisdiction. The fact that that period of time was longer than permissible under Bulgarian law did not automatically render the length of the proceedings excessive. Failure to abide by timelimits prescribed by domestic law does not in itself contravene the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Pretto and Others v.\u00a0Italy, 8 December 1983, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 71; Wiesinger v. Austria, 30\u00a0October 1991, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 213; and Estrikh v. Latvia, no.\u00a073819/01, \u00a7 138, 18 January 2007). It is true that there was an unexplained gap during the preliminary investigation and that the trial suffered from certain setbacks (see paragraphs 914 above). However, in spite of that the trial was completed in less than a year (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). After that, the  and the Supreme Court of Cassation also examined the case quite fast (see paragraphs 1821 above), managing to bring the overall duration of the proceedings to less than four years. In the Court's view, that amount of time cannot be regarded as unreasonable (see, mutatis mutandis, Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a074012/01, \u00a7 64, 6 November 2008).",

The trial court (as well as the appellate court) examined that material and, rejecting the applicant's objections as the lawfulness of the operation, confirmed its admissibility. As noted in paragraph 49 of the judgment: \u201c[t]he courts dealing with the criminal case against the applicant reviewed whether the surveillance had been carried out lawfully\u201d. Furthermore, unlike in Association for European Integration, \u201cthe material obtained as a result of the covert operation against the applicant was later used as evidence in her trial and thus stored as part of the criminal case against her\u201d (see paragraph 50 of the judgment).",
