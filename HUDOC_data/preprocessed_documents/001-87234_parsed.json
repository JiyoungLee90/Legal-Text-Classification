The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question which must be civil in nature (see Zander v. Sweden, judgment of 25 November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0279B, p.\u00a038, \u00a7\u00a022). Considering the nature of the applicant\u2019s claims (see paragraph 19 above), the Court finds that the dispute in question was not of a genuine or serious nature, nor did it concern any right recognised under the domestic law.
