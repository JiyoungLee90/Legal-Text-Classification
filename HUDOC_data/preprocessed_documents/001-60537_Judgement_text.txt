The case originated in an application (no. 33885/96) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Polish national, Eryk Kawka (“the applicant”), on 5 February 1996.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr W. Hermeliński, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained, inter alia, under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention that after having been arrested he had not been brought before “a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power”.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 23 October 2001 the Court declared the applicant's complaint under Article 5 § 3 admissible. It rejected the remainder of the application.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
On 13 January 1996 the applicant was arrested by the police and brought before the Gliwice District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy). On the same day, the prosecutor charged the applicant with robbery and detained him on remand because there existed a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence and because of the serious nature of that offence.
On 5 February 1996 the applicant sent a letter to the Gliwice District prosecutor, asking to be informed of the reasons for his detention. That letter was deemed to be an application for release. It was examined as such and rejected on 12 February 1996.
On 11 March 1996 the applicant was indicted on the charge of robbery.
On 17 June 1996 the Gliwice District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to four years and six months' imprisonment and three years' deprivation of his civic rights.
The relevant domestic law is described in the judgment Niedbała v. Poland, no. 27915/95, §§ 18-20 and 24-31, 4 July 2000, unreported.
