In particular, it appears from the report that while the expert reached a conclusion which clearly differed from the initial diagnosis of the applicant made during his admission to the hospital, the expert did not make any assessment about the initial diagnosis explaining why he departed from it. The Court considers in this connection that in such circumstances where an expert - following an examination carried out four days after the incident \u2013 came to a conclusion which differs from the initial diagnosis established during the applicant\u2019s admission to the hospital it was legitimately expected from him to give a detailed explanation as to why he reached such a conclusion.

The Court accepts in this respect that in some circumstances a measure, such as an arrest or a detention, may cause an individual, in particular with previous health problems - in the absence of duress or use of force by the police - stress, psychological tension and inevitable suffering inherent in any measure which could trigger his previous diseases. However, in the present case the Government contented themselves with submitting that the applicant\u2019s in-patient treatment was related to his previous diseases, without giving any explanation and account of events which could explain why the applicant was subsequently transferred by ambulance from the police station to the hospital. As noted above, nor did the forensic report provide any explanation in this respect. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the respondent Government failed to discharge their burden of proof and to submit any evidence refuting the applicant\u2019s account of events.",

As to the Government\u2019s argument that other persons brought to Nasimi District Police Station no. 22 on 14 June 2008 stated that they had not been subjected to any kind of pressure or ill-treatment by the police, the Court finds this argument irrelevant in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint.",

In this connection, the Court notes that only three days after the beginning of the criminal inquiry and without waiting for its conclusions, the spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs stated to the media that the applicant had not been ill-treated by the police and that his allegations were not true (see paragraph 23 above). The Court considers that this statement on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was the employer of the investigator in charge of the investigation, cast substantial doubts on the independence of the investigation from the beginning.",

In proclaiming the \u201cright to liberty\u201d, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be deprived of that liberty in an arbitrary fashion. In order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting point must be the specific situation of the individual concerned, and account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a specific case, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The distinction between a deprivation of liberty and a restriction thereof is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7 92, Series A no.\u00a039, and Austin and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09, \u00a7 57, ECHR\u00a02012).",

In the present case, it is undisputed that the applicant was taken to the police station by police officers and that he was not free to leave the premises without their authorisation. The Court thus considers that there was an element of coercion which was indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Gillan and Quinton, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Foka v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a028940/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a074-79, 24\u00a0June 2008).

The Court points out that subparagraphs\u00a0(a) to (f) of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which people may be deprived of their liberty, and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds (see Austin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 60). Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of somebody\u2019s detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness. What is at stake here is not only the \u201cright to liberty\u201d but also the \u201cright to security of person\u201d (see, among other authorities, Bozano v. France, 18\u00a0December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 111, and Wassink v. the Netherlands, 27 September 1990, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 185A). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2008).",

In this connection, the Court observes that it is apparent from the eyewitness statements of R.A. and M.H. that the applicant identified himself to the police as a journalist and the chairman of the IRFS (see paragraph 12 above) and did not refuse to disclose his identity to the police (see, by contrast, Vasileva v. Denmark, no.\u00a052792/99, \u00a7\u00a7 36-38, 25\u00a0September 2003). Moreover, the Government failed to submit any evidence, such as records, detention orders or any other documentary evidence, in support of their factual claim proving that the applicant had failed to comply with the request of the police to disclose his identity.

Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see Djavit An, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056). Accordingly, States must not only safeguard the right to assemble peacefully, but must also refrain from applying unreasonable indirect restrictions upon that right. In view of the essential nature of freedom of assembly and its close relationship with democracy, there must be convincing and compelling reasons to justify an interference with this right (see Ouranio Toxo v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a074989/01, \u00a7\u00a036, ECHR 2005X (extracts), and Adal\u0131\u00a0v.

In this connection, the Court notes that under Azerbaijani law the legal basis for the police intervention in an assembly and its potential dispersal is set out in Articles 7 and 14 of the Law on Freedom of Assembly. However, Article 4.1 of the same Law clearly provided that the right to hold gatherings in places which are in private ownership is not regulated by this Law. The Government also did not contest that an assembly held in a private caf\u00e9 is not subject to any requirement of notification.",

Moreover, the Court finds that this argument is contradicted by the explanation concerning the police intervention of 14\u00a0June 2008 in which the Head of Nasimi District Police Station no. 22 stated that the police had intervened in order to identify the persons gathered and to establish the purpose of the gathering, without referring to any complaint from neighbours (see paragraph 26 above). The spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs also indicated in his statement of 17 June 2008 that the police had intervened in order to interrupt an unauthorised gathering and to identify its participants, without referring to any complaint from neighbours (see paragraph 23 above).",
