They further recalled that all the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. This did not mean, however, that in order to be used as evidence statements of witnesses should always be made at a public hearing in court: to use as evidence such statements obtained at the pre-trial stage was not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided the rights of the defence have been respected (see Solakov v.

Therefore, for medical reasons, his participation in the pre-trial investigation had been limited, and excluded the possibility of a confrontation. Nevertheless, the trial court had taken all possible measures to guarantee a fair hearing, and for this reason had summoned Mr S. to the hearings. Contrary to the doctor\u2019s advice, Mr S. had attended a hearing, but had had to leave early on account of his health problems and need for treatment. For this reason the victim\u2019s representative had lodged a petition in which he asked the court to examine the case in the victim\u2019s absence. Besides, the lawyer had submitted to the Court Mr S.\u2019s written statement, in which Mr S. confirmed the statements he had made during the pre-trial investigation. The applicant, the second accused and their representatives objected to that petition. The court had allowed the petition in an effort to guarantee the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of both the accused on the one side and the victim on the other (see, mutatis mutandis Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0148). The Government found that position to be well-founded, considering the fact that given that even attending the court hearing caused the victim considerable stress, having him interrogated would have had much more serious consequences for his health. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the primary task for the national court in that situation was to protect the victim, Mr S., from situations in which memories of the armed attack could cause him undue stress, and that made it impossible to allow the victim to be interrogated in the courtroom. They also considered necessary to point out that the victim\u2019s diagnosis, and the length of time for which he was in such a condition confirmed that his health problems were chronic. For this reason the court concluded that the victim\u2019s presence at the subsequent court hearings, which took place during a short period of time, could have had the above-mentioned consequences.",

However, provided that the authorities cannot be accused of a lack of diligence in their efforts to award the defendant an opportunity to examine the witnesses in question, the witnesses\u2019 unavailability as such does not make it necessary to discontinue the prosecution (see, in particular, Artner v. Austria, judgment of 28\u00a0August 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0242-A, p.\u00a010, \u00a7\u00a021; Scheper v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a039209/02, 5\u00a0April 2005; Mayali v.

Evidence obtained from a witness under conditions in which the rights of the defence cannot be secured to the extent normally required by the Convention should, however, be treated with extreme care (see Visser v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a026668/95, \u00a7\u00a044, 14\u00a0February 2002, and S.N.\u00a0v.

They did not deny the fact of their fight with Mr S. and there was a sufficient body of evidence to confirm that. What the parties disagreed on was the account of the events and the reasons for the fight. Nevertheless, the domestic courts fully relied on the version given by the victim, Mr S., during the pre-trial investigation without hearing evidence from him in person and without providing the applicant with an opportunity to contest his statements. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s conviction in part of the conspiracy to kill, which is, moreover, a more serious crime than the armed robbery of which the applicant was also found guilty, was based to a decisive extent, if not solely, on the version of events provided by the victim. It is not the task of this Court to substitute the domestic courts in assessment of evidence or in proposing a concrete solution for balancing the interests of the parties. It observes, however, that the domestic courts did not make any effort to find a solution for testing the reliability of the victim, for example by doing it in a less invasive manner than direct questioning in the courtroom.",
