In January 2003 he sent to a newspaper two letters containing information about pressure put on the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office by a high-ranking politician. In one of the letters, the Vice-President of Parliament expressed discontent that several police officers were being criminally prosecuted for allegedly ill-treating and unlawfully detaining suspects. In another letter it was stated that one of those police officers had previously been convicted of similar offences, but had been exempted from serving a sentence and had soon been re-employed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Subsequently, the newspaper published an article on the basis of the letters. The applicant was then dismissed by the Prosecutor General for having violated the internal regulations of the Press Department. In proceedings for his reinstatement brought against the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, he argued before the domestic courts that the disclosure of the letters had been in good faith and had pursued the aim of \u201cfighting corruption and trading in influence\u201d. He argued that, in any event, the letters could not be classified as secret under domestic law. The domestic courts found in favour of the applicant\u2019s employer, on the grounds that the applicant had breached his duty of confidentiality by disclosing the letters, and that he had failed to consult other heads of departments before disclosing the letters to the newspaper.",

Against that background, it also found that the information disclosed by the applicant was of major public interest, because it concerned such issues as the separation of powers, improper conduct by a high-ranking politician, and the government\u2019s attitude towards police brutality. Balancing the different issues involved, the Court also took into consideration the detriment caused to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office by the disclosure. In doing so, the Court came to the conclusion that the public interest in having information about undue pressure and wrongdoing within the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office revealed was so important in a democratic society that it outweighed the interest in maintaining public confidence in the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. Lastly, the Court noted that the applicant had acted in good faith and that the most severe sanction possible had been imposed on him. In view of all the considerations, the Court came to the conclusion that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression, in particular his right to impart information, had not been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, and that there had been a breach of Article 10 of the Convention.",

In a democratic system, the acts or omissions of government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of the media and public opinion. The interest which the public may have in particular information can sometimes be so strong as to override even a legally imposed duty of confidence (see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no.\u00a029183/95, ECHR 1999I, and Radio Twist, a.s. v. Slovakia, no. 62202/00, ECHR\u00a02006-XV).",

Moreover, as indicated by the applicant\u2019s submissions, which were not disputed by either the Government in the proceedings before the Court or by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office in the domestic proceedings, the applicant was the first employee of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office to be dismissed on the basis of that provision.

In fact, the Prosecutor General did not even attempt to maintain the impression of a simple labour dispute. Instead, he acted in such a way as to make it obvious to the applicant and others that the applicant was no longer welcome to work at his old workplace.

The courts paid no attention at all to the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the treatment to which he had been subjected during his ten days of employment. They did not examine whether the dismissal constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed by Article 10, or whether the decision to dismiss the applicant again under section 14(8) of the Public Service Act was justified under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, bearing in mind the events of 2003 and the Guja judgment.",
