The Deputy Minister underlined the vague definition of \u201cenemy of the communist regime\u201d used by the KhAD, how it found those enemies through an extensive network of spies, and how all of this led to widespread and often random arrests of suspects. It was also noted that the KhAD was considered to be an elite unit of the communist regime, and that only those whose loyalty was beyond doubt were eligible for recruitment to the service. Furthermore, new recruits were initially assigned to KhAD/WAD sections actively engaged in tracking down \u201celements that posed a threat to the State\u201d, where \u2013 in order to prove their loyalty unequivocally \u2013 they were directly involved in the human rights violations the KhAD was associated with.

The Minister held that, based on the applicant\u2019s position and description of his tasks (including the processing of high-level classified information), he had attempted to trivialise his activities and had greatly impaired his credibility in consequence. On this point, the Minister relied, inter alia, on Amnesty International\u2019s \u201cReports of torture and long-term detention without trial\u201d of March 1991, according to which the Directorate in which the applicant had been employed was engaged in systematic torture.",

Taking into account that the applicant had never sought to leave the KhAD or the WAD, for which he had worked for about ten years, in which his last held rank was that of lieutenant-colonel, and in which he had been promoted to head of his department, the Minister concluded that there were no indications that the applicant had been forced or had involuntarily worked for the KhAD/WAD.",

She dismissed the applicant\u2019s fear of returning to Afghanistan as a (former) member of the PDPA and former officer of KhAD, referring to an official report issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in January 2005 and holding that the sole fact that an asylum seeker had been a PDPA member was not enough in itself to render Article 3 applicable in the eventuality of expulsion. The Minister further noted that the mere fact that the applicant had a different political conviction from those currently in power in Afghanistan similarly did not suffice to render Article 3 applicable. The Minister further took into account that the applicant had stated that he was not a known person in Afghanistan. The applicant had no concrete indication that he would be searched for by any group or person. In addition, relatives of the applicant \u2013 including his father and brother \u2013 were still living in Afghanistan without ever having encountered any problem.",

The applicant had submitted that he had attended meetings \u2013 where he had only taken minutes \u2013 in the course of which cooperation agreements had been reached between the KhAD and a mujahideen commander. In addition, the applicant had alleged that these mujahideen commanders were keen on ensuring that nobody in present-day Afghanistan would find out that they had cooperated with KhAD in the past, for which reason they were interested in eliminating the applicant. On this point, the Minister held that the applicant had failed to establish these commanders\u2019 whereabouts and current influence in Afghan society. The Minister noted that according to the applicant\u2019s own statements, he did not believe that these individuals occupied high positions in today\u2019s Afghanistan. Furthermore, the Minister considered that the mujahideen commanders were aware of the applicant\u2019s role in those meetings as well as of the identity of the person taking the decisions as regards financial support of the mujahideen, and that it was therefore implausible that they would be after the applicant. Finally, it was underlined that the applicant had been able to stay in Afghanistan until 1997 without any problems. For these reasons, the applicant\u2019s claim that he was being sought by the mujahideen was dismissed as founded on nothing but suspicion and speculation. The claim based on Article 3 was consequently rejected.",

Furthermore, the Minister had been inconsistent in finding, on the one hand, that the applicant had participated in human rights violations, but, on the other hand, that the applicant had not held an important position within the PDPA party. The applicant submitted that it was likely that he was well known enough for his former adversaries, who were now those in power in Afghanistan, to find him and subject him to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.",

According to the court, this did not mean that every former KhAD officer ran a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, and the applicant was thus required to establish the existence of such a risk in the particular circumstances of his case. The Regional Court agreed with the Minister that the applicant had failed to do so, as his claims were found to be merely based on unsubstantiated expectations, including his claimed fear of persecution by the mujahideen commanders who had been paid by the KhAD/WAD.
