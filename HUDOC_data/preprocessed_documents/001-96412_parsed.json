He submitted that on 21 May 1994 the four prison officers called by his cellmates had dragged him by his feet out of the cell. They had then beaten him, kicked him in his belly and kidneys and pressed a ballpoint pen behind his ear lobes. At that time he had lost consciousness. He had subsequently been dragged from the third floor along the steps down to the cellar, in the process suffering injuries and haematomas along his backbone and skin abrasions on his heels. Having been given a bandage that was insufficient, he had been locked in an individual cell in the cellar without daylight. Only upon a request by Mr Staub, who had visited him in prison on 24 May 1994, had a paramedic seen him and eventually, upon his insistence, taken him to the prison's doctor. The treatment he had suffered at the hands of the police officers on 21 May 1994 and the fact that he had subsequently been kept until 24 May 1994 in solitary confinement without daylight and without medical care were, in the applicant's submission, in violation of his rights under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention.",

It stated that during his hunger strike the applicant had regularly been weighed and his blood-sugar level had been checked. Because of conflicts with former inmates the applicant had already been transferred from another cell. The applicant had several times pretended to faint and had requested an inmate, Mr Stojanovic, to call the prison officers. On the day in question the applicant had banged continuously against the cell door, had rung the bell and had disregarded the ensuing admonitions of the prison officers. In the evening he had gone to the lavatory situated in the cell, had fallen down and had suffered a slightly bleeding injury on his head. The applicant's inmates had subsequently dragged the applicant away from the toilet. The prison's paramedical officer, Mr Zechmeister, established that the applicant was only pretending to be unconscious and such behaviour continued once the applicant was taken outside the cell. An officer, Mr Freithofer, then ordered that the applicant be placed in solitary confinement. Two other officers, Mr\u00a0Mayerhuber and Mr Reichel, were present. None of them had mistreated the applicant. While Mr Zechmeister fetched bandage material, Mr\u00a0Freithofer and Mr Mayerhuber carefully dragged the applicant down to the ground floor. The applicant was holding his head up while being carried, and was therefore only pretending to be unconscious. As he could not be made to walk on his own, inevitably his feet, and partly also his backside, dragged along the floor. After the applicant's head injury had been cleaned and bandaged, he walked on his own to the individual cell situated on the first floor. This cell had a window. At that time the applicant did not allege that he had sustained any further injuries. As with every prisoner on hunger strike, the applicant's state of health was examined daily by the prison's paramedical officer. On 24 May 1994 the applicant showed the paramedic for the first time the abrasions on his back, which were subsequently treated by the prison doctor.",

He had never noticed any injuries on the applicant's back. Some three or four days after the incident and again one week later he had met the applicant, who had shown him blue marks on his back and on his leg. The applicant also told him that he had been beaten. Mr Stojanovic had also been interviewed by police officers in the course of the criminal proceedings concerning the case.

The prison officers who had subsequently carried the applicant out of the cell had not mistreated him. When confronted with these statements at the hearing before the Independent Administrative Panel, Mr Stojanovic submitted that they were not true and had apparently been wrongly recorded because of his poor knowledge of the German language and misunderstandings with the interviewing police officers.",

He had then left in order to fetch dressing material for the applicant's head injury and requested the police officer in charge to place the applicant in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure and in order to keep the peace with the other inmates.

Cells were equipped with an interphone allowing inmates to contact staff at any time. In reply to the question whether there was specific surveillance for inmates who risked losing consciousness while in solitary confinement, Mr Zechmeister replied that in his view the applicant did not present such a risk at the material time. Nor did he consider that the applicant required permanent surveillance. Inmates requiring permanent surveillance were placed in the other Vienna Police Prison at Ro\u00dfauer L\u00e4nde. If they were unfit for detention, they were released. Mr Zechmeister could not remember when the applicant had first been examined by the prison doctor after the incident at issue. Hunger-strikers were examined by the prison doctor either daily or every second or third day, depending on their state of health (for example, where weight loss or blood pressure gave rise to concern).",

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18\u00a0January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). However, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as lying with the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336, and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

Moreover, the applicant made the allegations three days after the incident, when he received the visit of three persons, a representative of an NGO, a journalist and a friend. All three testified as witnesses before the Independent Administrative Panel that they had seen injuries behind the applicant's ears. In its decision, the Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the allegation, with reference to an expert medical opinion. The Court notes, however, that the medical opinion (see paragraph 36 above) concerned a different question. It found it unlikely that the applicant's eardrum had been injured during his detention and stated further that it was impossible to establish whether the applicant's earaches and decreased auditory function were a consequence of his detention. The Independent Administrative Panel's reference to the expert medical opinion is therefore not conclusive as far as the alleged stabbing with ballpoint pens behind the ears is concerned. Having regard to the medical report of 26 May 1994 and the corresponding statement of the witnesses, the Court finds that the existence of injuries behind the applicant's ears is established beyond reasonable doubt. In the absence of any explanation of how he came by them other than through the ill-treatment described, the Government have failed to discharge their burden of proving that these injuries did not stem from stabbing with ballpoint pens by the police officers.",

The medical report of 26 May 1994 notes that the bandaged skin abrasion was still moist and required a new bandage, while the other skin abrasions on the applicant's back were already covered with scabs. Moreover, the three persons who had visited the applicant in prison on 24 May 1994 all testified as witnesses before the Independent Administrative Panel that they had seen the skin abrasions on the applicant's back. One of them described two of these abrasions as having been about the size of the palm of a hand.

In addition, the acts complained of were such as to arouse in the applicant feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of debasing him and possibly breaking his physical and moral resistance. The Court finds elements which are sufficiently serious for the treatment to which the applicant was subjected to be considered inhuman and degrading (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 99, with further references).
