The letter stated that the district prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s conclusion that on 19\u00a0October 1999 Urus-Martan had come under a bomb strike was based on contradictory witness statements and had no objective confirmation. The letter pointed out, in particular, that whilst some of the witnesses had stated that they had seen planes that had allegedly carried out the strike, some other witnesses had indicated that they had not been able to see planes as on the day in question it had been cloudy and misty. Moreover, according to the letter, there were also discrepancies in witness statements concerning the overall number of planes that had allegedly participated in the attack and their colour. The letter went on to note that the origin of the ammunition fragments seized from two of the properties, that had allegedly come under the attack on 19 October 1999 (see paragraph 88 below), had not been established and it had not been ascertained how it had been possible that those fragments could still be found a year after the attack. At the end, the letter stated that at the same time the command of the United Groups Alignment and the Russian Ministry of Defence had reported that on 19\u00a0October 1999 the federal aircraft had not carried out any strikes on Urus-Martan.",

The experts stated that General-Major Sh.\u2019s decision to carry out bomb strikes on 19 October 1999 on fortified points and bases of illegal armed groups and on their radio and electronic facilities had been well-founded and timely, as at that time the town of Urus-Martan had been occupied by illegal fighters, amounting to over 1,500 persons, who had fortified it and had not been prepared to surrender and who had been reinforced with a new group of around 300 illegal fighters a day before the attack. According to the experts, any other methods of action by federal forces, such as a ground attack, storming or forcing out, would have led to unjustified losses among them. The experts also stated that, when organising the bomb strike in question the command of the Group \u201cWest\u201d had taken certain measures with a view to minimising civilian casualties. In particular, according to the report, the military authorities had opted for pinpoint strikes, which had resulted in only six people being killed and seventeen wounded, four of the latter belonging to illegal armed groups. On the other hand, considerable losses had been caused to the illegal fighters who, as a result, had subsequently, on 7 and 8 December 1999, surrendered the town without fighting with the result that there had been no casualties among the federal armed forces. The report thus concluded that the actions of General Major Sh. and General Lieutenant G. had complied with all relevant instructions and regulations, including the Infantry Field Manual, that the decision to carry out a strike on 19 October 1999 had been reasonable and that the federal aircraft had been used in Urus-Martan on 19\u00a0October 1999 pursuant to competent officers\u2019 decisions and taking into account the existing situation and intelligence data.",

In Mr K.\u2019s submission, in order to avoid casualties among civilian residents of Urus-Martan, the federal command had repeatedly applied to them with a request for the Wahhabis to discontinue their resistance and leave the town and had warned the residents that otherwise the Wahhabis would be destroyed by artillery fire and aerial attacks. Therefore, according to Mr K., the civilians residing in Urus-Martan had been warned; however, given that the illegal fighters had not surrendered, pinpoint bomb strikes had been aimed at their bases. In Mr K.\u2019s submission, bomb strikes had been carried out by the military aircraft on the basis of information obtained by the latter\u2019s intelligence service. Mr K. also noted that in December 1999 the federal forces had blocked Urus-Martan for further \u201csweeping-up\u201d operations.

Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14\u00a0October 2003) and that, therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution had decided not to investigate the claims (see Knyazev v. , no. 25948/05, \u00a7 86, 8 November 2007). In support of their argument, the Government enclosed a number of court decisions by which domestic courts, acting in accordance with Article 125 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, had set aside decisions by investigating authorities to dispense with or discontinue criminal proceedings in connection with various incidents involving military personnel.",

The Government insisted that the remedy invoked by them would be effective in the applicants\u2019 situation. In particular, in their view, the second and third applicants could seek compensation for pecuniary damage under relevant provisions of the Russian Civil Code, and compensation for non-pecuniary damage under other relevant provisions of the same Code. They also argued that, when examining a civil claim for compensation for damage sustained as a result of a criminal offence, a domestic court was entirely independent of decisions taken by investigating authorities and courts in the context of criminal proceedings in connection with that offence. To corroborate their arguments, the Government referred to a first-instance judgment and appeal decision awarding damages to the first applicant in Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia (nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, 24 February 2005) in connection with the death of his relatives in the Chechen Republic and to a first-instance judgment and appeal decision awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage and burial expenses to a certain V. for the death of V.\u2019s son during a military operation.",

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness.

Indeed, Article\u00a01069 of the Russian Civil Code invoked by the Government establishes the rules on compensation for damage inflicted by representatives of the State and provides that State agents are liable only for damage caused by their unlawful actions or failure to act. In the circumstances of the present case, where the investigation into the attack of 19 October 1999 ended with a decision of 17 November 2003 stating that the federal officers\u2019 actions had been justified, the second and third applicants\u2019 civil claim for damages would clearly be bound to fail. In this connection, the Court also refers to the practice of the Russian courts, which have consistently refused to award any compensation for damage caused by the federal forces during the conflict in the Chechen Republic, stating that the latter\u2019s actions had been lawful as the counter-terrorism operation in the region had been launched under relevant presidential and governmental decrees, which had not been found to be unconstitutional (see paragraphs\u00a0141-143 above). The Court finds even more relevant in the circumstances of the present case the fact that on 11 May and 4 October 2001, respectively, the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction rejected as unsubstantiated the first applicant\u2019s claim for compensation for his house that had been destroyed in the attack of 19 October 1999, despite evidence proving the involvement of the federal forces adduced by the first applicant (see paragraphs 43-48 above). In such circumstances, the Court sees no reason to conclude that the outcome of civil proceedings concerning a claim that could have been brought by the second and third applicants, and would have been similar to that brought by the first applicant, would have been favourable to them.",

As regards Governmental Decree no. 404 of 4 July 2003, which afforded a right to compensation to permanent residents of the Chechen Republic, it is clear from the relevant legal instrument that the compensation in question is paid without regard to the particular circumstances in which the property was lost, that is to say, irrespective of whether State agents were responsible for the destruction. Moreover, the value of the lost property is not taken into account either, since the overall amount paid for lost housing and other possessions cannot exceed RUB 350,000 Russian roubles (approximately EUR 9,000).

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 146-50, Series A no. 324; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

Although the Government gave certain explanations in that connection, the Court is still unable to see the full and clear picture of that incident. Whilst describing in general a complex situation in Urus-Martan and referring to the need to break the resistance of illegal fighters who had entrenched themselves in the town, the Government, however, did not provide any details concerning the planning and control of the strike of 19 October 1999 and remained silent as regards the actions of the federal servicemen who participated in that attack. They also failed to submit documents concerning that attack, such as copies of plans of the operation, orders, reports on its results, or the like. In this latter respect, the Court finds it open to criticism that a number of such documents or other important sources of information, such as photographs and tape-recordings, that appear to have been directly relevant to that attack, were destroyed a year, or even three months, after the attack in question with reference to a relevant order of the Russian Ministry of Defence (see paragraphs 108 and  above). In the Court\u2019s view, such time-limits for storage of information concerning planning, control, performance and results of large-scale military actions, in particular aerial bomb attacks, which may entail multiple deaths or injuries, massive destruction or damage to property, or other drastic consequences, are too tight to be accepted as adequate.",

In particular, the Court takes into account the Government\u2019s arguments, corroborated by witness statements of a number of federal servicemen, that the town had been occupied by a considerable number of well-equipped extremists, armed with a range of large-yield weaponry, who were in fact conducting large-scale military actions against the federal forces, including attacks on federal aircraft causing casualties among the federal forces, and had turned the town into a fortress, having dug trenches and dugouts, having filled pits with oil to be able to explode them on the approach of the federal forces, and having extended the depth of defence to three or four quarters from the outskirts towards the town centre (see paragraphs 77-79, 114 and 131 above).",

The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the authorities had informed the local population via leaflets and local mass-media of possible aerial strikes and artillery shelling in case of an organised armed resistance on the part of the illegal armed groups located in Urus-Martan. It notes, in particular, that Mr K., a high-ranking officer, who gave explanations to that effect, later refused to confirm them alleging that he could no longer recall the events in question (see paragraph 115 above). In any event, in a situation where the authorities knew that the residents who had remained in the town were, in fact, prevented from leaving by the illegal fighters who intended to use them as human shields (see paragraph\u00a076 and 78 above), the measures referred to by the Government could hardly be regarded as adequate. It is true that the evacuation of inhabitants in a situation where they were held hostage by fighters might have been particularly difficult, but the Government did not demonstrate that the authorities had taken any steps at all in that direction, that they had attempted to organise a safe exit for civilians, to negotiate their evacuation with the fighters, or the like.",

It is clear that during the attack of 19 October 1999 high-explosive fragmentation bombs of calibre\u00a0250-270 kg were used (see paragraph 81 above), this being an indiscriminate weapon. The Court has already held that using this kind of weapon in a populated area is impossible to reconcile with the degree of caution expected from a law-enforcement body in a democratic society. No martial law or state of emergency had ever been declared in the , and no derogation had been made under Article 15 of the Convention. The attack in question therefore has to be examined against a normal legal background. Even when faced with a situation where the population of the town was held hostage by a large group of well-equipped and well-trained fighters, the authorities\u2019 primary aim should have been to protect lives from unlawful violence. The use of indiscriminate weapons stands in flagrant contrast to this aim and cannot be considered compatible with the requisite standard of care that should be exercised in operations involving the use of lethal force by State agents (see Isayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0191).",

Nor does it overlook the fact that, as is apparent from the military documents, the only target that had been indicated as pre-selected in the attack of 19 October 1999 was located at a distance of one kilometre from Urus-Martan (see paragraphs 29, 30 and 81 above), whereas the residential quarter that came under attack on that date had not been mentioned in any of those documents at all.",

The Court does not overlook the Government\u2019s argument that at the relevant time active warfare was ongoing and that on the date of the incident in question Urus-Martan had been occupied by illegal fighters. However, it notes that, as can be ascertained from the documents produced, the town had been overtaken by the federal forces no later than on 7 and 8\u00a0December 1999 (see paragraph 114 above), and therefore the authorities could and should have become aware of the results of the attack of 19\u00a0October 1999 at that time.

Indeed, it is clear from the materials produced that a number of important items of evidence which might have been directly relevant to the attack in question, such as registers of orders given and received, registers of combat air missions, registers of military actions, tactical maps, tasking schedules, combat orders, reports on executed combat missions, photographs and tape-recordings, were destroyed a year, or even three months, after the attack (see paragraphs 108 and 111 above).",

Furthermore, the scene of the incident was not inspected until 3 and 5 October 2000 (see paragraph 87 above). Also, an expert examination of splinters seized from the scene of the incident on 5 October 2000 was not carried out until 25 June 2001 (see paragraph 89 above). The Court also finds it striking that it was not until 2\u00a0and 3 April 2003, that is almost three years after the beginning of the investigation, that the authorities finally took measures to dispose of unexploded bombs that remained lying in the courtyards of individual houses after the attack (see paragraph 129 above), although they were aware of the presence of those bombs for all that time (see paragraphs 52, 61 and\u00a0102 above).

The Court specifically notes the obvious unwillingness of the military authorities to assume responsibility for the strike in question and to investigate that incident properly. Indeed, for several years the military authorities denied that the attack had taken place at all (see paragraphs\u00a01820 and 22 above), and a military prosecutor\u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the attack of 19 October 1999, even though no meaningful inquiry into that incident appears to have been carried out before the decision to dispense with criminal proceedings was taken (see paragraph 30 above). Moreover, after such proceedings had been brought by the civilian authorities, on several occasions the military authorities refused to take over the investigation, returning the case file to the civilian authorities under various pretexts (see paragraphs 46 and 59 above).",

The Court is sceptical about the Government\u2019s argument that the second and third applicants had never shown any interest in the investigation, as it is clear from the documents in its possession that the first applicant, acting on their behalf, applied on numerous occasions to various authorities describing the incident in question and seeking to have it investigated and victim status granted to those concerned, including himself and the third applicant (see paragraphs 17 and 86 above). It is furthermore clear that the second applicant also applied, in her own name and on the third applicant\u2019s behalf, for information concerning the investigation, and, in particular, complained about the investigating authorities\u2019 failure to grant victim status to the third applicant (see paragraph 96 above). In any event, the Court reiterates that the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention, and that they cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2001III (extracts)).

Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). Therefore, as rightly pointed out by the Government, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has strong doubts that this remedy would have been effective in the present case. The materials in its possession reveal that the authorities only notified the first applicant of the decision of 17 November 2003, but did not furnish him with a copy. Moreover, he made it clear that he needed a copy of the decision of 17 November 2003 to be able to appeal against it before a court, but his request to that effect was explicitly refused by the authorities (see paragraphs 37 and 39 above).",

In other words, in the circumstances of the present case, the applicants would have had no realistic opportunity effectively to challenge the decision of 17 November 2003 before a court. Accordingly, the Court considers that it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government had a reasonable prospect of success (see, in a similar context, Chitayev and Chitayev v. , no. 59334/00, \u00a7\u00a7 140-41, 18 January 2007).

In the absence of any detailed explanations on the part of the applicants in this connection, the Court therefore finds that their claims in this part have not been substantiated.",

The Court has no doubt that there is a direct link between that violation and the pecuniary losses alleged by the second applicant in respect of the property. It further notes that the second applicant submitted a document attesting to the total surface area of the property and indicating that it had been partly destroyed and was unfit for human habitation (see paragraph 16 above). The second applicant based her calculations of the amount claimed on information concerning the price of a square metre of housing as indicated in the relevant decree of the Russian Ministry for Regional Development (see paragraph 222 above). The Court observes, however, that, as can be ascertained from that decree, it refers to the maximum price per square meter of housing in the  and makes no adjustments taking into account such circumstances as the type of housing, the area in which that housing is situated, etc. Moreover, the decree indicates a price for purchase rather than reconstruction of housing. Therefore, in the Court\u2019s opinion, it cannot be regarded as a reliable basis for calculating the actual value of the property in question to enable the Court to make an assessment of the amount to be awarded in this respect. The Court also does not overlook the fact that the first two applicants were two out of three co-owners of the property, the third co-owner not being a party to the proceedings before the Court. Therefore the second applicant, acting as the first applicant\u2019s heir and in her own name, can claim only two thirds of the amount that may be awarded for the damaged property in the present case. In such circumstances, the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR\u00a014,000 to the second applicant in respect of the pecuniary damage suffered by her and the first applicant because of the damage inflicted on the property at 24a .",
