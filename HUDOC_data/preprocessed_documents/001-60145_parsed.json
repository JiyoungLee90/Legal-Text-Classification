The competent authorities do not seem to have taken any action in response to the declaration of necessity made by the applicant on 2 May 1991. Until 2 May 1991, the applicant could not apply to either the judge dealing with the enforcement proceedings or the administrative court, which would not have been able to set aside the prefect\u2019s decision to give priority to any pending urgent cases, as that decision was an entirely legitimate one (see the Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy judgment cited above, \u00a7 56). After making the statutory declaration which gave her priority, although the statutory conditions for enforcement of eviction were satisfied (see the Scollo judgment v. Italy, 28\u00a0September 1994, Series A 315-C, \u00a7 39) she had no prospect of accelerating the grant of police assistance, which depended almost entirely on the availability of policemen. Furthermore, the Court notes that just before the eviction the authorities managed to allocate to the tenant a subsidised apartment: the Court has not been provided with any information as to why this could not be done earlier, nor as to whether the authorities made any efforts at all to allocate to her such an apartment prior to that date.",
