Secondly, they maintained that there was no relationship between the arbitration proceedings in the case and the ensuing enforcement proceedings, since the applicant company had allegedly acquired the debt pursuant to the contract of 10 February 2003 and not in accordance with the arbitration award.

Indeed, the word \u201ctribunal\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 is not necessarily to be understood as signifying a court of law of the classic kind, integrated within the standard judicial machinery of the country (see, inter alia, Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, pp. 72-73, \u00a7\u00a0201). It further considers that the Arbitration Tribunal was a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d, acting in accordance with the 1994 International Commercial Arbitration Act and internal procedural rules. The proceedings before the Arbitration Tribunal were similar to those before an ordinary State civil or commercial court and due provision was made for appeals to the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (as applicable at the material time), which could review the award on the grounds specified in the 1994 Arbitration Act. The Arbitration Tribunal remains the only arbitration body in  that may, in accordance with the 1994 Arbitration Act, decide on \u201ccommercial disputes with a foreign element\u201d. Under the 1994 Arbitration Act and section 3(1) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the Arbitration Tribunal\u2019s award is treated as equivalent to an enforceable court judgment.",

In particular, Articles 197-202 of Chapter 17 of the Civil Code allow the reassignment of debts and the conclusion of written agreements for their transfer. Furthermore, the applicant company\u2019s right to recover the debt owed to it by the Oriana company on the basis of the arbitration award and the agreement was upheld by the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Court of Appeal on 10\u00a0September 2004. The Court concludes therefore that the arbitration proceedings related to the determination of the original claimant\u2019s civil right. Following the transfer of the debt to the applicant company on the basis of the agreement of February 2003 and the recognition of the applicant company as a new debtor in September 2004, the ongoing enforcement proceedings involved the applicant company\u2019s rights and its civil rights in succession of those of the initial creditors.",
