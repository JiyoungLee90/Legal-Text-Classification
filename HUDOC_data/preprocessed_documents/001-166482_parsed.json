The applicant\u2019s initial medical examination at the Fo\u00e7a State Hospital did not reveal any findings other than a cut measuring 0.5\u00a0cm on his back between the tenth and eleventh ribs. However, a lung X-ray taken subsequently showed that a foreign object, which appeared to be a bullet, was lodged between his eleventh and twelfth ribs. The applicant was transferred to the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka State Hospital to receive further treatment for serious injuries sustained to his lungs and liver. After undergoing various operations, on 23 October 2008 he was discharged from the hospital. According to a medical report issued on 30\u00a0December 2008 by the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka State Hospital, it had been decided for medical reasons to leave the bullet inside the applicant\u2019s body, to be extracted only in the event of deterioration in the applicant\u2019s condition.

After photographing the site of the incident, they talked to the witnesses and the gendarmerie patrol unit on duty. According to the information they obtained, the applicant had collapsed abruptly while he was walking to meet his friends. No gunshots had been heard at the site of the incident, but a firing practice had been underway at the relevant time at the nearby military compound housing the 7th\u00a0Gendarmerie Commando Regiment. The gendarme officers indicated in their report that there were two shooting ranges within the said military compound: one located 1,780 metres to the north of the D\u00fcr\u00fcs farm, at an altitude of fifty metres (\u201cthe first shooting range\u201d); and the other 1,050\u00a0metres to the east, at an altitude of ninety metres (\u201cthe second shooting range\u201d). The altitude of the D\u00fcr\u00fcs farm was forty metres. There were three hills between the D\u00fcr\u00fcs farm and the first shooting range; the first two hills had an altitude of fifty-five metres, and the third hill had an altitude of ninety metres. No information was provided regarding the terrain between the farm and the second shooting range. Firing practice was carried out with G3 rifles at the first shooting range and with 5.56 mm rifles at the second shooting range. According to a sketch map prepared by the gendarme officers, the site of the incident was approximately 15 degrees to the east of the assumed trajectory of bullets fired from the first shooting range. In the gendarme officers\u2019 opinion, the applicant had been hit by a stray bullet that had ricocheted during firing practice, particularly in view of the fact that no evidence of criminal conduct had been found at the site of the incident. The only evidence collected by the gendarme officers was the jacket that the applicant had been wearing at the time of his shooting, which was handed to the \u0130zmir G\u00fcr\u00e7e\u015fme Criminal Police Laboratory for examination.",

The public prosecutor noted that the investigation had not thus far revealed any spent cartridges, bullet shells, arms or any other such material on or around the site of the incident, nor had any suspects who might have shot at the applicant been identified. According to the information provided by the applicant\u2019s three friends to the public prosecutor, the applicant had collapsed right before their eyes and there had been no one else present at the relevant time. They also told the public prosecutor that they often heard gunfire coming from the military compound during shooting practice and that gunfire had also been audible at the time of the incident, although they had not heard gun shots emanating from anywhere nearby.",

It is not clear whether this office was located inside the hospital or outside. Prior to the commencement of the interview, the applicant was informed of his right to request the appointment of a lawyer from the local bar association to assist him, but it appears that he did not exercise that right. The applicant told the gendarme officers that at approximately 8.45\u00a0p.m. on 14 October 2008, he had left his house to check up on the construction site where he worked as a watchman. As he had been walking towards the site, he had heard whizzing sounds above his head. He had continued to hear the same sounds on his way out of the construction site, along with the sound of gunfire from the military compound located nearby. Then, all of a sudden, he had felt a sharp pain in his back and had collapsed to the ground. He had not known what had happened until he had been told in the hospital that he had been shot in the back with a firearm. When the gendarme officers asked the applicant whether he had been in ongoing conflict with anyone and whether he had heard any gunshots at the time of the incident, he replied that he had not been in any conflict and that the only shots he had heard had been those coming from the military compound, which he had been hearing for the past week. The applicant also stated that he did not wish to press charges against anyone regarding the incident.",

He noted secondly that the forensic examination conducted on the applicant\u2019s jacket had revealed that the shot had been fired from a long distance; however, the source of the shot had not been identified, as the bullet had for medical reasons not yet been extracted from the applicant\u2019s body. Nevertheless, having regard to all the information in the case file and to the fact that a military firing practice had been underway a few kilometres away at the time of the incident, the public prosecutor found that the applicant had probably been hit by a stray bullet that had ricocheted during the firing practice. According to the public prosecutor, this offence was to be classified as one of causing bodily harm through negligence (taksir), as opposed to recklessness (bilin\u00e7li taksir), in view of the significant distance of the shooting range from the site of the incident. Since the prosecution of the offence of causing bodily harm through negligence required a formal complaint to be made by the victim (which was lacking in the instant case), the Fo\u00e7a public prosecutor decided to close the investigation.",

The criminal investigation into the incident had been closed on account of the applicant\u2019s decision not to bring an official complaint, and the bullet extracted from his body after the closing of the investigation had therefore not been subjected to a ballistic examination.

The public prosecutor explained that since the bullet had at that time not yet been removed from the applicant\u2019s body, it had not been possible to identify the gun from which it had been fired. He concluded, nevertheless, that the applicant had probably been hit by a stray bullet that had ricocheted during the firing practice carried out at the 7th Gendarmerie Commando Regiment at the material time. He further concluded that the applicant\u2019s wounding in such manner had constituted the offence of causing bodily harm through negligence, as opposed to recklessness, the prosecution of which depended on a formal complaint being first lodged by the victim. Since such a complaint was lacking in the instant case, the investigation could not be pursued any further. The applicant\u2019s argument that the investigation had been closed prematurely before many vital elements had been established was subsequently dismissed by the \u0130zmir Assize Court, despite the removal of the bullet from the applicant\u2019s body in the meantime.",
