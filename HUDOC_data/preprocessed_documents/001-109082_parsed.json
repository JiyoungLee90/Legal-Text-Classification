In the context of prisoners, the Court has had previous occasion to emphasise that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect them.

Dr\u00a0G. arrived at around 2.40 a.m., dressed the wounds and administered injections of cardiamine and other medicines. Mr Shumkov was then placed on a stretcher and transported to the medical unit, where he was found dead upon arrival as a result of heavy blood loss. He appears to have died between 2.40 and 2.45 a.m., the time of death being entered in the register as 2.40 a.m.",

He further stated that if he had arrived twenty to thirty minutes earlier he would still have been unable to save Mr Shumkov\u2019s life since there were arteries and veins slashed in both his arms. This statement prompts two conclusions. First, the provision of urgent medical aid was of critical importance when the prison officers discovered that Mr Shumkov had slashed his elbows. Second, they were bound to realise this since, given Dr G.\u2019s description of arteries and veins having been slashed and the whole cell being covered in blood upon his arrival, the bleeding from Mr Shumkov\u2019s wounds when the warders opened the cell must have been heavy enough to alert them to the gravity of the situation.
