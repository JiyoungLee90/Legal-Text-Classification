S. had stated that, just as at the time of his offences, the applicant still suffered from a dissocial personality disorder with marked psychopathic elements, as defined by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases, the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current, revised version).

That risk was particularly high when the applicant \u2013 whom the expert had concluded abused alcohol without being addicted, as defined by the ICD-10 \u2013 was drunk. Owing to his dissocial personality disorder, the applicant had hardly any inhibitions with regard to injuring others, as he lacked empathy.

As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to this Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpersons of unsound mind\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention (see\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0138 and 143-156 of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment).

Preventive detention was a measure of correction and prevention, a purely preventive measure designed to protect the public from dangerous offenders rather than punish criminal guilt (see \u00a7\u00a7 100-101 and 141142 of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment). The Federal Constitutional Court noted that this Court had considered preventive detention to be a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 102, 140). It considered that it was not necessary to align the constitutional notion of \u201cpenalty\u201d with its meaning under the Convention. Result-orientated recourse should rather be had to the assessments (Wertungen) under the Convention in order to prevent breaches of public international law (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 91 and 141 ss.).",

Firstly, it notes that, according to the findings of the domestic courts (see paragraph 18 above), the applicant\u2019s personality disorder with marked psychopathic elements, as defined by the ICD-10, was exacerbated by his abuse of alcohol. In this connection, it notes that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) equally permits the detention of \u201calcoholics\u201d. Without having to decide whether the requirements of those separate grounds for justification of a deprivation of liberty were also met in the applicant\u2019s case, the Court considers that the alcohol abuse rendered the applicant\u2019s personality disorder and its effects more serious. The extent of his personality disorder can indeed be said to have manifested itself in the manner in which he committed his offences. The offences were committed while he was under the influence of alcohol, involved randomly chosen victims and were characterised by gratuitous brutality. The Court would add that, having regard to the fact that the applicant was again found guilty of having committed assault while under the influence of alcohol at a time when he was in preventive detention (see paragraph 12 above), it is not convinced that there was no longer a risk that the applicant abused alcohol.",
