This right is implicit in the very notion of adversarial proceedings, and it can also be derived from the guarantees contained in subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 6. However, the personal attendance of the defendant does not necessarily take on the same crucial significance for an appeal hearing as it does for the trial. The manner in which Article 6 applies to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appeal court therein. In assessing whether any personal attendance was needed, regard must be had to, inter alia, the special features of the proceedings involved and the manner in which the defence\u2019s interests are presented and protected before the court of appeal, particularly in the light of the issues to be decided and their importance for the applicant. The abovementioned considerations are also applicable in respect of proceedings which concern an appeal on points of law (see Faig Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 60802/09, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27, 26 January 2017, with numerous further references).",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a025551/05, ECHR 2010). Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Ladygin v. Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30 August 2011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above; and Eon v. France, no. 26118/10, \u00a7 34, 14\u00a0March 2013). In other words, the absence of any \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant (see Adrian Mihai Ionescu, cited above). However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, inter alia, Mura, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 24).",
