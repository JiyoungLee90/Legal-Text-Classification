That fact, in conjunction with his admission that he had consumed alcohol (two drinks and a glass of wine) in a bar where he was having fun with his friends until the early morning of that same day, and with the above-mentioned reckless driving behaviour he showed by his speed, exceeding by far the permitted limit of 50 km/hour, the ignorance of danger and the overestimation of his skills, lead to the conclusion that indeed, the above-mentioned driver was under the influence of alcohol.

On the contrary, in civil courts the parties to the proceedings have the responsibility to adduce all evidence and the presumption of innocence is activated only if the parties adduce the acquittal decision of the criminal court to the civil court. In addition, each jurisdiction requires a different degree of judicial conviction. In criminal trial the principle in dubio pro reo prevails, whereas in civil trial, the judge needs to form full and certain opinion in order to admit that one bears civil responsibility.",

However, the reasoning of the civil courts must not question the acquittal by the criminal courts by, inter alia, referring that the defendant was acquitted due to doubts, or that he was acquitted by majority, or that the public prosecutor disagreed. The civil court must remain within the borders of the civil trial avoiding any considerations related to the criminal offence that are not relevant for the civil trial so as not to give the impression that it examines also the criminal offence. The use of expressions must be made carefully so as not to question the acquittal by the criminal court.

Sweden (dec.), no. 48518/99, ECHR 2003XI). By reference to the relevant articles of the joint ministerial decision, which for its part referred to the relevant article of the Traffic Code (see paragraph 11 above), the Court of Appeal made it clear that it had to examine an exemption clause of the insurance contract and no acknowledgment of criminal liability was intended (see Fleischner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067). The Court also notes that, according to the rules of domestic law, the outcome of the criminal proceedings was not decisive for the civil case. The insurance company had a right to rely on the exemption clause, regardless of whether the defendant was convicted or, as here, acquitted, and the compensation issue was to be the subject of a separate legal assessment based on criteria and evidentiary standards which differed in several important respects from those applicable to criminal liability (see paragraphs 20 - 25 above).",

Unlike criminal procedural law, the civil courts had to rely on the evidence presented by the parties and rules on the burden of proof applied (see Fleischner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067). While some of that evidence had also been the evidence presented before the criminal jurisdictions, such as the measurements of the alcohol in the applicant\u2019s blood, the civil jurisdictions were required to examine and re-evaluate the elements therein (ibid., \u00a7\u00a068). Furthermore, these elements were accompanied by other evidence, the totality of which was brought to the courts\u2019 attention in adversarial conditions, and it was on the basis of that totality of evidence that the Court of Appeal ruled and its decision was later upheld by the Court of Cassation (see, mutatis mutandis, Vella v. Malta, no.\u00a069122/10, \u00a7 59, 11\u00a0February 2014). In particular, it follows from the Athens Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusions that it took into account the measurements of the applicant\u2019s alcohol levels, but also his testimony before it and the speed of his car at the time of the accident in order to conclude that the insurance exemption clause should apply. The Court of Appeal made a separate assessment of the facts in order to determine whether the constitutive elements of an offence had been fulfilled, but also assessed the additional elements for establishing civil liability (see Fleischner, cited above, \u00a7 68). It did not set out first to demonstrate that the applicant had in fact committed a criminal offence in order then to be able to rule on the compensation claim (see, a\u00a0contrario, Lagard\u00e8re, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).",

In the circumstances of the present case, it notes that the Athens Court of Appeal used the expression \u201cwas driving under the influence of alcohol\u201d, as provided for by Article\u00a042 of the Traffic Code. In the Court\u2019s view this does not in itself present a problem, as the expression is not reserved for the criminal-law sphere but is equally used in the civil law of tort (compare N.A. v. Norway, no. 27473/11, \u00a7\u00a048, 18\u00a0December 2014) as certain elements of a penal provision\u00a0could be the basis for both criminal and civil liability (see Fleischner, cited above, \u00a7 63). Read in context of the judgment as a whole, the use of the said expression by the Court of Appeal in the instant case cannot reasonably be read as an affirmation imputing criminal liability on the part of the applicant. The Court also notes that the applicant himself has not put forward any allegations as regards the wording of the reasoning in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment or in that of the Court of Cassation which upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal.",

Nor did the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning contain any statement suggesting, either expressly or in substance, that all the conditions were fulfilled for holding the applicant criminally liable with respect to the charges of which he had been acquitted (see Ringvold, cited above, \u00a7 38).",
