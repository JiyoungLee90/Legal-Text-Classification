The case originated in an application (no. 20567/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Moldovan nationals, Mr Aurel Lozan, Mr Vitalie Samoil and Mrs Liliana Sângerean (“the applicants”), on 11 March 2002.
The applicants were represented by Mr Vladislav Gribincea, acting on behalf of the “Lawyers for Human Rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău.
The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicants complained that the failure to enforce the judgment of 4 November 1999 of the Centru District Court, which became final and enforceable on 25 October 2000, violated their right of access to court guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 7 October 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on admissibility, merits and just satisfaction.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicants are Moldovan nationals born in 1969, 1972 and 1965 respectively. They all live in Chişinău.
The applicants were employees of the Academy of Sciences of  (“the Academy”), the State’s highest scientific institution. They lived in separate rooms in a dormitory. The rooms had been allocated to them during their doctorate studies with the Academy between 1990 and 1997.
Following a Chişinău Local Council decision of 16 May 1996, by which the legal status of the building was changed from a dormitory to an apartment building, the Academy refused to issue occupancy vouchers in respect of the applicants’ apartments and to sign tenancy agreements with them.
On an unspecified date in 1999 the applicants brought an action against the Academy, seeking the creation of legal tenancies in their favour (see §§ 23 and 24 below). Notwithstanding the initiation of proceedings against the Academy and the fact that it had refused to sign tenancy agreements with the applicants, they continued to live in their flats, although Mr Aurel Lozan was periodically on mission abroad between 2001 and 2003.
By a judgment of 4 November 1999 the Centru District Court ruled in favour of the applicants and ordered the Academy to grant them legal tenancies. The Academy appealed.
On 31 January 2000 the  upheld the Academy’s appeal, quashed the judgment of 4 November 1999 and dismissed the applicants’ action. The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Appeal.
By a final judgment of the Court of Appeal of 6 June 2000 the applicants’ appeal on points of law was dismissed.
Following a request from the applicants, on 18 August 2000 the Prosecutor General’s Office lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice a request for annulment of the judgments of 31 January 2000 and 6 June 2000.
By a final judgment of 25 October 2000 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the Prosecutor General’s request for annulment, quashed the judgments of the  and of the Court of Appeal and upheld the judgment of the Centru District Court of 4 November 1999, ordering the Academy to grant the applicants legal tenancies. This would have permitted the applicants to sub-let their flats.
Following a request from the Academy, on an unspecified date in 2001 the Prosecutor General’s Office lodged with the Supreme Court of Justice a request for annulment of its judgment of 25 October 2000.
On 25 June 2001 the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the Prosecutor General’s request for annulment.
On 4 January and 20 February 2001 the applicants requested the Bailiff to enforce the judgment of 4 November 1999 and to oblige the Academy to grant the applicants legal tenancies.
On 5 December 2001 the Bailiff made an official report about the failure of the Academy to comply with the judgment of 4 November 1999.
On 4 December 2003, after the present application had been communicated to the Government, the Academy complied with the judgment of 4 November 1999 and issued the applicants with occupancy vouchers in respect of their flats. The applicants sent written declarations to the Government’s Agent, confirming that the judgment of 4 November 1999 had been enforced and that they did not have any pecuniary and non-pecuniary claims against the Academy.
The relevant domestic law concerning the enforcement of a final judgment was set out in Sîrbu and Others v. Moldova, nos. 73562/01, 73565/01, 73712/01, 73744/01, 73972/01 and 73973/01, § 12, 15 June 2004.
The MSSR Housing Code (Law No. 306 of 3 June 1983, still in force) provides that Moldovan citizens are entitled to possess flats owned by the State or municipal authorities or other public bodies (sections 1 and 6).
A decision on granting a flat has to be implemented by issuing the citizen with an occupancy voucher (ordin de repartiţie a încăperii de locuit) from the Local Council authority (section 50). The voucher serves as the only legal basis for taking possession of the flat designated therein and for the signing of a tenancy agreement between the landlord, the tenant and the housing maintenance authority (sections 50 and 53).
The flat is reserved for the tenant for the period when he or she and the members of his or her family are on mission abroad. The Local Council issues a certificate (certificat de protecţie), which should be presented to the landlord. If the tenant and the members of his or her family fail to return to the flat within six months of the date of expiry of the validity of the certificate, the landlord has the right to initiate judicial proceedings in order to terminate the tenancy agreement (section 65). During the period of validity of the certificate, the tenant has the right to sub-let the flat (section 66).
At any other time, the tenant has the right to sub-let the flat, with the consent of the members of his family and the landlord (section 77).
