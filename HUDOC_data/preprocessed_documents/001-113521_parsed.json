The Court further observes that at the relevant time in the event of non-payment the fine would be converted into a prison sentence for a term of at most 100 days, whereas one day would be imposed for each SIT 10,000 that remained unpaid.

It concluded that such a confusion of roles between complainant, witness, prosecutor and judge could self-evidently disclose a functional defect and prompt objectively justified fears as to the conformity of the proceedings with the time-honoured principle that no one should be a judge in his or her own cause and, consequently, as to the impartiality of the bench (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 127 and 128). As to the subjective approach, the Court analysed a number of aspects of the judges\u2019 conduct and found that the judges had failed to sufficiently detach themselves from the facts of the case as they had been personally insulted by the applicant\u2019s comments (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 130-31).",

Having said that, the Court finds that no other elements pointing to personal partiality on the part of Judge M. were brought forward by the applicant, nor can any be ascertained from the case file. In this situation it does not find it necessary to reach a conclusion on the basis of a subjective test, since the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee, which must in any event be respected (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",

The same judge, after receiving the appeal and before forwarding it to the , convicted the applicant under Article 109 of the CPC and imposed the sentence. The Court notes that the confusion of roles between complainant, witness, prosecutor and judge disclosed a functional defect and raised objectively justified fears as to the impartiality of the court (see,\u00a0Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 127).

In the present case, although the higher courts, in particular the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 18 and 21), appear to have power to quash the decision on the ground that the first-instance judge had not been impartial, they declined to do so and upheld the conviction and sentence. As a consequence, they did not cure the failing in question (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 134, and De Haan v. the Netherlands, 26 August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 52-55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV).",

In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant explained the claim with reference to statutory lawyer\u2019s fees rates and other itemised expenses only in so far as it concerned SIT 134,880 (equivalent to approximately EUR 600) and EUR 380. The remainder of the claim is unexplained. The Court therefore considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 980 for the proceedings before the Court (see Gaspari v. Slovenia, no.\u00a021055/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-3, 21 July 2009).",
