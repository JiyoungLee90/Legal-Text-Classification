It noted that the report drawn up by Dr\u00a0R., a neuropsychiatrist whom the applicant had consulted, had ruled out any form of dementia but had confirmed a slight cognitive impairment and some psychological fragility and vulnerability, rendering a protective measure necessary in view of the extent of the applicant\u2019s personal assets. The court agreed with Dr B. that the applicant had previously considered the management of his real property as a hobby, that he no longer had the physical and mental capacities for performing that task, that it was important that he be relieved of the said task of managing his business interests and tax returns, and that, similarly, he should no longer be allowed to dispose of his property. However, the court considered that the measure could be adjusted on the basis of the cognitive impairment noted, allowing him to hold a bank account and a cash withdrawal card.",

It noted that the applicant\u2019s daughter and M.S. accused each other of being primarily interested in the applicant\u2019s fortune, and that it was unclear whether the latter was being influenced by anyone. The UDAF added that the applicant was deeply affected by the conflict and that he seemed to consider marriage as a way of ensuring that he had someone at his side to assist him and to organise his daily life, and to avoid having to end his life on his own.",

Having pointed out that the applicant and M.S. were former alcoholics and that the applicant was apparently still drinking, the judge stated that he \u201cwas therefore only seeking greater safety in\u00a0 marriage in order to prevent a possible break-up and therefore the risk of ending his life alone\u201d. Furthermore, she considered that the lack of clarity as to the financial implications of the marriage was particularly worrying as the applicant was torn between his daughter and M.S., and financial considerations had manifestly led to a serious conflict between the two, quoting the UDAF\u2019s findings on that point. Without pronouncing on the religious dimension mentioned by the applicant, she concluded that the planned marriage as it stood was not in the applicant\u2019s interests. The applicant appealed.",

It noted that although the applicant had on several occasions expressed the wish to marry M.S., the serious disorders from which he had been suffering for several years had severely affected his judgment, as noted in the medical certificates of 14\u00a0March 2009 and 18\u00a0January 2010. Moreover, his anosognosia had prevented him from planning his joint life with his partner, taking account of the financial and legal implications of marriage. Furthermore, while the applicant seemed emotionally attached to his partner, the court noted that since they had been living together the applicant had been managing his affairs in an increasingly unreasonable manner, and his supervisor had not always been able to protect his interests. In particular, the applicant had had work carried out in the family apartment to the tune of 250,000 euros a few months after his wife\u2019s death, and had placed her furniture in storage under somewhat questionable conditions. The court of appeal also noted that a draft handwritten will had been prepared on 14\u00a0August\u00a02009 in M.S.\u2019s favour, observing that according to his lawyer\u2019s submissions, the applicant held assets of some 6,000,000\u00a0euros and had concluded with his deceased wife a universal community of assets contract. The court of appeal further noted that the applicant\u2019s relations with his daughter, M.D., had seriously deteriorated. The court of appeal concluded that although the inquiries ordered by the guardianship judge had mentioned the applicant\u2019s and M.S.\u2019s mutual affection, the psychopathological turn in his disorders and his failing perception of the realities of his finances were such that he could not give his informed consent to marriage.",

In its decision of 29 June 2012, the Constitutional Council noted that Article 460 (1) of the Civil Code did not prohibit marriage but rather permitted it with the supervisor\u2019s authorisation, the withholding of which could be brought before a court, which then had to organise adversarial proceedings. The court found that, having regard to the personal and pecuniary obligations stemming from marriage, the latter was an important civil act with which the said restrictions on freedom of marriage did not disproportionately interfere (see paragraph 20 above). The Court of Cassation, for its part, had dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law, firstly by citing the Constitutional Council\u2019s decision and secondly by ruling that the Paris Court of Appeal had lawfully reasoned its decision by analysing not only the relevant medical certificates but also the other documents on file, thus enabling it to deduce that the applicant was incapable of consenting in an informed manner to his own marriage (see paragraph 21 above).",

Unlike in situations where individuals are deprived of the right to marry under any circumstances (see, for example, Christine Goodwin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103), the obligation placed on the applicant to request prior authorisation for his marriage had been based on the fact that he was under a legal protection order, that is to say an enhanced supervision order. Accordingly, the authorities had a margin of appreciation, enabling them to provide him with effective protection depending on the circumstances, and thus to anticipate consequences liable to be detrimental to his interests. As regards Article 460 (1) of the Civil Code, the Court notes that that provision in fact preserves the right to marry, as confirmed by the Constitutional Council. It is true that some restrictions are laid down. However, the Court observes that those restrictions are properly regulated, with remedies under which restrictions on the right to marry can be subjected to judicial review, in the framework of adversarial proceedings. That was the situation for the applicant in the present case, since he availed himself of the remedies provided in domestic law and was able to make submissions in adversarial proceedings in order to contest the impugned decision (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above). Moreover, as stated by the Constitutional Council, the supervision system is aimed at protecting the interests of the supervisee and promotes the latter\u2019s autonomy as far as possible (decision\u00a0no.\u00a02012-260 QPC, cited above, \u00a7 5).",

Article 12 does not define the limits of possible interferences or make them subject to supervision of what is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to attain the \u201clegitimate aim\u201d pursued; it confines itself to stating that the right must be safeguarded \u201caccording to the national laws governing the exercise of this right\u201d (see Jaremowicz v. Poland, no.\u00a024023/03, \u00a7\u00a050, 5 January 2010). What conclusion should be drawn from this? Can it be deduced from the literal text of the Convention that the right to marry is less deserving of protection than the right to respect for private and family life? The Commission seemed to gainsay such an approach when it spoke of an \u201cabsolute right in the sense that no restrictions similar to those in para. (2) of Art. 8 of the Convention are expressly provided for\u201d (see X v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a06564/74, 21\u00a0May 1975), whereas the case-law of the Court would seem to suggest that Article\u00a012 provides a lower level of protection than Article 8. Thus the Court verifies whether the limitations introduced by domestic law restrict or reduce the right in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see L. v. the United Kingdom, no. , \u00a7\u00a034, 13\u00a0September 2005, and F. v. Switzerland, 18\u00a0December 1987, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 128). Or else, as in Frasik, it determines whether, \u201cregard being had to the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, the impugned interference [is] arbitrary or disproportionate\u201d (see Frasik v. Poland, no. 22933/02, \u00a7\u00a090, ECHR 2010), but without venturing to conduct a full review of proportionality. That is also the approach adopted by the majority of the Chamber (see paragraph 57 of the judgment).",

Whereas in hundreds of judgments the Court has widened the guarantees of Article 8, transforming them into a kind of \u201cumbrella\u00a0protection\u201d, it has treated the interpretation of Article 12 as a \u201cpoor relation\u201d. However, if the right to marry were not governed by a separate provision it could just as easily fall within the ambit of Article 8, as evidenced by the case-law on the rights of same-sex couples. Thus in its Schalk and Kopf judgment the Court interpreted the \u201cto marry\u201d concept set out in Article 12 in its historical context and only applied it to heterosexual marriage (see Schalk and Kopf\u00a0v. Austria, no.\u00a030141/04, \u00a7\u00a055, 24\u00a0June 2010), while analysing under Article 8 the authorities\u2019 rejection of a same-sex couple\u2019s application to marry (see Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094). Does not such case-law, which applies a different yardstick to same-sex couples and different-sex couples, lead to differing levels of protection? I would take the view that it contradicts the systemic interpretation method under which the Convention \u201cmust be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions\u201d (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a027765/09, \u00a7\u00a0171, ECHR 2012). Furthermore, such an interpretation is incompatible with the Court\u2019s jurisprudential premise that same-sex couples are just as capable as different-sex couples of entering into stable, committed relationships, and that they are in a relevantly similar situation to a different-sex couple as regards their need for legal recognition and protection of their relationship (see Oliari and Others v.\u00a0Italy, nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11, \u00a7 165, 21 July 2015; Schalk and Kopf, cited above, \u00a7 99; and Vallianatos and Others v.

He was alleged to have considered the management of his real estate as \u201ca hobby\u201d (see paragraph 9 of the judgment), his expenditure on refurbishment work in his apartment was considered unreasonable (see paragraph 17 of the judgment), he had reportedly not stopped drinking (see paragraph 16 of the judgment), but he was allowed to have a bank account and a cash withdrawal card (see paragraph 9 of the judgment).

It is true that M.S., as the applicant\u2019s wife, would have had joint control over the spending of his money. There again, however, her access could have been limited by restrictive measures at the financial level (restrictions on credit cards, limits on withdrawals from the applicant\u2019s account, etc.). Moreover, the real estate \u2013 apparently accounting for most of his assets \u2013 would have remained protected.

However, a restrictive measure adopted against the will of the person concerned should not, in my opinion, go beyond what is strictly necessary. Although the content of Article 460 (1) of the Civil Code is unobjectionable as such, its application in the circumstances of the present case, which resulted in a ban on marriage, is disproportionate.
