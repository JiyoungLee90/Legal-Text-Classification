It had been found that the next flight with an escort for the applicants\u2019 removal would not be available before 18 September 2007, and the prefect had not therefore shown a lack of diligence in organising the departure and limiting the length of the detention.

The European Union directive concerning the reception of aliens thus treats minors, whether or not they are accompanied, as a category of vulnerable persons particularly requiring the authorities\u2019 attention (see paragraph 42 above). To be sure, children have specific needs that are related in particular to their age and lack of independence, but also to their asylum-seeker status. The Court would, moreover, observe that the Convention on the Rights of the Child encourages States to take the appropriate measures to ensure that a child who is seeking to obtain refugee status enjoys protection and humanitarian assistance, whether the child is alone or accompanied by his or her parents (see, mutatis mutandis, Muskhadzhiyeva and Others, \u00a7 62).",

However, in view of the foregoing and the recent developments in the case-law concerning the \u201cchild\u2019s best interests\u201d in the context of the detention of immigrant minors (see Rahimi, cited above), the Court cannot agree with the arguments of the Government claiming that the children\u2019s best interests were upheld in the present case. The Court is of the view that the child\u2019s best interests cannot be confined to keeping the family together and that the authorities have to take all the necessary steps to limit, as far as possible, the detention of families accompanied by children and effectively preserve the right to family life. In the absence of any indication to suggest that the family was going to abscond, the measure of detention for fifteen days in a secure centre appears disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

The Court has considered treatment to be \u201cdegrading\u201d when it arouses in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and, possibly, of breaking their physical or moral resistance. Treatment has been held to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily or intense physical and mental suffering. The threat of conduct prohibited by Article\u00a03, provided it is sufficiently real and immediate, may be in conflict with that provision and may constitute, at the very least, inhuman treatment. To my mind, the facts of this case are sufficient to establish that the threshold for the \u2018minimum level of severity\u2019 required under Article\u00a03 has been crossed.",
