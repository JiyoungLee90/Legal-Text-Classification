The District Court had made all necessary efforts to obtain the opinion in question, including by imposing fines on one of the experts for her delay in submitting the opinion requested. Accordingly, this period could not be considered an unreasonable delay attributable to the State. The Government further stressed that the applicant, who had joined the proceedings as the heir of his father, had not been present at any of the hearings. His absence had further contributed to the protraction of the proceedings.",

He argued that the questions which had been put to the agricultural experts had not been too difficult to answer and could not justify the courts\u2019 inability to appoint a competent expert or to hold a hearing between 15 November 1995 and 21 October 1998. Moreover, despite the fact that an expert eventually submitted his opinion on 8 July 1998, the first instance judgment was only delivered on 30 October 2000. Furthermore, the applicant stressed that, even though the case had not been particularly complex, it had taken nine years and six months for the courts to decide on it. As regards the Government\u2019s statement that the applicant himself had contributed to the protraction of the proceedings by failing to appear at hearings, he claimed that no hearings on the merits had been held following his father\u2019s death. His presence in court had not therefore been necessary. Lastly, the applicant highlighted what had been at stake for his father in the proceedings, namely compensation for the disability suffered in an accident. It was therefore wrong that they had lasted so long.",

It is to be noted that the experts were acting in the context of judicial proceedings under the supervision of the judges trying the case. The judges therefore remained responsible for the preparation of the case and the conduct of the hearings within a reasonable time (Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, p. 13, \u00a7 30). It is to be recalled that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, Duclos v. France judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp.\u00a02180\u201381, \u00a7 55 in fine). ",

The Court notes, however, that fines were only imposed on two occasions, and as late as December 1997 and January 1998. After that, yet another expert had to be appointed who only submitted his opinion in July 1998. In these circumstances it cannot be maintained that the court\u2019s actions resulted in any significant acceleration of the proceedings. The Court considers that the delay in the proceedings must be mainly attributed to the national authorities.",
