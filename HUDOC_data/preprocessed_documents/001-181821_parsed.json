In this context, the applicant explained that, while it was true that the increase in value had been effected at the second hearing at which the claimant had been represented by a Croatian lawyer, the reason was that the lawyer had been instructed to represent the claimant just before the court hearing of 1\u00a0February 2005 and so had not had sufficient time to prepare for the case.

The grounds for using this remedy related to the explicitly enumerated serious procedural breaches and/or erroneous application of the substantive law explicitly mentioned in section 385 of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 33 above).

Moreover, the claimant could have amended the value of the dispute when his Croatian lawyer had joined the proceedings but he had failed to do so. Instead, he had changed the value at a stage when, according to the relevant law and the constant practice of the Supreme Court, this was no longer possible without amending the initial civil claim as provided under the relevant domestic law. In addition, they pointed out that the position of the respondents had to be protected in the proceedings. In this case, the respondents had had a legitimate expectation that the case would end at the appeal stage without further examination by the Supreme Court. On the other hand, the applicant could not have had any legitimate expectation that she would have access to the Supreme Court, particularly since her predecessor had made the decisive error concerning the indication of the value of the subject matter of the dispute by seeking to change the value when it was no longer possible to do so under the applicable procedural rules. Moreover, in the Government\u2019s view, it could not be considered that the value of the dispute, initially set at HRK 10,000, had been manifestly erroneous. In any event, the State could not bear responsibility for the claimant\u2019s initial choice of a lawyer from Montenegro and the actions taken by that lawyer. In addition, the Government pointed out that Montenegrin and Croatian civil procedure law originated from the same former Yugoslav legislation which had allowed the lawyer from Montenegro to effectively represent the applicant.",

At all events, in the Government\u2019s view, this was a property issue that should be addressed under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not under Article 6 of the Convention. The Government pointed out that the applicant\u2019s predecessor had never asked for exemption from the payment of court fees. He had also had an opportunity to request a return of the erroneously calculated fee in the period of one year from the moment of its payment (until 5 June 2007), but he had never made such a request. In these circumstances, although the first-instance court\u2019s error in its calculation of the costs and expenses of the proceedings was regrettable, the Government did not consider that this was sufficient in itself to find a violation of Article 6.",

Indeed, there is no dispute between the parties that the ratione valoris restrictions on access to the Supreme Court are generally permissible and, for the purpose of this provision, legitimate. Moreover, in view of the fact that it is impossible to expect a uniform model for the functioning of the supreme courts in Europe, and having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law on the matter (see paragraph 83 below), there is no reason in the present case to put in doubt the legitimacy and permissibility of such restrictions or the domestic authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation in regulating their modalities.",

The \u201cordinary\u201d appeal on points of law, which is in issue in the case at hand, is the one referred to in section\u00a0382(1)\u00a0(1) of the Civil Procedure Act. It concerns disputes where the value of the contested part of the judgment exceeds a certain threshold (HRK 100,000 at the material time).

On the other hand, the \u201cextraordinary\u201d appeal on points of law concerns cases where an \u201cordinary\u201d appeal on points of law is not allowed. It is regulated under section 382 (1) (2) of the Civil Procedure Act and concerns cases in which the \u201cdispute depends on the resolution of a substantive or procedural question which is important for securing consistent application of the law and the equality of citizens\u201d. In the framework of either of the two forms of appeal on points of law, the Supreme Court can quash the lower courts\u2019 judgments and remit the case or, in some instances, overturn the impugned judgment.

In making that assessment, the Supreme Court relied on section 40 (3) of the Civil Procedure Act, which states that the value of the subject matter of the dispute may be changed by the latest at the preparatory hearing or, if no preparatory hearing has been held, at the first session of the main hearing before the respondent has begun litigation on the merits of the case.
