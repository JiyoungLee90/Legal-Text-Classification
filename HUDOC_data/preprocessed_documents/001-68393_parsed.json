Austria (dec.), no.\u00a074159/01, 9\u00a0October 2003). In the Court\u2019s view, a detailed examination as to whether the applicant could have made more efficient use of the remedy by using it at other stages of the proceedings, would overstretch the duties incumbent on an applicant pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see mutatis mutandis Wohlmeyer Bau GmbH\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a020077/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 8\u00a0July 2004). This is all the more so, as the applicant has used the remedy not only once but on two occasions, namely on 16\u00a0March 1994 and again on 27 July 1995. The Court further notes that the proceedings at issue were pending before the Administrative Court for about three and a half years, namely between 27\u00a0March\u00a01998, when the latter court requested the applicant to supplement his complaint, and 20\u00a0September 2001, when it rendered its decision and that no remedy lies against delays caused by the Administrative Court. The Court concludes that the applicant complied with his obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. Thus, the Government\u2019s objection on non-exhaustion has to be dismissed.",

Another eleven months passed by before that authority, on 5\u00a0June\u00a01996, decided in the matter.
