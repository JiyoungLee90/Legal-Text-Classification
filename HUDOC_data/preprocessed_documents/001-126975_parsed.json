Banco di Napoli, the domestic court upheld the claimants\u2019 arguments, holding that they had a right to remain under the system of perequazione aziendale even following the entry into force of Law no. 503/92. The same was confirmed in a number of other judgments in various jurisdictions, including the Court of Cassation (for example, judgments nos. 1388/00 and 12912/00) and more specifically the Court of Cassation in its ultimate formation, namely sitting as a full court (Sezione Unite). The latter in its judgment (no. 9024/01) of 3\u00a0July 2001 upheld the claimants\u2019 argument on the basis of the interpretation of Law no. 503/92 and Laws nos. 497 and 449 of 1996 and 1997 respectively, which explicitly made reference to perequazione aziendale, confirming that it had not been abrogated by the 1992 laws. The impugned amendments applied solely to persons still employed and not to persons who had retired on or before 31 December 1990. In consequence, the contested right was legitimately due to the former Banco di Napoli employees who had retired by 31 December 1990, for the period between 1\u00a0January 1994 (date when a general suspension of pension adjustments ceased) and 26 July 1996 (date when a new suspension of such adjustments started in respect of the Banco di Napoli).",

Indeed, the interpretative nature of the norm was evident since it had confirmed one of the possible meanings of the original 1992 text, which had also been upheld in some jurisprudence. The impugned law had been reasonable because it aimed to achieve recognition of an equal and homogenous treatment of all pensioners under the current integrative regimes. Moreover, this law had not augmented contentious proceedings since it had rendered their outcome foreseeable. As to the other inconveniences mentioned by the Court of Cassation, it considered that these arose from a random number of circumstances and was not sufficient to consider the norm unconstitutional. It further considered that the legislator could enact interpretative laws, once they were based on one of the possible meanings of the original text even if there had been consistent jurisprudence about the matter, and this did not affect the role of the Court of Cassation.",

According to the applicants, its sole purpose was to thwart the consolidated interpretative orientation which had been adopted by the domestic courts (including the highest court \u2013 the Court of Cassation in its ultimate formation, sitting as a full court), namely that the relevant provisions of the 1992 law did not apply to persons who had retired by 13 December 1990. Following the enactment of Law no.\u00a0243/04 the domestic courts were bound to find against the applicants. Thus, the State had influenced the result of proceedings, defining their merit and rendering further hearings useless, violating the independence of the judiciary and interfering in the administration of justice. Indeed, the introduction of the 1997 law only confirmed that the 1992 law had not abolished harmonisation regarding long-standing pensioners. Otherwise there would have been no need to enact such a law. Neither would there have been any need to intervene again in 2004. The State had felt the need to introduce the 2004 legislation only because the courts had adopted a unanimous orientation in favour of the applicants and persons in their position.

Thus, the general public had not benefited in any way; it was solely the two private banks which had benefited since they were able to recover or save the sums which the domestic judges had deemed to be due to pensioners such as the applicants. Moreover, this law only affected pensioners from the two mentioned banks and thus was consciously directed to affect these specific disputes. It therefore had nothing to do with a general pension reform, namely the harmonisation following Law no. 449/97, and in fact the applicants were not contesting the effects of that law. Moreover, the applicants had to suffer such repercussion only because of the unreasonable delay in the proceedings, which had started in 1994, as opposed to others who obtained their dues because they were lucky enough to have concluded their proceedings. Furthermore, such disputes had been nearing an end and there was little chance of new disputes arising given that persons affected would by then have been octogenarians, only a few of them were still alive, and also because of the applicable prescriptive periods. This factor diminished even more the need for any such allegedly interpretive intervention twelve years after the original law was enacted.",

Hundreds of judgments in various courts, at different instances, had been delivered in favour of persons in the applicants\u2019 position, precisely in line with the Amato reform. As in fact highlighted by the Government there had been only one exception, namely the Court of Cassation judgment no. 6767 of 1998, which moreover did not concern ex-employees of the Banco di Napoli but other claimants who were seeking the application of a law abrogated in 1977. Indeed the reference made to the subject matter in that judgment had not even been warranted by the scope of that case. More importantly, following the 2001 judgment of the Court of Cassation, all judgments had followed in that direction, namely finding in favour of the applicants, thus, the matter had been definitively resolved. Moreover, the literal, logical and systemic contents of the cited legislation could not allow for any other interpretation.

The Government, however, were of the view that one had to consider that the interpretation of the relevant laws had been controversial up to the Court of Cassation judgment (sitting as a full court) of 2001. Thus, the legislature\u2019s intervention through the enactment of Law no. 243/04 was to ensure respect for the original will of the legislator. Indeed, the meaning given by Law no.\u00a0243/04 to the laws at issue had been one of possible meanings, an option which had sometimes also been upheld by the domestic courts. They referred to the Court of Cassation judgment no. 6767, 10 July 1998. Thus, the legislator had simply chosen, out of the different meanings available, the one which reflected its original will and which they considered was in conformity with the ratio legis of the Amato reform.",

The instant case is also different from the case of OGIS-Institut Stanislas, OGEC Saint-Pie X and Blanche de Castille and Others v. France (nos.\u00a042219/98 and 54563/00, 27 May 2004) cited by the Government, where the applicants also attempted to derive benefits as a result of a lacuna in the law, which the legislative interference was aimed to remedy. In the said two cases the domestic courts had acknowledged the deficiencies in the law at issue and action by the State to remedy the situation was predictable (\u00a7\u00a7 112 and 72 respectively). However, in the present case, there had been no major flaws in the law, and, before the enactment of Law no. 243/04, the domestic courts had been practically unanimous about the interpretation of the relevant legal provisions, particularly following the judgment of 2001 by Italy\u2019s highest court. Indeed, the Government have submitted only one example of a different interpretation, which is, moreover, dated 1998. Against that background it is difficult to consider that the legislator opted for one of the available interpretations, and even less can it be accepted that it aimed at restoring the original intention of the legislator, which is neither apparent from a reading of the law, nor from the uniform interpretation given to it by the domestic courts. Given also that in twelve years of application of the law there had been a solid interpretation in favour of the applicants, a legislative interference (shifting the balance in favour of one of the parties) in the present case, unlike in the abovementioned cases, was not foreseeable. Lastly, the Court cannot ignore the effect of Law no. 243/2004 as explained in the Arras judgment, in conjunction with the method and timing of its enactment (see Zielinski, cited above, \u00a7 58 and Papageorgiou v. Greece, 22 October 1997, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI), namely it being tabled in parliament by an ex Banco di Napoli consultant (a matter not contested by the Government), twelve years after the coming into force of the law and after scores of cases finding against the said bank throughout the entire country.",

The Court reiterated that in creating a scheme of benefits it is sometimes necessary to use cut-off points that apply to large groups of people and which may to a certain extent appear arbitrary (see Twizell, cited above, \u00a7 24). While it was true that the impugned legislation affected a small number of people, mainly octogenarians who were previously employed by the Banco di Napoli and whose proceedings were still pending, the Court considered that, particularly bearing in mind the wide margin of appreciation afforded to States in this sphere, the impugned cut-off date was reasonably and objectively justified (\u00a7 68). The fact that the impugned cut-off date arose out of legislation enacted pending the applicants\u2019 proceedings did not alter the above conclusion for the purposes of the examination under Article 14.",

Accordingly, the applicants only lost the more favourable augmentation according to a perequazione aziendale. Thus, the Court considers that the applicants were obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction, rather than the total deprivation of their entitlements (see, conversely, Kjartan \u00c1smundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2004IX).",

Against this background, bearing in mind the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pension system and the fact that the applicants endured commensurate reductions, the Court considers that the applicants were not made to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Arras, cited above, \u00a7 83).",
