In 2007 its members decided to discontinue the organisation\u2019s registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation by the State. In particular, they complained of the refusal of the Ministry of Justice to register amendments to the organisation\u2019s articles of association, the repeated freezing of its bank account, the arbitrary arrest of its members, attempts to shut down its newspaper, among other things. Several of the organisation\u2019s leaders requested political asylum in western countries. It was decided to continue the organisation\u2019s activity under the same name but without registering it with the State authorities. It was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation\u2019s successor. After removal of the organisation from the Government\u2019s list of non-governmental organisations on 2 June 2008, Hyde Park\u2019s activities continued as before on the basis of its new articles of association. The association continued editing its newspaper, its Internet page and continued staging protests and demonstrations.",

On 24 February 2006 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants\u2019 action, finding that the Municipal Council had lawfully rejected its application and upholding all the reasons relied upon by it. Moreover, the court gave a new reason in favour of the Municipality\u2019s decision not to authorise the demonstration, namely that in its request for authorisation, Hyde Park had failed to correctly indicate the aim of its protest. In particular, it indicated that the protest was intended to be against the manner in which the contest was organised. Later, during the proceedings, it submitted that the intention was to protest against the non-transparent manner in which the televoting in Moldova had taken place.",
