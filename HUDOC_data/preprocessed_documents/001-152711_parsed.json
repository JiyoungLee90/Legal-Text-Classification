It acknowledged that there was a significant public interest in being informed about practices employed in the field of insurance, and that this interest was liable to be weightier than the individual interests at stake. However, it considered that the applicants could have achieved their aims by other means entailing less interference with the broker\u2019s private interests, for example by commenting on the Ombudsman\u2019s annual reports or interviewing the Ombudsman\u2019s staff or customers who were dissatisfied with their broker\u2019s services. It also found that instead of filming the meeting with a hidden camera, the journalist could have drawn up a record of the conversation, although it acknowledged that the probative value of that method would obviously have been less striking. Lastly, it held that the filming of a single case was insufficient to provide reliable evidence of the scale of the alleged problems, since examples of malpractice in this field were widespread and common knowledge. The public could therefore not draw general conclusions about the quality of advice given by insurance companies from the broadcasting of an isolated example.",

The subject of the programme, which had aimed to draw public attention to malpractice in the field of private insurance in Switzerland, was of considerable public interest. Moreover, journalists were free to choose the methods they wished to employ to carry out their investigations. A realistic portrayal of the situation had been necessary in this particular case; otherwise, the broker could have successfully brought a civil claim against the journalists. The deterrent effect of the judicial decisions in issue was extremely significant, bearing in mind the absolute nature of the Federal Court\u2019s findings. The applicants pointed out that they had given the broker the opportunity to respond to the criticisms after the recording and before the broadcast, and that he had refused to do so.",

Such methods were permissible only if certain highly restrictive conditions were satisfied and in the case of extremely serious offences. The Federal Court\u2019s decision in the present case had clearly been issued in relation to the specific circumstances, and not in general terms. The Government noted that the Federal Court had acknowledged that there was a considerable public interest in being informed of any shortcomings in the field of selling life insurance, but had found that the report broadcast in the present case had simply highlighted problems that were already well known, without revealing anything new. They agreed with the Federal Court that the journalists could have produced a transcript of the conversation without recording it, or could have used other, lawful, means, and that it was not the journalists\u2019 task to gather absolute proof.

These duties and responsibilities are liable to assume particular significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual or, more generally, infringing the \u201crights of others\u201d. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be released from their ordinary obligation to verify their information and not publish factual statements that are defamatory. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the allegations in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable in that respect (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78, and T\u00f8nsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v.\u00a0Norway, no. 510/04, \u00a7 89, 1 March 2007).",

It was not disputed among the parties that the use of this technique was permitted only where there was an overriding public interest in the dissemination of the relevant information, provided that such information could not be obtained by any other means. The Court has already established that the report concerned a matter of public interest. It considers that what is important at this stage is an assessment of the applicants\u2019 conduct. Although the broker might legitimately have felt that he had been deceived by the journalists, they nevertheless cannot be accused of having deliberately acted in breach of professional ethics. They did not disregard the rules on journalism as laid down by the Swiss Press Council (see paragraph 29 above) limiting the use of hidden cameras, but instead inferred \u2013 incorrectly, in the view of the Federal Court \u2013 that the subject of their report entitled them to obtain information by those means. The Court notes that the Swiss courts themselves were not unanimous on this question, since they acquitted the applicants at first instance before subsequently convicting them. That being so, the Court considers that the applicants should be given the benefit of the doubt as to whether they really intended to comply with the ethical rules applicable to the present case regarding the method used to obtain information.",

In the majority\u2019s view, however, the two rights at stake do not carry comparable weight. Special importance is accorded to freedom of expression, bearing in mind the matter of public interest forming the subject of the report (see paragraphs 56-59 of the present judgment). The same cannot be said of the broker\u2019s right to respect for his private life. In paragraph 64 the majority consider that the recording entailed only limited interference with the broker\u2019s interests, given that only a restricted group of individuals had access to it. In paragraph 65 they add that, when the recording was broadcast, the applicants took steps to ensure that the broker would be less recognisable by viewers.

In finding that the applicants\u2019 conduct could not be excused on the ground of justification \u2013 that is, by a reason allowing them to disobey the criminal law \u2013 the Federal Court does not appear to have been arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable in its assessment. Having regard to the interests at stake, I likewise do not consider that the applicants\u2019 conviction was disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued by the law, and thus conclude that there has been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.",
