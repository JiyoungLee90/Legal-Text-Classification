Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, it was the public prosecutor who requested that the District Court seek an opinion from the Medico-Legal Authority. The applicants had only requested a supplementary investigation by the police. The case was adjourned from January 1995 to December 1997 without the applicants having any means of accelerating the submission of the Authority\u2019s opinion. It was necessary to have the opinion before any witnesses could be heard. The hearing of the witnesses then lasted about one year and five months, which was within a normal time-frame. Given that the case involved some 6,000 pages of documentation, the applicants considered that no blame could be placed on them for having requested an extension of the time-limit for filing and completing their appeal to the Court of Appeal.",

While conceding that the delay in the submission of the opinion of the Medico-Legal Authority was rather long, the Government noted that it was caused in part by the fact that the experts who were asked to submit their opinion failed to meet their deadlines, though repeatedly reminded thereof by the police and the Authority.
