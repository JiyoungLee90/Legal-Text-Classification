The reopened proceedings ended on 9 July 2007 when the issue was finally determined by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation. Thus, applying its case-law in respect of the period to be taken into account, the Court considers that the period between 20 May 1999 and 30 January 2001 should be discounted from the global length of the proceedings since during this period the issue pending before the domestic courts was not a dispute concerning the determination of the applicants' civil rights and obligations but whether or not to grant reopening.",
