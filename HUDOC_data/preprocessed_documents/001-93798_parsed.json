There had been Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the town. The armed men who had abducted Khizir Tepsurkayev had driven around in military vehicles, including APCs and UAZ vehicles. The police officers who had witnessed the abduction had confirmed that Khizir Tepsurkayev\u2019s abductors were under the command of officer V. Vasiliy and were carrying out an identity check. The abductors had fired a number of shots without fear of being heard by law enforcement agencies located in close proximity to the place. All the information provided to the applicant from the criminal case file supported her assertion as to the involvement of State agents in the abduction. Since Khizir Tepsurkayev had been missing for a very lengthy period, he could be presumed dead.

Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were significantly delayed or were not taken at all. For instance, as can be seen from the decision of the Town Court of 22 November 2004, by that time the investigators had not established the owners of the APCs and UAZ vehicles which had moved around Urus-Martan on 27 August 2001; they had failed to identify the officers who had been in charge of the security operations conducted in Urus-Martan on that date, as well as the military servicemen who had participated in these operations. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

Moreover, the court\u2019s instructions to the district prosecutor\u2019s office to investigate the crime effectively did not bring any tangible results for the applicant. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
