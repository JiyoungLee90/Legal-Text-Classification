It was issued on 5 April 2006 in a case concerning a dispute about overtime pay for security workers who worked twentyfourhour shifts at a radio relay station. As with the present applicants, the security workers also operated on the basis of continuous work of twenty-four hours and time off for the subsequent twenty-four hours. The Court of Cassation found it established in that case that the workers had not worked continuously for that period as they had been paired up by the employer to allow one person to work and the other to rest. According to the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation\u2019s Civil Division, that arrangement meant that each worker spent an average of twelve hours on duty, of which one hour had in any case to be set aside for the mandatory rest period. In decisions adopted on 14 June 2006 and 21 March 2007, which concerned similar disputes involving other radio relay station workers, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation\u2019s Civil Division held that irrespective of whether the work was carried out in shifts or pairs, the actual time worked would be taken as fourteen hours in workplaces where twenty-four-hour work shifts were the norm. According to those decisions, an average person would not be able to work continuously for twenty-four hours and would need to take an average of ten hours off for their physical needs, such as resting, sleeping and eating (no. E.2006/9-374, K.2006/382, and E.2007/9176, K.2007/164).",

The Court of Cassation, having examined the circumstances of their case, the arguments of the parties and the findings of the first-instance court, came to the conclusion that the approach it had taken concerning overtime in workplaces with twentyfourhour shifts in its well-established case-law, which had up to then concerned only radio relay station workers, had also to be followed in the applicants\u2019 situation (see paragraph 27). It reasoned in that connection that it would not be possible for an employee to work continuously for twenty-four hours without setting aside any time for rest. Therefore, in the opinion of the Court, it cannot be convincingly argued that the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision to quash the first-instance court\u2019s judgment lacked reasoning or failed to take into account the arguments of the applicants. Nor does the fact that the Court of Cassation gave an unfavorable interpretation of domestic law suggest, in and of itself, that its reasoning suffered from arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness.",

                                                "content": "53.\u00a0\u00a0The Court considers that the core of the applicants\u2019 arguments was that the Court of Cassation should have interpreted the law, including its own case-law, as entitling employees to overtime pay when they were physically present at the workplace, regardless of whether they actually performed any tasks. According to the applicants, such a line of interpretation would have been the correct approach to take on the facts of their case, which had been duly established by the first-instance court. Although the Court is mindful of the fact that the Court of Cassation\u2019s interpretation of the domestic law had a direct effect on the outcome of the proceedings, it is unable to agree with the applicants that the interpretation as such constituted a procedural flaw in the conduct of the domestic proceedings so as to render them unfair. For the Court, the reasoning given by the Court of Cassation pertained to the substantive limitation on the right to overtime in the particular context of twenty-four-hour shift work. It is not for this Court to question under Article 6 of the Convention whether the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation of what counts as overtime hours was appropriate since that would effectively involve substituting its own views for those of the domestic courts as to the proper interpretation and content of domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 101, ECHR 2001V). The Court reiterates in that regard that it is a principle of Convention case-law that Article 6 does not in itself guarantee any particular content for civil rights and obligations in national law. The Court may not create by way of interpretation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 a substantive right which has no legal basis in the State concerned (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088). In the Court\u2019s view, the Court of Cassation\u2019s well-established case-law defined the contours of the right to overtime and the substantive limitations on it. The case-law seems to have taken into account the customary practices of workplaces with a twenty-four-hour work shift and time off for the next twentyfour or forty-eight hours. It thus concluded that out of twentyfour hours spent at the workplace, only fourteen would be considered as working time given the time that would need to be set aside for rest, which was in accordance with the domestic law. Finally, it has been consistent in the application of the principles derived from its case-law to employees in similar conditions. Against this background, the Court does not have sufficient grounds to conclude that the Court of Cassation\u2019s interpretation of domestic law was based on a manifest factual or legal error, resulting in a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d (see Moreira\u00a0Ferreira, cited above, \u00a7 85).",

For example, work to be carried out in pursuance of a freely negotiated contract cannot be regarded as falling within the scope of Article\u00a04 on the sole ground that one of the parties has undertaken with the other to do that work and will be subject to sanctions if he does not honour his promise.
