The applicants had been involved in activities against the Iranian administration during their stay in Turkey and for reasons of national security their residence in Turkey had not been deemed appropriate by the Turkish authorities.

As to the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, deportation orders had been issued in conformity with Article\u00a032 of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cthe Geneva Convention\u201d) and the applicants had been notified of the deportation orders in the presence of a translator.

By laying down that any deprivation of liberty should be \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires, firstly, that any arrest or detention should have a legal basis in domestic law (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a050, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). The Convention here refers essentially to national law and establishes the need to apply its rules, but it also requires that any measure depriving the individual of liberty must be compatible with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May 1985, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 93).
