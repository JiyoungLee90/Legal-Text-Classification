They stressed that even if regard was had to the applicant\u2019s injuries and medical treatment, the lapse of time between her injuries and the beginning of the criminal investigation had been too long to allow an effective investigation. They further noted that some of the applicant\u2019s statements were not supported by the materials in the case file or by other sources. In particular, they found no support for the applicant\u2019s assertion that a \u201chumanitarian corridor\u201d had been announced on 23 January 2000 or that any route had been designated for it. The Government referred to other cases reviewed by the Court concerning events in the Staropromyslovskiy district of Grozny in January 2000, in which the applicants had not mentioned such information. They also noted that despite the applicant\u2019s submissions, no other victims of the same attack could be identified. Finally, the Government reminded the Court that until early February 2000  had been the scene of fierce fighting between the Russian federal troops and illegal armed groups, and that the wounding of the applicant could not be unilaterally attributed to the State without further proof.",

The situations where deprivation of life may be justified are exhaustive and must be narrowly interpreted. The use of force which may result in the deprivation of life must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in Article 2 \u00a7 2 (a), (b) and (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims. In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0146150, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0324; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

The same applies to an attack where the victim survives but which, because of the lethal force used, amounted to attempted murder (see Isayeva and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a057947/00, 57948/00 and 57949/00, \u00a7\u00a0171, 24 February 2005, with further references).",

The statements by the eyewitnesses to the events support the applicant\u2019s version, whereas the majority of persons who were questioned by the investigation in July and August 2002 were not in  at the material time and therefore could not provide any useful information on the applicant\u2019s claim.

In the absence of any indications to the contrary and in view of the hostilities that broke out in  after October 1999, the Court finds it reasonable to assume that the applicant held both jobs simultaneously. Therefore, she was not employed after October 1999 and received no salary at the time of the injury. The Court furthermore finds that the applicant\u2019s claim that she was unable to work as a teacher in the following years is unsubstantiated, as it was never alleged that she was disabled to a degree which would make her unfit for work.
