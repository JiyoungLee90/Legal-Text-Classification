In particular, the District Court noted the applicant\u2019s potential to influence his accomplice, Mr G. (the prosecution\u2019s main witness in the case against the applicant), and stressed that firearms had been found in the applicant\u2019s car during his arrest and that he was skilled in combat and fighting military techniques, as well as that he had a serious military experience. The District Court took into account the investigator\u2019s argument that there was a serious risk of the applicant tampering with witnesses, including with other members of his criminal group by mounting threats against them and their family members. In addition, the investigators argued, and the District Court found it convincing, that the applicant was attempting to contact other members of the criminal group to plot their defence, in particular taking into account his authority within the criminal group and his connections to the criminal underworld. The District Court linked the applicant\u2019s potential to reoffend to, among other things, the fact that, in addition to the firearms discovered in the applicant\u2019s car, a large arsenal of firearms had been found in the accomplices\u2019 houses. It finally noted the applicant\u2019s potential to abscond given his frequent travelling to various regions of the Russian Federation prompted by the nature of his activities. The District Court concluded that no alternative measure of restraint could mitigate the cited risks. That decision became final on 21\u00a0March 2012 when the St. Petersburg City Court upheld it on appeal having fully accepted the District Court\u2019s reasoning.",

Having mentioned the risk of collusion and, in particular, possible threats to witnesses from the applicant, the District Court relied on handwritten statements by Mr G. and a Mr K. expressing fear for their lives and lives of their relatives. In addition, the District Court noted that a number of members of the criminal group were on the run, which provided ground to conclude, that if released, the applicant could use his influence to interfere with the investigation.

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2005\u2011I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Naydyon v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a016474/03, \u00a7 63, 14\u00a0October 2010; Savitskyy v.

The Court cannot emphasise enough the special importance attached to interim measures in the Convention system. Their purpose is not only to enable an effective examination of the application to be carried out but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; such measures subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise the execution of the final judgment. Interim measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7 125; Shamayev and Others v.

The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument. It reiterates that the aim of the interim measure in the present case, as formulated in the Court\u2019s decision of 3 October 2013, was to obtain an independent medical expert assessment of the state of the applicant\u2019s health, the quality of the treatment he was receiving and the adequacy of the conditions of his detention for his medical needs. That expert evidence was necessary to decide whether, as the applicant argued, his life and limb were at real risk as a result of the conditions of his detention, including the alleged lack of requisite medical care. In addition, the Court was concerned with the contradictory nature of the medical evidence submitted by the Government and the applicant in response to its request under Rule 54 \u00a7\u00a02 (a) of the Rules of Court for provision of information on the applicant\u2019s health and the amount of medical aid he received in detention.

The main purpose of the interim measure, as indicated by the Court in the present case \u2013 and the Government did not pretend to be unaware of it \u2013 was to prevent the applicant\u2019s exposure to inhuman and degrading suffering in view of his poor health and his remaining in the conditions of a detention facility that was unable to ensure that he received, as he argued, adequate medical assistance.",

However, it is dispensed from the necessity to rule on those issues in view of the decision taken by the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of St. Petersburg. In particular, on 20 May 2014 the District Court declared the report of 21\u00a0October\u00a02013 invalid, having criticised the doctors for having failed to correctly assess the applicant\u2019s medical condition, as well as for their decision to issue that report in the absence of the personal examination of the applicant (see paragraph 43 above). The District Court even went as far as to accentuate the possible damage which the report could have produced in the process of the assessment of the evidence by the Court in the present case. In these circumstances, the Court does not need to discuss the report of 21\u00a0October 2013 any further.

France, no.\u00a067263/01, ECHR 2002IX), the Government stressed that the applicant had received comprehensive medical care in detention. They relied on evidence enclosed with their reply of 1 November 2013. The Government further challenged the reliability of the medical reports commissioned by the applicant from various medical experts. In particular, they argued that the biggest flaw of those examinations, in comparison with those provided to the Court by the Government, was that neither of the applicant\u2019s experts had examined him in person. They also stressed that although the applicant had provided the experts with various medical documents describing his health, those documents were not \u201cofficial\u201d records reflecting the essence of the medical treatment provided to him. The Government therefore proposed that the Court dismiss the expert reports as inadmissible and declare the applicant\u2019s complaint as manifestly ill-founded.",

While having acknowledged that the reports commissioned by his counsel from civil experts had not been performed on the basis of his personal examination, he insisted that they had been issued by very respected civil medical specialists, including a doctor who had later participated in the preparation of the report of 16 May\u00a02013. The reports were also prepared on the basis of his entire medical file. Furthermore, the reports prepared by the experts both in response to the request from the defence and those from the prosecution confirmed that the applicant did not have adequate access to necessary medical specialists, such as an infectious diseases doctor or herpetologist, he was not subjected to necessary testing, including fibroscopy, and he was not seen by medical personnel frequently enough as was required by his condition, including in the cases of medical emergencies. He also stressed that the Russian authorities had failed to comply with the recommendations of the medical experts. The applicant argued that the expert reports submitted by him disclosed serious failings in his medical care in detention. In his opinion, the Government did not submit any evidence which could have rebutted that conclusion. The applicant concluded that the Russian authorities violated his rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention as they were unable to provide him with the requisite level of medical services and were subjecting him to severe suffering and a significant risk of a fatal outcome.",

It reiterates that, in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention  conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. In accordance with its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein).",

The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

Thorough evaluation of his condition on the basis of the relevant diagnostic procedures, such as sputum smear or drug resistant tests, was significantly delayed or was entirely absent in respect of certain health problems (see paragraphs 19, 20 and 22 above). There was no adequate diagnosis in response to the increasing number of his health-related complaints. The treatment he received was incomplete, resulting in the applicant having developed complications, such as toxic hepatitis due to the overdose of anti-tuberculosis drugs (see paragraph 32 above). The medical supervision afforded to him was insufficient to maintain his health. The medical personnel of the detention facilities did not take sufficient steps to address his concerns and they did not apply the recommendations of the experts commissioned by the applicant, having, in so far as it concerned the development of the concomitant illness, limited their assistance to a mere recording of the negative dynamics (see paragraphs 23 and 34 above). The inability of the applicant to receive necessary medical services in detention was confirmed by the St. Petersburg City Court which, having relied on the expert report of 16 May 2013, stressed the applicant\u2019s need for the complex permanent and dynamic medical supervision and treatment, including a surgical one, which could only have been provided to him in a specialised medical facility by specialists in several related fields of medicine. The Russian court\u2019s unequivocal conclusion that the medical care the applicant received in detention was not capable of securing his health and well-being and preventing further aggravation of his condition served as the ground for his release.",

A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons justifying his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v.

Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v.\u00a0Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007 II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the fact that the applicant had resources and connections in other regions of the Russian Federation, including through his work and previous experience of frequent traveler, and that he had a weighty military experience, and the flowing special skills which could have, presumably, helped him in concealing his whereabouts. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts\u2019 finding that it was necessary to continue the applicant\u2019s detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the persistence of a risk of his absconding (see, for similar reasoning, Sopin v. Russia, no. 57319/10, \u00a7\u00a042, 18\u00a0December 2012, and Mkhitaryan v. Russia, no. 46108/11, \u00a7\u00a093, 5\u00a0February 2013).",

The Court reiterates the applicant\u2019s arguments that the fact that he was seriously ill, with his state of health continuously deteriorating and the need to remain under constant medical supervision, considerably reduced the risk of his absconding. While not being convinced that the applicant\u2019s medical condition entirely mitigated the risk of his absconding so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, the Court is of the opinion that the risk of collusion was such that it could not be negated by the changes in the applicant\u2019s state of health to the extent that his detention was no longer warranted.",

Those included the organisation of a stable criminal group to commit several counts of aggravated kidnapping, extortion, robbery and possession and trafficking of firearms. The national courts stressed the organised nature of the crimes, involving a number of apprehended defendants and a number of suspects still on the run. The authorities considered the risk of pressure being brought to bear on the parties to the proceedings to be real, and in such circumstances insisted on the necessity to keep the applicant detained in order to prevent him from disrupting the criminal proceedings. The Court reiterates that the fear of reprisal, justifiable in the present case, can often be enough for intimidated witnesses to withdraw from the criminal justice process altogether. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the safety of the witnesses and victims who had already given statements against the applicant, together with the prospect of other witnesses\u2019 willingness to testify, against the applicant\u2019s right to liberty (see Sopin, cited above, \u00a7 44). It also does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that the Russian courts authorised the applicant\u2019s release with the specific reference to the fact that the proceedings against him had reached an advanced stage with the collection of evidence having been completed and thus the risk of collusion having been negated.",

(extracts); and Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a7 72 et seq., 1 June 2006). In the present case, the domestic courts cited specific facts in support of their conclusion that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings, having assessed the evolving circumstances and the changes that affected the applicant\u2019s situation in the course of his detention. They also considered the possibility of applying alternative measures, but found them to be inadequate (see, for similar reasoning, Buldashev v. Russia, no. 46793/06, \u00a7 99, 18 October 2011 and Bordikov v. Russia, no. 921/03, \u00a7 92, 8 October 2009.",

In these circumstances, the Court also accepts that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources within a lengthy time-frame to which the suspected criminal activities extended, coupled with the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the applicant\u2019s alleged criminal activities, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for extending the applicant\u2019s detention for the time necessary to collect evidence, complete the investigation and proceed to the trial stage. The Court thus concludes that, in the circumstances of this case, the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice actually did exist, and it justified holding him in custody (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, 4\u00a0May 2006, and \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no.\u00a028481/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05960, 15\u00a0January 2008). The Court concludes that the circumstances of the case as described in the decisions of the domestic courts, including the applicant\u2019s personality and the nature of the crimes with which he was charged, reveal that his detention was based on \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds.",

The time that elapsed between the commission of the crimes and the institution of the criminal proceedings was another factor that complicated the investigators\u2019 task. The Court is mindful of the fact that the authorities needed to balance the necessity to proceed with the investigation against an obligation to ensure that the applicant was fully fit to take part in it. The national authorities displayed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. They completed the investigation, provided the defence team with an ample opportunity to study the case file and proceeded to the trial within less than twenty months. There is no indication that the authorities had, in any way, delayed that procedural action. In these circumstances, the Court reiterates that while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the authorities\u2019 efforts to clarify fully the facts at issue, to carefully reflect on whether the offences were in fact committed, to investigate every plausible version of events, including those which give the applicant the benefit of a reasonable doubt and to provide the defence with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 64).",
