None the less, they maintained that, despite the fact that neither the Supreme Court nor the Constitutional Court had clarified in their respective case-law at the time the seizure had been imposed whether book-entry shares fell within the scope of that provision, the case-law of the ordinary courts had answered this question in the affirmative, as evidenced by the Prosecutor General\u2019s interpretative guideline (see paragraph 52 above). The principles enshrined in this caselaw were subsequently embodied in the CCP, with the amendment which entered into force on 1 January 1998. Moreover, the interpretation of book-entry shares as movable items was also borne out by the records of the debate preceding the adoption of the Securities Act in Parliament. The Government further pointed out that Article 89 \u00a7 16 (previously Article\u00a089\u00a0\u00a7\u00a013) of the Criminal Code, which entered into force on 1\u00a0January 1998, stipulated that the provisions governing items were applicable to securities. They further asserted that the seizure of items had been subject to judicial control under Article 80 of the CCP and, subsequently, from 1\u00a0January 2002 onwards, under Article 79c taken in conjunction with Article 79a of the CCP. As regards the procedural safeguards available to the applicant company, the Government maintained that the seizure could have been appealed before the Constitutional Court and that the applicant company could have lodged an application under Article 80 of the CCP requesting that the seizure be lifted or, after 1\u00a0January\u00a02002, challenged the decision to seize under Article 79c of the CCP directly.",

The freezing of the shares thus amounted, in the applicant company\u2019s view, to de facto deprivation of its property. The Government asserted that the situation constituted a control of property within the meaning of the third sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court notes that the applicant company did not allege that it had lost its status as holder of the shares. It further observes that not all of the rights relating to the shares were suspended by the original seizure, the applicant company having been entitled, inter alia, to receive dividends, to challenge resolutions of general meetings or to propose the convening of general meetings. Moreover, the voting rights attached to the shares were suspended only in June 2006. Therefore, the Court considers that the situation in question could not be regarded as a deprivation of property. Accordingly, it is the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 which is applicable (see Capital Bank AD v. , no.\u00a049429/99, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2005-XII (extracts), with further reference to, mutatis mutandis, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108, \u00a7 51, and Bosphorus Hava Yollari Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

However, that does not dispense with the need for the Court to determine whether the interference in issue complied with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (ibid.). The Court further recalls that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a\u00a0public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful (see Capital Bank AD v.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. The Court further reiterates that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. They can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, for example, Cantoni\u00a0v. France, judgment of 15\u00a0November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7\u00a035, and Chauvy and Others\u00a0v.

It notes that neither the Criminal Code nor the CCP specified before 1 January 1998 whether the prosecuting authorities were empowered to seize book-entry shares, the statutes in question providing for the seizure of \u201citems\u201d in general. Nor did the case-law of the Supreme Court and the  clarify the issue at that time. As to the existence of the domestic courts\u2019 practice alleged by the Government with reference to the Prosecutor General\u2019s interpretative guideline, the Court accepts that the requirements of foreseeability and clarity of the law may be satisfied if the matter in question can be solved by means of the application of principles enshrined in settled domestic practice, including a practice having a certain degree of authoritative effect.",

The same conclusion must be made with regard to the ordinary courts\u2019 practice referred to by the Government and by the  in the reasoning of its decision rejecting the applicant company\u2019s constitutional appeal. Consequently, the Court is not in a position to conclude that the case-law whose existence is alleged by the Government could have made the interpretation of Article 79 of the CCP unequivocal, as that case-law must be considered inaccessible to the applicant at the time of the original seizure. Furthermore as regards Czech practice, the Court observes that, when they were published in 1998, the legal opinions adduced by the Government (see paragraphs 53 \u2013 55) had not arrived at the same conclusions when addressing the issue whether the term \u201citem\u201d in Article 79 of the CCP encompassed book-entry shares before 1\u00a0January 1998. That jurisprudence cannot therefore be regarded as interpreting unambiguously the scope of application of Article 79 of the CCP before 1 January 1998. In these circumstances, the Court observes that at least two interpretations of the scope of application of Article 79 of the CPC existed at the relevant time.",

The Court notes in this regard that the seizure took place in consequence of the business transaction concluded by the applicant company in the course of its professional activities. Given the unsettled business environment of the Czech Republic of 1990 and the considerable volume of that transaction, it considers that the applicant company, if dealing with due care, presupposing inter alia legal assistance, could not be regarded as lacking a reasonable opportunity to foresee the consequences of acquiring the securities, including the impossibility of ruling out the risk that the securities might be subsequently seized. This conclusion applies a\u00a0fortiori to the situation after 1 January 1998, when Article 89 \u00a7 13 of the Criminal Code was amended so as to bring securities within the ambit of the provisions governing items, and even more so with the entry into force on 1\u00a0January 2002 of Article 79c of the CCP providing explicitly for the seizure of book-entry shares.",

Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000-XI). Moreover, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental rights be, in certain cases, subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the measures and the relevant evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050963/99, \u00a7 123, 20 June 2002). It is true that Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision (see Fredin v.  (no.\u00a01), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0192, \u00a7\u00a050). Nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision. In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v.

As regards Article 80 of the CCP, the Court observes that it provides, inter alia, for the lifting of a seizure measure in pre-trial proceedings by the prosecutor when the seized item is no longer required for the criminal proceedings and its expropriation or confiscation can be ruled out. Thus, it is a legal instrument which makes it possible, not to appeal directly a decision on seizure, but rather to react to a change in the circumstances under which an item was seized. Furthermore, decisions under Article 80 of the CCP and appeals against them are adopted by a\u00a0prosecutor (see paragraph 48 above) and not by a court, at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings. It is true that the seizure of book-entry shares became reviewable by a court with the amendment of the CCP, which introduced Article 79c CCP taken in conjunction with Article 79a of the CCP and with Article 146a of the CCP as amended. However, the correspondingly worded legal provisions entered into force only on 1\u00a0January 2002.

Here, the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation and the Court will respect their judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This necessarily applies, and perhaps to a greater extent, in the event of changes to a country\u2019s political system (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v.  [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR\u00a02000-XII). As for the requirement of proportionality, any interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must achieve a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure interfering with property rights of individuals (see, among other authorities, Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, \u00a7 38, and Malama, cited above, \u00a7 48). In determining whether both requirements are met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing how the measures are to be implemented and to ascertaining whether the consequences of implementation are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 75, ECHR 1999-III).\u00a0\u00a0Under the Court\u2019s case-law, the character of interference, the aim pursued, the nature of property rights interfered with, and the behaviour of the applicant and the interfering State authorities are among the principle factors material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicants.",
