However, it considers the amounts claimed to be excessive. In this connection, the Court observes that at the admissibility stage one of the applicant\u2019s complaints was declared inadmissible. It is therefore appropriate to reimburse only in part the costs and expenses alleged by the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Sakkopoulos v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a061828/00, \u00a7\u00a059, 15 January 2004). Having regard to the elements at its disposal and on the basis of an equitable assessment, the Court awards the applicant EUR 3,000 for the costs incurred before the Italian authorities and EUR 2,500 for the costs relating to the European proceedings, and therefore the global sum of EUR 5,500.",
