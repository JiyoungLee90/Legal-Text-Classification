The Court observes that the administrative proceedings in question had had the same object throughout their duration, namely the real property, and were aimed at remedying the expropriation which occurred in 1957. The Court notes however that, as stressed by the Government (see paragraph 33 above), the applicant by modifying the subject matter of the proceedings in July 1997 instituted de facto a new set of proceedings under Article 156 \u00a7 1 of the Polish Code of Administrative Procedure (CAP). It follows that for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and having regard to the requirements of the six-month rule contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court will only consider the length of the final set of the proceedings \u2013 namely the proceedings initiated in July 1997, which ended on 21 December 2005.
