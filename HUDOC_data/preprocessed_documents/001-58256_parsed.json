In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public, including the accused. Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. In deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Hauschildt judgment cited above, p. 21, \u00a7 48).",

That kind of situation may give rise to misgivings on the part of the accused as to the impartiality of the judges. However, whether such misgivings should be treated as objectively justified depends on the circumstances of each particular case; the mere fact that a judge has already taken decisions before the trial cannot in itself be regarded as justifying anxieties as to his impartiality (see the Hauschildt judgment cited above p.\u00a022, \u00a7 50).",

Despite the fact that the Supreme Court had said in its judgment of 14 November 1994 that the approach taken by the Central Military Court could not be regarded as an investigative measure capable of undermining the objective impartiality of the trial court (see paragraph 18 above), the wording used by the chamber of the Central Military Court that heard the appeal against the auto de procesamiento, which included in particular judges E.S.G. and R.V.P., could easily be taken to mean that it finally adopted the view taken by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 20\u00a0January 1992 that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to allow of the conclusion that a military offence ha[d] been committed\u201d (see paragraph\u00a014 above).",
