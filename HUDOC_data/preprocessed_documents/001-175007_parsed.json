Relying, in particular, on the 16\u00a0September 2010 decision of the Constitutional Council (see paragraph 16 below), it held that \u201cthe provisions of national law applied [to the applicant] were such as to reconcile respect for private life and the protection of public order in a manner that was neither manifestly unbalanced nor in breach of the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention\u201d. In connection with the substantive aspect of the offence, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s plea that a sample had already been taken from his headgear during his police custody and that he was entitled to refuse further sampling, given that there had been no DNA profiling the first time.",

The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should, in particular, ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored, and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored. The domestic law should also comprise safeguards capable of effectively protecting the personal data recorded against inappropriate and wrongful use (see B.B., cited above, \u00a7 61), while providing a practical means of lodging a request for the deletion of the data stored (see B.B., cited above, \u00a7 68, and Brunet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43).",

The Court notes that that forty-year period in principle constitutes a maximum which should have been adjusted under a separate decree. Since no such decree has ever been issued, the forty-year period is, in practice, treated as indefinite storage, or at least as a norm rather than a maximum (see M.K., cited above, \u00a7 45, and Brunet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043), particularly in the case of persons of mature age.",

To date, no appropriate action has been taken on that reservation (see paragraphs 14 and 42 above). Thus, the Court notes that no differentiation is currently provided for according to the nature and/or seriousness of the offence committed, notwithstanding the significant disparity in the situations potentially arising under Article 706-55 CPP. The applicant\u2019s situation bears witness to this, with events occurring in a political/trade-union context, concerning mere blows with an umbrella directed at gendarmes who have not even been identified (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above), contrasting with the seriousness of the acts liable to constitute the very serious offences set out in Article 706-55 CPP, such as sex offences, terrorism, crimes against humanity and trafficking in human beings, to mention but a few. To that extent the instant case is very different from those specifically relating to such serious offences as organised crime (see S. and Marper, cited above) or sexual assault (see Gardel, B.B. and M.B., cited above).",
