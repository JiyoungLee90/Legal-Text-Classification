This approach was later confirmed in several Russian and Ukrainian cases concerning the supervisory review system, almost identical in two countries (see Volkova v.

The Court finds no reason to depart from its reasoning in the aforementioned Ryabykh and follow-up cases. It concludes that the setting aside of the judgment of 21 September 1999 in supervisory review proceedings for the sake of correcting an alleged judicial error violated the principle of legal certainty enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and constituted an unjustified interference with the applicant\u2019s possessions, protected by virtue of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1 to the Convention.",

Ukraine, no. 77317/01, \u00a7 50, 18 January 2005). The Court notes, at the same time, that the applicant claimed only RUR\u00a040,000 under this head.
