The Court considered that while the domestic law in force at that time (Article 92 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure) provided for summoning by means of public notice, the way in which the Romanian courts applied the law was too formalistic. In particular, the courts had not been diligent in ensuring that defendants had been informed of the date of the hearings and had thus failed in their obligation to ensure effective participation in the proceedings (ibid., \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a032-35).",
