The ground for his application was that on 8 July 1998 the Olsztyn District Court had named him and his sister as the inheritors of their parents\u2019 property. On 6\u00a0November 1998 the District Court asked the applicant to produce a decision proving that the entry in the register was not consistent with the legal status of the property, failing which his application would be dismissed. On 14 January 1999 the applicant complained about that requirement to the \u0141om\u017ca , but without success. On 3\u00a0February 1999 the Land Registry Division of the District Court rejected his application to have the entry in the register rectified.",

The Court further notes that when conducting the negotiations for the sale or rent of the property (see paragraph 17 above), after the applicant had been listed in the Land Register (see paragraph 16 above) and while the application for acquisition of title to the property through adverse possession was pending, the authorities treated the applicant as the owner of the property.

Since the \u2019s decision, the State authorities have done all they can to delay the restitution of the property (see paragraph 54 above). All the proceedings instituted directly or indirectly by them have resulted in infringements of the applicant\u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",
