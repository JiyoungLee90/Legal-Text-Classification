Section 1 of that statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms (for example in order \u201cto enforce the laws, decrees and decisions of the relevant authorities or to disperse public gatherings or suppress mutinies\u201d), without being liable for the consequences. These provisions were modified by Article 133 of Presidential Decree no. 141/1991, which authorises the use of firearms in the situations set forth in Law no. 29/1943 \u201conly when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted\u201d. Law no. 29/1943 was criticised as \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201cvague\u201d by the Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court (see Opinion no. 12/1992). Senior Greek police officers and trade unions have called for this legislation to be updated. In a letter to the Minister of Public Order dated April 2001, the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), an advisory body to the government, expressed the view that new legislation which would incorporate relevant international human rights law and guidelines was imperative (NCHR, 2001 Report, pp. 107-15). In February 2002 the Minister of Public Order announced that a new law would shortly be enacted, which would \u201csafeguard citizens against the reckless use of police weapons, but also safeguard police officers who will be better informed as to when they can use them\u201d.",

Admittedly, the  Administrative Court of Appeal had found the State responsible and had already awarded damages. But the breach of Article 2, as found by this Court, cannot be remedied exclusively by an award of compensation previously granted by the domestic courts to the relatives of the victim. In my view, the claim of non-pecuniary damage presented by the applicant under Article 41 of the Convention is clearly distinguishable from the claim presented before the domestic courts. In other words, I find it contradictory to decide that the applicant can still claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (paragraph 48) and then to hold that the finding of a violation of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction within the meaning of Article 41 of the Convention.",
