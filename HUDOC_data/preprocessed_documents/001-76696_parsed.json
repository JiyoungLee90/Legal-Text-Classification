However, under Rule 55 of the Rules of Court, any plea of inadmissibility must be raised by the respondent Contracting Party in its written or oral observations on the admissibility of the application. Accordingly, the normal practice of the Convention organs has been, where a case has been communicated to the respondent Government, not to declare the application inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, unless this matter has been raised by the Government in their observations (see Citizens of Louvain v. Belgium, no.\u00a01994/63, Commission decision of 5\u00a0March 1964, Yearbook 7, p. 253, at p. 261; K. and T. v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no.\u00a025702/94, \u00a7\u00a0145, ECHR 2001VII; N.C. v.

As no possibility for outdoor or out-of-cell activities was provided, the applicant would have had to spend in his cell \u2013 which was situated in the basement \u2013 practically all of his time, except for the two short visits per day to the sanitary facilities or the occasional taking out for questioning or to court (see Peers, cited above, \u00a7 75 and I.I. v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 74). The Court considers that the fact that the applicant was confined for practically twenty-four hours a day during more than three months to his cell without exposure to natural light and without any possibility for physical and other out-of-cell activities must have caused him considerable suffering. The Court is of the view that in the absence of compelling security considerations there was no justification for subjecting the applicant to such limitations. In so far as the Government failed to submit observations on this complaint, no such considerations have been put forward for assessment by the Court.",
