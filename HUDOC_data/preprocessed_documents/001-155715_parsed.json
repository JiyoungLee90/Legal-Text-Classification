The host was Nicky Campbell and there were a panel of three or four experts, if I can call them that, one of whom certainly was a rabbi, when there was a discussion which touched upon the plot to blow up airliners and terrorism and the facts giving rise to this case were to some extent touched upon. Did anybody, 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, watch that programme? Could you come forward, please, sir.",

Please do not do that. There was an element of inaccurate and unsatisfactory reporting at the time this matter first came to light. The allegations were not accurately reported in every instance and it is critically important that you decide the case upon the evidence that you hear in court and nowhere else. We tell jurors in all criminal cases not to carry out any research of their own. In a typical pub fight case we tell jurors not to go and have a look at the pub, not to turn themselves into sleuths because what is critical is you decide the case only upon what you hear in court. The defendants are entitled to know the basis and the exact basis upon which they are being tried. So, accordingly, please do not, either before the case starts tomorrow or indeed at any stage, carry out any internet research or indeed any research of any kind. I will also give you further instructions not to read any newspapers or listen to any television reports. The reason for that is sometimes they are inaccurate, sometimes they are speculative and they are always partial reporting. The only way you can hear and receive all the evidence is by being here in court, listening to it. That is where you receive the information.",

The lapse of time since the last exposure may increasingly be regarded, with each month that passes, in itself as some kind of a safeguard. Nevertheless the risk that the widespread, prolonged and prejudicial publicity that occurred in this case will have a residual effect on the minds of at least some members of the jury cannot be regarded as negligible. The principal safeguards of the objective impartiality of the tribunal lie in the trial process itself and the conduct of the trial by the trial judge. On the one hand there is the discipline to which the jury will be subjected of listening to and thinking about the evidence. The actions of seeing and hearing the witnesses may be expected to have a far greater impact on their minds than such residual recollections as may exist about reports about the case in the media. This impact can be expected to be reinforced on the other hand by such warnings and directions as the trial judge may think it appropriate to give them as the trial proceeds, in particular when he delivers his charge before they retire to consider their verdict.",

The test applied when considering an application for an abuse of process is whether it is possible for the defendant to have a fair trial. The court must consider what measures can be taken to reduce the impact of prejudicial publicity \u2013 for example, by giving warnings to jurors.

Contempt and an abuse of process have different standards of proof (contempt beyond reasonable doubt, abuse of process on the balance of probabilities). The abuse of process test needs to account for the cumulative effect of publicity, given that the issue is whether a fair trial is possible in all the circumstances and the effect that media coverage has had on the independence and impartiality of the tribunal. In contrast, the contempt test is necessarily focused on individual publications, because to hold media organisations in contempt for contributing to a climate of \u2018trial by media\u2019, where their individual publications would not give rise to a substantial risk of serious prejudice, could contravene article 10. In consequence, we consider that it would be a mistake to align the tests for whether there has been an abuse of process because of prejudicial media coverage and whether there has been a breach of section 2(2). Do consultees agree that the tests for whether there has been an abuse of process because of prejudicial media coverage and whether there has been a breach of section 2(2) should remain distinct?\u201d (footnotes omitted)",

The collective experience of this constitution as well as the previous constitution of the court, both when we were in practice at the Bar and judicially, has demonstrated to us time and time again, that juries up and down the country have a passionate and profound belief in, and a commitment to, the right of a defendant to be given a fair trial. They know that it is integral to their responsibility. It is, when all is said and done, their birthright; it is shared by each one of them with the defendant. They guard it faithfully. The integrity of the jury is an essential feature of our trial process. Juries follow the directions which the judge will give them to focus exclusively on the evidence and to ignore anything they may have heard or read out of court. No doubt in this case [the judge] will give appropriate directions, tailor-made to the individual facts in the light of any trial post the sentencing hearing, after hearing submissions from counsel for the defendants. We cannot too strongly emphasise that the jury will follow them, not only because they will loyally abide by the directions of law which they will be given by the judge, but also because the directions themselves will appeal directly to their own instinctive and fundamental belief in the need for the trial process to be fair.\u201d",

He emphasised in particular that the 2010 report had found that jurors serving on high-profile cases were almost seven times more likely to recall media coverage than jurors serving on standard case and that in high-profile cases, twenty per cent of jurors who recalled media reports said that they had found it difficult to put the reporting out of their minds while serving as jurors. The 2012 Law Commission paper supported his argument that the risk of each publication should have been addressed separately, by reference, inter alia, to the area of circulation of the publication in question, the number of copies circulated, the prominence of the article in the publication, directions to the jury and the delay between publication and trial. The applicant contended that the difficult challenges produced by the multiple publications of different kinds had received no individualised assessment by the trial judge, who had simply concluded, after summarising the content of some of the offending material, that his experience informed him that he could ensure impartiality by directing the jury appropriately.",

The material suggested that the applicant was far more deserving of conviction for reasons that the jury had not been permitted to know.

They argued that four points emerged from the Court\u2019s case-law on the question of adverse publicity (referring to Mustafa (Abu Hamza), cited above). First, there was a risk that adverse publicity, particularly when unremitting and sensational, might prejudice a jury but the domestic case-law showed that English courts were well aware of that risk. Second, in the majority of cases the nature of the trial process and the role of the trial judge in directing the jury would ensure that the proceedings were fair. Third, in deciding whether a case was so exceptional that a fair trial was no longer possible, domestic courts were better placed to make the assessment than the Court.

Malta (dec.), no.\u00a045441/99, 15 June 2000; and Mustafa (Abu Hamza), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40). In particular, where the impugned newspaper reports appeared at a time when the future members of the jury did not know that they would be involved in the trial process, the likelihood of any appearance of bias is all the more remote, since it is highly unlikely that the jury members would have paid any particular attention to the detail of the reports at the time of their publication (see Beggs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126). In such cases, a direction to the jury to disregard extraneous material will usually be adequate to ensure the fairness of the trial, even if there has been a highly prejudicial press campaign (for an example where such a direction was sufficient, see Beggs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0128). It is essential to underline in this respect that it is reasonable to assume that a jury will follow the directions given by the judge in the absence of any evidence suggesting the contrary (Beggs, cited above, \u00a7 128; and Szypusz v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a08400/07, \u00a7 85, 21\u00a0September 2010).",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a030024/02, 8 July 2008; and Beggs, cited above, \u00a7 127). However, it is important to emphasise that the fact that the authorities were the source of the prejudicial information is relevant to the question of the impartiality of the tribunal only in so far as the material might be viewed by readers as more authoritative in light of its source. The question whether public officials have prejudged a defendant\u2019s guilt in a manner incompatible with the presumption of innocence is a separate issue to be considered under Article 6 \u00a7 2, with the focal point being the conduct of those public officials and not the impartiality of the tribunal itself (see, for example, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 39-41, Series A no. 308). Thus, while the authoritative nature of the published material may require, for example, a greater lapse of time or most robust jury directions, it is unlikely in itself to lead to the conclusion that a fair trial by an impartial tribunal is no longer possible. In particular, allegations that any disclosure of prejudicial material by the authorities was deliberate and was intended to undermine the fairness of the trial are irrelevant to the assessment of the impact of the disclosure on the impartiality of the trial court.",

As noted above, the trial judge, when invited to consider the effect that an adverse media campaign might have on a \u201ctribunal\u201d, has at his disposal various possibilities to neutralise any possible risk of prejudice to the defence and ensure an impartial tribunal. In cases involving trial by jury, what is an appropriate lapse of time and what are suitable directions will vary depending on the specific facts of the case.

The judge considered the applicant\u2019s arguments in a careful and detailed judgment. He readily accepted that the multiplicity and breadth of the prejudicial reporting had to be considered in order to gauge the potential effect upon jurors exposed to the media reports and confirmed that, in order to assess their impact, he had read everything to which his attention had been drawn (see paragraph 27 above). He rejected as \u201cfanciful\u201d the suggestion that the authorities had deliberately briefed the press with a view to disadvantaging the applicant in the retrial (see paragraph 30 above). He also found no evidence that the State had manipulated and abused the court process by failing to restrain publicity resulting from its own press briefings (see paragraph 31 above).",

He considered that sufficient time would have passed since the end of the prejudicial reporting on 14 September 2008 until the commencement of the retrial scheduled for 16 February 2009. He also expressed his confidence that the jury would decide the case on the basis of the evidence and would follow the directions given to them. He undertook to give the jury members, at the outset of the trial, \u201ca most careful direction tailored particularly to this case\u201d, to canvass the direction with counsel before delivering it and, if necessary, to repeat it from time to time (see paragraphs 33-34 above).",

It is clear that during jury selection, the trial judge took care to underline the importance of impartiality and asked questions to elicit any information which might put the impartiality of any particular jury member in doubt (see paragraphs 36-38 above). The applicant does not suggest that the judge failed to discharge any particular jury member during this process. Once the jury had been selected, the judge gave a lengthy direction in which he alluded to prior \u201cinaccurate and unsatisfactory reporting\u201d and emphasised that the jury had to decide the case on the evidence heard in court and nowhere else. He warned them not to speak about the case to family and friends, not to read newspaper report or watch television broadcasts about the case and not to carry out any research, including on the Internet (see paragraph 39 above). The applicant has not suggested that, at the commencement of the retrial, he objected to the direction proposed by the trial judge. Throughout the trial, the judge repeated his injunction to the jury not to discuss the case with family or friends and not to carry out research (see paragraphs 40-41 above). During his summing-up, the judge again reminded the jury that they should not discuss the case with anyone other than other jury members and, after the jury had retired to deliberate, he reminded them each evening that they should not discuss the case outside the jury room (see paragraph 42 above).",

The court not only was \u201centirely satisfied\u201d that the retrial judge had applied the correct principles and come to a conclusion that was open to him, but also agreed with him that, given the trial process and the time that had elapsed before the retrial, there was no risk of any appearance of bias (see paragraphs 48-49 above).",

When publication of the prejudicial material commenced, the decision to pursue a retrial had not yet been made. Any members of the public exposed to the reports would not have known at that time that they would be involved in the subsequent retrial. The trial judge considered whether sufficient time had elapsed to allow the reports to fade into the past, having carefully reviewed the content of each and every instance of reporting to which his attention had been drawn, and recognised the need for careful jury directions, which he subsequently delivered. There is nothing in the circumstances of the case to suggest that the jury could not be relied upon to follow the judge\u2019s instructions to try the case only on the evidence heard in court. The fact that the jury subsequently handed down differentiated verdicts in respect of the multiple defendants in the retrial proceedings, including three acquittals on Count 1 (see paragraph 43 above), supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the jury could be trusted to be discerning and to ignore previous media reports and, consequently, decide the case fairly on the basis of the evidence led in court.",
