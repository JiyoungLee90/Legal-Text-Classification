The fact that the appeal proceedings were still pending could not be used as a criterion to determine whether the person had already been administratively punished. The only criterion for determining the repeated nature of the offence was whether or not the decision on the initial offence had been set aside or its legal effect suspended at the time the decision on the repeat offence was being taken. In the absence of such circumstances, the findings of the decision on the initial offence were legally binding and had to be taken into account when classifying the second offence as a repeat offence. Referring to Article 283 of the Code of Administrative Offences, the court noted that an appeal against a decision revoking a person\u2019s driving licence did not suspend enforcement of that decision. Accordingly, the appeal lodged against the decision concerning the offence of 31 July 2009 (the initial offence) did not preclude the offence under consideration being classified as a repeat offence and the proceedings being concluded while that appeal was still pending.",

The legal question of the disqualification itself was clear, final and legally binding. Appeals by the applicant seeking to reassert the District Court termination of proceedings of 1 December 2008 and overrule the Regional Court judgment of 27 February 2009 in the first set of proceedings were therefore manifestly ill-founded and doomed to fail.

By introducing a manifestly ill-founded appeal against the \u201cinitial offence\u201d, first before the police authority (two weeks after the commission of the second offence, already characterized as repeat) and then before the first instance administrative court (almost four weeks after the commission of the repeat offence), the applicant ensures that the second characterization \u2013 a repeat offence \u2013 is either vitiated or must be held in abeyance no matter how long the administrative proceedings relating to the manifestly ill-founded appeal in the second set of proceedings take. The applicant submits that, until the final conclusion of the Administrative Regional Court of 24 April 2012 in the second set of proceedings, he could not have been charged (or indeed been convicted) with a \u201crepeat\u201d offence, but perhaps only an offence under Article 1494 (6) of the Code of Administrative Offences.",

As a matter of fact and law, whether the applicant accepted it was legal or not, he had been banned from driving by a court judgment in the first set of proceedings in 2008. That ban was enforceable when the two subsequent administrative offences for driving despite the ban were committed in July and September 2009. The applicant may have felt himself \u201cinnocent\u201d or that the first set of proceedings were unfair, but he nevertheless went on to infringe a legally valid ban on driving a car. In this context, it is irrelevant whether the \u201cinitial administrative offence\u201d (the subject of the second set of proceedings) was res iudicata or not when the third set of proceedings were concluded. What is important is that the judgment in the first set of proceedings imposing the driving ban was enforceable and, for the duration of its two year validity, the applicant was not allowed to drive a car. When he nevertheless did so, he was a (re)offender.
