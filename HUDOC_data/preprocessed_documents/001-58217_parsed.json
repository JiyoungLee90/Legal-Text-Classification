The Court of Cassation said in that regard that hearsay evidence could be admissible if it emanated from a reliable witness. The evidence had also to be considered \u201cserious\u201d, as the judge had referred to objective corroborative evidence. Emphasising that the statements in question had been made by different people and concerned different events so that their credibility was strengthened, the Court of Cassation concluded that the evidence assembled by the investigating judge pointed to the likelihood that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he had been charged. Furthermore, under Article 275 CCP, the seriousness of those offences raised a rebuttable presumption that a risk existed that the applicant would tamper with evidence, abscond or reoffend.",

As to his instruction to a colleague to \u201cease up\u201d, his intention had not been to protect members of the Mafia, but to bring a junior police \nofficer in line following a search in which he had ill-treated the sons and wife of a mafioso wanted by the police.",

It appears from the case file that the proceedings involved 165 hearings at the investigative stage and the examination of more than 250 witnesses or persons accused of offences connected with those with which the applicant was charged. There were also four confrontations; moreover, fourteen hearings were necessary merely to examine the applicant, thirteen of which were held in succession between 4 November and 29 December 1994. Fifty-eight witnesses called by the parties gave evidence at the trial. A large number of documents were lodged on the case file. The hearings between 22 April 1994 and 12 October 1995 were devoted to the hearing of witnesses. Seven pentiti were, for security reasons, questioned in the Rome and Padua prisons where they were detained. The public prosecutor made his submissions over the course of twenty-one hearings held between 23 November 1995 and 19 January 1996. Between 7\u00a0February and 29 March 1996, over twenty-two hearings, the applicant\u2019s lawyer made his submissions for the defence.",

Seven pentiti were, for security reasons, questioned in the Rome and Padua prisons in which they were detained. \nThree confrontations were organised.
