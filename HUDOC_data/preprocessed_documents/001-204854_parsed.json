That conclusion does not concern the applicant as such as she was not a party to the proceedings before investigating judge no. 3. However it permits the Court to conclude that there was no indication whatsoever that the applicant, as one of the protesters, engaged in actions that were violent or not peaceful (Frumkin v.

In so far as that criminal procedure was relevant to the determination of the issues relating to some protesters\u2019 participation in the demonstration, and the way in which they were handled by the police, the Court notes that Valladolid criminal judge no. 3, after having examined evidence, concluded that the protesters had been violently repressed without any prior warning, despite the fact that they had not blocked traffic, that it had not been proved that they had been trying to enter the restaurant (see paragraph 23 above) where some politicians had been having lunch, and that they had not provoked the confrontation with the police officers. In view of the facts as established by criminal judge no. 3 in his judgment, the protesters\u2019 behaviour and the harmlessness of their slogans and placards did not justify the force deployed by the police.
