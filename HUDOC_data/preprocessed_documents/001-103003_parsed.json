Many persons who were in police custody in the context of the April 2009 events complained that, despite repeated requests for independent medical assistance, they had been refused such assistance. In some cases, police staff allegedly denied access to a doctor in order to obtain a confession or other statement from the injured detained persons concerned. Further, it appeared in a few cases of persons who had presented visible injuries that medical care had not been provided to them on the grounds that they had not specifically requested it. Such situations not only deprive detained persons of a safeguard which can play a significant role in the prevention of ill-treatment, but it may also have serious repercussions on the health of persons in police custody.

Such an investigation, as with that under Article 2, should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 117, with further references). The investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough, with the authorities making a serious attempt to find out what happened (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq.). They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence (see Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104 et seq., ECHR 1999-IV, and G\u00fcl v. Turkey, no.\u00a022676/93, \u00a7\u00a089, 14\u00a0December 2000). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard.",

Shortly afterwards, the results of the medical examination of the first applicant were made known. There was therefore a serious allegation of ill-treatment that called for investigation. This was carried out by a prosecutor, who began his work in a timely manner and concluded it within a matter of weeks. The Court notes from the prosecutor's decision of 10 December 2004 that he interviewed a considerable number of persons in the course of his investigation, including both applicants, three other members of the Lipencov family, the three men who had apprehended the first applicant, several police officers who had been involved in the first applicant's detention at some stage, and the lawyer who had attended the interrogation. The prosecutor also had a copy of the results of the medical examination.",

As already mentioned (see \u00a7 37 above) it does not appear that the two persons who allegedly accosted and assaulted him some hours earlier were questioned. The Court recalls that the obligation on the authorities under Article 3 to conduct an effective investigation into credible allegations of ill-treatment does not vary according to the status of the alleged perpetrators, i.e. State agent or private party. Such investigation must be capable of both identifying and punishing those responsible (Macovei and Others v. Romania, no. 5048/02, \u00a7 46, 21\u00a0June 2007). Although in this case the prosecutor's decision indicates that he took a relatively detailed approach to the situation, recording both the allegations of the applicants and the denials of the police, the Court considers that the conclusion that there was no evidence of a crime is inadequately reasoned. The prosecutor did not clearly explain why the police version of events should be accepted over that of the applicants. Furthermore, the cryptic reference to \u201cirregularities\u201d that occurred in relation to the first applicant's detention called, in light of the serious allegations made, for further explanation. The Court reiterates the imperative of maintaining the public's confidence in, and support for, the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of the authorities' tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (Okkal\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)).",
