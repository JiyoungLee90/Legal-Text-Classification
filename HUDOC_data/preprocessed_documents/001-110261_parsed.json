However, it has been forgotten that not only M.S. but also other persons had been charged in the criminal proceedings in question. Those other persons had smuggled goods together with M.S., and the illicit gains had been obtained together. Some of those co-accused had been released from criminal liability, but three of the co-accused, J.M., K.K. and V.V., were convicted. For Article 72 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code to be applied, it was not important that the third persons to whom the property had been transferred should be family members or relatives of the person who committed the crime. Moreover, even presuming that it was M.S. who had transferred the property to his wife, his parents and his parents-in-law, it did not mean that that property had been obtained from the criminal activity of him alone. In the present case that property had been obtained as a result of the criminal activities of all co-accused, including those who had been convicted. Furthermore, V.V., who was M.S.\u2019s cousin, had played a very important role in the activities of the criminal organisation. Accordingly, the persons to whom the confiscated property had been transferred were connected by family links not only to M.S., who died, but also to V.V., who was convicted. These circumstances totally rebut the appellant\u2019s contention that the property had been confiscated after the proceedings had been discontinued, because in reality confiscation had been ordered after [the trial court] adopted an accusatory judgment\u201d.",

Even so, the appellate court again went through the evidence and upheld the trial court\u2019s findings, dismissing E.J.\u2019s arguments to the effect that the two confiscated items in the applicant\u2019s ownership had a lawful provenance (see paragraph 19 above).",

The Supreme Court emphasised that it was a court\u2019s duty to confiscate property which fell under Article 72 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code. It was noted that, in its judgment, the trial court had thoroughly reasoned its choice as to which items of property should be confiscated as being the proceeds of illegal activities. The Supreme Court acknowledged that most of that property had been found in the possession of third persons. However, given the trial court\u2019s conclusion that those persons knew or should have known about the illicit funding of the items concerned, it was lawful to confiscate them even though those persons had not been charged in the criminal proceedings against M.S. and the criminal organisation.",

The Court considers that it is not called upon to examine in abstracto the compatibility with the Convention of the provisions of the Lithuanian criminal law, which oblige the court to confiscate money and property which have been acquired in a criminal manner, including property transferred to third persons. Instead, the Court must determine whether the way in which the confiscation was applied in respect of the applicant offended the basic principles of a fair procedure inherent in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Salabiaku v.\u00a0France, 7\u00a0October 1988, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 141-A). It must be ascertained whether the procedure in the domestic legal system afforded the applicant, in the light of the severity of the measure to which she was liable, an adequate opportunity to put her case to the courts, pleading, as the case might be, illegality or arbitrariness of that measure and that the courts had acted unreasonably (see AGOSI, cited above, \u00a7 55; also see, mutatis mutandis, Arcuri and Others, cited above, and Riela and Others v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a052439/99, 4 September 2001).

Whilst noting that the applicant indeed was not a party to the criminal proceedings against the criminal organisation, the Court considers that the system in question was not without safeguards. It notes, first, that the confiscation of the applicant\u2019s property had its origins in a measure taken by the investigating authorities, namely seizure of her assets in 2000. The Court considers that it was open to the applicant to institute judicial review proceedings to challenge the reasons for that seizure and present evidence that those items of property had been acquired lawfully. Whilst acknowledging that the seizure was only a temporary measure, having no conclusive influence over the subsequent confiscation, the Court is of the view that at that time the applicant could reasonably foresee that the seizure could result in confiscation of the property at a later stage of the proceedings. Accordingly, this was an occasion for the applicant to present her arguments and thus to obtain the lifting of the seizure. On this last point the Court also notes that, as it appears from the facts of the case, M.S.\u2019s mother was successful in her plea that some of the seized property had been acquired lawfully, given that seizure of some of the assets was lifted (see paragraph 11 above). Lastly and even though having certain reservations as to the Government\u2019s suggestion that the applicant could have explained the origin of her property had she chosen to testify in the criminal proceedings against the criminal organisation, the Court nonetheless finds that that was one more occasion for her to put forward any evidence in support of her claims. However, according to the Court of Appeal, she did not avail herself of that opportunity (see paragraph 21 above).",

The Court has particular regard to the fact that in his appeal and cassation appeal E.J. explicitly raised the matter of confiscation, arguing that the property belonged to third persons whose fault had not been established. In particular, E.J. challenged the confiscation in respect of each item of property, including those belonging to the applicant (see paragraphs 19 and 26 above). In these circumstances, the Court shares the Government\u2019s view that if the applicant had any evidence to adduce to prove that her property came from legitimate sources, she could have passed that information on to E.J., the lawyer of her choice (see Bongiorno and Others v. , no. 4514/07, \u00a7 49, 5 January 2010).",

Imposing criminal sanctions on the living in respect of acts apparently committed by the deceased person calls for its careful scrutiny (see A.P., M.P. and T.P. v. , 29\u00a0August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046 and 48, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V).

With regard to the application of the presumption of innocence, the Court\u2019s case-law also shows that the autonomous meaning of the expression \u201ccharge\u201d in Article 6 of the Convention means that a person can be considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d for the purposes of that Article when that individual\u2019s situation has been \u201csubstantially affected\u201d (see Serves v.

It had been obtained from illicit proceeds of criminal activities of the entire criminal organisation (see paragraph 24 above). To decide this point the trial court had regard to the fact that when purchasing the confiscated apartment the applicant had taken a loan from the mother of the convicted V.V., who, in turn, could not explain the provenance of his mother\u2019s possessions. As to the shares in the telecommunications company, they had been purchased through the off-shore company that the criminal organisation used to launder the money gained through passing contraband. The Court sees no reason to depart from the appellate court\u2019s findings, which were based on its direct knowledge of the facts of the case and the domestic law. Accordingly, the Court holds that the order to confiscate some of the applicant\u2019s property was not related to any finding of guilt on the part of the applicant in respect of the crimes allegedly committed by her late husband. Lastly, the Court cannot fail to observe that the present case is distinguishable from the facts in A.P., M.P. and T.P., where new proceedings had been opened against the applicants, whereas in the instant case the criminal proceedings against M.S. and his co-accused merely continued after his death.",

The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest.

It also observes that the Lithuanian courts were debarred from basing their decisions on mere suspicions. Looking in detail at the steps taken by the courts to reach the final conclusion as to which pieces of property to confiscate, the Court notes that in respect of each item to be confiscated the courts were satisfied, on the basis either of the submissions by the applicants\u2019 counsel or the evidence adduced by the prosecution, that the confiscated assets had been purchased by virtue of reinvestment of the criminal organisation\u2019s unlawful profits (see, by contrast, Vulakh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046).
