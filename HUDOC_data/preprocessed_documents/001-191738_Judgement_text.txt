The case originated in an application against Serbia (no. 41392/15) lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Marica Nikolić (“the applicant”), on 7 August 2015.
The applicant was represented by Ms N. Dautović, a lawyer practising in Novi Sad. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 20 February 2017 the complaint concerning the length of civil proceedings was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Novi Sad.
On 1 June 2004 the applicant instituted civil proceedings seeking reimbursement for income she had lost because of a car accident.
On 25 February 2008 the Novi Sad Court of First Instance delivered a judgment partly in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to pay her a certain amount in that respect.
On 30 October 2008 the Novi Sad District Court partly quashed the judgment of 25 February 2008 and remitted the case, upholding the remainder of the judgment.
On 2 July 2010 the Novi Sad Court of First Instance rejected the applicant’s claim in the remitted part.
On 30 January 2012 the Novi Sad Court of Appeal partly upheld the judgment of 2 July 2010 and partly reversed it granting certain applicant’s claims.
On 5 February 2015 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s complaint about the length of those proceedings, taking into consideration that the civil courts had rendered four judgments at two instances and that the proceedings had been complex.
