Abrupt separation from his mother threatens disintegration and a developmental crash. Gradual separation opens the possibility for the mother, driven by her frustration, immaturity and fears, to increase the pressure on [the applicant]. It seems that the unresolved symbiotic relationship with the mother, for which she rather than the child bears responsibility, may only be interrupted in the future \u2018violently\u2019 \u2013 either by an adult or by the child himself, again accompanied by a developmental crash (for example conflict with the symbiotic parent in the upcoming adolescence and \u2018chain dissipation\u2019 which carries the risk of developing a disorder typical of the developmental stage of adolescence: defiance, rebellion, emotional or behavioural disorder, shifting dependence on other objects \u2013 dysfunctional peer groups or psychoactive agents; or the opposite \u2013 by regressing to the psychotic level of functioning ... Therefore, as the suspicion of sexual abuse by the father is multiply unjustified, as the mother has isolated the child from both his father and all other family members, as the mother-child symbiotic relationship may only be interrupted \u2018violently\u2019, as the symbiotic relationship with the mother and her functional deviations pose the main developmental risk for [the applicant], in our view the most appropriate measure of protection of [the applicant] would be to entrust his care in the future to his father, who stands out as a more adequate parent for the further psychophysical development of the child. We emphasise that the relationship between [the applicant] and his mother must remain continuous; we therefore suggest regular meetings between the two. Over time, when the situation finally stabilises, when the child ceases to be a \u2018patch\u2019 in the dysfunctional parental relationship, when he is convinced that he has both his mum and dad \u2013 his developmental potential could be released.\u201d",

A restrictive or technical approach in this area is therefore to be avoided (see N.Ts. and Others v. Georgia, no. 71776/12, \u00a7 54, 2\u00a0February 2016; and A.K. and L. v. Croatia, no. 37956/11, \u00a7 47, 8\u00a0January 2013). The key consideration in such cases is that any serious issues concerning respect for a child\u2019s rights should be examined (see N.Ts. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 55; Tonchev v. Bulgaria, no. 18527/02, \u00a7 31, 19\u00a0November 2009; and Hromadka and Hromadkova v. Russia, no. 22909/10, \u00a7 118, 11 December 2014). The Court has also held that, in cases arising out of disputes between parents, it is the parent entitled to custody who is entrusted with safeguarding the child\u2019s interests (see Moog v. Germany, nos. 23280/08 and 2334/10, \u00a7 41, 6 October 2016).",

In view of the object and scope of the application, as formulated (see paragraphs 57 and 64-67 below), the Court does not discern any conflict of interest between A and the applicant on this very point. The fact that A is not complaining in her own name further supports the above understanding of the Court (see N.Ts. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057, and, conversely, Kru\u0161ki\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no. 10140/13, \u00a7 97, 25\u00a0November 2014).

While it is true that in K.B. and others v. Croatia (no. 36216/13, \u00a7\u00a7 109-10, 14 March 2017) the Court declared incompatible ratione personae complaints which a non-custodial parent brought before the Court in the name of his children concerning non-enforcement of their contact rights, the situation in the present case is significantly different. Here the applicant complains about the failure of the State to protect his rights in the decision-making process leading to the decision imposed that he live with his father, and the enforcement of that court judgment as the natural continuation of the former decision. It can thus not be concluded that the applicant could not claim to be a victim in the enforcement proceedings which concern such a crucial aspect of his private and family life such as the decision with which of his parents he was to live (see, mutatis mutandis, M. and M. v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7 172, and N.Ts. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 59). The Government\u2019s argument should accordingly be dismissed.",

Likewise, the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Child-Friendly Justice seek to ensure that in cases where there are conflicting interests between parents and children, either a guardian ad litem or another independent representative is appointed to represent the views and interests of the child and keep the child informed about the content of the proceedings (see paragraph 53 above).",

In line with its usual practice in similar situations, the Chamber has accepted that the child\u2019s parent, in this case the mother, may act as the child\u2019s representative in the proceedings before the Court, notwithstanding the fact that the complaint arises from a dispute between the mother and the father relating to custody and contact rights concerning the child.

Although the problem of the child\u2019s representation manifests itself in the present case in a procedural situation which in one respect is different, namely in that the child alone is the applicant before this Court, the main considerations in my view remain very similar. In this case, it is clear that the underlying conflict is one between the child\u2019s mother and the father. The domestic authorities have found that the mother has developed a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d with the child and her influence on the child has even been characterised as \u201cemotional abuse\u201d and \u201cdangerous for the child\u2019s development\u201d (see paragraphs 13, 17 and 21 of the present judgment). Under such circumstances, it is doubtful whether the mother can be considered capable of properly and genuinely representing the best interests of child as a legal subject in his own right.",

Despite the findings referred to above, the Court does not discern any conflict of interest between the mother and the applicant on the subject matter of the complaint. Yet in the light of the underlying conflict, there is no reliable basis for determining whether the recourse to the proceedings taken by the mother on behalf of the child, including those before the Court, is indeed in the child\u2019s best interests. Similarly, the examination of the complaint on the basis of submissions made under instructions by the mother, rather than by an unbiased representative of the child, is problematic.",
