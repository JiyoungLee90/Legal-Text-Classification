However, it did not deal with the grievance about the disruption of the meeting by the police, particularly in the light of the reasoning contained in the subsequent judicial decisions rejecting their claims for damages. Therefore by quashing the two applicants\u2019 administrative convictions the authorities had taken measures favourable to the applicants, but they neither acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, nor afforded redress for, the breach of Article 11 of the Convention.",

Having regard to the scope and the subject matter of the supervisory review in this case (see paragraphs 31-32 above), as well as the inconsistent outcomes in the identical cases of the three applicants, the Court cannot uphold the Government\u2019s assertion that the supervisory review constituted an effective remedy to be exhausted in the present case (see, by contrast, Orlovskaya\u00a0Iskra v. Russia, no. 42911/08, \u00a7\u00a7 69-79, 21 February 2017, where the Court found that in the relevant period such a complaint could in other circumstances be considered in the application of the six-months\u2019 rule).",

It previously found that a disruption of a religious gathering which caused its premature termination amounted to a limitation on the right to freedom of religion (see Kuznetsov and Others v. Russia, no. 184/02, \u00a7\u00a7 59-62, 11 January 2007) and, by implication, an interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly (ibid., \u00a7\u00a053). In the present case, the applicants could not proceed with their small-scale informal gathering in the presence of the large number of police officers who were accusing them of a failure to notify the authorities of their meeting and who remained in the room until the participants of the meeting left it. It is clear that the meeting was brought to an end prematurely by the authorities\u2019 intervention, which therefore constituted \u201ca restriction\u201d, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11 of the Convention.",
