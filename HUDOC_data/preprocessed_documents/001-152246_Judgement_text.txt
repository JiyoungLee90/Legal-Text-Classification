The case originated in an application (no. 27970/12) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Hungarian nationals, Ms Beáta Mária Balázs, Ms Zsuzsanna Ilona Mester and Mr Csaba Tóth (“the applicants”), on 24 April 2012.
The applicants were represented by Mr T. Fazekas, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 25 July 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1975, 1975 and 1976 and live in Szigethalom, Budapest and Budapest, respectively.
In March 2003 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicants on charges of blackmailing.
In a decision which became final and binding on 17 February 2012, the Pest Central District Court acquitted the applicants.
