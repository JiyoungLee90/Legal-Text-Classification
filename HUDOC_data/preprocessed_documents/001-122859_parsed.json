The most that could be said against the expert evidence given at this trial is that it might need adjustment in the light of new medical research and/or thinking. In any event, the medical evidence given at time of trial has not been demonstrated to be flawed, even in this limited sense. As the passages from the judgment of the CACD which I have cited show, this court\u2019s decision went no further than to say that the differences of medical opinion needed to be resolved by a jury. Nor was this a case in which the jury was presented with a medical consensus that the triad was diagnostic of unlawful killing. The medical evidence called for the appellant accepted that it was consistent with unlawful killing but disputed that it necessarily led to that conclusion. The appeal was allowed because over the intervening years more possible force had emerged for the opinion voiced on the appellant\u2019s behalf and now supported by Dr Squier\u2019s evidence, which the jury had not heard and which the CACD, despite plain doubts about it, was not in a position wholly to dismiss.",

I am not persuaded that the House laid down any incorrect principle in Stafford, so long as the Court of Appeal bears very clearly in mind that the question for its consideration is whether the conviction is safe and not whether the accused is guilty. But the test advocated by counsel in Stafford ... does have a dual virtue ... First, it reminds the Court of Appeal that it is not and should never become the primary decision-maker. Secondly, it reminds the Court of Appeal that it has an imperfect and incomplete understanding of the full processes which led the jury to convict. The Court of Appeal can make its assessment of the fresh evidence it has heard, but save in a clear case it is at a disadvantage in seeking to relate that evidence to the rest of the evidence which the jury heard. For these reasons it will usually be wise for the Court of Appeal, in a case of any difficulty, to test their own provisional view by asking whether the evidence, if given at the trial, might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury to convict. If it might, the conviction must be thought to be unsafe.\u201d",

Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 18, the House of Lords considered the application of section 133 of the 1988 Act. Mr Mullen\u2019s trial in England had been possible only because the British authorities had arranged his deportation from  in flagrant breach of local and international law. This emerged only after conviction and his appeal to the Court of Appeal, approximately seven years later, resulted in the quashing of his conviction on the ground that his deportation had involved abuse of process, namely a gross abuse of executive power. His claim for compensation under section 133, or the ex gratia scheme which existed in parallel at that time, was refused by the Secretary of State. In subsequent judicial review proceedings, the House of Lords unanimously found that section 133 did not require the payment of compensation for a miscarriage of justice in his case. However, there was a divergence of views between Lord Bingham and Lord Steyn as to the proper construction of section 133.",

But in ordinary parlance the expression would, I think, be extended to those who, whether guilty or not, should clearly not have been convicted at their trials. It is impossible and unnecessary to identify the manifold reasons why a defendant may be convicted when he should not have been. It may be because the evidence against him was fabricated or perjured. It may be because flawed expert evidence was relied on to secure conviction. It may be because evidence helpful to the defence was concealed or withheld. It may be because the jury was the subject of malicious interference. It may be because of judicial unfairness or misdirection. In cases of this kind, it may, or more often may not, be possible to say that a defendant is innocent, but it is possible to say that he has been wrongly convicted. The common factor in such cases is that something has gone seriously wrong in the investigation of the offence or the conduct of the trial, resulting in the conviction of someone who should not have been convicted.\u201d",

It is a duty for all public authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial, e.g. by abstaining from making public statements affirming the guilt of the accused. Defendants should normally not be shackled or kept in cages during trials or otherwise presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals. The media should avoid news coverage undermining the presumption of innocence. Furthermore, the length of pre-trial detention should never be taken as an indication of guilt and its degree. The denial of bail or findings of liability in civil proceedings do not affect the presumption of innocence.\u201d (footnotes omitted)",

The refusal of compensation based on lack of eligibility could not be incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2; to hold otherwise would render meaningless the criteria and restrictions in Article 14 \u00a7 6 of the ICCPR and Article\u00a03 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention.",

Here, by contrast, the decision on compensation was distinct and separate from the decision to quash the criminal conviction because it was generally taken by the executive and not the judiciary; it was taken pursuant to an administrative process and not in criminal proceedings; it could be based on different evidence, not considered at the trial itself; it was from a temporal aspect remote, as an application for compensation could be made up to two years after the reversal of the conviction; and it was made and provided on a confidential basis to the applicant. Although assessment of whether a miscarriage of justice had been conclusively demonstrated, as required by section 133 of the 1988 Act, involved some evaluation of the evidence that had led to the conviction in the first place, that process did not involve any infringement of the presumption of innocence and did not undermine the acquittal.",

Further, whereas in civil proceedings a balance had to be struck with the rights of third parties, no such balance was relevant here, as it was the State that was responsible for payment of compensation. In any event, the Court had found Article 6 \u00a7 2 applicable even in cases concerning civil proceedings where those proceedings resulted in the innocence of the applicant being questioned (citing Orr v.

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fair-trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 \u00a7 2 in this respect may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see, for example, Zollman v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62902/00, ECHR 2003XII, and Taliadorou and Stylianou v.

The two Articles are concerned with entirely different aspects of the criminal process; there is no suggestion that Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 was intended to extend to a specific situation general guarantees similar to those contained in Article 6 \u00a7 2 (compare and contrast Maaouia v.

However, if the national decision on compensation were to contain a statement imputing criminal liability to the respondent party, this would raise an issue falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see Ringvold, cited above, \u00a7 38; Y v.

Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 34, 24 May 2011). Thus, in a case where the domestic court held that it was \u201cclearly probable\u201d that the applicant had \u201ccommitted the offences ... with which he was charged\u201d, the Court found that it had overstepped the bounds of the civil forum and had thereby cast doubt on the correctness of the acquittal (see Y\u00a0v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 46; see also Orr, cited above, \u00a7 51; and Diacenco, cited above, \u00a7 64). Similarly, where the domestic court indicated that the criminal file contained enough evidence to establish that a criminal offence had been committed, the language used was found to have violated the presumption of innocence (see Panteleyenko, cited above, \u00a7 70). In cases where the Court\u2019s judgment expressly referred to the failure to dispel the suspicion of criminal guilt, a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 was established (see, for example, Sekanina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, and Rushiti, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31). However, when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings, even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive (see paragraph 125 above). The Court\u2019s case-law provides some examples of instances where no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 has been found even though the language used by domestic authorities and courts was criticised (see Reeves, cited above, and A.L. v.

The CACD did not itself assess all the evidence, in the light of the new evidence, in order to decide whether guilt had been established beyond reasonable doubt. No retrial was ordered as the applicant had already served her sentence of imprisonment by the time her conviction was quashed (see paragraphs 21, 26 and 34 above). Pursuant to section 2(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, the quashing of the applicant\u2019s conviction resulted in a verdict of acquittal being entered (see paragraph 45 above).

Similarly, an acquittal on appeal based on inadequate jury directions or the admission of unfair evidence would not satisfy the criteria set out in section 133.

In the applicant\u2019s case, the medical evidence heard by the CACD and the trial jury demonstrated that there was \u201cpowerful evidence\u201d against the applicant, and it would have been for a jury to determine the issue (see paragraph 31 above).

As Lord Steyn had expressed the view that a miscarriage of justice would only arise where innocence had been established beyond reasonable doubt, there was necessarily some discussion of the matter of innocence and the extent to which a judgment of the CACD quashing a conviction generally demonstrates innocence. Reference was made in this regard to the Explanatory Report to Protocol 7 to the Convention, which explains that the intention of Article 3 of that Protocol was to oblige States to provide compensation only where there was an acknowledgment that the person concerned was \u201cclearly innocent\u201d (see paragraph 72 above). It is wholly understandable that when seeking to identify the meaning of an ambiguous legislative notion such as \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d that has its origins in provisions figuring in international instruments \u2013 in the event, Article 14 \u00a7\u00a06 of the ICCPR and Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention \u2013 national judges should refer to the international case-law on those provisions and to their drafting history setting out the understanding of their drafters. However, the Explanatory Report itself provides that, although intended to facilitate the understanding of the provisions contained in the Protocol, it does not constitute an authoritative interpretation of the text (see paragraph\u00a071 above). Its references to the need to demonstrate innocence must now be considered to have been overtaken by the Court\u2019s intervening case-law on Article 6 \u00a7 2. But what is important above all is that the judgments of the High Court and the Court of Appeal did not require the applicant to satisfy Lord Steyn\u2019s test of demonstrating her innocence. The High Court in particular emphasised that the facts of R\u00a0(Mullen) were far removed from those of the applicant\u2019s case and that the ratio decidendi of the decision in R\u00a0(Mullen) did not assist in the resolution of her case (see paragraph 27 above).",

In assessing whether a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d had arisen, the courts did not comment on whether, on the basis of the evidence as it stood at the appeal, the applicant should be, or would likely be, acquitted or convicted. Equally, they did not comment on whether the evidence was indicative of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence. They merely acknowledged the conclusions of the CACD, which itself was addressing the historical question whether, had the new evidence been available prior to or during the trial, there would nonetheless have been a case for the applicant to answer.

It is as much as saying that the question \u201cwhether the reasons [given in the civil judgment] gave rise to an issue under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 must be viewed in the context of the proceedings as a whole and their special features\u201d (see Reeves v.

It is true that in the civil proceedings the standard of proof will be less strict than in criminal proceedings \u2013 on a balance of probabilities, and not beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 but that is not really saying much as far as popular perception of guilt or innocence, and therefore of the existence or otherwise of criminal liability, is concerned. This issue was very clearly highlighted in Judge Costa\u2019s dissenting opinion in Ringvold v. Norway (no.\u00a034964/97, ECHR 2003-II). Indeed in that case two judges took a diametrically opposed view on the same passages of the Norwegian Supreme Court\u2019s judgment. The concurring opinion of Judge Tulkens reflects the theoretical \u2013 dare I say, academic \u2013 approach to the question of Article 6 \u00a7 2 in collateral civil proceedings, whereas the dissenting opinion of Judge Costa is a stark reminder of pragmatic reality: \u201c[The applicant] was told that he had been acquitted of the offence with which he had been charged, but he was subsequently told (on the basis of the same facts) that it was clear that he had committed the offence, and ordered to pay compensation to the victim.\u201d",

I still believe that Article 6 \u00a7 2 has no place whatsoever in civil compensation proceedings, whether following upon acquittal in criminal proceedings or where no criminal proceedings have ever been initiated.",
