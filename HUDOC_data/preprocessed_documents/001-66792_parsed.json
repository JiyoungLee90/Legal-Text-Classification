Also, she had known about the criminal charges against her for more than six months prior to her arrest but had made no attempt to abscond or obstruct the investigation.

The presumption was only rebuttable in very exceptional circumstances where even a hypothetical possibility of absconding, reoffending or collusion was excluded, due to serious illness or other exceptional factors. It was moreover incumbent on the detained person to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he or she was bound to remain in detention pending trial throughout the proceedings. The above principles were based on Article 152 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the CCP, as worded at the material time, and the Supreme Court\u2019s practice at that stage.",

However, the issue which needs to be determined in the present case is not whether the law was compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, but whether the authorities gave relevant and sufficient reasons for keeping the applicant deprived of her liberty. In this connection, the Court notes that when the applicant applied for release in March 1996 the competent prosecutor acknowledged that there was no risk of her absconding or offending, but nevertheless rejected her application for release (see paragraph 39 above). Then, in June 1996, November 1997 and March 1998, the applicant\u2019s house arrest was confirmed by the authorities of their own motion, apparently without any specific reasons being put forward (see paragraphs 4143 above).

As regards the claim for nonpecuniary damages, in the Court\u2019s view, it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has suffered distress and frustration on account of the unreasonable length of her pretrial detention and subsequent house arrest, the lack of a possibility to seek judicial review of her house arrest and the length of the criminal proceedings against her. Taking into account the various relevant considerations and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,000.",

The Court further observes that the same lawyer represented the applicant both in her previous case (see Nikolova, cited above, \u00a7 7) and in the present case, while there is a certain overlap between the facts of the two cases. This calls for a further reduction. Finally, the Court notes that the claim for translation expenses is not supported by relevant documents.",
