Originally, the District Court had passed a judgment on 26 October 2007 in a criminal case against five defendants, of whom counsel A had defended three. When passing the judgment, the District Court had ordered the three defendants to pay legal costs (without specifying the amount). On the same day the District Court had awarded A DKK 73,500, of which each of the three defendants was to pay one third. Information about that decision had been sent to A by letters of 31\u00a0October and 2 November 2007. The three defendants had only become aware of this decision when the police collected the fee from one of them on 31\u00a0January 2008. On 12 February 2008 A had lodged an interlocutory appeal claiming that the defendants should pay a smaller share. The appeal had been dismissed by the High Court as being submitted out of time. On appeal, the Supreme Court stated that the decision on payment of legal costs was integrated in the judgment, which had been passed in the presence of the defendants. Accordingly, since the interlocutory appeal concerned the order to pay the legal costs, and not the actual amount of the legal fee, the timelimit should be calculated from 26\u00a0October 2007.",

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts of appeal and of first instance, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. The role of the Court is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits governing the filing of documents or the lodging of appeals. Rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal are aimed at ensuring a proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty. Litigants should expect those rules to be applied. (see, for example, Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2002IX and Miragall Escolano and Others v.

Thus, while time-limits are in principle legitimate limitations on the right to a court, the manner in which they are applied in a particular case may give rise to a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, for example, if the time-limit for lodging an appeal starts to run at a moment when the party did not and could not effectively know the content of the contested court decision (see, inter alia, Viard v.

He did not maintain that the amount of legal costs for either counsel A or B was excessive or wrongly calculated. Accordingly, as stated by the High Court in its decision of 10 March 2010, since the interlocutory appeal did not concern the amount of the fees awarded to the applicant\u2019s two lawyers, but solely the decision integrated in the judgment of 4\u00a0December 2009, namely that the applicant was liable to pay the legal costs pertaining to him, section 969 of the Administration Act applied. Therefore, the time-limit for lodging an interlocutory appeal was fourteen days, calculated from the passing of the decision integrated in the judgment of 4\u00a0December 2009, and it expired on 18\u00a0December 2009.",

It was not until 5\u00a0January 2010, when the City Court approved the fees to be granted to B and the supplementary costs to be paid, and until 25\u00a0January\u00a02010, when the applicant received the invoice from the police, informing him about the fees that the City Court had granted A on 24\u00a0September 2009, that the applicant could effectively apprise himself of the court decision of 4 December 2009.",

He was present, though, and assisted by counsel B on 4\u00a0December 2009, when the judgment was passed. Thus, he was or could have been, aware from that day on that he - and he alone - was liable to pay the legal costs relating to him, including the fees to his two lawyers, despite their amount. It is also undisputed that B, a few days later, received a transcript of the judgment, which in the operative part relating to the legal fees stated: \u201cEach of the accused is to pay the legal costs relating to them, including the fee to counsel appointed to them.\u201d",

He could have argued, without knowing the exact amount of the legal costs, that the Treasury should contribute, in full or in part. However, the applicant did not lodge such an appeal until 17\u00a0January 2010, and the High Court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal on 10\u00a0March\u00a02010 was therefore a foreseeable reaction.",
