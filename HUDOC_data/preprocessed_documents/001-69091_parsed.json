The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010 (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0103, p. 28, \u00a7 46, and Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), judgment of 23\u00a0May\u00a01991, Series A no. 204, p. 27, \u00a7 63). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (Jerusalem v. Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001II).",
