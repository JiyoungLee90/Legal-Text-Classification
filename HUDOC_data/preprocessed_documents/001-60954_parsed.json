Section 17 provided that where the mental disorder from which the person suffered was a persistent one manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct (that is, a psychopathic or anti-social personality disorder), he could only be detained where medical treatment was likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his condition. This reflected general medical pessimism as to the benefits of medical treatment for psychopaths. The sheriff was required to release a restricted patient where the patient was not suffering from a mental disorder making it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, or it was not necessary for the health and safety of the patient or the protection of other persons that he receive such treatment (section 64 of the 1984 Act).",

This had been on the recommendation of a consultant psychiatrist consulted by the Secretary of State, who in his report of 8 August 1986 found that there was no continuing evidence of mental subnormality or of any evidence of mental illness other than persistent abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct. While he was not convinced that the applicant\u2019s period of treatment in the open hospital had improved his behaviour in any consistent fashion, the only possible reason to continue his detention in hospital was to attempt to modify his aggressive and seriously irresponsible conduct. In his view the only appropriate type of hospital management would be the more secure and structured organisation within the State hospital. It was further noted that the incident with the child raised grave doubts concerning the safety to other people of allowing the applicant to be released from institutional care and it was for that reason that he recommended the applicant\u2019s return to the State hospital. On 7 October 1986, on the day of the applicant\u2019s release from prison, the applicant was transferred back to the State hospital.",

He had before him the written and oral evidence of seven consultant psychiatrists. He found that they were unanimous that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder, namely a persistent and permanent psychopathic/anti-social personality disorder, manifested by abnormally aggressive and seriously irresponsible behaviour. In the event of the applicant being released, he found there was a very high risk of his reoffending and that any such offence was likely to have a sexual connotation. He accepted that the evidence was such that the applicant\u2019s disorder would not be likely to justify his admission to hospital had his original offence been committed in 1994 and noted that the majority of the opinions were to the effect that the applicant\u2019s condition was not curable and that the medical treatment provided by the State hospital had not alleviated and would not alleviate his condition. However, he nonetheless found that the applicant\u2019s disorder was severe and that it was appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment. He stated that nowhere in the Act did it state that a criminal ordered by the High Court to be detained without limit of time should be discharged if his condition was not being alleviated.

On 26 November 2001 the Mental Health Act (Remedial) Order 2001 came into force, amending sections 72 and 73 to require the tribunal to discharge the patient if it was not satisfied that he fulfilled the conditions for detention. In a recent case in Scotland brought by a patient under section 64 of the 1984 Act (Lyons v. the Scottish Ministers, 17 January 2002, First Division of the Court of Session), the Scottish court noted that the Scottish ministers had accepted, concerning the burden of proof in proceedings for release, that they were required to establish that the patient suffered from a mental disorder of a nature or degree making it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital.

Where the medical experts had expressed conflicting opinions and the patient posed a risk to public safety, they considered that the Court should be slow to disturb their conclusions. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) was in any event not concerned with suitable treatment or conditions and it was not a precondition of the lawful detention of a person of unsound mind that treatment was available to him or that available treatment was to any extent beneficial. A person could be detained in conformity with the Convention where this was necessary in his own interests, or for the protection of the public or on both medical and social grounds.

Since 1967, he had continued to suffer from a persisting mental disorder established by objective medical expertise and warranting his compulsory confinement in the State hospital. Although by 1980 his problems no longer included mental deficiency, his medical history showed that he continued to suffer from a persisting mental disorder, namely a psychopathic personality disorder. He also remained a risk to the public and the treatment available to him in the structured environment of the State hospital prevented deterioration in his condition. Even if there was disagreement in 1994 amongst the experts as to his treatability, there was sufficient evidence that the care under medical supervision in the hospital prevented deterioration and constituted medical treatment.",

The applicant\u2019s argument, essentially, is that he is now recognised as suffering from a psychopathic personality disorder that cannot be treated in hospital and that accordingly his detention in hospital is inappropriate and therefore arbitrary. He supports this argument with reference, inter alia, to the reports of the doctors considered at the hearing before the sheriff in June and July 1994, the finding of the Inner House of the Court of Session that the sheriff had erred in considering that he was treatable on the basis of the medical evidence, and the fact that when he was convicted for a new offence in 1986 he was not found to be suffering from a mental disorder making it appropriate for him to receive hospital treatment.",

The Court\u2019s case-law refers rather to the applicant being properly established as suffering from a mental disorder of a degree warranting compulsory confinement. Such confinement may be necessary not only where a person needs therapy, medication or other clinical treatment to cure or alleviate his condition, but also where the person needs control and supervision to prevent him, for example, causing harm to himself or other persons (see, for example, Witold Litwa v.

The applicant rejected the Government\u2019s argument that in the circumstances the burden of proof was irrelevant. The authorities in his case should have had to prove to the sheriff that the applicant was treatable on a balance of probabilities. Instead the applicant had had to prove that he was not treatable.

In practice, both the patient and the State led evidence on the issue of whether the lawful criteria for detention were met and it was normal practice in  for the State to lead evidence that the patient was continuing to suffer from a mental disorder. In the present case, the sheriff, who had had the inestimable advantage of hearing the witnesses, found it to be established that he suffered from a mental disorder and that there was a high probability that he would reoffend. He thus came to a definite conclusion on the evidence and no question of onus arose. The Government agreed that section 64 was broadly analogous to sections 72 and 73 in issue in Ex parte H. (cited at paragraph 39 above), since which the law had been changed by a remedial order. The Scottish Ministers in  (cited at paragraph 39 above) had accepted that the burden of proof lay on them in appeals brought by a patient and the Government also accepted that the State was required to satisfy the court of the positive facts which warranted the continuing detention of a patient. This accorded with what had been the previous practice.

These conclusions were reached on an assessment of the evidence as a whole and the burden of proof does not appear to have played any role. However, there was another issue before the sheriff concerning the domestic-law requirement that the applicant\u2019s mental illness was amenable to treatment. On that point, the medical experts differed, the sheriff noting that the majority of the opinions were to the effect that the applicant\u2019s condition was not curable and that the medical treatment provided by the State hospital had not alleviated and would not alleviate his condition. Of the seven consultant psychiatrists who had given evidence, he referred to two doctors\u2019 assessments that the applicant had improved or benefited from the care and stability provided in the hospital environment. In reaching his decision to reject his appeal, the sheriff stated, in terms referring to the onus of proof placed on the applicant by section 64 of the 1984 Act, that he had not been satisfied that the applicant was not now suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for him to be liable to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment. The Court also notes that, on reviewing the sheriff\u2019s decision, the Inner House of the Court of Session found that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the applicant was \u201ctreatable\u201d. In those circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the onus of proof placed on the applicant in the proceedings by the applicable legislation was irrelevant to the outcome. The Government argued that the burden of proof could not be considered a determining factor of a case unless a court was unable to come to a definite conclusion on the evidence or some part of it. It is however sufficient to raise a problem concerning the effectiveness of the proceedings as a mechanism for preventing arbitrary or unlawful detention, if, on the state of evidence before the court, the burden of proof placed on the applicant was capable of influencing the decision. In the applicant\u2019s case, where the issue of treatability was subject to conflicting views, this would appear to be the case.",

In particular, the applicant waited some six months after the sheriff\u2019s decision to apply for legal aid for judicial review; after his application for legal aid was refused in March 1995, he did not re-apply until October 1995; he delayed from 30 August 1996, when he was granted legal aid, to 7\u00a0November 1996 in applying to lift the adjournment in the proceedings and he agreed to the adjournment of the House of Lords proceedings which delayed the hearing for some months. However, even taking those delays into account, the Court observes that there was a lapse of time of three months and eight days between the applicant\u2019s application to the Outer House of the Court of Session and the decision dismissing his appeal; of nine months and ten days between the lifting by the Inner House of the Court of Session of the adjournment (granted for the applicant to obtain legal aid) on 12 November 1996 and its judgment on 22 August 1997; and of seven months and three days between the setting down of the case for hearing by the House of Lords and the delivery of its judgment on 3 December 1998.",

The applicant\u2019s applications challenging the sheriff\u2019s decision were not, in the domestic sense, full appeals on fact and law but involved judicial review, principally, of lawfulness and propriety of procedure. As the appellate instances were nonetheless involved in ruling on issues concerning the lawfulness of his continued detention and this could have potentially led to his release, the Court sees no reason why they should not be taken into account as part of the proceedings. The fact that in Scotland there is a four-tier system of review cannot serve to justify the applicant being deprived of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. It is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, R.M.D. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2015, \u00a7\u00a054, and G.B. v. Switzerland, no. 27426/95, \u00a7 38, 30 November 2000).",

The longer delays which appear in this case cannot be justified either by the complexity of the case or the exigencies of internal procedure.
