They do not suggest that the courts made an appropriate assessment of the facts relevant to the question whether such a preventive measure was necessary in the circumstances. Moreover, with the passage of time the applicant\u2019s continued detention required more justification, but the courts did not provide any additional reasoning in that respect. Furthermore, in maintaining the applicant\u2019s detention the courts referred to his failure to admit his guilt. This part of reasoning appears to be irrelevant as it runs contrary to such important elements of the fair trial concept as freedom from self-incrimination and the presumption of innocence (see Lutsenko v.
