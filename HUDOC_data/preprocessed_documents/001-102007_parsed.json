Initially the investigation had progressed at a good pace. The numerous investigative steps had been illustrative of the authorities\u2019 determination to identify the perpetrators and bring them to account. At the same time, it could not be overlooked that, as noted by the domestic courts, the investigating authorities had breached the rules of procedure and had made mistakes. Had they complied strictly with the rules governing the gathering of evidence, they would have stood a much better chance of identifying the culprits. However, the fact that the assailants had worn masks had posed serious difficulties in that respect. Another problem had been the scarcity of witness evidence. Nonetheless, the authorities\u2019 failure to identify those responsible for an offence did not automatically entail a breach of their procedural obligations under Article 2. The authorities could not be blamed if, despite carrying out an effective investigation, they still could not establish the identity of and punish those responsible. The investigation was continuing, and could go on until the expiry of the limitation period, which was thirty years from the commission of the offence. Lastly, the Government pointed out that the Assistance and Financial Compensation of the Victims of Crime Act, which applied in respect of offences committed after 30 June 2005, had come into force on 1 January 2007.",

The investigation in the case at hand had not been effective; on the contrary, it had been tainted by a number of grave omissions, which had completely undermined its ability to establish both the exact circumstances in which Mr\u00a0Ivaylo Zashev had been killed and the identity of the persons responsible for his death. The most serious error had been the loss of the cartridges impounded from the crime scene, as well as the failure to provide protection to Mr V.K., which had been both possible and indispensable, and the lack of which had led to his changing his statements several times. Other deficiencies had been the substandard inspection of the crime scene, the belated conducting of interviews with the neighbours, the belated commissioning of DNA and ballistic expert reports, and in general the excessive length of the investigation, which had lasted almost eight years. The applicants also criticised the passive conduct of the prosecution during the trial, in the course of which it had made only one \u2013 poorly substantiated\u00a0\u2013 request for further evidence to be gathered.

Article 2 \u00a7 1 imposes on the State a duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminallaw provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by lawenforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). That obligation requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have died in violent or suspicious circumstances, even if there is no indication that the death is due to State action (see, concerning interprisoner violence, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002II; concerning homicides by prisoners benefiting from early release or social reintegration schemes, Mastromatteo v.

Indeed, this need for scrutiny was acknowledged by the national authorities, which initiated an investigation immediately after the incident (see paragraph 9 above).",

Croatia, no.\u00a046423/06, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2009... (extracts)), any such investigation must comply with certain minimum requirements which have recently been set out, with reference to deaths not involving State action, in paragraphs 19294 of the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Kolevi (cited above). The Court would add that the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of effectiveness depend on the circumstances of each particular case. They must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see, among other authorities, Velikova v.

Moreover, this is not an obligation of result, but of means only (see, among other authorities, Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 71). Article 2 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

Pleven Regional Court analysed in detail the material adduced by the prosecution and found that, due to a number of omissions during the investigation, there was not a single piece of evidence to link the accused to the commission of the offence. In particular, no samples had been taken and no real evidence seized from the crime scene; the bullets and cartridges found there had been lost before being tested, due to a failure to comply with proper procedures; the seized car had not been examined in a timely fashion; the key witness for the prosecution had been unlawfully pressured by the police into testifying in a certain way; and the identity parades he attended had not been conducted properly (see paragraphs 4146 above). On appeal, the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal fully endorsed those findings (see paragraph 50 above). One additional weakness, also criticised by Pleven Regional Court but not remedied effectively, was the authorities\u2019 failure to provide effective protection for that key witness, who had received threats and eventually retracted all of his incriminating statements, possibly as a result of those threats (see paragraphs 21, 22, 24, 33, 34, 36 and 38 above).",
