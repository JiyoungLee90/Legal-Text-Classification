On 15\u00a0April\u00a02005, before he left Russia, the investigating judge suggested to her lawyer two possible dates for a hearing at the court in . The applicant arrived in  on 20 April 2005.

After a conversation on 28\u00a0April 2005 between the investigating judge and a public prosecutor in Pennsylvania, who was thus informed of the applicant\u2019s presence in , the US Department of Justice, on 29 April 2005, sent a request for the applicant\u2019s provisional arrest to the Federal Office of Justice, which ordered his urgent arrest that same day.

Neither did it comply with Recommendation R (83)12 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe of 23 September 1983, concerning safe conduct for witnesses under the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, which emphasises the importance of meeting all the requirements of the summons, in particular by expressly pointing out the scope of that guarantee in the requesting State. In the applicant\u2019s submission, having regard to the negotiations that had taken place with the investigating judge prior to his departure, it was clear that he was going to be questioned as a witness, and this explained why he had accepted a more informal means of calling him for questioning on 2 May 2005 in the proceedings concerning his daughter.",

This position reflects the well-established opinion in international law that safe conduct must also apply to witnesses or experts who have been notified in an informal or illegal manner.
