The activities envisaged by the association in order to achieve its objectives, as declared in Article 8 of its articles of association, were: research and analysis; public debates and conferences; monitoring the implementation of European Union directives; public communication campaigns; opinion polls; reviewing the development and implementation of public policies in the environmental field; training; raising citizens\u2019 awareness; informing people of matters of public concern; raising the awareness of the community and of public authorities about the need to protect the environment; organising meetings between citizens and representatives of public authorities; organising debates and opinion polls on issues impacting the environment; developing programmes in partnership with public authorities; active involvement of citizens in the development of public policies and the decision-making process; improving the legal framework; setting up annual prizes for environmental activities; awarding scholarships for promoting sustainable development; networking with similar national and international organisations; supporting and defending the association\u2019s members and volunteers; and other lawful activities.",

Following the appeal on points of law lodged by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the last-instance court identified some irregularities in the application. However, it does not appear from the evidence available in the case file that the applicant was either summoned in chambers, or asked in writing to remedy those irregularities. Given that the national law aimed to give associations a chance to remedy any irregularities during the registration process, the decision of the last-instance court to dismiss the application for registration without allowing the applicant any time or giving him an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies found by the court appears to contradict the purpose and spirit of the law (see, mutatis mutandis, The Arge\u015f College of Legal Advisers, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).",

Romania, no. 35097/02, \u00a7 23, 11 October 2007). The provisions of the association\u2019s founding instruments gave no indication that its goal was the setting up of a political party or that it had intended to involve itself in political activities (contrast Bota v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a024057/03, 12\u00a0October 2004). Also, there is no evidence in the case file that the association\u2019s founding members had intended to use their association as a de facto political party. Their organisation, had it been founded as an association, would have not been able to take part in the elections and in establishing public authorities, i.e. in the activities, mentioned in Article 2 of Law no. 14/2003 (see paragraph 12 above). Therefore, the Court sees no need to speculate whether the said Law defines any field of activity as an exclusive domain of political parties, which an association is not allowed to enter, and whether the goal and objectives of the applicant\u2019s association as described by its memorandum and articles of association could have had any attributes that entered that hypothetical domain.",

Likewise, in so far as the Government suggested that the association could have made a second application for registration after amending its articles of association, the Court observes that it has already established that imposing such a duty on the applicant would have amounted to a disproportionate burden given that the domestic legislation had allowed for the possibility of having the potential irregularities remedied during the course of the first set of registration proceedings (see Bozgan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029).",

However, influencing public policies does not seem to be the sole preserve of political parties. Many associations in different countries which do not wish to take part in elections and seek public power try to influence public policies by other means. A restriction on forming associations which are not political parties but which intend to influence public policies does not seem justified under the Convention.",

The domestic court considered that \u201cthe concepts used by the organisation had been very general and had run the risk of being understood as belonging to the field of activities of political parties\u201d (see paragraph 10 of the judgment). The association\u2019s declared goals \u201ccould have been perceived as belonging to the field of activities of political parties\u201d (see paragraph 37). It is difficult to understand this argument, which seems to be based upon the implicit assumption that political parties should have a monopoly on influencing public policies. Furthermore, it has not been shown by the Government that under Romanian legislation, the function of influencing public policies is in fact reserved for political parties. In such a context, the decision not to register the association does not seem to have a sufficient legal basis in domestic law and in any event did not provide sufficient and relevant reasons.",

Given that the national law aimed to give associations a chance to remedy any irregularities during the registration process, the decision of the last-instance court to dismiss the application for registration without allowing the applicant any time or giving him an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies found by the court appears to contradict the purpose and spirit of the law (see, mutatis mutandis, The Arge\u015f College of Legal Advisers, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040)\u201d (see paragraph 41). This statement suggests that the refusal to register the association was disproportionate because it did not have the opportunity to remedy the deficiencies within the same procedure. Such reasoning is based on the assumption that the restrictions placed on the content of the internal rules were not disproportionate per se.",

I do not consider that the requirement to amend the internal rules of an association and to resubmit a registration request is a disproportionate burden per se. The problem is not that it was necessary to amend the internal rules and resubmit the registration request but the fact that it was not possible to register as an association a nongovernmental organisation which did not wish either to obtain the status of a political party or to use the tools belonging by nature to political parties, but intended to influence public policies.",
