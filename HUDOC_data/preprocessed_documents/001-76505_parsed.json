The rule in Article 35 \u00a7 1 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has a close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention right (see Scordino v.

The Court notes that in a number of cases it has found remedies to be effective which involved in one way or another the taking of specific measures in order to accelerate the proceedings, such as the imposition of time-limits for the completion of a specific procedural step or act (Gonzalez Marin v. Spain (dec.) no. 39521/98, ECHR 1999-VII; Tom\u00e9 Mota v. Portugal (dec.) no.\u00a032082/96, ECHR 1999-IX; Holzinger v. Austria (no. 1), no. 23459/94, \u00a7\u00a022, ECHR 2001I; Kunz v.

With regard to the conduct of the authorities, the Court observes that the case was marked by very protracted preliminary investigations. They lasted from May 1994 until January 2001 when the indictment was filed, that is for more than six and a half years. This duration is not explained in a satisfactory manner by the need to wait for the results of investigations conducted by the German authorities, since after their receipt in January 1997 the preliminary investigations still continued for four years. On the basis of the file it appears that no major procedural steps were taken until February 2000 when an arrest warrant was issued against the applicant and legal aid requests were addressed to the German, Swiss and Austrian authorities. Even the Government admit to a \u201ccertain slowness\u201d of investigating judge L. who was eventually replaced in March 2000.
