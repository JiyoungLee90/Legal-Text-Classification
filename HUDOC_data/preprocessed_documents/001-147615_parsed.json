Later, he was held in Ljubljana prison three more times and was released in March 2011, January 2012 and December 2012. Throughout all this period the case-law, that none of the remedies relied on by the Government could be regarded with a sufficient degree of certainty as constituting an effective remedy for the applicants, was still as set out in the case of Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a010620) and the decision in the case of Bizjak was given only in July 2014. There appear to be no reasons to reach a different conclusion in the present case from the case of Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107. The Court therefore finds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention on account of the lack of an effective and accessible remedy under domestic law for the applicant\u2019s complaints in respect of the conditions of his detention.",
