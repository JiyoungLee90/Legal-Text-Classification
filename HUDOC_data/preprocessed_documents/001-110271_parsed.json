Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a Sri Lankan national suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused, and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to Sri Lanka. Lord Justice Dyson, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of Article 3 in a suicide case was, as in other Article 3 cases involving expulsion, whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, would face a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.",

It required firstly, that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity. Secondly, there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching Article 3. The court also found, thirdly, that because of the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of expulsion cases, the threshold for what would meet the threshold of Article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving State but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness. Fourthly, a risk of suicide could, in principle, form the basis of a successful claim under Article 3. Fifthly, an important factor in determining whether removal would breach Article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill-treatment in the receiving State, if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide, was objectively well-founded. A fear found not to be objectively well-founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of Article 3. Finally, the Court of Appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and/or receiving States had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide.

However, the Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law (see D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III), aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in principle claim any right to remain in the territory of a Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms of assistance provided by that State, unless such exceptional circumstances pertain as to render the implementation of a decision to remove an alien incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. Finally, the Court recalls that in order to violate Article 3, treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. This applies regardless of whether the risk of harm emanates from deliberate acts of State authorities or third parties; from a naturally occurring illness (see N., cited above, \u00a7 29); or even from the applicant himself (see Kharsa v. Sweden, no. 28419/95, Commission\u2019s decision of 26 October 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR)). The Court recalls that in previous cases involving a risk of suicide, it has found not only that the high threshold for Article 3 applies to the same extent as it does in other types of cases, but that appropriate and adequate steps taken by the relevant authorities to mitigate a risk of suicide will weigh against a conclusion that the high threshold of Article 3 has been reached (see Nikovic v. Sweden, no. 28285/95, Commission decision of 7 December 1995, (DR)).",

In this regard, the Court observes that the Government have set out, in their letter to the Court of 2 December 2009, the precautionary measures that would be taken should the applicant be re-admitted to immigration detention and the deportation order against him enforced. The Government addressed the risk that might arise at three stages: i) when the applicant is notified of the decision to remove him to Nigeria; ii) during his actual removal; and iii) after he has arrived in .

In the light of the precautions to be taken by the Government and the existence of adequate psychiatric care in Nigeria, should the applicant require it, the Court is unable to find that the applicant\u2019s deportation would result in a real and imminent risk of treatment of such a severity as to reach this threshold.

However, that interference would be justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8, being in accordance with law and taken in pursuit of the legitimate aims of protecting public safety, the prevention of crime, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Government also contended that the interference was proportionate given the nature and seriousness of the applicant\u2019s offences, which were, for the most part, drugs offences, which the Government considered to be particularly grave given the issues of public protection that they raised. The Government pointed in particular to the fact that the applicant\u2019s last offence had been of sufficient gravity to attract a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant had committed his offences when he was already an adult and his case could therefore be distinguished from that of the applicant in Maslov v.  [GC], no. 1638/03, 23 June 2008, whose offences by contrast could be characterised as \u201cjuvenile delinquency\u201d. The Government considered the young age at which the applicant had entered the United Kingdom and the fact that he had stronger ties with that country than with Nigeria to be relevant factors, but maintained that his deportation would have a relatively minor impact on the applicant given that he did not have family life in the United Kingdom and could re-establish private life in Nigeria. In this regard, the Government pointed to the applicant\u2019s good health, high intelligence and the fact that he had lived alone since the age of eighteen with little support. As such, and having regard to the importance of protecting the public from drugs-related crime, the Government were of the view that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Nigeria would represent a proportionate interference with his private life in terms of Article 8.",

Indeed it will be a rare case where a settled migrant will be unable to demonstrate that his or her deportation would interfere with his or her private life as guaranteed by Article 8 (see Miah v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53080/07, \u00a7\u00a017, 27\u00a0April 2010). Not all settled migrants will have equally strong family or social ties in the Contracting State where they reside but the comparative strength or weakness of those ties is, in the majority of cases, more appropriately considered in assessing the proportionality of the applicant\u2019s deportation under Article 8 \u00a7 2. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see\u00a0Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 63). However, the Court has previously held that there will be no family life between parents and adult children or between adult siblings unless they can demonstrate additional elements of dependence (Slivenko v.

While a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation or adopted policy rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born in those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot be expelled on the basis of their criminal record (see paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be expelled cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention, couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first paragraph.\u201d",

The Court notes that the Secretary of State takes an especially grave view of offences involving drugs, and accepts that she is entitled to do so, particularly given the destructive effects of such offences on society as a whole (see Dalia v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I). It is also noted that the deportation offence was not the applicant\u2019s first; he had several previous convictions, some of which were also for drug-related offences. The nature of the applicant\u2019s offending and the fact that, with the exception of the conviction for possession of drugs in February 2004, all of his offences appear to have been committed when he was over the age of eighteen and hence, an adult, mean that his case can clearly be distinguished from that of the applicant in Maslov, cited above. In that case, the applicant\u2019s offences could be characterised as \u201cjuvenile delinquency\u201d, but Mr Balogun\u2019s offences merit far more serious characterisation. The Court does, however, observe, with regard to the third of the relevant criteria listed above, that the applicant does not appear to have committed any further offences since his release from prison.",

Whilst the applicant has always maintained that he was brought to the United Kingdom at the age of three and has remained there since, the Government reject this claim, stating that there is no record of the applicant being present in the  until he was eight years old. The Court notes that even the application for leave to remain made on behalf of the applicant by social services stated that he had arrived at the age of three. This was long before the issue of the applicant\u2019s deportation arose. The Court therefore takes the view that the applicant\u2019s consistency as to the age at which he entered the country outweighs the lack of documentary evidence of his presence, and therefore accepts that he has been in the  since he was three. Furthermore, while the Court notes the Government\u2019s point that regardless of how long the applicant has been in the United Kingdom, only four years of his stay were with valid leave, the Court is of the view that the applicant, given the young age at which he was brought into the country and the unfortunate circumstances of his childhood, should not be penalised for his guardians\u2019 failure to regularise his status earlier. Given that the applicant can be classed as a settled migrant who has spent virtually the whole of his childhood in the host country, the Court finds that very serious reasons would be required to justify his expulsion (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 75).",

The main tie to  that the applicant may have, given the young age at which he left the country and consequent lack of memories or cultural experience, is the fact that his mother appears to reside there. The applicant claims not to be in contact with his mother or to have any knowledge of her whereabouts, and given that he does not appear to have lived with her since his arrival in the United Kingdom, the Court accepts that this is not a strong familial tie. However, it is one that could be pursued and strengthened by the applicant if he chose. The remainder of the applicant\u2019s relatives, namely, his half brother, the aunt with whom he lived as a child \u2013 and from whom it is presumed the applicant is now estranged \u2013 and a second aunt and her family, reside in the  and have settled immigration status. His father is deceased. The applicant\u2019s family ties in both the United Kingdom and  can therefore be characterised as limited. The Court is, however, of the view that his social and cultural ties to his host country are undoubtedly stronger than those to Nigeria, given his length of residence in the United Kingdom, the fact that he has both studied and worked there and his relationship, now of several years\u2019 duration, with his girlfriend.",

He was thrown out by this aunt at the age of fifteen and was thereafter taken into foster care. He has therefore not only spent by far the greater part of his childhood in the United Kingdom and been entirely educated in that country, but has been partly brought up in the care of the United Kingdom\u2019s social services. These elements of the applicant\u2019s background contribute significantly to the Court\u2019s finding that his ties to the United Kingdom are stronger than those to . However, while the Court views with sympathy the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s formative years, the fact remains that he is responsible for his own actions. Particularly in light of the fact that the majority of the applicant\u2019s offences were committed when he was already an adult, the Court finds that the applicant cannot excuse his past criminal conduct by reference to his upbringing.",

However, the Court has paid specific regard to the applicant\u2019s history of repeated, drugs-related offending and the fact that the majority of his offending was committed when he was an adult, and also to the careful and appropriate consideration that has been given to the applicant\u2019s case by the domestic authorities. With these factors in mind, the Court finds that the interference with the applicant\u2019s private life caused by his deportation would not be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.

In Nunez all the facts were before the Norwegian judicial authorities who gave relevant and sufficient reasons for their decision to uphold Mrs Nunez\u2019s expulsion. Likewise in A.A. all the facts were before the Immigration Tribunals and the Court of Appeal, and it was not for a moment suggested that these had erred in law or in fact (although in A.A. the UK Border Agency dragged its feet for more than two and a half years after the decision of the Court of Appeal).",
