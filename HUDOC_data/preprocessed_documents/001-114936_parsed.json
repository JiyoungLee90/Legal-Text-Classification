It requires that where an issue pertaining to the general interest is at stake, especially when it affects fundamental human rights, including property rights, the public authorities must act promptly and in an appropriate and above all consistent manner (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7\u00a0120, ECHR 2000I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a0128, ECHR 2004XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v.

It is desirable that public authorities act with the utmost care, in particular when dealing with matters of vital importance to individuals, such as welfare benefits and other such rights. In the present case, the Court considers that having discovered their mistake, the authorities failed in their duty to act speedily and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Moskal, cited above, \u00a7 72). The initial decision to grant the applicant an earlyretirement pension appears to have been taken lightly and without appropriate checks having been first undertaken.",
