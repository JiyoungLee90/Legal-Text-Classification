Shortly before then, the Court had given a decision in which it had found, in general terms, that Section 91 of the Courts Act was not an effective remedy as regards length of proceedings (Holzinger (no. 2) v. Austria [decision], no.\u00a028898/95, 12.10.1999, unreported). However, at that time this was the Court\u2019s only decision on the issue and it had not yet been confirmed by a judgment. This is all the more important, as it cannot be said that there was any constant case-law of the Commission with regard to Section 91 of the Courts Act. Moreover, on 2 December 1999, the Court found that an application under Articles 108 and 109 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure was an effective remedy as regards complaints about the length of proceedings (Tom\u00e9 Mota v. Portugal [decision], no. 32082/96, ECHR 1999IX). This remedy is comparable to an application under Section 91 of the Austrian Courts Act, as it provides for an interlocutory application which allows a superior authority inter alia to fix a time-limit for taking a procedural measure which the competent court has failed to take. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Government could have been expected to raise the issue of non-exhaustion either in their observations on admissibility, or at least following the Tom\u00e9 Mota decision, which was given well before the Court\u2019s admissibility decision on 29 August 2000 in the present case. As there are no particular reasons which would have absolved the Government from raising the preliminary objection in the proceedings on admissibility, they are estopped from doing so now. ",

This appears to be particularly relevant as regards the period between 16\u00a0October 1991, when the indictment was preferred, and 1 June 1994 when the trial was opened. The Court is not convinced by the applicants\u2019 argument that Section 91 of the Courts Act would not have offered prospects of success given the judicial vacancy, as this provision does seek to remedy the procedural dilatoriness of a particular judge, but of a court. Thus, the applicants could and should have made an application under Section 91 of the Courts Act and thereby reduced the period of delay. However, the Court notes that Section 91 of the Courts Act does not apply to delays caused by the Public Prosecutor. Thus, the applicants cannot be held responsible for any delays by the Public Prosecutor before the indictment was preferred on 16 October 1991.",
