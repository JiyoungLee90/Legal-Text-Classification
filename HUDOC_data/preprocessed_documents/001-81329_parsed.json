Some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities.

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Labita v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005).

In this connection the Court reiterates that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view. It must be examined with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding and reoffending or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, p. 19, \u00a7 43; and Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In the present case the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts warranting the applicant's detention on that ground, save for a reference to his lack of a permanent place of residence and work. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the mere absence of a fixed residence and work does not give rise to a danger of absconding (see Sulaoja v.\u00a0Estonia, no.\u00a055939/00, \u00a7\u00a064, 15 February 2005). The Court further observes that the authorities did not indicate a single circumstance suggesting that, if released, the applicant would abscond or evade justice, or that he would otherwise upset the course of the trial.

During the entire period under consideration the authorities did not consider the possibility of ensuring the applicant's attendance by the use of other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d \u2013 such as a written undertaking or bail \u2013 which are expressly provided for by Russian law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings. In this connection, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant offered guarantees by the two well-known persons to ensure his release. However, those guarantees were rejected without due consideration (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above). Furthermore, the Court finds it particularly striking that the applicant was kept in custody for six months, from 8 September 2000 to 8\u00a0March 2001, for the sole purpose of studying the case file. However, at no point did either the Regional Court or the Supreme Court, which examined the issue of the lawfulness of the applicant's detention during that period, consider having recourse to such alternative measures or, at the very minimum, seek to explain in their decisions why such alternatives would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course.",

They took no notice of the arguments in favour of the applicant's release pending trial. It is of particular concern to the Court that the Russian authorities persistently used a stereotyped summary formula to justify the extension of the applicant's detention; the prosecutors reproduced the same formula in all their decisions. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities, using the same formula, simultaneously extended the detention of the applicant and his co-defendants. In the Court's view, this approach is incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in so far as it permits the continued detention of a group of persons without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention or of compliance with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Dolgova v. , no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 2 March 2006).",

They thus failed to justify the applicant's continued deprivation of liberty for a period of four years and almost two months.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, judgment of 23\u00a0November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, p. 28, \u00a7\u00a028, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224, p. 23, \u00a7 84). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV).
