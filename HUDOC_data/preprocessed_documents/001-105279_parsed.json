The examination report indicated cardiomyopathy, presumably caused by drug addiction, as the cause of I.M.\u2019s death. It noted that I.M. had been intoxicated by a psychostimulant substance belonging to the amphetamine group which had triggered a heart attack and death. Furthermore, it discovered features of the following conditions: focal serous bronchopneumonia and chronic leptomeningitis, fatty degeneration of the liver, chronic hepatitis and nephritis, atherosclerotic heart disease, thyroid hyperplasia and cardiomegaly.

In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2000VII). Thus, the Court attaches importance to the particular vulnerability of persons in custody (ibid.). It considers that, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is later found dead, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation for the events leading to his death, failing which the authorities must be held responsible under Article 2 of the Convention (see Velikova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a041488/98, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2000VI). Indeed, events in prisons or other State-controlled facilities lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, which therefore have a duty to account for them (see Ertak v. , no. 20764/92, \u00a7 132, ECHR 2000-V, and Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 103, ECHR 2001-III (extracts)).

While the obligation to investigate is of means only and there is no absolute right to obtain a prosecution or conviction, any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Makaratzis v.  [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7 74, ECHR\u00a02004XI). At the same time, a failure on the part of the State to advance a satisfactory and convincing explanation for a death occurring under its control is an inconceivable result if an investigation complies with the minimum standards satisfying the requirement of effectiveness.",

It remains unclear what kind of drug was found in I.M.\u2019s body and how it had been trafficked into the SIZO. The Court also observes that about three months before his death, I.M. had been found to be healthy and in unstable remission from drug addiction, and that the state of his health had never been the object of the SIZO doctors\u2019 attention. The applicants\u2019 belated allegation about the poor health of their son has also to be taken into account although it is not corroborated by any documents and contradicts their own submissions to the domestic authorities (see paragraph 22 above).

While the findings of a later forensic medical examination might be expected to overrule that early and preliminary conclusion, this is not obvious in the present case, given that about two years after I.M.\u2019s death the investigators called for another expert examination in order to verify whether I.M. had in fact suffered a head injury before his death (see paragraph 58 above).",

The Court notes that, although the applicants have not yet paid the legal fees, they are bound to pay them pursuant to a contractual obligation. As can be seen from the case file materials, Ms\u00a0Topolevska has been representing the applicants throughout the proceedings before the Court and is therefore entitled to seek payment of her fees under the contract, which, according to the currency exchange rate as of June 2008, are equal to about EUR 1,000. Accordingly, the Court considers those fees to have been \u201cactually incurred\u201d (see Tebieti M\u00fchafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v. Azerbaijan, no. 37083/03, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2009...).
