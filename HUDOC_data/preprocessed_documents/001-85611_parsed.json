The judgment of 28 December 2004 deprived the applicant of his capacity to act independently in almost all areas of life: he was no longer able to sell or buy any property on his own, to work, to travel, to choose his place of residence, to join associations, to marry, and so on. Even his liberty could henceforth have been limited without his consent and without any judicial supervision. In sum, the Court concludes that the deprivation of legal capacity amounted to an interference with the private life of the applicant (see Matter v. , no. 31534/96, \u00a7 68, 5 July 1999).",

However, as a rule, in such a complex matter as determining somebody\u2019s mental capacity, the authorities should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation. This is mostly explained by the fact that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with the persons concerned and are therefore particularly well placed to determine such issues. The task of the Court is rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by the national authorities in the exercise of their powers in this respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Bronda v. , 9 June 1998, \u00a7 59, Reports 1998-IV).",

He was not allowed to communicate with the outside world until his discharge. Finally, the applicant subjectively perceived his confinement in the hospital as a deprivation of liberty. Contrary to what the Government suggested, he had never regarded his detention as consensual and had unequivocally objected to it throughout the entire duration of his stay in the hospital.",
