The district court ordered the district prosecutor\u2019s office to resume the investigation. The district court noted that the investigators had failed to identify the military and security units responsible for the operation, had failed to question the commanders of and participants in the operation and to study the documents related to its execution and results, and had failed to question the commanders of the district military and security authorities about the operation. The court granted the applicants access to the case file, stating that the documents in the file were accessible unless they contained secret information and noted that access to the file was essential in order to realise the applicant\u2019s right to appeal. As to copying of documents from the case file, the court noted that this right was accorded to victims only upon completion of the investigation, and not when the proceedings were adjourned. On 23 August 2006 the Chechnya Supreme Court upheld the district court\u2019s decision.",

These measures still failed to bear any fruit as to the outcome of the investigation; however the Court attaches particular weight to the fact that after 2005 the applicants perceived this investigation as effective, as demonstrated by their active stance. Thus, the applicants successfully challenged the suspension of proceedings in the district court on two occasions in 2006 (see paragraphs 58 -59 above) and demonstrated their willingness to cooperate with the investigation in other important aspects (see, for example, paragraph 51 in fine).",

The Court is of the view that, as the closest relatives of the deceased, the applicants bore a duty to take steps to keep track of the investigation\u2019s progress, especially as time is of importance in resolving the issues in such a case. However, in the present case the Court considers that the applicants complied with the requirement to submit their case within \u201ca very few years after the events\u201d (see Varnava and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0162).

The Court deems it important to reiterate at this juncture that there is little ground to be overly prescriptive as regards the possibility of an obligation to investigate unlawful killings arising many years after the events, since the public interest in obtaining the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators is firmly recognised, particularly in the context of war crimes and crimes against humanity (Brecknell, cited above, \u00a7 69).",
