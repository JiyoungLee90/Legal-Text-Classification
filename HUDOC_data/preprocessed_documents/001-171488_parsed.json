The Court notes that the issues raised by the applicant are essentially the same as those examined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment (cited above). The facts of the present case closely resemble those of the Gafgaz Mammadov case. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz\u00a0Mammadov judgment also apply to the applicant\u2019s first case. In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being abusively banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7 55); doubts about the credibility of the formal ground, namely, Article 310.1 of the CAO, invoked by the authorities for arresting and convicting the participant in an unauthorised demonstration (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a056 and 62); the authorities\u2019 failure to take into consideration the fact that the demonstration had been notified (ibid., \u00a7 60); the lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration, which had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and the lack of any acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov case the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

The Court observes that the organisers did not give the BCEA prior notice of the demonstration of 26 January 2013. Examining the applicant\u2019s argument that no such notice was required by law, the Court notes that, indeed, under Article 5 \u00a7 IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly, no prior written notification was required for \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d. Nevertheless, the applicant has failed to sufficiently substantiate his allegation that the demonstration in which he participated was a spontaneous one. In such circumstances the Court is ready to accept that the dispersal of the demonstration of 26 January 2013 was lawful (compare Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11\u00a0February 2016).",

Therefore, for the same reasons as those outlined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present case have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration (see Gafgaz\u00a0Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 61). The authorities also failed to acknowledge that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

The Court notes in particular that in the second case the sanction applied to the applicant under Article 298 of the CAO was very harsh. He was ordered to pay AZN 500, whereas at the material time the minimum wage in the country was AZN 93.5. The measures applied in the present cases and the fear of sanctions that could potentially be applied against participants and organisers of unauthorised peaceful assemblies undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of assembly. This deters other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrations, and, more generally, from participating in open political debate.",

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment also apply to the applicant\u2019s first case. In that judgment, the Court noted in particular that the measures applied by the authorities, namely, the arrest and custody followed by a prison sentence of several days had pursued aims unrelated to the formal ground relied on to justify the deprivation of liberty, and implied an element of bad faith and arbitrariness (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0108).
