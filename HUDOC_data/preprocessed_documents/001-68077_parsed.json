Moreover, [the applicant] has [finally] accepted that he infected the young man with whom he had a long-lasting relationship from the beginning of the 1990s, thus admitting that it was not the other way around.

Nevertheless, it has not been established that [the applicant] has materially changed his attitude regarding the risk that he may spread the disease.

Moreover, having been in touch with the physicians whom [the applicant] has [recently] contacted voluntarily [P.H. and C.G.], the county medical officer considers that these consultations were partly economically motivated [on account of the fact that the applicant needed medical certificates in order to continue to receive sickness benefit], partly motivated by his wish to be declared mentally healthy, but [not motivated] by any willingness to commence treatment. During [the applicant's] contact with the doctors in question, they did not discuss the risk of spreading the disease at all. A treatment plan was not formally signed [by the applicant]. In conclusion, in the county medical officer's opinion, [if released the applicant] will not voluntarily comply with the instructions given or limit the spreading of the disease.\u201d",

During these two years he did not have any contact with the county medical officer or the consulting physician. Periodically he has used a false name and has been living a very secluded life, obviously owing to the risk of being discovered. A life at liberty makes great demands upon the person carrying the infection. During the time preceding his compulsory isolation, [the applicant] was not able to follow the practical instructions issued. Subsequently, he has consistently declined the help offered by the consulting physician and the psychiatrist at the special care facility at the hospital and has instead responded with aversion and mistrust \u2013 and by escaping. [The Court] finds that it has been difficult for [the applicant] to accept the information regarding the HIV infection and that he needs help in dealing with this critical situation. It appears from the evidence that [the applicant] still shows aversion to the treatment offered and that he is considered likely to abscond. [The Court] has not been convinced that [the applicant] is not misusing alcohol and finds that, especially in connection with alcohol consumption, [the applicant] is likely to be unable to control his sexual behaviour. Against this background, [the Court] finds that there is good reason to suppose that, if he remains free, [the applicant] will not comply with the practical instructions issued and that this entails a risk of the infection spreading.\u201d",

'Misuse' in psychiatric terms is defined as a maladaptive use of substances ... This diagnosis is to be distinguished from alcohol dependency, which means a compulsive use of alcohol with abstinence and social complications, and is more difficult to master. The diagnosis 'paranoid personality disorder' is defined as a pervading suspiciousness and lack of trust in other people, whose motives are consistently perceived as malicious. It follows from the definition of 'paranoid personality disorder' itself that this is manifest in the patient's personality from the time he or she becomes an adult. Owing to the fact that the person in question perceives the disorder as part of his or her own self, the motivation for change is usually insufficient. It is not correct to talk in terms of lack of awareness of a disease, since it is not considered that a disease is involved but rather a variation in personality, although the latter may well cause complications in relations with other individuals and society. When such complications occur, an individual with a personality disorder may display different symptoms such as depression, anxiety, etc. In [my] interview with [the applicant], the latter was fairly open and talkative. When he talked about experiences from his time at school, he displayed different emotions. He also showed empathy as far as other people from those years were concerned. He was also partly able to shoulder responsibility for his own mistakes, without blaming others. However, he was very rigid in his interpretation of what had occurred in his adult life and particularly the events of recent years after he had been informed that he had the HIV virus in September 1994. His attitude towards the county medical officer and the staff at the infection ward, whom he believed had kept harassing him unjustly, was almost hateful. [The applicant] felt that he had been subjected to persecution between 1994 and 1995. This could possibly be interpreted as a symptom of delusion. From 1996, he had not experienced feelings of persecution, inter alia since he had secured his own liberty. With regard to sexual relations, [the applicant] has stated that he preferred sexual contact with boys around the age of 17. He was not interested in pre-pubescent boys. He had been celibate since 1996 and had no longer any particular sexual desires or fantasies. He was fully aware that he was carrying the HIV virus and was careful to stress that he was not afraid to die. His attitude towards medication against the HIV infection was negative. The reasons for this were that such medication could have side effects and perhaps, above all, because it would entail limitations on his freedom since he would be subjected to various check-ups. [The applicant] spontaneously expressed a wish to have further talks on a voluntary basis. When asked whether such talks could be part of a treatment plan in cooperation with the county medical officer and the staff at the infection ward, he answered 'no', the reason being that he would feel ashamed of himself if he were to give up this fight.\u201d",

That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is executed in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see, for example, Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Hilda Hafsteinsd\u00f3ttir, cited above, \u00a7 51).",

There is a link between all those persons in that they may be deprived of their liberty either in order to be given medical treatment or because of considerations dictated by social policy, or on both medical and social grounds. It is therefore legitimate to conclude from this context that a predominant reason why the Convention allows the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 (e) of Article 5 to be deprived of their liberty is not only that they are a danger to public safety but also that their own interests may necessitate their detention (see Guzzardi v.

A few days ago in France a person was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for deliberately transmitting Aids to uninfected partners. On the other hand, it should again be emphasised that liberty (which gives rise to responsibility) is and should be the rule. Systematic confinement of persons capable of spreading infectious diseases would turn them into outcasts; this would be an unacceptable step backwards in terms of human rights, which are founded on the principle of freedom and responsibility of the human being. It is acceptable only for limited periods (\u201cquarantine\u201d), where the disease is curable, as in the case of tuberculosis (I do not think that placement in a sanatorium is in principle contrary to Article 5), and where the disease is spread unintentionally, which is not normally the case with sexually transmitted diseases: what could be more intentional than the conduct of a person who has sexual intercourse without any precautions when he knows that he is infected (this was not the case for the applicant in 1994 \u2013 see paragraph 7 of this opinion)?",

If he was so dangerous that his confinement had to be prolonged, why was he de facto left at liberty with the risk of transmitting Aids? Secondly, it appears from the evidence that Mr Enhorn did not actually infect anyone, or indeed have any sexual relations, after 1994 (see the reference in paragraph 23 to the report drawn up in 1999 by a qualified psychiatrist). A fortiori, if there was no established risk that the applicant might pass on Aids, why was the order for his continued isolation extended for a further two and a half years?",

I can accept in conceptual terms that a disproportionate deprivation of liberty is not necessary and that, if it is not necessary, it borders on arbitrary. However, some clarification would be desirable, particularly with a view to ensuring legal certainty.

The problem is that where such measures entail deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, they must be consistent with the Court's settled case-law, which is rightly stringent. I would point out in this connection that \u201cwhen the matter is one which concerns ordre public within the Council of Europe, a scrupulous supervision by the organs of the Convention of all measures capable of violating the rights and freedoms which it guarantees is necessary in every case\u201d (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.
