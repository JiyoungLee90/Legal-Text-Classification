The final decision is clearly a decision on the merits rendered after the examination of the substance of the case. Moreover, the judicial decisions rendered by the domestic courts in the instant case are called judgments (in Macedonian: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430), a term which designates decisions on the merits.

Nonetheless, in the instant case, I find the blame of \u201cexcessive formalism\u201d pernicious. The crucial legal issue in the case was the identification of one of the parties to a contract. The question of who is a party to a contract is of utmost importance for the security of legal commerce. Legal certainty in this area is fundamental to protect the interests of legal subjects who enter into contractual relations with other parties. Everyone has to know whether he is a party to a legal relationship with another party. In this domain the reproach of \u201cexcessive formalism\u201d in the application of the law is inappropriate.
