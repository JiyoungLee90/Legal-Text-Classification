In that court\u2019s view, this was all the more true where, as in the present case, public interests were at stake and the legislative provisions sought to prevent the local authority\u2019s financial situation from worsening any further. It was also the court\u2019s view that once the insolvency procedure had been initiated, the debtor could not be held liable for the non-performance of its obligations, and that this justified the \u201cblocking\u201d (blocco) of the statutory interest and the compensation for inflation.
