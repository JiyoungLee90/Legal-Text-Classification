The officer then grabbed the applicant by his clothes and dragged him on to the floor and down the stairs to the sobering-up room. The applicant tried to turn onto his left side as he had had an operation on his right leg and he was trying to spare it. While he was being dragged down the stairs, he felt a sharp pain in his left leg and started to scream. The officer did not stop; he dragged him into a cell and left him there. The applicant was unable to move. After some time, three persons entered the cell, took off his trousers, causing him more pain, and injected him with some substances.

The Government, firstly, noted that he had lodged his complaint with the domestic authorities almost one month after the events and that he had not produced any evidence or described the alleged perpetrators. Secondly, he had only belatedly informed the domestic authorities about possible witnesses and had not properly identified them. Moreover, the statements of V.S. had varied, whereas the testimony of the police officers concerning the place and time of the detention had remained consistent. Thirdly, the applicant had not raised any complaints when leaving the police station or in the hospital. The Government relied on the applicant\u2019s statement as noted by the attending doctor, that he had fallen on the street. They further considered that the applicant\u2019s allegations regarding facial injuries, raised at a later date before the domestic authorities, were unfounded as the administrative detention report had noted that they had been sustained previously.

In this connection, the Court notes that a medical examination is an important safeguard against the ill-treatment of detained persons which should apply as from the very outset of deprivation of liberty, regardless of how it may be described under the legal system concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, T\u00fcrkan v. Turkey, no.\u00a033086/04, \u00a7 42, 18\u00a0September 2008).",

The Court has already held that where the national authorities fail to conduct a medical examination before placing the applicant in detention, the Government cannot rely on that failure in their defence and claim that the injuries in question pre-dated the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody (see T\u00fcrkan, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

If that had been the case and, indeed, if the applicant had been carried into the police station not fully conscious after having fallen down on stairs outside the police premises, it is clear from the above-mentioned case-law that the police authorities would have been required to seek a medical opinion on his state of health before placing him in custody, or to call an ambulance without undue delay. The Court has held, in a related context, that the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, \u00a7\u00a078, 4 April 2000).",

The ambulance medical record, drawn up some eight hours later, revealed more injuries on the applicant\u2019s body \u2013 on his left hip and head; a further bruise on the lower part of his body was also recorded. Furthermore, two medico-legal examinations confirmed these injuries, albeit belatedly, in particular the applicant\u2019s hip injury and the bruises on the lower part of his body. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the findings contained in those reports, namely, that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been sustained as a result of bumping into blunt objects, are consistent with the applicant\u2019s allegations of having been dragged down the stairs in the police station on his left side. These findings are also sufficiently serious to amount to ill-treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013 and 39, Series A no. 336).",

Furthermore, the use of force in the context of an arrest, even if it entails injury, may fall outside Article 3, particularly in circumstances resulting from an applicant\u2019s own conduct (see Berli\u0144ski v. Poland, nos.\u00a027715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 64, 20 June 2002). In applying these principles, the Court found in Holodenko that the use of force against the applicant at the time of his arrest had not been proportionate in view of the seriousness of the injuries and his own behaviour (see Holodenko, cited above, \u00a7 70). In Igars, however, the Court found that the applicant did not lay the basis of an arguable complaint that he had been ill-treated as alleged (see Igars v. Latvia (dec.), no. 11682/03, \u00a7 72). In some other cases, the Court could not, on the basis of the evidence before it, establish whether the use of force on the applicant had been strictly necessary and proportionate in the circumstances (see Sapo\u017ekovs v. Latvia, no. 8550/03, \u00a7\u00a066, 11\u00a0February 2014, not yet final), whether the applicant\u2019s injuries upon arrest were caused as alleged (see Grimailovs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0109), whether the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment on the day of his arrest or whether the authorities had recourse to physical force which had not been rendered strictly necessary by the applicant\u2019s own behaviour (see Timofejevi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).",

The Court agrees with the applicant that his complaint cannot be considered unjustifiably delayed as he submitted it within five days following his discharge from the hospital. Nor can it be said that the absence of complaints when leaving the police station or in the hospital undermines the credibility of the applicant\u2019s allegations.

It does not, however, permit the detention of an individual merely because of his alcohol intake. However, in the text of Article 5 there is nothing to suggest that this provision prevents that measure from being applied by the State to an individual abusing alcohol, in order to limit the harm caused by alcohol to himself and the public, or to prevent dangerous behaviour after drinking (see Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-2).",

The Government considered that the applicant\u2019s conduct was constitutive of the offence of \u201cindecent public behaviour while being in a state of alcohol intoxication\u201d. The Court notes, however, that it does not follow from materials in the case-file that he was officially held liable for any offence under section 171. The Court observes that this provision provides for the following sanctions: a warning, a monetary fine and an administrative arrest. The applicant did not receive any warning, nor was any monetary fine imposed on him. Furthermore, an administrative arrest was not imposed on him; the case-file material does not reveal that a judge had ordered his administrative arrest. It appears that the only reason mentioned for the applicant\u2019s detention was to \u201csober up\u201d, as it stems from the contents of his administrative detention report as reproduced in expert report no. 352 of 13\u00a0November 2003 (see paragraph 16 above). It cannot therefore be considered that the applicant\u2019s detention was carried out pursuant to this provision; all the more so as administrative detention was not one of the applicable sanctions for the administrative offence proscribed in section 171, as pointed out by the applicant.",

It suffices to note in this respect that the measure of administrative detention pursuant to this provision could only be imposed on a person, who had committed an administrative offence (see paragraph 37 above). The Court notes that there is no indication, in the documents submitted by the parties to the Court, that the applicant had committed the administrative offence under section 171 or indeed any other administrative offence. The Government have not sufficiently explained the application of section 254 in practice to the applicant\u2019s situation and have not, accordingly, justified his detention on the basis of the latter provision. Taking into account this conclusion, the Court also rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies as the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention and any appeals thereof remain unclear.",

In this regard the Court notes that in the present case, similarly to the circumstances in Witold Litwa, no consideration appears to have been given to the fact that the Code of Administrative Violations provides for several different measures which might be applied to an intoxicated person. There are specific administrative sanctions for the offence of \u201cappearing in public places in an intoxicated state, which is an affront to human dignity\u201d which can range from a mere warning to a monetary fine. The applicable sanctions are harsher for a repeated offence \u2013 they range from a bigger monetary fine to an administrative arrest for up to 15 days, which can only be imposed by a judge (see paragraph 37 above). It does not appear from the documents made available to the Court that some of these sanctions, which are less stringent than a deprivation of liberty (for example, a warning or a monetary fine), were considered and found to be inappropriate before the decision was made to apply administrative detention, a measure depriving the applicant of his liberty for around eight hours. Even if the Court were to accept what it understands to be the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant could reasonably have been considered to pose a threat to public order or to himself, as it has already noted above, the domestic authorities would also have needed to consider seeking a medical opinion as to his state of health before placing him in custody, or call an ambulance without undue delay, given the circumstances.",
