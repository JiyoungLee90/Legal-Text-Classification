In order to take into account the realities of the situation, the effects of the revocation thus have to be ascertained in the light also of the situation obtaining on the applicants\u2019 surrounding properties.

One has, however, to bear in mind that, over the years, the exploitation of gravel had become more and more regulated and, in fact, restricted (see paragraphs 10 and 32-35 above). Thus, the amendment introduced on 1 July 1973 to the 1964 Act (see paragraph 35 above) empowered the authorities to revoke, without compensation, old permits, such as the applicants\u2019, after ten years had passed, that is after 1 July 1983.

The extent and speed of the implementation of conservation measures is guided not only by the desire to protect the environment, but also by other factors and financial and economic considerations may have a heavy impact. It seems to be worthwhile to underline this argument with a reference to the Sunday Times judgment of 26 April 1979 (Series A no. 30).

Taking into account what has been stated above, and also the well established principles relevant to the application of Article 14 (art. 14), it cannot be said that the alleged difference of treatment lacked an objective and reasonable justification: it had a legitimate aim (see paragraphs 48 and 50 of the judgment) and the revocation decision itself was not disproportionate to this aim. Accordingly, I find no violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of the First Protocol (art. 14+P1-1).",
