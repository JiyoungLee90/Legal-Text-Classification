The AFC consequently invited the applicant to transmit any observations he might have within a specified time-limit. The applicant availed himself of that right. On 4\u00a0November\u00a02010 the AFC gave a fresh decision, which was properly reasoned, reaching the conclusion that all the preconditions were present for affording administrative mutual assistance. Subsequently, the applicant lodged a second appeal with the Federal Administrative Court, which dismissed that appeal by judgment of 2 March 2011 (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above).
