Persons in custody are in a particularly vulnerable position, and the authorities are under an obligation to account for their treatment. The Convention requires the State to protect the health and physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty, for example by adopting appropriate measures for the protection of their lives and providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see, inter alia, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a0111, ECHR 2001III; Mouisel v.

The Court also reiterates that where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7\u00a085, ECHR 1999-IV, and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR\u00a02000-VII).",

The system required by Article 2 must provide for an independent and impartial official investigation that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness. Accordingly, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness, and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system, and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved. The requirement of public scrutiny is also relevant in this context (see Kats and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 29971/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, 18 December 2008).",

The parties, however, disputed the exact way in which the virus had been transmitted. The Government indicated two possible routes for the HIV transmission: the applicant giving himself a large number of tattoos in detention, and the applicant committing self-mutilating acts which involved, inter alia, swallowing sharp objects and cutting his arm. The applicant insisted that the illness was the result of negligence on the part of prison medical staff during invasive medical procedures performed on him.

Neither the applicant\u2019s medical records nor any other documents submitted by the parties contained any reference to a history of intravenous drug use by the applicant. Similarly, there was no evidence of sexual contact between the applicant and other inmates. The Government identified the applicant\u2019s tattoos as \u201chome-made\u201d, which, as follows from their submissions, meant that the tattoos could have been done in insanitary conditions with infected instruments; they also indicated that his self-inflicted injuries could have been the primary source of the infection. The Court cannot disregard the Government\u2019s argument, given that tattooing and acts of self-mutilation both require the skin to be broken or contact with blood and bodily fluids using objects or instruments which may be multiply-used and unsterilised, which in its turn could carry health risks, not excluding infection with HIV. It also bears in mind the finding by the specialists from the Hygiene and Epidemics Centre that the most recent tattoo was done in 2008 (see paragraph 15 above). While the test performed in February 2009 showed that the applicant was HIV-negative, transmission of the virus by the tattooing in 2008 cannot be completely ruled out. The Court notes that a \u201cwindow\u201d period during which an infected person would not test positive runs from several days to up to six months, depending on the patient\u2019s body and the HIV test used. The Court further observes that the applicant refused to have an HIV test in 2010, which could have narrowed the window of uncertainty as to the possible time of his infection.\u00a0It also observes that the applicant committed two acts of self-mutilation between February 2009, when he still tested HIV-negative, and February 2011, when tests showed that he was infected. While infection on those occasions in the circumstances described by the parties is unlikely, the Court cannot entirely dismiss the Government\u2019s argument.",

The Court also reiterates the applicant\u2019s argument, which is unsupported by any evidence but not entirely lacking validity, that the Government did not produce any proof that any of his tattoos were recent. The Government could apparently have provided the Court with a list of the applicant\u2019s tattoos, which would have been drawn up each time he was admitted to a detention facility, and compare it to those he has now. They could also have requested an expert opinion to show when the tattoos had been made, on the basis of the colour of the tattoo ink.",

Thus, the investigation must be thorough. This means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened, and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions.

A criminal-law inquiry could have allowed the assembling of evidence necessary to corroborate the applicant\u2019s allegation of negligence on the part of prison medical staff leading to his contracting the virus.

The investigating authorities\u2019 role was critical not only to the pursuit of criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the offence, but also to the pursuit by the applicant of other remedies to redress the harm he had suffered (see Shchebetov v.

In most of the cases concerning the detention of persons who were ill, the Court has examined whether or not the applicant received adequate medical assistance in prison. The Court reiterates in this regard that even where Article 3 does not entitle a detainee to be released \u201con compassionate grounds\u201d, it has always interpreted the requirement to secure the health and well-being of detainees, among other things, as an obligation on the part of the State to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094; Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2002-VI; and Khudobin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2006-XII (extracts)).",

The Court observes that the applicant did not indicate any specific omissions on the part of the prison medical personnel which had rendered their services ineffective or inadequate. He limited his submissions to the general grievance that an HIV-positive inmate should not be treated in the way he had been treated. However, having assessed the evidence, the Court finds the quality of the medical care provided to the applicant to have been adequate.",

While the Court is concerned that it took the Russian authorities ten months to perform the first CD4 cell count, which is considered one of the major instruments in identifying the proper time for the commencement of treatment, there is no evidence that the clinical staging and assessment of the applicant by prison medical staff were incorrect, or that they delayed the initiation of the antiretroviral treatment. The medical record produced by the Government does not show that the applicant\u2019s clinical status called for his urgent placement on the chemotherapy regime before December 2011, when he started receiving the treatment. The CD4 count test performed in December 2011, which showed slightly over 320 cells/mm3, served as indirect evidence that no delay in the introduction of the antiretroviral treatment had occurred (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant received regular and systematic clinical assessment and monitoring, which formed part of the comprehensive treatment strategy aimed at preventing the deterioration of the applicant\u2019s condition. The Court is unable to find any evidence, and the applicant did not argue otherwise, that the recommendations as to the frequency of testing or the permanent character of the antiretroviral treatment were disregarded by the medical staff of the detention facilities.",

The schedule provided by the Government showed that the applicant received the treatment without any interruptions, with the daily intake of the drugs being carried out under the supervision of prison nurses. The Court is satisfied that the Government introduced psychological and control mechanisms, such as consultations with a psychiatrist and supervision by medical staff, to ensure the applicant\u2019s adherence to the treatment and compliance with the prescribed drug regime. The Court notes, in particular, that the applicant was offered psychological support and attention and was provided with clear and complete explanations about medical procedures, the desired outcome of the treatment, and the negative effects of interrupting it.",
