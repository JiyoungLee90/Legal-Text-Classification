The case originated in an application (no. 13813/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Yelena Yevgenyevna Shibayeva (“the applicant”), on 9 March 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr Veselov, a lawyer practising in Serpukhov. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr M. Galperin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 February 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaint concerning non-enforcement of judgements in the applicant’s favour and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Serpukhov.
On 20 October 2005 the Serpukhov Town Court of the Moscow Region (“the Town Court”) found the applicant’s dismissal unlawful. The court ordered the applicant’s former employer, the state veterinary institution in the Moscow Region “Serpukhovskaya stantsiya po borbe s boleznyami zhivotnykh” (ГУ ветеринарии Московской области “Серпуховская станция по борьбе с болезнями животных”), to reinstate her in the position of a veterinarian, as well as to pay her 53,142.73 Russian roubles (RUB), as amended on 7 November 2005. On 14 December 2005 the judgment came into force.
On 20 October 2005 and on 10 January 2006 the writs of execution were issued as regards the obligation to reinstate the applicant and to make the payment, respectively. The enforcement proceedings were initiated.
On 14 February 2006 the enforcement proceedings in respect of the payment were terminated as the amount ordered by the judgment had been transferred to the applicant.
In the course of the enforcement proceedings concerning the reinstatement, the bailiff in charge of the enforcement filed a petition in the Town Court to pay the applicant her average wages for the period of nonenforcement of the judgment. On 22 June 2006 the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 130,283.10 in average wages for the period from 21 October 2005 until 31 May 2006, to be paid by the debtor institution. The decision came into force on 4 July 2006. On 12 July 2006 the bailiffs initiated enforcement proceedings.
On 11 September 2006 the applicant complained to the Town Court of bailiffs’ inefficiency during the enforcement proceedings as regards her reinstatement and the payment awarded on 22 June 2006.
On 28 September 2006 the Town Court established, in particular, that the bailiff concerned twice requested the head of the debtor institution to immediately reinstate the applicant. On 10 November 2005 the debtor institution refused, referring to some objective reasons preventing them from doing that. Later, in November-December 2005, they argued that in the structure of the institution there was no such post as mentioned in the judgment of 20 October 2005. Moreover, the debtor institution submitted that they could not reinstate the applicant in August-September 2006 due to the fact that the head of their institution was on leave. The Town Court noted that the bailiffs attempted to penalise the head of the debtor institution in December 2005 and in February 2006, and applied for recovery of the wages for the applicant for the period of non-enforcement (see paragraph 8 above). The court, therefore, dismissed the applicant’s complaint. Its decision became final on 14 October 2006.
On the same day the Town Court delivered a special court ruling. The court considered invalid all the reasons cited by the debtor institution in justification of the delay in reinstatement of the applicant. In particular, the applicant was not required to submit any documents to be reinstated. According to the court, neither the alleged lack of the post to which the applicant had to be reinstated nor the absence of the head of the institution during his leave could prevent the reinstatement. Thus, the debtor institution was found to be violating the domestic law and impeding execution of a binding judicial decision. The Town Court ordered that the situation be brought to the notice of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the Moscow Region.
On 19 December 2006 the applicant was reinstated as required by the judgment of 20 October 2005.
On 15 January 2007 the Town Court granted the bailiff’s request to award the applicant her average wages for the period from 1 June 2006 until 18 December 2006. Thus, the debtor institution was ordered to pay the applicant RUB 125,821.35. The decision came into force on 26 January 2007. The amount under the judgment, after deduction of the income tax, was paid to the applicant.
On 9 February 2007, in execution of the decision of 22 June 2006, RUB 113,346.10 was transferred to the applicant, and the income tax in the amount of RUB 16,937 was sent to the treasury.
In force at the material time, Article 120 § 1 defined an institution as an entity established by its owner for the performance of managerial, socio-cultural or other non-commercial functions and funded by its owner in whole or in part. Article 298 § 1 provided that an institution could not alienate or otherwise dispose of the property assigned to it by its owner. Article 120 § 2 provided that an institution was liable under its obligations to the extent of its cash funds. If it lacked sufficient cash funds, the owner of the property assigned to it incurred vicarious liability.
Article 399 § 1 provided that, before claiming a debt from a person whose liability is vicarious as described above, a creditor shall first claim the debt from the principal debtor. If the principal debtor refuses to satisfy the claim or no reply is received within a reasonable time, the claim may be brought against the person vicariously liable.
On 30 April 2010 Russian Parliament enacted Federal Law no. 68FZ “On Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a Judgment within a Reasonable Time” (“the Compensation Act”). A summary of its provisions, which at the material time only concerned monetary claims against the State, may be found in the Court’s decision in Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev v. Russia ((dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, §§ 15-19, 23 September 2010).
On 14 December 2016 Russian Parliament enacted Federal Law no. 450-FZ amending Federal Law no. 68-FZ on Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a Judgment within a Reasonable Time (“the new Law” amending “the Compensation Act”). The amendments introduced provisions in the Act concerning compensation for violation of the right to enforcement within a reasonable time of a judgment ordering the State to fulfil obligations of a pecuniary and/or non-pecuniary nature. The new Law, signed by the President of the Russian Federation on 19 December 2016, entered into force on 1 January 2017. It extended the scope of the Compensation Act to cases concerning the non-enforcement of domestic judgments imposing obligations of a pecuniary or non-pecuniary nature on various domestic authorities. For a summary of the provisions of the new Law see Shtolts and Others v. Russia (dec.) (nos. 77056/14 and 2 others, §§ 3141, 30 January 2018).
