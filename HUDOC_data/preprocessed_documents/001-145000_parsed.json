It considered that the INPS had not submitted any relevant arguments, save for a reiteration of the text of the impugned law. According to the Court of Cassation, by means of Article 9(6) of Law No. 67 of 1988, the legislator had wished to specify that the exemption was to be applied to the entire rate and not to the rate resulting after concession, thus excluding the incompatibility of the two benefits and presupposing the enjoyment of both contemporaneously. The Court of Cassation noted that when the legislator had wished to exclude the application of the concession to employers operating in the South, it had specifically done so (as in Legislative decree no. 536 of 1987). However, the legislator had made no mention of employers operating in disadvantaged areas in the North.",

Indeed, the prohibition on applying laws retroactively was a constitutional norm only applicable to the criminal sphere. It considered that the legislator could enact both laws of authentic interpretation \u2013 which clarify and determine the extent of the original norm within the content of what was originally plausibly provided \u2013 and innovative ones with retroactive effect in so far as such retroactivity was reasonably justified and not in conflict with other values and interests protected by the Constitution. The Constitutional Court noted that a law of authentic interpretation could not be unreasonable in so far as it was limited to assigning to the provision to be interpreted a meaning which was already therein contained and which was one of the possible meanings of the original text. Indeed, in the present case, the prohibition on applying the benefits cumulatively had been one of the possible interpretations of Article 9(6) of Law No. 67 of 1988 which had immediately been contested by the INPS but which ten years later had been given another, indeed possible, meaning by the Court of Cassation.

This was evident from the object, function and method of calculation of the benefits at issue. Thus, had they been intended to be cumulative, it would have had to be expressly provided for in law or authorised. The fact that the benefits at issue were not cumulable was further confirmed by an assessment of the entire legal framework concerning the subject matter, including, for example, other benefits available to the agricultural sector in general.

The established case-law had been based on the legislator\u2019s intention, as transpired from the explanatory memorandum issued by the Parliament study service (servizio studi), and the relevant travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, and it therefore could not be said that the enacted law was an interpretative law \u2013 its meaning having been totally clear to the parliamentarians. That case-law had established that the benefits could be accumulated both on the basis of the literal meaning of the applicable norms, which were considered to be unequivocal, and on the basis of the rationale behind the two benefits, which had a different function and operated at different levels. Indeed, the applicant companies noted that on the one hand concessions were an instrument adopted by the legislator in lieu of a direct grant of State aid to all firms and on the other hand exemptions were direct benefits aimed at supporting employers in the agricultural sector who operated in zones and territories with particular disadvantages. They noted that the Court of Cassation had explicitly held that the two benefits were not incompatible and that they had been provided for by different laws and had different aims (see paragraph 53 and 54 above). In that light, according to the applicant companies, it could not have been considered an interpretative law and it had been referred to as such at the domestic level only to get away with a retroactive application of the law to accommodate the INPS, which had opted not to follow the evident meaning of the then applicable norms.",

This was even more relevant when a dispute arose between a private party and the public administration. Ergo, even interpretative laws could not be used as an instrument by the legislator to favour the public administration, that is, itself.

In the present case the legislator had introduced the \u201cinterpretative\u201d law fifteen years after the enactment of the original law, during which time the Parliament had never raised any questions or doubts about the law. Moreover, the law had been introduced after at least (referring only to cases brought by the lawyers in the present case) 140 judgments (forty-three of which had become final, the INPS having failed to appeal) finding against the public entity, including two Court of Cassation judgments (see paragraphs 53 and 54 above), none of which had identified any \u201ctechnical defects\u201d in the formulation of the original law and none of which had referred to the even remote possibility of giving the self-evident law another interpretation. More importantly, the intention to do so had become apparent after the applicant companies had already obtained two judgments in their favour, at first-instance and on appeal. Furthermore, one could not ignore the difference between the attitude and manifest will of the United Kingdom Government and Parliament over the years and that of the Government in the present case. One also had to note the relationship between the Government and the INPS, an integral part of the State\u2019s administration. Thus, it was reasonable to consider (even on the basis of the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires and other statements made in certain domestic judgments) that the INPS, having been unsuccessful in hundreds of proceedings, had itself solicited the executive to act in order to nullify the pronouncements against it, rendering devoid of any meaning the distinction between executive and judiciary, but enabling the improvement of its financial situation. Lastly, the Attorney General\u2019s attitude towards the applicant companies\u2019 case (see paragraph 68 below) also distinguished it from National & Provincial Building Society (cited above).",

The Court highlights that financial considerations cannot by themselves warrant the legislature substituting itself for the courts in order to settle disputes. While it is true that at a later stage of the observations, in response to further questions by the Court, the Government made reference to compatibility with EU legislation and infringement proceedings in their regard, they failed to give any detail whatsoever on that matter. In the absence of concrete information in that respect such an argument cannot but be considered as an unsubstantiated allegation. Moreover, the fact that it was brought up at such a late stage of the proceedings indicates that the Government did not consider it to be of any major relevance. Thus, while the aim of the law may have been legitimate, and worthy of intervention to regulate the future provision of the said benefits, the Court is unable to identify in the circumstances of the present case any compelling generalinterest reason capable of outweighing the dangers inherent in the use of retrospective legislation which had the effect of influencing the judicial determination of a pending dispute to which the State was a party.",

France, nos. 42219/98 and 54563/00, \u00a7\u00a7 69 and 71, 27 May 2004). The Court cannot but observe that the applicant companies did not bring proceedings against the INPS immediately in 1988. Indeed, three of the four applicant companies awaited the outcome of the proceedings undertaken by Floramiata Spa. Only one of the applicant companies, namely S.A.P. Pietrafitta S.r.l, lodged its administrative application and subsequent judicial proceedings before the Court of Cassation judgment in Floramiata Spa had been issued (see paragraphs 31 and 33); however, it did so more than a decade after the enactment of the original law. Undeniably, such a wait had some bearing on the Court\u2019s findings in the case of National & Provincial Building Society (cited above \u00a7 109). Nevertheless, twenty years after that judgment, the Court must take other factors into account. Bearing in mind that justice systems in many Council of Europe member States, including, if not particularly, Italy, are overburdened, the Court considers that waiting for the determination of a principal judgment on the matter could only benefit the interests of judicial economy. Moreover, one cannot lose sight of the fact that by waiting for the outcome of that judgment, the applicant companies were on the one hand protecting themselves from the risk of incurring unnecessary costs and expenses, but, on the other hand, forfeiting parts of the sums that they could have recovered, since claims regarding past years would have become time-barred.",

Indeed, the legislator had not manifested such an intention when the Court of Cassation delivered a final judgment for the first time on the matter in the case of Floramiata Spa. Neither did Parliament manifest such an intention at any point in the three years that followed the first final judgment on the matter, years during which other companies were successful in their proceedings. Moreover, if, as proclaimed by the Government and the Court of Cassation, there was more than one possible interpretation of the original laws, it would have been entirely reasonable for the applicant companies to believe that the interpretation most favourable to them, as continually upheld by the domestic courts, was in fact the legislator\u2019s intention and that, therefore, there be no reason to expect a reaction by the authorities trying to amend the state of affairs.",

The desire to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, including the second paragraph: there must therefore be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aims pursued (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 98, and National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society, cited above, \u00a7 80). Consequently, \u201cthe financial liability arising out of the raising of tax or contributions may adversely affect the guarantee secured under this provision if it places an excessive burden on the person or the entity concerned or fundamentally interferes with his or its financial position\u201d (see Ferretti v.

Thus, it is firstly for the national authorities to decide on the type of tax or contributions they wish to levy.

If that had indeed been the complaint, the Court would have had to examine whether there was some sort of legitimate expectation that the legal regime established in 1988 would remain in place for an indefinite period of time. We find it difficult to accept that such an expectation would exist, thus making it impossible, or at least very difficult, for the legislature to ever change the law ex nunc.",

Or rather, the majority has overlooked the crux of the complaint actually made. We read in the applicant companies\u2019 submissions that they in fact presented for the Court\u2019s examination one single complaint, which relates to the retrospective effect of the \u201cauthentic interpretation\u201d given by Law No. 326 of 24 November 2003 to Law No. 67 of 11 March 1988. It does not appear to us that they raised two substantially different complaints. On the contrary, they complained that, solely by the fact of enacting the \u201cinterpretative law\u201d, the legislature simultaneously violated both Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1: it violated Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 in that the new law interfered with the judicial determination of pending disputes, and it violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in that the new law abolished claims in respect of which the applicants had a legitimate expectation that they would be upheld by the courts. However, when the majority examined the complaint under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1, it detached it from the Article 6 \u00a7 1 complaint and barely mentioned the fact that the law in question had a retrospective effect (see paragraph 103).",

The present judgment does not enter into detail with respect to the nature of these civil rights. However, it is clear that the applicants, in claiming the return of certain sums paid by them to the Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS), invoked civil rights of a proprietary nature. By declaring the applicants\u2019 claims well-founded, the domestic courts turned them into claims that constituted \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The partial finding of a violation of the Convention, namely one of Article 6 \u00a7 1 but not of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01, is internally inconsistent, as it tends to create the wrong impression that the finding of a violation of the right to a fair trial is in itself sufficient.

Italy (nos. 46286/09, 52851/08, 53727/08, 54486/08 and 56001/08, 31 May 2011) and continued with Arras and Others v. Italy (no. 17972/07, 14 February 2012). In these cases, the Court concluded that the retrospective reduction of social security or welfare benefits constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1, but not of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In two more recent cases the Court has had to deal, as in the present case, with interpretative laws: M.C. and Others v. Italy (no.\u00a05376/11, 3 September 2013) and Stefanetti and Others v. Italy (nos.\u00a021838/10, 21849/10, 21852/10, 21822/10, 21860/10, 21863/10, 21869/10, and 21870/10, 15\u00a0April 2014, not yet final). In these cases, the Court found that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been violated, but that conclusion was not decisively based on the retrospective effect of the \u201cinterpretative\u201d law. In that sense, these cases follow the Maggio-Arras line of reasoning. However, while in M.C. and Stefanetti the Court still found a violation not only of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, but also of Article 1 of Protocol No.1, in the present case the majority concludes that there has been a violation only of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1, not of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.

In that case the Court found, as in the present case, that a legislative act which interfered in pending disputes constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (\u00a7\u00a7 58-66). It then went on to analyse the act as an interference with the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, namely as a deprivation of their possessions (\u00a7 75). It found that, while the interference was (obviously) \u201cprovided by law\u201d (\u00a7 76), it was doubtful whether the sole financial interest of the State could constitute a \u201cpublic interest\u201d sufficient to justify a retrospective interference by the legislature (\u00a7\u00a7 80-81). Leaving that question open, it considered that the legislative interference had in any event made it decisively impossible for the applicants to have their claims upheld (\u00a7 83), thus obliging them to bear an individual and excessive burden and upsetting the balance between the general interest and the rights of the applicants (\u00a7 84). The Court concluded that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been violated.",

Once the Court has found that there was no justification for the legislative interference in pending proceedings \u2013 in particular in proceedings to which the applicants were parties \u2013 because of the absence of \u201cany compelling general interest reasons\u201d (see paragraph 87), it is hard to see how, in the present case, there could be public interest reasons that would justify a retrospective interference with the applicants\u2019 right to protection of their possessions. Again, the question whether the legislature could abolish the benefit created by Legislative Decree No. 536/87 with prospective effect, would, in our opinion, be a different matter.",

We note that according to the applicants \u201cin Italy it [has become] common practice to introduce \u2018interpretative\u2019 provisions in matters involving financial interests to secure higher income (or lower expenditure) for the public administration\u201d (see paragraph 63). This statement has not been contradicted by the Government. Having regard to similar cases that the Court has dealt with in the recent past and to certain cases that are still pending before it, we tend to agree with the applicants that the Italian legislature is regularly tempted to intervene in pending proceedings when it appears that the outcome of such proceedings may have a significant impact on the State\u2019s budget. In the present case, the so-called interpretative act was adopted almost sixteen years after the original act. We find this practice particularly disturbing, and regret that the majority has not condemned it inter alia from the perspective of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

The applicants\u2019 claims were upheld at first instance and on appeal. Their claims were based on a legislative provision that left no discretion to the public authorities. The only question was whether the reduction of the contributions to be paid under Legislative Decree No. 536/87 could be combined with the exemptions granted by Law No. 67/88, and, as the Court notes (see paragraph 78), that question had consistently been answered by the Italian courts in a way that was favourable to companies such as the applicant companies. In these circumstances we agree with the applicants that, had Law No. 326/03 not been enacted, they \u201c[would have had] not only [...] a legitimate expectation to obtain their claims, they [would have] been almost certain of it\u201d (see paragraph 91). It was only on account of the enactment of the latter law that the judgments rendered in their favour were quashed by the Court of Cassation and their claims unexpectedly dismissed. We consider that in these circumstances the just satisfaction to be awarded to each applicant company in respect of pecuniary damage should in principle amount to the sum claimed by it from the Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS) (see paragraph 109) and awarded in full by the court of appeal (respectively EUR 89,729 for Azienda Agricola Silverfunghi, EUR 213,776 for Scarpellini, EUR 108,770 for S.A.P. Pietrafitta, and EUR 84,375 for Floricultura Zanchi Di Zanchi Fratelli). However, where applicable the sum received by the applicant company from the INPS by execution of the firstinstance judgment and not yet returned by that applicant company following the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment should be deducted from this amount. Finally, to the amount thus calculated should be added the statutory interest applicable under domestic law.",

This uncertainty has resulted in us voting in different ways, which basically reflect two competing patterns of voting in this Court on just compensation (Article 41 of the Convention): Paul Lemmens voted in favour of point 4 and against point 5 (because the sums indicated in point 4 are seen as due to be paid to the applicants in any event, irrespective of the fact that they are insufficient), while Egidijus K\u016bris voted against both points 4 and 5 (because the sums indicated in point 4 are insufficient).
