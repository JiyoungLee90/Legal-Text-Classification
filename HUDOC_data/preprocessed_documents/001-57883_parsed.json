In its judgment of 15 February 1989 the  emphasised the need to distinguish between the indictment, which was the responsibility of the public prosecutor\u2019s office, and the despacho de pron\u00fancia. The latter was designed solely to verify the probability of guilt in order to avoid a trial where there was no prima facie evidence. It was thus a decision on the viability of the indictment and did not entail any prejudice on the part of the judge when the merits were being considered. It consequently served as a filter and a safeguard. Even if his legal classification of the facts was different, a judge did not act as a prosecutor. In the instant case Mr Salvado could not be accused of partiality merely because he had issued the despacho de pron\u00fancia. It would have been different if in his decision he had gone beyond the scope of the prosecution\u2019s charges and had made substantial alterations to them. In that case, which was not the one before it, the distinction between the indictment and the despacho de pron\u00fancia would have been lost as the judge would have encroached on the prerogatives of the public prosecutor.",

Under the Portuguese law applicable at the time, the judge in charge of the case, when issuing the despacho, was determining whether the file, including the prosecution\u2019s charges, amounted to a prima facie case such as to justify making an individual go through the ordeal of a trial. The issues which the judge has to settle when taking this decision are consequently not the same as those which are decisive for his final judgment. This may be illustrated by the fact that on 20 May 1987 the Criminal Court division which Mr Salvado presided over acquitted sixteen of the co-accused included in the despacho. Besides, if Mr Saraiva de Carvalho had had any misgivings about the consequences of the order, he could have been expected to appeal against it under Article 371 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 26 above).",

In producing the despacho, Mr Salvado was acting in his capacity as a judge of the Fourth Division; he took no steps in the investigation or in the prosecution. His detailed knowledge of the case did not mean that he was prejudiced in a way that prevented him from being impartial when the case came to trial.
