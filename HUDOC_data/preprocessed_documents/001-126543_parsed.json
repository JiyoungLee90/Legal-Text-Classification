The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted in evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair. In particular, \u201cas a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses\u201d; that provision \u201cdoes not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused\u2019s behalf: its essential aim, as is indicated by the words \u2018under the same conditions\u2019, is a full \u2018equality of arms\u2019 in the matter\u201d (see\u00a0Perna v.

Even though it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to call a witness, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see ibid, \u00a7 179).",

According to the prosecution, on 10 and 11 May 2007 the applicant loaded the drugs, which were already packed, together with textile merchandise, into the truck (see paragraph 13 above). The applicant admitted that he had been present in the car park in Turkey when the goods were loaded. However, he denied that he had loaded any goods himself or observed the loading. In this connection, he stated that S.B. and T.S. had loaded the goods (see paragraph 7 above). His defence position was accordingly aimed at proving that he had not loaded the drugs into the truck and that he had been unaware of their presence (see paragraph 16 above).",

At the second hearing, held on 13\u00a0July 2007, the applicant requested that the trial court obtain the written statements of S.B. and T.S. given on 16 May 2007. It is evident from the records of their questioning that both S.B. and T.S. witnessed the loading of the goods into the applicant\u2019s truck in the car park in Turkey. S.B. left the scene at noon on 10 May 2007, but T.S. remained until the loading was completed on 11 May 2007. Neither of them stated that the applicant had loaded any goods into the truck. On the contrary, they both stated that workers from the company S.T., which was apparently the dispatcher of the goods, had loaded the goods into the truck. T.S. was even more specific: he stated that S., who was the co-owner of the company S.T., had personally delivered the goods in which the drugs were found. Moreover, they both confirmed that S. had personally affixed a label to the goods stored in the containers where the drugs were subsequently found stating that they were T-shirts (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). It has not been claimed that the applicant was in possession of those statements at that time. The trial court refused to admit them in evidence on the ground that there was already sufficient evidence to establish the facts. It appears that the applicant did not make an explicit request for the trial court to examine S.B. and T.S. However, in the Court\u2019s view, that did not prevent the trial court from calling these witnesses if it considered their evidence relevant for the establishment of the truth. The Court observes in this context that pursuant to sections 308 and 340 of the Criminal Proceedings Act the trial court was required to extend the taking of evidence proprio motu to all relevant facts and means of proof, including those which had not been adduced, with a view to establishing the truth and the actual circumstances of the case (see\u00a0paragraphs 26 and 27 above).",

The operative provisions stated that he had loaded and hidden the drugs in the central cargo area of the truck and had transported them from Turkey to the respondent State (see paragraph 16 above). His conviction was based on G.Z.\u2019s testimony, which stated that the applicant had been present in the car park at the critical time; on the fact that he had used border-crossing points where customs control had been less strict; and the fact that the drugs had been hidden in a part of the truck that was difficult to access. Consequently, there was no direct evidence that the applicant had loaded and hidden the drugs in the truck. The trial court did not explain how the facts described above corroborated the actions imputed to the applicant. Even G.Z., who had left the car park earlier, stated that the goods had been loaded by S.B. and T.S., and that the latter had continued loading the goods after G.Z. had left the car park (see paragraph 8 above).",

The trial court relied on G.Z.\u2019s testimony in concluding that S.B. had not been present when drugs were loaded into the truck (see paragraph 17 above). The Court notes, however, that no explanation was given as regards the evidence of T.S., who was responsible for the loading and was present at the critical place up to the time when the applicant left the car park with the truck (see paragraph 11 above).",
