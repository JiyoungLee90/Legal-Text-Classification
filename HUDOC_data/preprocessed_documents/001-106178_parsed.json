The judgment reiterated the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that the right to respect for freedom of expression was subject to limits derived from labour relations, since the contract of employment created a series of rights and reciprocal obligations that circumscribed the exercise of the right to respect for freedom of expression. For that reason, certain manifestations of this right that might be legitimate in other contexts were not legitimate in the context of labour relations, even though the requirement to act in good faith did not always imply a duty of loyalty to the point of subjecting the worker to the employer\u2019s interests.",

For the court, the publication of the offending drawing and articles had clearly been harmful to the dignity of the persons concerned and had overstepped the limits of admissible criticism, as the exercise of freedom of expression did not justify the use of insulting, offensive or vexatious expressions that went beyond the legitimate exercise of the right to criticise and clearly impugned the respectability of the persons concerned.

Secondly, as to the [alleged] interference with trade-union freedom guaranteed by Article 28 of the Constitution (this complaint incorporating the appellants\u2019 complaint under Article 14 of the Constitution in so far as they alleged discrimination on trade-union grounds), this is inadmissible as [the appellants] have not provided sufficient evidence to show that the company\u2019s action was intended to restrict, hamper or prevent the exercise of their right to freedom of association, on account of their union membership or activities in a trade union. In line with what this court has repeatedly said, such evidence does not consist of a mere allegation of a constitutional violation but must be sufficient for it to be inferred that the violation could have been constituted ... which is not the case here, since the circumstances alleged do not give rise to any suspicion as to the potential violation in question. In their allegations, the appellants have simply expressed their disagreement with the decisions rendered by the courts below, which found in decisions giving reasons and not being manifestly unreasonable that they had committed the acts of which the company had accused them in their letters of dismissal.",

As the Court held recently in judgment no. 39/2005 of 28 February (legal ground 4), reiterating its case-law, although the Constitution does not prohibit the use of hurtful, embarrassing or vituperative expressions in every circumstance, the constitutional protection afforded by Article 20 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Constitution does not, however, extend to absolutely vexatious expressions which, taking into account the actual circumstances of the case and regardless of their veracity or lack of veracity, are offensive or defamatory and are not pertinent for the purpose of conveying the opinions or information in question. The application of that jurisprudence to the present case leads the Court to the conclusion that the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression has not been infringed, since they used that right in an excessive manner by means of value judgments expressed through cartoons and comments that were offensive and humiliating for the persons concerned and impugned their honour and reputation. [Those cartoons and comments] were not necessary for others to form an opinion about the facts of which the appellants wished to complain, and were therefore gratuitous and not necessary for the exercise of freedom of expression in a trade-union context.\u201d",

In the present case, the interference had been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others. In order to ascertain whether that interference had been necessary in a democratic society, the Court had to refer to the particular context of the dispute, in which proceedings had been brought by the applicants against their employer in the employment courts. While taking the view that if a trade union was unable to express its ideas freely it would become meaningless and pointless, the Chamber noted in the present case that the Spanish courts had balanced the conflicting interests, in the light of domestic law, and had concluded that the applicants had transgressed the permissible limits of the right to criticise. The decisions given by the domestic courts could not therefore be regarded as unreasonable or arbitrary. Accordingly, the Chamber found that there had been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention. In addition, it took the view that no separate question arose under Article 11 of the Convention.",

The applicants alleged that the company P.\u2019s head of human resources had tried to buy the services of certain trade-union members in order to persuade other delivery men to refrain from asserting their rights. The human resources manager had allegedly offered them cash in return for those services, and the association of non-salaried delivery men, to which witnesses A. and B. belonged, had thus become the employer\u2019s accomplice.

The courts referred to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression in the context of labour relations and noted that this right was not unlimited, on account of the specific features of labour relations that had to be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the High Court of Justice of Catalonia found that the dismissal of two other salaried delivery men had been in breach of Article 54 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (c) of the Labour Regulations, because they had been on sick leave at the time of the publication and distribution of the newsletter in question.

A trade union that does not have the possibility of expressing its ideas freely in this connection would indeed be deprived of an essential means of action. Consequently, for the purpose of guaranteeing the meaningful and effective nature of trade-union rights, the national authorities must ensure that disproportionate penalties do not dissuade trade-union representatives from seeking to express and defend their members\u2019 interests. Trade-union expression may take the form of news sheets, pamphlets, publications and other documents of the trade union whose distribution by workers\u2019 representatives acting on behalf of a trade union must therefore be authorised by the management, as stated by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization in its Recommendation No. 143 of 23 June 1971 (see paragraph 21 above).",

The responsibility of the authorities would nevertheless be engaged if the facts complained of stemmed from a failure on their part to secure to the applicants the enjoyment of the right enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Gustafsson, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

The cartoon and articles were thus published in the newsletter of the trade-union workplace branch to which the applicants belonged, in the context of a dispute between the applicants and the company P. Nevertheless, they did contain criticism and accusations, not directly against the company but against the two non-salaried delivery men and the human resources manager. The Court reiterates in this connection that the extent of acceptable criticism is narrower as regards private individuals than as regards politicians or civil servants acting in the exercise of their duties (contrast Lingens v. Austria, 8\u00a0July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 103, and Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR 2002II).",

The primary role of publications of this type \u201cshould be to deal with matters essentially relating to the defence and furtherance of the interests of the unions\u2019 members in particular and with labour questions in general\u201d (see paragraph 24 above, in particular point 170 of the International Labour Office Digest cited therein).

In the countries examined, the domestic legislation seeks to reconcile the employee\u2019s right to freedom of expression with the employer\u2019s rights and prerogatives, requiring in particular that a dismissal measure be proportionate to the conduct of the employee against whom it is taken (see paragraphs 27 and 30-31 above).

The somewhat artificial nature of this distinction, precisely in the context of labour relations, may give reason to fear that the present judgment constitutes a step backwards in relation to the Fuentes Bobo judgment, concerning the dismissal of a journalist on account of harsh criticism during a radio programme, where the Court found that there had been a violation of Article\u00a010 of the Convention in the context of an industrial dispute.",
