The investigation in case no. 22015 was instituted on 27 January 2003, twenty-two days after the authorities had become aware of Vakhit Dzhabrailov's abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. Further, it is not possible to assess whether a number of investigating steps had been delayed, in view of the Government's failure to provide the Court with relevant information (see paragraphs 30 and 41 above), but it is clear that a number of the most crucial investigating measures had not been taken at all. For instance, the investigators did not question the local military commander about those who could have obtained his permission to drive around past curfew; they did not question the servicemen who had been on duty at the ROVD on 3 January 2003; they failed to establish the identity of the owners of the tented GAZ vehicle used by the abductors, and they did not question the applicant's relatives who had been present during the abduction. Further, it does not appear that the investigators attempted to question the applicant's son Mr V.D. and the taxi drivers who had seen the abductors' vehicle driving on the premises of the ROVD shortly after the events (see paragraph 31 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.
