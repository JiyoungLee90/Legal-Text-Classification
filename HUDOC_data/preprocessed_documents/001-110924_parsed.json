(no. 64780/09, \u00a7\u00a7 49-65, 22\u00a0September\u00a02011) the Court concluded that there was a serious risk of the applicant being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention in the event of his removal to Algeria. In that case the Algerian authorities had convicted the applicant in absentia of having founded a terrorist group and had imposed a life sentence on him. The risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 resulted, in particular, from the continued practice of the DRS of gathering information from people suspected or convicted of terrorist activities using methods which had been denounced by a number of international reports. The Court further noted that there had been no significant developments as regards the situation in Algeria between the delivery of the Daoudi judgment on 3 December 2009 and February 2011.",

The Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was nevertheless justified on the ground that he represented a security risk cannot be accepted. The guarantee under Article 3 of the Convention is absolute and it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 138).",
