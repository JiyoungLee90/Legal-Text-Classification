It observes in this regard that in submitting their complaints in accordance with the procedures laid down in the 1976 and 1989 Acts, the applicants were seeking a ruling that they had been denied the opportunity to compete for and obtain work on the basis of their abilities and competitiveness alone and to be given security clearance for this purpose without regard to their religious beliefs or political opinions. Had it been established that the applicants were indeed the victims of unlawful discrimination, the County Court in the case of Tinnelly and the Fair Employment Tribunal in the case of the McElduffs were ultimately empowered under the 1976 and 1989 Acts to assess the extent of the applicants\u2019 loss and order financial reparation in their favour including for direct and indirect loss of profits. The fact that the contracts in issue were public procurement contracts or that the applicants\u2019 offers were never accepted cannot prevent that right from being considered a \u201ccivil right\u201d for the purposes of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1.",

In reaching that conclusion, Mr\u00a0Justice\u00a0McCollum heard the evidence of NIE officials and of the civil servant who had advised the Secretary of State that NIE\u2019s request for a section\u00a042 certificate had been substantiated.

The Government stressed that the national security concerns which may be pleaded in defence of an alleged act of sex discrimination were of a fundamentally different nature since, and unlike gender, the issues of religious belief and political opinion were intertwined with the intercommunal violence and the terrorist threat to national security, public safety and public order in Northern Ireland. The assessment of whether or not an act was done for one of the purposes set out in section\u00a042 of the relevant legislation necessitated the collection of sensitive security data which, by their nature, should not be disclosed to a party or scrutinised by a tribunal with a jurisdiction relating to the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion. Nor would it be appropriate to introduce a procedure modelled on the Canadian Immigration Act 1976 which had been averted to by the Court in its Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15\u00a0November 1996 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1866, \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 144).

The narrowness of the review of the grounds for issuing the certificate was compounded by the cumbersome and dissipated procedures which Tinnelly had to invoke in order to produce that limited result. The Commission agreed with the applicants\u2019 contention that alternative procedures could have been envisaged which would have allowed the Secretary of State\u2019s decision to be \nsubjected to independent judicial scrutiny and at the same time ensured protection for the imperatives of national security. In this respect, the Government had not provided any convincing reasons why a procedure such as that instituted pursuant to the Sex Discrimination (Amendment) Order 1988 could not be transposed to the type of issue at stake in the instant case.

For this reason, the Government\u2019s assertion that the access enjoyed by the applicants was as effective as could be in the circumstances cannot be sustained (see paragraph 67 above). Furthermore, the mechanisms which they rely on to illustrate that procedures exist for securing the control and accountability of the intelligence agencies involved in the making of negative-vetting decisions such as those taken against Tinnelly and the McElduffs (see paragraph\u00a067 above) would not have resulted in any independent judicial scrutiny of the facts grounding those decisions. Such mechanisms cannot be considered therefore to compensate for the severity of the limitations which the section\u00a042 certificates imposed on the applicants\u2019 right of access to a court and cannot be weighed in the balance when assessing the proportionality of those limitations for the purposes of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

It is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s claim that the adjustment of procedures under the fair employment legislation or the introduction of other special judicial procedures to accommodate both of these interests need in any way undermine the independence of the judiciary in Northern Ireland or impair public confidence in the administration of justice in the province (see paragraph\u00a068 above). The introduction of a procedure, regardless of the framework used, which would allow an adjudicator or tribunal fully satisfying the Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 requirements of independence and impartiality to examine in complete cognisance of all relevant evidence, documentary or other, the merits of the submissions of both sides, may indeed serve to enhance public confidence. The Court observes in addition that Mr\u00a0Justice\u00a0McCollum was unable under the present arrangements to dispel his own doubts about certain disturbing features of the Tinnelly case (see paragraph\u00a030 above) since he, like Tinnelly and the Fair Employment Agency, was precluded from having cognisance of all relevant material in the possession of NIE, the respondent in the proceedings instituted by Tinnelly under the 1976 Act.
