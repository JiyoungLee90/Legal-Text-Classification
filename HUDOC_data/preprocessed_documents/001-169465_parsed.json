The court, having examined certain witnesses, also considered that Mrs S. had indeed caused the claimants inconvenience and complicated their life, and that they had therefore decided to place her in a medical institution. The court thus concluded that the sentence stating \u201c...quite a few respectable people bring their ill relatives to the care home in an attempt to escape unnecessary troubles...\u201d could not be said to be untrue, whether it was the applicant\u2019s generalisation or a sentence relating to the claimants, as alleged by them. The court further found, with reference to relevant evidence adduced by the applicant, that the information concerning Mrs S.\u2019s living conditions in Lesnaya Dacha was also accurate. It also rejected as unfounded the claimants\u2019 argument that the disputed publication had been propagandistic and had aimed to influence voters\u2019 opinions; in this respect, it noted that the text of the article was socially oriented and contained general argument concerning the problems affecting ill and elderly people, with the specific example of the Lesnaya Dacha care home. The court also noted that the general statements of the care home\u2019s chief medical officer concerning a lack of mercy for next of kin had had no link to the claimants or other members of the S. family.",

The Government submitted that, after a full examination of the circumstances of the case, the national courts had established the absence of any factual basis for the applicant\u2019s relevant statements. In particular, the appellate court had established that the S. family had placed Mrs S. in the institution for the elderly with a view to ensuring her necessary medical treatment and care, rather than in an attempt to \u201cescape troubles\u201d. The court had furthermore established that the institution referred to in the article had had a very good reputation, and that was why the S. family had chosen it for Mrs S.; moreover, they had regularly come to see her, as had been confirmed by witnesses.

France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-VI; Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v.

For Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life\u201d (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a039954/08, \u00a7 83, 7\u00a0February 2012). The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person in question was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant, or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2013, and the authorities cited therein).",

It notes, however, that he was never a party to the defamation proceedings in question. Therefore, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that Mr S. was \u201cdiscredited in the eyes of his voters\u201d (see paragraph 34 above), as that question was never assessed by the domestic courts. The Court is furthermore not convinced that the same objective link can be found between the extracts and the claimants in the defamation proceedings, Mr S.\u2019s father, brother and sister. As was stressed by the Government, they were not \u201cpeople in authority\u201d; moreover, the text in question only mentioned \u201cDeputy S.\u201d and no other member of the S.\u00a0family. The statements can therefore hardly be regarded as directly relevant to the claimants, or detrimental to their reputation. The Court further does not consider that the regional court\u2019s mere reference to the statements of two witnesses, who had perceived the impugned extracts to relate to the claimants (see paragraph 19 above), is sufficient for establishing any such link, as the identity of those two witnesses was not clarified, nor the basis for that perception.",

The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. Admittedly, where allegations are made about the conduct of a third party, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertions of fact and value judgments. Nevertheless, even a value judgment may be excessive if it has no factual basis to support it (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7\u00a7 98-99, ECHR 2004XI). The Court has on many occasions pinpointed the structural deficiency of the Russian law on defamation, as interpreted and applied at the relevant time, which made no distinction between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to \u201cinformation\u201d (\u201csvedeniya\u201d), and proceeded on the assumption that any such \u201cinformation\u201d was susceptible to proof in civil proceedings (see Grinberg v.

In particular, the disputed extracts described the placement as \u201can attempt to escape unnecessary trouble\u201d and \u201ca lack of mercy\u201d, whereas the claimants argued that they had been driven by the need to ensure proper medical assistance and care for their relative (see paragraph 20 above). It is obvious that the abovementioned expressions were value judgments; they represented the applicant\u2019s interpretation of the placement of the claimants\u2019 relative in the care home for the elderly, were quotes of the care home\u2019s chief medical officer, and were concerned with moral criticism of that placement. In relation to such criticism, the Court notes that, although journalists must be afforded some degree of exaggeration or even provocation, they nevertheless have \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, and should act in good faith and in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, \u00a7 61, 14 February 2008). Gratuitous accusations of morally reprehensible behaviour may arguably be taken as going beyond the limits of responsible journalism. In particular, in the context of the issue raised by the applicant in her article, that is, in her submission, the lack of specialist care facilities for elderly people in the region (see paragraph 30 above), the Court fails to see why it was relevant to give information \u2013 disclosing the full name and containing suggestions of morally reprehensible behaviour \u2013 on the last days of a lady who had died three years earlier (see paragraph 35 above), and who had been the mother of a person standing as a candidate for election to the national Parliament at that time.",

The level of impact was thus quite remote\u201d. This is a completely different approach compared with the arguments set out in the present judgment. It is more concrete and closer to the factual circumstances.
