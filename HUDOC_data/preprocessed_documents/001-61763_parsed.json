(the court held that Mrs T.\u2019s and Mr T.\u2019s testimony was not credible because their relations with the applicant had been strained) the court found that the officers had led the applicant out of lieutenant R.\u2019s office and into the corridor. There, some verbal exchange had taken place between the applicant and chief-sergeant D., while sergeant U. had stepped aside. The applicant had then slapped chief-sergeant D. on the face, had tried to kick him and had called him a \u201cbrat\u201d and a \u201csniveler\u201d. The court noted that the applicant presented a completely different version of the facts, namely that it was her who had been subjected to violence. However, it went on to hold that Dr S., the surgeon who examined the applicant on the day of the incident, had not found blood on the applicant but only a dull trauma on her right scapula. That could have been occasioned by a blow by or onto a blunt object. Thus, it was possible that the applicant had inflicted the injury on herself. Therefore her allegations of savage beating, kicks, pushing, falling down etc. did not correspond to the testimony of the doctors who had examined her. The fact that there had been no visible traces of beating on the applicant was also established through the testimony of G.A., the boy who had helped her move out of the police station, and of Mr Y., the driver who had taken her to the hospital.",

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

The medical doctors who later examined the applicant apparently considered that the injuries could indeed have been caused in such a manner (see paragraph 16 above). The police officers, together with the applicant, were the only eye-witnesses of the incident and did not state that the applicant had fallen down and had hit herself, nor that she had sustained her injuries while being forced into the detention room; they merely maintained that they had pushed her into the room after she had allegedly slapped one of them and that after that they had left her alone there. They also denied having hit her. However, their statements appear inconsistent with the injuries later found on the applicant\u2019s body and head. They also appear inconsistent with the unequivocally established facts that the applicant was squatting on the floor of the room when she was later found by lieutenant R. (see paragraph 14 above) and that she had difficulty walking after she left the police station a little after noon (see paragraph 15 above). The District Court\u2019s finding that the applicant has not been subjected to violence appears questionable: the court conceded that the applicant\u2019s right scapula had been injured, but quite readily accepted that this was a self-inflicted injury, without stating any basis for such a conclusion, without delving more into her allegations, and without testing different versions about to the actual course of the events (see, for a decision to the contrary, Klaas v.
