The order contained in the Ministry\u2019s decision (paragraph 7 above) concerned the time-limit within which the applicant had been requested to leave voluntarily the territory of the respondent State. They urged the Court to take into account the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 7 to the Convention (paragraph 17 above). According to the Government, \u201cexpulsion was an autonomous concept that concerned measures or actions aimed at forcible removal of a person from the territory of one State to the territory of another State.\u201d They averred that there was no risk that the applicant would be expelled in the future. In this connection, they stated that there was no example of the forcible removal of a person who had been residing in the respondent State in relation to the Kosovo crisis of 1999.",

The decision also contained an explicit order compelling the applicant to leave the respondent State within the specified time-limit (see paragraph 7 above). The Court notes that that order was not revoked or otherwise invalidated. Furthermore, there was no decision by any domestic authority by which the implementation of that order was suspended or the applicant granted leave to stay in the respondent State (see, conversely Saeed v. Denmark (dec.), no. 53/12, \u00a7 7, 24\u00a0June 2014). Furthermore, as stated by the applicant and not contested by the Government, the enforcement of that order is not subject to any further formal requirements. Accordingly, the applicant risks expulsion at any time. The fact that the applicant was granted one-off permission to leave and return to the respondent State (see paragraph 13 above), as well as the fact that the order has not been enforced to date, are insufficient for the Court to conclude that the order compelling the applicant to leave the respondent State is no longer in force or that it cannot lead to her expulsion. Both the single permission to leave and the authorities\u2019 tolerance of the applicant\u2019s continued stay in the respondent State arose from decisions made in the exercise of their discretion and were not based on any statutory grounds. Similar considerations apply to the assertion that no one residing in the respondent State on the same grounds as the applicant had been forcibly removed (see paragraph 19 above).",

It is not sufficient that the applicant may have unsuccessfully exercised another remedy which could have overturned the impugned measure on other grounds not connected with the complaint of a violation of a Convention right.

However, it was not presented with any argument or example of domestic practice that such a request would have led to a review of the procedure followed by the Ministry in making the risk assessment and in issuing the order compelling the applicant to leave the respondent State. Indeed, there is nothing to suggest that a request for temporary residence was capable of remedying directly the applicant\u2019s grievances before the Court, namely that she had not been provided with the minimum procedural safeguards to protect her interests in the impugned proceedings. Furthermore, the Court has not been presented with any evidence that a request for temporary residence would be granted to an alien who was deemed to represent a risk to national security, as was the applicant. Assuming that the applicant might have been able to regularise her stay in the respondent State on the basis of such a request, it is to be noted that such a decision would have rested on family grounds that were not connected with her complaints before the Court.

However, even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that deportation measures affecting fundamental human rights be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent authority or a court competent to effectively scrutinise the reasons for them and review the relevant evidence, if need be with appropriate procedural limitations on the use of classified information. The individual must be able to challenge the executive\u2019s assertion that national security is at stake. While the executive\u2019s assessment of what poses a threat to national security will naturally be of significant weight, the independent authority or court must be able to react in cases where the invocation of this concept has no reasonable basis in the facts or reveals an interpretation of \u201cnational security\u201d that is unlawful or contrary to common sense and arbitrary (see C.G. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 40).",

The same idea is applicable mutatis mutandis to the guarantees contained in Article 1. In other words, the procedural guarantees of Article 1 have a preventive character: to provide for an accessible and foreseeable legal basis for expulsion and allow the alien concerned to submit reasons against his expulsion, to have his case reviewed and to be represented for these purposes before the competent authority.

In the present case, by contrast, the applicant has not (yet) been expelled. However, the enforcement of the order compelling the applicant to leave the respondent State is not subject to any formal requirements. Accordingly, the applicant risks expulsion at any time (paragraph 22 of the judgment). This is not only pertinent for purposes of the applicability of Article 1. It is also a necessary and sufficient condition for finding a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7, if the guarantees provided therein have not been respected. As stated above, subject to the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2, Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 is geared to the phase preceding expulsion. If one accepts the proposition that the object and purpose of this provision is to introduce a series of guarantees of a preventive character, tending to protect the individual from arbitrary expulsion (see above, paragraph 4), then it seems logical to also accept that the issuance of an order to leave the country, adopted without those guarantees having been respected and enforceable at any time, amounts to a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a07.",

Article 3 of the Convention is essentially about substance, i.e. the substantive evaluation of the risk that the applicant would face ill-treatment if expelled to another country. Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 7 mainly concerns the phase preceding expulsion. Article 3 of the Convention is geared to the future, i.e. to the risk faced after an eventual expulsion. This is precisely the reason why the Court has accepted the principle of examining the risk faced by the applicant, under Article 3 (and also under Article 2 of the Convention), by taking into account elements that are subsequent to the domestic decisions (see for instance F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no. 43611/11, 23 March 2016, esp. \u00a7 157). In such circumstances it is perfectly understandable and indeed necessary to find only a conditional \u2013 a \u201cwould-be\u201d \u2013 violation. It would be unthinkable to hold that the international responsibility of a State under the Convention is engaged for not having evaluated elements that were not even submitted to the national authorities. More generally, the whole ratio of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 differs from that of other provisions of the Convention applied in an expulsion context and especially Article 3. It is, therefore, not appropriate, in my view, to draw a parallel between those provisions and to necessarily apply the same solutions.",
