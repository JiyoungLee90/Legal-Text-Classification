It clarified, nevertheless, that the term \u201cadministration of justice\u201d did not cover judicial proceedings in their entirety, but only extended to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case. Other judicial acts \u2013 mainly of a procedural nature \u2013 fell outside the scope of the notion \u201cadministration of justice\u201d. State liability for damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act, such as a breach of the \u201creasonable length\u201d requirement of court proceedings, could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings. The Constitutional Court emphasised, moreover, that the constitutional right to compensation by the State for damage should not be tied in with the personal fault of a judge. An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The Constitutional Court held that Parliament should legislate on the grounds and procedure for compensation by the State for damage caused by the unlawful acts or failure to act of a court or judge and determine territorial and subject-matter jurisdiction over such claims.",
