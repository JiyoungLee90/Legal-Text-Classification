[GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-55, 27\u00a0November 2008). It notes that the present case is similar to the Salduz case since at the time when the applicant was taken into police custody, namely in May 2002, the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was restricted pursuant to Section 31 of Law no. 3842, as he was accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. In this connection, the Court observes that although the applicant did not have access to a lawyer during his police custody, he repeatedly denied the charges against him during his interrogation by the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively. Consequently, he did not make any self-incriminating statements. However, the Court finds it important to recall once again that the investigation stage is of crucial importance in criminal proceedings as the evidence obtained at this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered (see, Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 54, and Dayanan v. , no. 7377/03, \u00a7 32, 13 October 2009). In this regard, the Court observes that when the applicant was in police custody, he took part in an identification parade and was identified by the intervening parties as the person who had taken part in the respective armed robberies which had occurred in 1993. The Court further notes that in convicting the applicant the trial court relied heavily on the result of this identification parade. Thus, the applicant was undoubtedly affected by the restrictions on his access to a lawyer during the preliminary investigation. Neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred during the applicant\u2019s custody period.",
