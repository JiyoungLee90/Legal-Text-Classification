The latter had held an interview with the applicant about his personal situation and ties to Denmark and Syria, which included information about schooling, language skills, work, family etc. Before the Immigration Service the applicant stated that he speaks and understands Arabic. He does not read or write Arabic. He also stated that he speaks, reads and writes Danish well. However, an interpreter was used in connection with the interview regarding his personal circumstances which was held on 26\u00a0April\u00a02005. The Immigration Board also considered the applicant\u2019s submission that he feared being returned to Syria because he had not sorted out the issue of compulsory military service and because he feared being punished by the Syrian authorities if they found out that he had been sentenced for drugs offences in Denmark. The Immigration Board referred to a consultation response of 9\u00a0February\u00a02004 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which included an expert opinion of 6\u00a0January\u00a02004 obtained by a named professor and former dean at the Faculty of Law of Damascus University, concerning the principle of ne bis in idem set out in Article 27 of the Syrian Penal Code. That provision stated that no Syrian or foreigner will be charged in Syria with an offence on Syrian territory, if he has been convicted and has served his sentence abroad or if the punishment has lapsed owing to the limitation legislation of the relevant country or if he has been pardoned. According to Article 28 of the Syrian Penal Code, a judgment delivered abroad did not prevent prosecution for an offence falling under Article 19, which applied to any Syrian or foreign national who breached the law or committed a serious offence outside Syrian territory harming national security or who forged Government stamps or forged or counterfeited Syrian or foreign bank notes or debt instruments, which were lawful means of payment or in general circulation in Syria.",

The applicant was interviewed and anew he objected to the expulsion. He maintained, inter alia, that although originally he had stated that he was born in Syria, where he was also registered, in reality he was born in Lebanon. The applicant did not wish to return to Syria, as he did not wish to perform his military service there. He also feared being returned to Syria due to his father\u2019s political past there. Moreover, he was in conflict with a Syrian family, because he had had an affair with their daughter in 1999 and she had subsequently falsely accused him of rape. Finally, he was afraid of being sentenced again in Syria for the drugs crime he had committed in Denmark. He added that in December 2007 he had found a new girlfriend, who visited him in prison every week. The applicant said that he would agree to being sent to Germany, where he had an aunt.

It took into account that the applicant had maintained all along that he was born in Syria, that in the public register in Syria he was recorded as a Palestinian from Homs in Syria, and that he had relied on his fear of being called up for military service there. The fact that, during an interview on 25 May 2009, he had stated that he was born in Lebanon and produced a copy of a birth certificate, could not lead to another assessment. The Aliens Service did not find the applicant\u2019s story about the girl in Syria credible. It noted that he had not provided any information in this respect until the interview held on 25\u00a0May 2009, and found it unlikely that the girl\u2019s family would persecute him since allegedly he had ended the relationship in 1999. In addition it found that a related document produced by the applicant, allegedly issued by the Syrian authorities, was not authentic. It did not find credible either the applicant\u2019s allegation that he could not return to Syria because of his father\u2019s political activities, notably since the applicant could not give any details about those activities. Finally, the Aliens Service did not find that the fact that the applicant had not performed compulsory military service in Syria or that he had been convicted for a drugs offence in Denmark could bar his expulsion.

A return to face prosecution or enforcement of a sentence falls under Article 3 only if there are substantial grounds for believing that the implementation of such measures will entail a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. In the present case it followed from the background information concerning Syrian criminal law that the risk of double jeopardy only existed in relation to offences committed outside Syrian territory when it was a serious crime harming national security, or the perpetrator forged Government stamps or forged or counterfeited Syrian or foreign bank notes or debt instruments which were lawful means of payment or in general circulation in Syria. Moreover, the background information available at the time did not give any specific basis for assuming that upon arrival in Syria, the applicant would be at risk of arbitrary deprivation of liberty justifying asylum. They noted for example that the report of 20\u00a0April 2010 by Amnesty International, referred to by the applicant, did not discuss the situation of persons forcibly returned to Syria. It was a general status report to the United Nations Committee Against Torture on Syria\u2019s implementation of the United Nation\u2019s Convention Against Torture and dealt mainly with conditions in prisons, methods of torture and refoulement of third country nationals from Syria. Thus, the report could have given reason to suspect a risk of illtreatment of prisoners, but it did not substantiate that the applicant would be imprisoned upon his arrival in Syria.",

The latter stated that in Syrian criminal law the risk of double jeopardy only existed in relation to offences committed outside Syrian territory when the offence was a serious crime harming national security, or the perpetrator forged Government stamps or forged or counterfeited Syrian or foreign bank notes or debt instruments which were lawful means of payment or in general circulation in Syria. His statement did not contain any details in case of double punishment, but it did enumerate various types of offences which could give rise to double punishment.

Moreover, he feared being persecuted by a Syrian family, because he had had an affair with their daughter in 1999 and she had subsequently falsely accused him of rape.

In their decisions of 10 August 2009 and 2\u00a0December\u00a02009 the Aliens Service and the Refugee Appeals Board rejected these allegations. The Court observes that before these instances, the applicant was represented by a lawyer and he was given the opportunity to submit written observations and documents. His arguments were duly considered and the authorities\u2019 assessment in this regard must be considered adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources. In addition the Court notes that while in Denmark, the applicant was never summoned for military service in Syria. Thus, there were no indications that he would face arrest by the military police upon return on account of having failed to report (see paragraph 38). Moreover, as to his father\u2019s political past, the Court notes that apparently that did not prevent his father from returning to Syria in November 2010 in order to receive the applicant upon arrival (see paragraph 22).",

As emphasized by the High Court in its decision of 26\u00a0May 2010, the applicant\u2019s relationship with his third wife-to-be thus commenced after the expulsion order had become final by the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 25 August 2006. The applicant and his new wife therefore knew that their family life in Denmark would from the outset be precarious and they could not legitimately expect the applicant\u2019s deportation order to be revoked on the basis of a fait accompli due to their marriage or their having a child together (see, for example Udeh v. Switzerland, no. 12020/09, \u00a7 50, 16 April 2013 and Onur v. the United Kingdom, no. 27319/07, \u00a7 59, 17 February 2009. Nevertheless, even assuming that the applicant can rely on this relationship in the context of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s wife-to-be claimed that she could and would follow the applicant to Syria (as opposed to, for example, Amrollahi v. Denmark, cited above, \u00a7 40-41), but that for reasons unknown to the Court, she changed her mind after the District Court had refused to revoke the applicant\u2019s expulsion order on 29 March 2010.",
