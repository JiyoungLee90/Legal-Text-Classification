As regards Murat Bekta\u015f, the doctor had noted bullet entry wounds on his head and hands. The doctor had concluded that classic autopsies were required in order to establish the cause of death.

The prosecutor noted that officers Nurettin B\u00fclb\u00fcl, Haydar Erol, Ey\u00fcp Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya and Ali Erdurucan had broken down the door to Murat\u00a0Bekta\u015f's flat and entered there without issuing a warning.

This conclusion makes it unnecessary for the Court to establish whether the force used by the police officers was absolutely necessary and justified under Article 2 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The Court's examination of the first applicant's complaint will therefore be limited to ascertaining whether or not the national authorities afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for the violation. In this connection the Court notes that, although the police officers who killed Mr Bekta\u015f were found guilty of the offence of murder, they were sentenced to six months' imprisonment which, in any event, was suspended.",

According to the initial police report, fire was opened from Mr Arslan's flat on a number of occasions and subsequently there was crossfire between the police officers and the occupants of the flat (see paragraph 10 above). According, however, to the information given by two of the police officers from the Special Forces who took an active part in the operation, there was no crossfire and only one shot was fired from the room where Erdin\u00e7 Arslan and Mustafa K\u00f6pr\u00fc had been hiding (see paragraph 21 above).",
