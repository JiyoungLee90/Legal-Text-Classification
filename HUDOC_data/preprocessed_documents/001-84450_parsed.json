The decision described the circumstances of the attack of 6 August 2000 as they had been stated in the decision of 15 December 2001 on complete termination of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 77) and referred to the same documents as those relied on in that decision.

The Government disputed the applicants\u2019 argument that they had been unable to make use of that remedy, as they had not been recognised as victims of a crime, and stated that the said provision entitled any individual and not only participants in criminal proceedings to apply to a court with relevant complaints.

In this connection they relied on applications submitted to the Court by other individuals claiming to be victims of similar violations, documents of human rights NGOs and media reports. The applicants further contended that they had been excluded from the criminal proceedings as none of them had ever been recognised as a victim of a crime, and therefore they had no right under national law to challenge decisions of the investigating authorities. Nevertheless, they had actively attempted to participate in the investigation and repeatedly applied to law-enforcement bodies, including various prosecutors, requesting them to inform them of the investigative measures that had been taken and of any developments in the case as well as to grant the status of victim to the first two applicants, the mothers of the persons killed. The applicants thus argued that they had had recourse to the remedies usually available in domestic law, but that those remedies had proved futile in their case.",

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI, pp. 2275-76, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; Akdivar and Others\u00a0v.

A civil court is unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of fatal assaults, still less of attributing responsibility. Furthermore, a Contracting State\u2019s obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 13 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of fatal assaults might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under those Articles, an applicant would be required to pursue an action leading only to an award of damages (see Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 2\u00a0September 1998, Reports 1998VI, p.\u00a02431, \u00a7\u00a074, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a057942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-121, 24 February 2005). In the light of the above, the Court finds that the applicants were not obliged to pursue a civil remedy and that this limb of the Government\u2019s preliminary objection should therefore be dismissed.",

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, p. 1211, \u00a7 69; Aksoy, cited above, p. 2276, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54; and Tanr\u0131kulu v.

The investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see O\u011fur, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088). In particular, there must be an implicit requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition (see Ya\u015fa, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102-04, and Mahmut Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022535/93, ECHR 2000-III, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-07). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary for case to case. In all cases, however, the next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (see Shanaghan\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a037715/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, 4 May 2001).",

However, after the case file had been transferred to a military prosecutor\u2019s office two days later (see paragraph 66), the investigation appears to have become protracted and plagued with inexplicable shortcomings and delays in taking the most trivial steps. In particular, it does not appear that any ballistic tests were ever performed, even though they may have been relevant in the circumstances, given the pilots\u2019 statements that the men whom they had had attacked had been armed and the statements of military officials that spent cartridges from machine-guns had been found during the servicemen\u2019s inspection of the area.

The Court notes in this connection that the investigation had been suspended at least on two occasions, on 30 October and 30 December 2000 (see paragraphs 69 and 72 above), for failure to identify those responsible. The Court notes in this connection that it is highly unlikely that the identity of those involved in the operation of 6 August 2000 was unknown to the authorities or that it was impossible to establish it immediately thereafter. Moreover, whilst the identity of the federal pilots who participated in the attack was finally established more than a year later, the identity of their superiors who had given the order to attack does not appear to have been established at all. In particular, the decision of 15 December 2001 ordered that the criminal proceedings be discontinued in the part relating to the actions of an official who had given the order to attack the Niva vehicle and its occupants, without indicating whether the identity of that official had been established (see paragraph 76 above). Furthermore, the decision in question ordered that the proceedings be discontinued on the sole ground that the order to use lethal force had been justified in the circumstances of the case, without making any assessment of that order or providing any explanations in this connection. No further attempts to analyse the order were ever made, the proceedings under that head having remained closed after 15 December 2001.",

It further observes that the legal instrument referred to by the Government became operative on 1 July 2002 and that the applicants were clearly unable to have recourse to this remedy prior to that date. As regards the period thereafter, the Court considers that in a situation where the effectiveness of the investigation was undermined from a very early stage by the authorities\u2019 failure to take the necessary investigative measures, where the investigation was repeatedly suspended and reopened, where the applicants were never declared victims and were unable to consult the case file at any stage, and where they were only informed of the conduct of the investigation occasionally, it is highly doubtful that the remedy invoked by the Government would have had any prospect of success. Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that this remedy would have been capable of providing redress in the applicants\u2019 situation \u2013 in other words, that it would have rectified the shortcomings in the investigation and would have led to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the deaths of their relatives. The Court thus considers that in the circumstances of the case it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government would have been effective within the meaning of the Convention. It finds that the applicants were not obliged to pursue that remedy, and that this limb of the Government\u2019s preliminary objection should therefore be dismissed.",

Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution has decided not to investigate the claims. The Court, however, has strong doubts as to whether this remedy would have been effective in the circumstances of the present case. As mentioned above, prior to the decision of 24 April 2003, the investigating authorities ordered that the proceedings be terminated at least twice, on 15 December 2001 and 21 March 2002, referring to the same grounds, and namely the absence of evidence of a crime. Those decisions were subsequently set aside by supervising prosecutors and the case was repeatedly referred back for further investigation. In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that an appeal to a court, which could only have had the same effect, would have offered the applicants any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal in the particular circumstances of the present case would be devoid of any purpose. The Court finds that the applicants were not obliged to pursue that remedy and that this limb of the Government\u2019s preliminary objection should therefore be dismissed.",
