Moreover, the domestic criminal procedure system was deficient as it did not allow the victim and his or her representative to take part in particular investigative measures during the investigation. The applicant also contended that the manner in which some of the investigative measures had been carried out during the investigation, in particular the ordering and examining of the forensic expert report and the interviewing of the paramedic by telephone, had raised doubts as to the impartiality of the State Attorney\u2019s Office and the validity of its conclusions. In the applicant\u2019s view, the ineffectiveness of the investigation had also been manifest from the fact that in the civil proceedings the State had been found responsible for the injuries he had sustained during the arrest. Moreover, the findings of the expert report obtained by the State Attorney\u2019s Office differed from the findings of the experts in the civil proceedings which the applicant had instituted against the State. Thus, the reliance on a deficient expert report and the evidence obtained in an inadequate manner when discontinuing the investigation had shown that the decision of the State Attorney\u2019s Office had been manifestly defective.",

Moreover, those reports were based on the different extent of information and evidence available to the experts and were concerned with the establishment of facts concerning different aspects of responsibility \u2013 criminal and civil respectively. Thus, the expert report obtained in the criminal investigation was based on the specific questions put to the expert by the prosecutor, and during his questioning the expert was presented with other evidence obtained during the investigation, which he then put in the context of the charges made against the police officers (see paragraphs 24 and 26 above).
