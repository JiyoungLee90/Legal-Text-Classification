P 10/06 (30\u00a0October 2006) and SK 43/05 (12 May 2008), underlined the importance of freedom of expression in a democratic society, while stressing that the dignity of an individual also had to be protected by the authorities. In the case of conflict between freedom of expression and the right to private life, the latter could prevail over the former. The Constitutional Court further held that the protection of reputation and good name \u2013 things which were inextricably linked to a person\u2019s dignity \u2013 by means of criminal law did not, by itself, infringe the relevant provisions of the Constitution. Civil sanctions would be sufficient if they made it possible to re-establish the previous state of affairs. However, the consequences of attacking a person\u2019s good name could not be reversed, and subsequent apologies could not eradicate the fact of an attack. Lastly, the Government noted that the criminal proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case had been initiated by a bill of indictment lodged by private individuals, and not by a public prosecutor.",

Poland, no.\u00a075955/01, \u00a7 46 in fine, 29 March 2005). The use of sarcasm and irony is perfectly compatible with the exercise of a journalist\u2019s freedom of expression (see Smolorz v. Poland, no. 17446/07, \u00a7 41, 16 October 2012). However, it appears that the domestic courts did not take sufficient account of these features, even though they noted that the applicant had intended to mock the officials and had earlier published an ironic article on the same subject. In this context, the Court reiterates that, while any individual who takes part in a public debate of general concern \u2013 like the applicant in the instant case \u2013 must not overstep certain limits, particularly with regard to respect for the reputation and rights of others, a degree of exaggeration or even provocation is permitted; in other words, a degree of immoderation is allowed (see Mam\u00e8re, cited above, \u00a7 25; D\u0105browski v.

The Court has observed on several occasions that satire is a form of artistic expression and social commentary which, by its inherent features of exaggeration and distortion of reality, naturally aims to provoke and agitate.

The Strasbourg Court\u2019s role is but to respect the judicious judgment of the domestic courts in such cases.

The entire article was written in very sharp terms and in a sarcastic tone. The majority finds the article to be permeated with irony and, without even a semblance of analytical consideration, equates it with satire (see paragraphs 40, 44 and 45). They emphasise this feature of the article to such an extent that it seems as though it were in itself a legitimate excuse for all the words and phrases used in the publication. We shall come back to this \u201cexcuse\u201d argument a bit later. But before we do so, however, we must admit that, in our opinion, the article in question really does contain some irony, even a considerable amount. Its classification as satire, however, is far from equally obvious. Not every emotional text bulging with sarcasm and angry irony is a satire, just as not every text written in verse amounts to poetry. Although, of course, it is not for legal professionals (not excluding us judges) to have the final say on whether this article (or any other publication) may be correctly qualified as satire, we nonetheless doubt that many literary critics would easily agree with such a classification, so abruptly pronounced by the majority. But even if the article can be described as satirical, as the majority suggests, the fact of being satire cannot represent such a privilege that it can, in itself, absolve the author of any responsibility for the words and phrases employed in the publication. The fact of being satire is not absolution. There are satires that can be tolerated and satires that simply cannot be tolerated. This applies equally to a joke, a comedy, a grotesque, a lampoon, a parody, a caricature, an internet meme... the list can be extended.
