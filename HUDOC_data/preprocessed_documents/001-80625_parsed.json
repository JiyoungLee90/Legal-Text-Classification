The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article\u00a05 of the Convention, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see Benham v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996III, pp. 752-53, \u00a7\u00a040). It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Benham, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041).",

The CPT, meanwhile, has set 7 sq. m as an approximate, desirable guideline for a single-occupancy police cell [see \u201cThe CPT Standards\u201d \u2013 CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2006, paragraph 43], but there is no such guideline in respect of prison cells. However, the CPT has in general applied a standard of a minimum of 4 sq. m per prisoner in multiple occupancy cells [see, for example, the CPT reports on the 2002 visit to Bulgaria, CPT/Inf (2004) 21, paragraphs 82 and 87, and on the 2004 visit to Poland, CPT/Inf (2006) 11, paragraphs 87 and 111], and a minimum of 6\u00a0sq. m. per prisoner in single occupancy cells [see, for example, the CPT report on the 2004 visit to Poland, CPT/Inf (2006) 11, paragraphs 87 and 111]. Separately, the Court notes that during the period of the applicant's detention there were no sanitary facilities in the cells, but that access to such facilities was provided several times daily (see paragraph 90 above). There was direct sunlight and the windows in the cells could be opened to allow fresh air to circulate (see paragraph 91 above). Detainees were provided with clothes, a bed with a mattress, bed linen and a locker for personal belongings. The bed linen was changed every fortnight. The detainees had to bathe at least once a week, had access to a washing machine and after 1999 had easier access to hot water on account of the boilers installed in each corridor (see paragraph 92 above). Detainees were provided free-of-charge with toiletry products and materials to wash and disinfect their clothes and living areas (see paragraph 93 above). Efforts were also made to exterminate any insects and rodents (see paragraph 94 above).",

Considering the menus presented by the Government in respect of two of the weeks of the applicant's detention at this facility, the Court does not find that the food during those periods was substandard or inadequate (see paragraph 95 above).",

An equipped sports hall was also available for use by detainees to which they had was daily access (see paragraph 96 above).

It further notes that there was a prison library with a significant number of books and newspapers (see paragraphs 97 and 98 above). Films were screened on a weekly basis and there was the possibility to watch cable television in each cell. Radios were also permitted (see paragraphs 100 and 101 above).",
