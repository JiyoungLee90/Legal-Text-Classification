Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see, inter alia, Hornsby v. Greece, 19\u00a0March 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 40 et seq., Reports 1997-II, and Metaxas v. Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7 25, 27 May 2004). The Court has pointed out in civil length-of-proceedings cases that the enforcement proceedings are the second stage of the proceedings and that the right asserted does not actually become effective until enforcement (see, among other authorities, Di Pede v. Italy and Zappia v. Italy, 26 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 24 and 26 and \u00a7\u00a7 18, 20 and 22 respectively, Reports 1996-IV, and, mutatis mutandis, Silva Pontes v. Portugal, 23 March 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 286-A). While delays in enforcement might be justified in exceptional circumstances, only periods strictly necessary to enable the authorities to find a satisfactory solution are covered (see Immobiliare Saffi [GC], cited above, \u00a7 69; and Sokur v. Ukraine, no. 29439/02, \u00a7 30, 26 April 2005).",

Irrespective of whether a debtor is a private or a State-controlled entity, it is up to the State to take all necessary steps to enforce a final court judgment, and in so doing, to ensure the effective participation of its entire apparatus (see, mutatis mutandis, Pini\u00a0and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0Romania, nos. 78028/01 and 78030/01, \u00a7\u00a7 174-189, ECHR 2004-V; Hornsby, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

Its obligations under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in the enforcement of the respective court awards, for example, through enforcement proceedings or bankruptcy procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, Kotov v. Russia [GC], no. 54522/00, \u00a7 90, 3 April 2012). When the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a final court decision and they fail to do so, their inactivity may, in certain circumstances, engage the State\u2019s responsibility under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 (see Scollo v.

The Court\u2019s task in such cases is to examine whether the measures applied by the authorities were adequate and sufficient and whether they acted diligently in order to assist a creditor in the execution of a judgment (see Fociac\u00a0v.\u00a0Romania, no. 2577/02, \u00a7 70, 3 February 2005).",
