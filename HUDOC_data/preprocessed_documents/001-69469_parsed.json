This applies not only to cases dealing with the compulsory taking of children into public care and the implementation of care measures (see, inter alia, the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 27 November 1992, Series A no. 250, pp. 35-36, \u00a7 90), but also to cases where contact and residence disputes concerning children arise between parents and/or other members of the children's family (e.g. Hokkanen v.

In paragraphs 53-56 the majority rightly quote the relevant case-law of the Court in this respect. However, they then proceed down a path which we cannot follow. In our view, the Court should be extremely reluctant to second-guess, with hindsight, the assessment made by the domestic authorities in matters of parental custody and access rights, given its subsidiary role under Article 19 of the Convention. It should also be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with the persons concerned. This particular application presents the added difficulty that the case file before the Court is in a way \u201cincomplete\u201d: whilst it contains the version of the facts as seen by the applicant and the Government, it does not contain the version of the other principal party at domestic level, namely the mother. The majority finally conclude that there has been a violation of Article 8 on four grounds: the unpersuasive/ insufficient reasoning of the national courts, the far-reaching limitation of the applicant's parental rights, the unexplained refusal of assistance in obtaining effective compliance with judicial orders on access arrangements, and the failure to weigh up carefully the interests involved in the case so as to strike a fair balance between the mother's right to travel and the applicant's right of access to his child. We are not convinced by these reasons.",

Finland (judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 229) or Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania (no. 31679/96, ECHR 2000-I) is that the applicant himself cannot be regarded as entirely blameless for the situation complained of before the Court. It was the applicant who twice took the small child away from the mother, the second time for a period of almost 15 months. He did not even comply with repeated court orders to reveal the child's place of residence. It was only after several warnings had been given in vain that the court finally deprived him of all parental rights ",

In our opinion, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, this far-reaching limitation of the applicant's parental rights was justified as he had shown a complete disregard for the child's well-being and health. It was only after this decision that the police removed the child from the applicant. In these circumstances it is quite understandable \u2013 although not justified \u2013 that the mother was not immediately prepared to restore the applicant's access rights as determined by the court during the time when the applicant had abducted his child (one visit on the third Saturday of each month at the mother's home from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. without the possibility of taking the child anywhere outside). Given that the parents were apparently unable or unwilling to communicate with each other in a rational manner about, for instance, parental issues and that the child's welfare obviously required that he should not be exposed to a bitter parental dispute, we feel that the domestic authorities would have been irresponsible in imposing stringent coercive measures on the mother, at least during the initial period in which she was reunited with the child.",

But to infer from that mere fact a failure by the State to comply with its positive obligations under Article 8 is one bridge too far. To reach that conclusion, we would need more clarification as to the reasons why no one agreed to provide such assistance.",

To us such an assertion, by its nature and timing, can only be regarded as the next move on the legal chessboard. The answer given to the applicant was that, until the date on which the judgment removing his parental rights obtained legal force, the passport would not be issued without his approval. That stands to reason. But as soon as that judgment did become final and only the mother held parental rights, there were no further legal obstacles to the issuing of a passport for the child. The mother's right to travel with her child, if need be abroad, is also a fundamental right (Article 8 in conjunction with Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of Protocol No. 4). She merely availed herself of that right. Can one really argue that the national authorities were under a legal (or moral) obligation to warn the applicant, who had lost his parental rights, that the mother, who did have parental rights, was going abroad on 30 May 2000? And can one blame the State for the fact that the mother apparently wanted to start a new life with the child abroad and broke off all contact with the applicant? One cannot expect the impossible from the national authorities.",
