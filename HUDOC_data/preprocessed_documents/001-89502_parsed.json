Turkey, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 324, \u00a7\u00a086). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life. What form of investigation will achieve this purpose may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedure (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan v.  [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2000-VII). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken all reasonable steps to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Gongadze\u00a0v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, \u00a7\u00a0176, ECHR 2005-XI).",

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force or a disappearance may generally be regarded as essential in ensuring public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7\u00a7 108-15, ECHR 2001III, and Av\u015far v.

Meanwhile, the primary expert\u2019s opinion had served as a strong argument not to investigate the version of the violent death of Mr\u00a0M. straight after the discovery of his body. It was not until 12 May 2000, almost fourteen\u00a0months after the corpse had been found, that the case about the beating of the applicant\u2019s son was reclassified as a case of bodily harm causing a death.
