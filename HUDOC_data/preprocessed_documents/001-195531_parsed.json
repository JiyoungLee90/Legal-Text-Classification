[T]he criminal case against [\u010c.M., the applicant, I.R., D.L., O.J. and A.J.] concerning allegations of falsification of documents and appropriation of value-added tax is still pending before the first-instance court (the Vilnius Regional Court). The evidence in that case is still being examined and a judgment on the charges against the aforementioned individuals has not been adopted. Accordingly, since pre-trial investigations have been separated on the basis of individuals and not on the basis of criminal offences, and since the criminal case from which the present case has been separated has not been examined by a court to date, the possibility to establish all the circumstances of the criminal offences allegedly committed by the accomplices in the present case is significantly restricted. Having in mind that the proceedings before the appellate-instance court are limited not only by Article 255 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but also by Article\u00a0320 of that Code (a case is examined only in respect of those accused (suspects) and those criminal acts which have been referred to the court for examination), the appellate-instance court ... cannot examine all the circumstances of the alleged criminal offences and cannot establish the acts and roles of [\u010c.M., the applicant, I.R. and D.L.] in the commission of the alleged criminal offences.

A person is considered innocent of a crime until his or her guilt has been proved in accordance with a procedure established by law and he or she has been found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect. The presumption of innocence is inseparably linked with respect for and the protection of other constitutional human rights and freedoms, as well as acquired rights.

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State. In certain circumstances, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, \u00a7 179, 23\u00a0February 2017, and the cases cited therein). The Court also reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the remedies they suggest in the particular circumstances in issue with examples from the case-law of the relevant domestic courts or decisions of the administrative authorities (see Varga and Others v.\u00a0Hungary, nos. 14097/12 and 5 others, \u00a7 50, 10 March 2015).",

The Government submitted that the applicant had had the possibility to lodge a civil claim and obtain monetary compensation for the breach of her honour and dignity. A civil-law remedy can, in principle, be considered effective, within the meaning of the Convention, against alleged violations of the presumption of innocence. In some cases the Court found civil-law remedies, offering the possibility of obtaining monetary compensation together with various other procedures for acknowledgment of or putting an end to the infringement of the presumption of innocence, to be effective. The Government provided examples of domestic case-law in which individuals had claimed that statements presenting them as guilty of a criminal offence had breached their honour and dignity. One of them had succeeded in receiving monetary compensation. That remedy does not appear to be \u201con its face\u201d ineffective with regard to the applicant\u2019s complaint about her right to be presumed innocent. The majority has not discerned any exceptional circumstances which could have absolved the applicant from the obligation to avail herself of the said compensatory remedy, and the existence of \u201cmere doubts\u201d as to the prospects of success of a remedy which is not \u201cobviously futile\u201d is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust that avenue of redress. In addition, the applicant did not ask the court to continue examining the criminal case against her after it became time-barred and acquit her, in order to dispel any doubts as to her innocence. She thus has failed to exhaust domestic civil-law (compensatory) and criminal-law remedies with regard to her Article 6 \u00a7 2 complaint.",
