The prosecutor terminated those proceedings on the basis of the fact that the child systematically refused to spend time alone with her father, but the firstinstance court later quashed that decision and returned the case for further consideration.",

Sweden (no. 2), 27\u00a0November 1992, \u00a7 90, Series A no. 250; Hokkanen v. Finland, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 299-A; Ignaccolo-Zenide v.\u00a0Romania, no. 31679/96, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2000-I; Santos Nunes v. Portugal, no. 61173/08, \u00a7\u00a7 66-69, 22 May 2012). The essence of those principles is that, given that the relationship between parents and children is protected under the Article 8 notions of family life, individuals\u2019 inability to maintain this relation calls for action by the authorities in line with their positive obligations to adopt measures to reunite, or help re-establish contact between, child and parent (see Eriksson, \u00a771; Olsson (no. 2), \u00a7 90; and Ignaccolo-Zenide, \u00a7 94, all cited above). The obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate such a reunion is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with other persons may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures. The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case. Any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited, since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account and, more particularly, the best interests of the child (see Hokkanen, \u00a7 58, and Ignaccolo-Zenide, \u00a7 94, both cited above). What is decisive, and what the Court is called upon to review, is whether the national authorities have taken all necessary steps that could reasonably be demanded in the circumstances, aimed at allowing the individuals concerned to reunite and preserve the relationship between them (see K\u0159\u00ed\u017e v.\u00a0the Czech Republic, no.\u00a026634/03, \u00a7 85, 9 January 2007).",

The first applicant met her son five times. The third applicant managed to see her child on four occasions, always in institutional settings and in the presence of the other parent and social workers.

The authorities have not provided an explanation to justify that delay. The Court emphasises in that connection that in cases such as these the adequacy of the measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 102). Swift implementation is of particular importance in the early stages of separation, when the relationship with the child still exists. Given that the enforcement proceedings at stake were decisive for the applicants\u2019 effective enjoyment of their right to a family life and, in particular, for their ability to be reunited with their children, the Court considers that the proceedings needed to be conducted with particular diligence.",

Bearing in mind that both children were growing more and more apart from the applicants because of the passage of time and the particular circumstances brought about by the other parent in each case, the Court finds that the prolonged enforcement proceedings had an undeniably negative impact on the applicants\u2019 possibility to reunite with their children and contributed to the related difficulties experienced by them (see, similarly, K\u0159\u00ed\u017e, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

In the case of the first applicant, police officers accompanied representatives of the social services and the mayor a number of times when they visited the place where A.I. lived with the second applicant. Their intervention was confined to assisting the bailiff in summoning and accompanying, without that actually leading to the handing over of the child to the first applicant or even to bringing about meetings between her and the child. In addition, in the first applicant\u2019s case, the police failed to effectively fulfil the court order to assist with the transfer of second applicant to the first applicant, explaining that omission with the child\u2019s opposition to it (see paragraph 26 above). Similarly, in the case of the third applicant the bailiff told the parties that police assistance might be sought during the first attempt to hand the child over to her (see paragraph 35 above).

The Court observes that the relevant authorities consistently concluded in the first applicant\u2019s case that the other parent explicitly opposed all attempts to re-establish contact between her and the child, and actively and effectively avoided such attempts (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 25 above), and in the third applicant\u2019s case that the other parent\u2019s cooperation to that end was lacking and that the child was suffering from parental alienation syndrome (see paragraphs 42, 45, 48 and 50 above). Despite such unambiguous observations by the social services, the Court notes that they produced reports with conclusions and recommendations which were not followed up. In that connection, the relevant authorities failed to make sure that professional, targeted support was effectively provided to the children, which was critical for them to get used to the idea of seeing their mothers, the first and third applicants, and accept them back into their lives. Such support was part of the indispensable preparatory measures that the authorities were required to take in line with their positive obligations under Article 8. In particular, preparatory measures were vital for ensuring the children\u2019s autonomous engagement with the situation, independently from the other parent\u2019s undeniably decisive influence.",

Apparently those proceedings had no effect and the other parent continued to further hamper enforcement in both cases.

The Court finds that the fact that, as the Government contended in their observations (see paragraph 90 above), she had not sought the lifting of the suspension of the enforcement once the change of custody proceedings brought by the other parent had been terminated, or the return of her child under Article 71 of the Family Code, did not have an effect on the conduct and effectiveness of the enforcement proceedings.

As to the Government\u2019s submission that she had herself caused the child to be estranged by delaying the start of enforcement proceedings for a year (see paragraph 96 above), the Court makes the following findings. Before the child\u2019s father failed to return him in September 2011, the third applicant had lived alone with the child for over a year, exercising custody rights in line with the court\u2019s decision on interim measures (see paragraph 29 above). While the third applicant significantly delayed the initiation of the enforcement proceedings, the Court accepts her explanation that she made repeated direct attempts to reach an agreement with the father following the advice of private bailiffs (see paragraph 33 above). In any case, this delay could not be considered decisive for the deficiency of the subsequent enforcement proceedings throughout which the third applicant continuously demonstrated willingness to cooperate with the authorities in order to obtain the return of the child and to find the best arrangement for contact with him.",

Admittedly, a number of authorities and officials were involved to varying degrees and with varying intensity in facilitating or attempting to ensure the applicants could meet their children at various times. However, those measures have not brought about the return of the children to the first and third applicants, nor have they led to the re-establishment of any kind of meaningful contact between them and the children with a view to rebuilding the relationships. The parties at fault, the other parent refusing to follow a final judicial decision in each case, have remained largely unconstrained, which has allowed them to persist in their obstruction of all related efforts. The relevant authorities, faced with such obstruction, did not ensure that timely and suitable preparatory measures were put in place and carried through (see, similarly, Zav\u0159el v. the Czech Republic, no. 14044/05, \u00a7 52, 18 January 2007, and, to the contrary, Krasicki v.

As to whether the authorities used the appropriate coercive and/or preparatory measures, the Court observes that the bailiff acted swiftly by repeatedly fining the mother in the months that followed, having found that she had not handed the child over. For their part, the social services assessed the situation and recommended that the fourth applicant make a sustained effort to see the child regularly, at least temporarily in the presence of the mother. However, instead, the fourth applicant refused to accept R.D.\u2019s presence during his meetings with the child and, as established above, failed to seek contact with the child for prolonged periods of time or tried to have meetings on days that were not part of the schedule of visits.",
