Moreover, the cells were overcrowded, poorly lit and humid. The prisoners were not provided with bedding and had no laundry facilities. As to the conditions in the Soroca prison, the applicant submitted that the cells were overcrowded and humid. In respect of the Cricova prison, the applicant complained about the conditions there for the first time in his observations on the admissibility and merits of the case in January 2010 and only about the period between October and December 2006 when he had been detained in an overcrowded cell with no heating.

In cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of the situation (B. and D. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9303/81, Commission decision of 13 October 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 49, p. 44). The concept of a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State so as to render the applicant a victim (see, Montion v. France, no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14\u00a0May 1987, DR 52, p. 227, and Hilton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a012015/86, Commission decision of 6 July 1988, DR 57, p. 108). Normally, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies.
