The applicant did not contest either the proceedings or impartiality of any member of the academic council. The latter issued a decision based on equity. As the applicant was asked to submit reasons for his extraordinary success in the second round of written examinations, his only submission was that it had been an outcome of his preparations. Such a submission was, however, devoid of value, for the preparations had taken place before the first round of written examinations. The latter had had only a rather poor impact on the applicant's result in the first round, but they inexplicably and suddenly became extremely fruitful in the second round. For that reason, the academic council issued a decision on equity and annulled the results of the applicant's written test.
