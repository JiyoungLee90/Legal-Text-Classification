The case originated in an application (no. 36743/97) against the Republic of Lithuania lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Lithuanian national, Mr Algis Grauslys (“the applicant”), on 2 April 1997.
The applicant was represented by Mr K. Stungys, a lawyer practising in Vilnius. The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Švedas, Deputy Minister of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, violations of Articles 5 §§ 1, 3, 4 and 6 § 1 of the Convention insofar as his detention in remand was unlawful, he was not brought promptly before a judge or other officer, he was not able to take proceedings to contest the lawfulness of his detention, and the length of the criminal proceedings against him was excessive.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 14 September 1999 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant, the commercial director of a private company (“the company”), was suspected of fraud. On 4 October 1995 a criminal case was instituted against him.
The applicant was arrested on 25 March 1996. His detention on remand was authorised by a prosecutor on 26 March 1996.
On 1 April 1996 the applicant was charged with suppressing documents. On 16 May 1996 the applicant was charged with unlawfully obtaining the property of another.
On 24 May 1996, by the authorisation of the Deputy Prosecutor General, the term of the applicant’s detention on remand was extended to 30 July 1996.
The Klaipėda District Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention on remand twice: on 24 July 1996 to 25 August 1996 and on 19 August 1996 to 25 September 1996. On 23 September 1996 the Klaipėda Regional Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention on remand to 9 October 1996.
The pre-trial investigation in the case was concluded on 27 September 1996. The applicant had access to the case-file from 3 to 31 October 1996, while the other three co-accused were given access from 27 September to 7 November 1996.
In a communication of 27 September 1996, the prosecution informed the prison administration that the pre-trial investigation had been concluded and access to the case-file had commenced.
On 30 October 1996 the applicant applied to the prosecution for bail, contesting the lawfulness of his detention after 9 October 1996. On 8 November 1996 a prosecutor informed the applicant that there were no reasons to vary the remand. The prosecutor stated inter alia, “the access by the accused and their counsel to the case-file was completed on 7 November 1996. On 8 November 1996 the criminal case was transmitted for the confirmation of the bill of indictment. The validity of the term of the applicant’s detention was not breached”. No remand decision was taken.
On 12 November 1996 a prosecutor informed the prison administration that access to the case-file had been completed on 7 November 1996, and that the case had been transmitted to the Klaipėda Chief Regional Prosecutor to confirm the bill of indictment. On the same date a prosecutor informed the prison administration that the bill of indictment had been confirmed, and that the case had been transmitted to the Klaipėda Regional Court. No remand decision was taken.
On 19 November 1996 the Klaipėda Regional Court forwarded the case to the Kretinga District Court. No formal decision on the applicant’s detention was taken. On the same date the applicant applied to the Minister of Justice, claiming that his detention had been unlawful since 9 October 1996.
On 4 December 1996 the applicant applied to the Kretinga District Court for bail. On 5 December 1996 a judge of the Klaipėda District Court committed the applicant to trial. In his decision the judge also decided that the applicant’s “remand shall remain unchanged”. The decision did not refer to other aspects regarding the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention. The judge also set 13 January 1997 as the date of the first trial hearing.
The hearing took place on 13 January 1997. On the same date the applicant again applied for bail.
On 15 January 1997 the judge of the Kretinga District Court, in the presence of the applicant’s counsel, ordered further investigations in the case. The judge noted inter alia that the prosecution had alleged that financial damage to the company and its shareholders had been caused by the applicant and the co-accused. However, no victims had been established and questioned. In addition, the company’s audit had not been properly carried out. The judge held that the trial could not continue until these procedural requirements were met.
By the same decision the judge also dismissed the applicant’s request for bail and extended the term of his detention on remand for three months. The dangers of the applicant absconding and “obstructing the establishment of the truth” in the case were mentioned as reasons for this decision. The judge did not mention the applicant’s allegations about the unlawfulness of his detention since 9 October 1996.
On the same date the applicant appealed to the Klaipėda Regional Court, claiming that he had been unlawfully kept in detention after 9 October 1996. On 20 January 1997 the applicant lodged with the Klaipėda Regional Court a further appeal against the decisions of the Kretinga District Court of 5 December 1996 and 15 January 1997. He stated inter alia that Article 5 of the Convention had been breached to his detriment.
On 28 January 1997 the applicant submitted a complaint to the Ombudsman, alleging that the term of his detention had expired on 9 October 1996, and that thereafter the prison administration had kept him in custody unlawfully.
On 17 February 1997 the Klaipėda Regional Court held an appeal hearing in the presence of the applicant’s counsel. The Regional Court dismissed the appeal insofar as it concerned “the substance of the decision of the Kretinga District Court of 15 January 1997”, pursuant to Article 372 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as then in force. No aspects concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the applicant’s detention were mentioned in the appellate decision. The Regional Court nonetheless ordered the applicant’s release on bail, without giving reasons. He was immediately released from prison.
On 20 February 1997 the Ombudsman drew the attention of the Minister of Interior and the prison authorities to the fact that from 7 November to 5 December 1996 the applicant had been remanded in custody in breach of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention.
On 23 June 1997 the additional investigation was concluded. On 17 July 1997 the case was again transmitted to the Kretinga District Court. On 21 July 1997 a judge of the Kretinga District Court committed the applicant to trial.
On 6 October 1997 the judge again decided to order further investigations. He noted that the investigating authorities had breached domestic criminal procedure in its conduct of the pre-trial investigation and the collection of additional evidence. The judge held inter alia that the company’s audit had been defective and that the prosecution had not established or questioned victims in connection with the damage suffered by the company.
Upon the prosecution’s appeal against the above decision, on 17 November 1997 the Klaipėda Regional Court quashed the decision of 6 October 1997. The Regional Court held that no breaches of domestic criminal procedure had been specified by the District Court, which might warrant the collection of additional evidence. The appellate court stated inter alia that the District Court could itself establish and summon victims in connection with the company’s losses, without returning the case back to the prosecution for further investigations.
On 17 December 1997 a judge of the Kretinga District Court joined the case against the applicant and the three co-accused with a case against another defendant. The judge withdrew from the case on the ground inter alia that he had taken decisions on the applicant’s detention on 5 December 1996 and 15 January 1997.
On an unspecified date, jurisdiction was transferred from the Kretinga District Court to the Skuodas District Court. On 2 April 1998 a judge of the Skuodas District Court committed the applicant to trial. On 12 June 1998 the judge adjourned the case until 12 September 1998 and ordered further investigations, particularly on the ground that the company’s audit had been defective. In this respect, the court requested the Ministry of Finance to carry out a fresh audit.
On an unspecified date, the applicant’s trial was resumed. To date no first instance judgment has been pronounced.
