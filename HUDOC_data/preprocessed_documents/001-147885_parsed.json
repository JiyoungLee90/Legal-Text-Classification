From the police\u2019s description of the facts and evidence it appears that on 13\u00a0March\u00a02010 at 9:45 am while trying to overtake X\u2019s car, which had been improperly parked, the applicant failed to make sure that he could do so without endangering X\u2019s car and with the rear right end of his car he hit the rear left end of X\u2019s car. Allegedly, after the collision the applicant left the scene of the accident without submitting his personal data to X who was not present during the accident or notifying the police that he had been involved in an accident. X stated to the police that an unknown witness told him that the person responsible for the accident was driving a dark car with the number plate LJ 37-33. On the basis of this information the police checked two vehicles with number plates LJ 37-33V and LJ 37-33L. These vehicles did not show any sign of damage. On 14 March 2010 X informed the police that he had found a dark car with the number plate KP L3-733. The police established that the owner of the car was the applicant. On the same day the police interviewed the applicant and checked his car. They found that the damage on the applicant\u2019s car corresponded to that of X\u2019s car. They further found that Y was present in the applicant\u2019s car during the accident.",

He argued that he did not detect any collision between the two cars and that, accordingly, he had not informed X or the police of the accident; that there had been many passers-by on the road who had witnessed how he had been manoeuvring the car but nobody had warned him of any kind of abrasion or dent caused to X\u2019s car; that he lived at the address of the scene of the accident and would have never left the scene even if he had caused the damage; that he had been informed of the accident only the following day when called by the police, and that together with the police he had checked his car visually and discovered a scratch of 10 to 15 cm in length for which he did not know when it appeared. According to the applicant, due to X\u2019s improper parking any vehicle could have hit his car; from the damage on X\u2019s car it was clear that the applicant could not have caused the damage with his car. The applicant reiterated that if he had detected the accident he would have reported it and this fact could have been proved by witness Y which was present in his car. He described in detail the events of 13\u00a0March\u00a02010, namely approximately at 9.30 am he drove out of the parking spaces, he wanted to turn to the right but two cars prevented him from doing so because they were actually parked on the road; the cars parked posed a threat to road traffic safety because the space between them would have not allowed an ambulance or any other emergency vehicle to pass; in such a situation the applicant was forced to position his car at an appropriate angle to enable him to pass safely between the cars; he had to fold both side mirrors; otherwise he would not have been able to pass the two parked vehicles without collision; he manoeuvred his car at almost zero speed and was not aware that he had caused an abrasion or damage to any other vehicle.",

He complained that the police had not sufficiently established the facts; he had not left or escaped the scene of the accident; he had not been aware of any collision and, consequently, he did not inform X and the police thereof in accordance with Section 135(3) of the Road Traffic Safety Act. He further stated that he wanted to turn right onto the carriageway but he was prevented from doing so by two cars parked on the carriageway \u2013 on the left and on the right sides of the road. One of the cars was X\u2019s car. When he wanted to drive out of the garage he could not do so and was forced to manoeuvre for quite some time to position the car at an appropriate angle and had to straighten the car almost completely to be able to pass freely between the two cars. In order to do it safely he had to fold in both side mirrors because otherwise he would have not been able to pass the parked cars without colliding with them. During the manoeuvring he was not aware that he had caused an abrasion or damage to the cars. The manoeuvring speed was minimal. There were many passers-by who witnessed the manoeuvring but did not warn him of any accident. In order to prove these allegations the applicant proposed that he and Y be heard. He further stated that police had not considered the fact that he lived at the address of the scene of the accident and therefore he had no interest in leaving the scene. He drove to a filling station, went shopping and visited his parents. As evidence he submitted a fuel purchase receipt and a shop receipt and proposed the hearing of his parents. He further argued that if he had left the scene of the accident intentionally he would have concealed the scratches on his car. Even if he had collided with X\u2019s car he would not have been aware of it since his car was a diesel-fuelled car which tended to vibrate heavily. Moreover, his radio was always turned on which reduced the likelihood of noticing the collision. In order to prove this he proposed that he and Y be heard. He argued that he was not aware of the date when the scratch appeared on his car since the car was seven years old and had many other scratches. Since X\u2019s car had been improperly parked any vehicle could have collided with it. The police did not clarify on the basis of which fact they had concluded that the scratch on his car corresponded to the damage on X\u2019s car. In the applicant\u2019s view X had been frenetically searching for the culprit and as soon as he found a black car with few scratches he reported him to the police and the police believed X without hearing any witness and without considering all of the circumstances of the case.",

The Local Court held that it had no reason to doubt the findings of the police who conducted an interview with the applicant and a visual inspection of his car during which they noticed damage which corresponded to the damage on X\u2019s car. According to the court, it was clear from the documents of the case-file, in particular the photographs of X\u2019s car, that the damage had been caused by the applicant\u2019s car and the applicant\u2019s complaints in this respect remained general and subjective. In particular, the allegations that the accident would have been reported by passers-by or that the applicant would not have left the scene of the accident if he had noticed it were subjective and could not be verified. The applicant could not be released from his responsibility for the minor offence by stating that he had not been aware of the collision because this was, again, a subjective allegation. Every participant in road traffic, in the circumstances described by the applicant, was expected to be particularly alert and to detect the collision. Regarding the allegation that X\u2019s car was parked on the road and that it had endangered the traffic safety the court stressed that only the applicant\u2019s behaviour was at issue. It held that according to Section 135(5) of the Road Traffic Safety Act a traffic offender who had left the scene of the accident should have immediately notified the injured party or the police the information referred to in that Section. The court therefore did not have to reply to the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had not left the scene to an unknown place as they were legally irrelevant. Finally, the evidence submitted by the applicant could not change the conclusions of the police and it was only an attempt to delay the proceedings since the motions for evidence did not comply with the required legal standards regarding the subject-matter about which the witnesses proposed might have testified.",

These observations were confirmed by several facts that could be established in an objective manner and also by the applicant himself in his interview with the police officers and in his appeals against the payment order. The documents of the case-file contain several facts that fit together and their overall picture shows that the police\u2019s findings were correct. The unknown witness who saw the collision informed X that a dark-coloured car had damaged his car on the right rear end. The same witness provided X with an incomplete number plate LJ 37-33. Later, the police found a trace of black paint on the damaged part of X\u2019s car, they conducted an interview with the applicant and together with him they visually checked his car. Moreover, the numerical part of the number plate submitted by the unknown witness corresponded to the applicant\u2019s number plate KP L3-733. The applicant told the police officer that he had difficulties with manoeuvring on the day of the accident. In his request for judicial review he stated that even if he had hit X\u2019s car he would not have detected it because his car vibrated at low speed and the radio was always turned on. He thus allowed for the possibility that the collision had actually happened and therefore completely compromised his statement that the collision had not happened. The Local Court had substantiated why it had not heard the proposed witnesses. The applicant had the opportunity to state his opinion in his objection to the payment order and in his request for judicial review and the Local Court made a reasoned assessment on the basis of the case-file\u2019s documents and no oral hearing was necessary.",

The police found in its records two vehicles which corresponded to the abovementioned number plate, LJ 37-33V and LJ 37-33L; they checked those vehicles but found no damage which could have corresponded to the damage on X\u2019s car. Subsequently, X found the applicant\u2019s car parked nearby with the number plate KP L3-733. He informed the police thereof. The police checked visually X\u2019s car and the applicant\u2019s car and interviewed the applicant. A black scratch was found on X\u2019s car which according to the personal observations of the police corresponded to the damage on the applicant\u2019s car. The applicant could not tell when the scratch appeared as the car was old. When contesting the fine imposed before the Ljubljana Local Court he alleged that he had encountered problems in manoeuvring his car because of X\u2019s improper parking but he either denied committing the offence or alleged that he was not aware of any collision. He requested, inter alia, that he and Y, who was present in his car at the relevant time, be heard.",

Slovenia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-39). The facts were not established by means of an objective method (for example by way of collection of paint samples from both vehicles; see, a contrario, Suhadolc v. Slovenia, cited above) but mostly by way of personal observations of an unknown witness who provided a partial number plate of the offender, and the police officers visual checking of the damage on the cars allegedly involved in the accident. In his request for judicial review the applicant denied the commission of the offence and in order to prove that he had not damaged X\u2019s car he requested that he and Y be heard. Considering that the number plate provided by an unknown witness whom the applicant could not question was incomplete and that both cars had been checked only visually by the police officers, the Court finds unconvincing the reasoning provided by the Local Court that the applicant\u2019s motion for the hearing of Y, in particular, was unsubstantiated and represented an attempt to delay the proceedings. In those circumstances, given the nature of the factual questions to be addressed by the Local Court and the fact that the evidence was not obtained by means of an objective method the Court is of the view that the Local Court could not, as a matter of fair trial, have properly determined the facts or the applicant\u2019s guilt without a direct assessment of the evidence at an oral hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Flisar v. Slovenia, cited above; and Milenovi\u0107 v. Slovenia (no. 11411/11, 28 February 2013).",

The Court therefore accepts that the applicant incurred expenses in seeking redress for the violation of the Convention through the domestic legal system (see, mutatis mutandis, Rojas Morales v.
