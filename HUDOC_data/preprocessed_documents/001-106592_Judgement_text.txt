The Government provided the Court with a copy of a judgment handed down on 20 April 2009 by the Kraków Court of Appeal, which had awarded just satisfaction in respect of the excessive length of civil proceedings to the plaintiff, a certain K.M., on the basis of Articles 417 and 448 of the Polish Civil Code, concerning the protection of personal rights. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal considered that the excessive length of the civil proceedings for the distribution of inheritance, which had been pending for over twenty years, had caused the applicant, an elderly person, considerable stress resulting in moral suffering and entitling her to non-pecuniary damages. Consequently, it modified the lower court’s judgment and awarded K.M. the sum of PLN 70,000.
