It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant and some of his co-defendants had made attempts to disrupt the trial in its early stages (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, it accepts that certain delays during the trial were caused by the defendants' obstructiveness (see paragraphs 20 and 24 above).",
