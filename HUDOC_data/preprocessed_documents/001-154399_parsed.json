Thus, the review of the lawfulness of the detention had to embrace an examination of the basis of the arrest, otherwise a person could be detained under the 2000 Act for up to twenty-eight days without there having been any judicial review of the lawfulness of the original arrest and that could not be Convention compliant. The High Court therefore found that Judge Philpott had been wrong to disavow any review of the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 arrest and, as a consequence, her decision to grant extensions had to be quashed. The court accepted, however, that a review of the lawfulness of the arrest need not involve a detailed analysis of the basis for the decision to arrest and should reflect the constraints that necessarily apply in many arrests for terrorist offences.",

In a judgment delivered on 24 February 2011, the High Court of Northern Ireland found no basis for the submission that Schedule\u00a08 was incompatible with Article 5 of the Convention. In particular, the court held that, although there was no doubt that the \u201ccompetent legal authority\u201d referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) was the authority having competence to deal with a criminal charge (the magistrate in the United Kingdom), in Schiesser v. Switzerland (4 December 1979, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a034) and McKay v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 543/03, ECHR 2006X) the Court had made it clear that the function of \u201ca judge or other officer\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention could be carried out by an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and did not necessarily have to be a person with power to conduct the trial of any eventual criminal charge; that, although there was no express power to order release in the 2000\u00a0Act as required by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, such a power must be implied; that, as paragraph 32 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act provided that there must be reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of a person was necessary, it therefore contained a requirement of proportionality; that, there was no provision for conditional release on bail within the statutory scheme, an issue which did not arise in the present case but would need to be addressed in any future case in which it arose; that, although paragraph 33(3) of Schedule 8 enabled a judicial authority to exclude an applicant or anyone representing him from any part of the hearing and paragraph 34 permitted information to be withheld from the applicant or anyone representing him, there were a range of tools available to the court to preserve to the necessary extent an adversarial procedure and equality of arms; and, finally, that there was no authority which supported the applicants\u2019 contention that Article 5 required that a detained person be charged well before the expiry of the twentyeight day period contemplated in the 2000 Act.",

Such first communication, which could take the form of a letter sent by fax, would in principle interrupt the running of the six-month period (see Abdulrahmen v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a066994/12 of 5 February 2013).",

In the present case the High Court found that a review of the lawfulness of arrest need not involve a detailed analysis of the basis for the decision to arrest and should reflect the necessary constraints that applied in many arrests for terrorist offences, where reasons of public safety prevented the disclosure of the full information upon which the decision to arrest was taken. The applicants submitted that this was not compliant with Article 5 \u00a7 3, as such a test prevented the effective review of arrest and detention required by that Article on the first automatic review by a judge and in subsequent reviews. Therefore, even if the County Court Judge had proceeded on the basis approved by the High Court, it would not have been sufficient to comply with Article 5 \u00a7 3.",

Convention case-law established that the latter role had to be carried out with due expedition (McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, ECHR 2006X). There was no dispute between the parties that the \u201cjudicial authority\u201d as constituted under the 2000 Act did not possess the power to order conditional release; however, without the possibility of imposing conditions of release the judicial authority could only order unconditional release or continued detention. The position was particularly stark in a case such as the present, where the applicants should, at the very least, have been conditionally released. In this regard the applicants submitted that the police had sought to extend their detention when they had already been detained for seven days without charge; police interviews had come to an end save for the receipt of the results of forensic tests; the investigations had not produced any or sufficient evidence to charge the applicants; they were of good character and did not pose a flight risk; and they were entitled to the presumption of innocence.",

In Brogan and Others (cited above, \u00a7 61), the Court specifically acknowledged that \u201c[t]he difficulties ... of judicial control over decisions to arrest and detain suspected terrorists may affect the manner of implementation of Article 5 \u00a7 3, for example in calling for appropriate procedural precautions in view of the nature of the suspected offences\u201d. This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have \u201ccarte blanche\u201d under Article 5 to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, ultimately, by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (see \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7\u00a0104, ECHR 2005IV).",

It is not, however, a requirement of the Convention and there is no reason in principle why the issues cannot be dealt with by two judicial officers, within the requisite time frame. In any event, as a matter of interpretation, it cannot be required that the examination of bail take place with any more speed than is demanded of the first automatic review, which the Court has identified as being a maximum of four days (see Brogan and Others, cited above).",

Where this is the case, the Court has found the requirements imposed by this first part of Article 5 \u00a7 3 to be satisfied.

Although it was the paragraph 36 order which the applicants subsequently challenged by way of judicial review, the High Court held that paragraph 32, which sets out the grounds for granting a warrant of further detention, had to be interpreted in conformity with Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).

Firstly, under the Schedule 8 scheme the judge could only extend detention for a maximum of seven days and the overall period could not exceed twenty-eight days. Before granting any extension the judge had to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing that further detention was necessary and that the investigation was being conducted diligently and expeditiously (see paragraph 36 above). Furthermore, following the ruling of the High Court, the judge also had to be satisfied that the arrest was lawful and consider the merits of detention. Although in certain cases detainees and/or their representatives could be excluded from the hearings, in the present case the first applicant gave evidence on oath during the first review and arguments from both applicants were heard during the second reviews (see paragraph 8 above). Finally, the applicants were able to challenge their continued detention by way of judicial review.",
