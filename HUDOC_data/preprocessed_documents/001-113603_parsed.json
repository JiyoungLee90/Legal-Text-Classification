As regards the domestic courts\u2019 conduct, the Court notes that it took them about two years to even start the examination of the claim (see paragraphs 5 and 10 above). The remittal of the case by the appellate court back to the first-instance court for fresh examination caused another delay of about one year and a half (see paragraph 13 above).
