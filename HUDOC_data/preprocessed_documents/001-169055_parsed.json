It considers that, having regard to the nature of the violation found under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, in principle the most appropriate form of redress for this violation would be to restart or to reopen the proceedings. In this respect, the Court notes that section 64(i) of the Law on the Supreme Military Administrative Court in force as of 30 April 2013 provides for the reopening of proceedings following a judgment by the Court. Thus, it is now for the applicant to make use of that opportunity (Bistrovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 25774/05, \u00a7 58, 31\u00a0May 2007, and Fatma Nur Erten and Adnan Erten, cited above, \u00a7 37).",
