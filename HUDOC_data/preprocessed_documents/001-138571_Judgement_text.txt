The case originated in an application (no. 74550/12) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovak national, Ms Mária Kucejová (“the applicant”), on 11 November 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr R. Cibulka, a lawyer practising in Trnava. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.
On 18 December 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Púchov.
On 17 November 1998 the applicant’s sister initiated civil proceedings before the District Court in Trnava claiming that real property in issue belonged to the estate of her late parents. On 22 September 1999 the District Court dismissed the claim. On 23 November 2001 the Trnava Regional Court quashed the first-instance judgment.
On 5 February 2003 the District Court allowed the applicant to join the proceedings as one of the plaintiffs.
On 2 October 2007 the District Court stayed the proceedings. On 30 January 2009 the Regional Court quashed that decision in part and ordered the District Court to proceed with the case in respect of one of the defendants.
On 16 April 2012 the applicant complained about the duration of the proceedings to the Constitutional Court. She claimed 3,000 euros (EUR) as just satisfaction and EUR 318.84 in reimbursement of her legal costs.
On 3 October 2012 the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had breached the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. There was no justification for the overall duration of the proceedings.
The Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction and legal costs. It noted that, between 28 May 2009 and 4 April 2012, it had delivered four judgments in which it had found a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in respect of nine other persons who were in the same position as the applicant in the above proceedings before the Trnava District Court (see paragraphs 14-15 below). In those four judgments, the Constitutional Court had granted the plaintiffs, who had been represented by the same lawyer as the applicant, the overall sum of EUR 18,000 as just satisfaction and EUR 1,609.85 for their legal costs.
The Constitutional Court expressed the view that the legal representative of the plaintiffs had chosen to submit separate complaints in order to earn money. Had all the persons concerned submitted a single constitutional complaint, the overall just satisfaction award would have certainly not attained the amount of EUR 18,000, and the costs granted would have been lower than the above sum. As a result, the share in just satisfaction to which the applicant might be entitled as one of the multiple parties to the proceedings had been “granted to and consumed by” the precedent successful plaintiffs before the Constitutional Court.
Subsequently the District Court took further evidence and heard the parties. A hearing scheduled for 6 March 2013 was adjourned to 15 July 2013 as the case had been assigned to a different judge. The documents submitted to the Court indicate that the proceedings are still pending.
Article 127 of the Constitution reads as follows:
“1. The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court.
If the Constitutional Court finds a complaint justified, it shall deliver a decision stating that a person’s rights or freedoms as set out in paragraph 1 have been violated by a final decision, specific measure or other act and shall quash that decision, measure or act. If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act, the Constitutional Court may order [the authority] which has violated the rights or freedoms to take the necessary action. At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order that authority to refrain from violating the fundamental rights and freedoms... or, where appropriate, order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation.
In its decision on a complaint the Constitutional Court may grant appropriate financial compensation to the person whose rights under paragraph 1 have been violated.” (...)
On 28 May 2009 the Constitutional Court found that in the same proceeding of which the applicant complains the District Court had breached the right of the applicant’s sister to a hearing within a reasonable time. It ordered the District Court to avoid further delays and granted EUR 3,000 to the plaintiff as just satisfaction (file no. IV. ÚS 120/09).
In three other judgments delivered on 21 September 2010, 19 October 2011 and 4 April 2012 (file numbers III. ÚS 348/09, IV. ÚS 359/2010 and IV. ÚS 62/2010) the Constitutional Court found a breach of the right to a hearing within the reasonable time in respect of eight other applicant’s co-plaintiffs. It granted each plaintiff EUR 1,500 (in proceedings file number III. ÚS 348/09) or EUR 2,000 (in the other two sets of proceedings) as just satisfaction and ordered the District Court to reimburse their costs. The Constitutional Court also referred to the fact that it had already ordered the District Court to avoid further delays in its judgment of 28 May 2009.
