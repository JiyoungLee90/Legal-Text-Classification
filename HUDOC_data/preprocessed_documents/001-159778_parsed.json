Since the right to a hearing within a reasonable time is a right guaranteed by the Constitution (see paragraph 50 above) and decisions adopted in the context of the proceedings instituted by requests under section 27 of the Courts Act (length-of-proceedings decisions) necessarily entail determination of that right, it would appear that those dissatisfied by such decisions are entitled to lodge constitutional complaints against them relying on section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act, regardless of whether or not that possibility was referred to also in section\u00a028 of the Courts Act (compare the text of what used to be paragraph\u00a03 of section 28 of the Courts Act before the entry into force of 2009 Amendments and the amended text of what became paragraph 5 of the same section, in paragraphs 53-54 above).

In particular, the Court notes that on 11 July 2012 the enforcement court had informed the Croatian Pension Fund that the writ of execution of 18\u00a0February 2003 had become final and ordered it to commence garnishment of 10% of the debtor\u2019s pension to which, on 21 September 2012, the Fund replied that it could not do so because 1/3, that is, allegedly, the statutory maximum, of the debtor\u2019s pension was already being garnished pursuant to another writ of execution obtained by the applicant (see paragraphs 33-35 above). However, the Court notes that the relevant enforcement legislation in force at the time allowed for garnishment of more than 1/3 of one\u2019s income if the claim sought to be enforced concerned statutory (child) maintenance (see paragraphs 57-59 above). Therefore, it would appear that by garnishing a larger portion of the debtor\u2019s pension the enforcement could have been completed earlier than 12\u00a0November 2014.",
