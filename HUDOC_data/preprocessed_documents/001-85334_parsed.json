He also stated that he had had to use a bucket for his sanitary needs, the contents of which had been thrown away each morning and evening. The Court considers that subjecting a detainee to the embarrassment of having to relieve himself in a bucket in the presence of his cellmates and of being present while the same bucket was being used by them (see Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2001III; I.I. v. Bulgaria, no. 44082/98, \u00a7 75, 9 June 2005; Kalashnikov, \u00a7 99; and Kehayov, \u00a7 71, both cited above) cannot be deemed warranted, except in specific situations where allowing visits to the sanitary facilities would pose concrete and serious security risks. In so far as the Government failed to submit observations on the admissibility and merits of this complaint, no such risks have been invoked as grounds for the limitation on the visits to the toilet by the detainees in the Pazardzhik Regional Investigation Service detention facility during the period in question.",

The Court considers that the fact that the applicant was confined to his cell for more than two-and-a-half months practically twenty-four hours a day without sufficient exposure to natural light and without any possibility for physical and other out-of-cell activities must have caused him considerable suffering.
