Some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable, and often inevitable, in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities. However, the national authorities must attempt to keep this to a minimum. It is for the Contracting States to organise their systems in such a way that their authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivation of liberty (see Ruslan Yakovenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a05425/11, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2015 with further references). As the Government have submitted elsewhere, as a matter of domestic law the right to liberty is recognised as being of ancient origin and the burden is on the person who has detained another to show that he had lawful authority to do so: the responsibility lay with the Government to ensure that the detention was (and remained) lawful (see S.M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 77450/12, \u00a7\u00a085, 22\u00a0June 2017). In this connection, the Court takes account of the applicant\u2019s \u2018worryingly long\u2019 detention and her vulnerability as someone suffering from mental health problems, and that both these elements of her situation must have been known by the relevant authorities.",

The Court observes that the Supreme Court found this concession was probably realistic but it considers equally that it is not possible to know when the applicant would have been released had the detention reviews been correctly conducted and the appropriate arrangements for her release made in light of the obligation identified above. In this respect, the circumstances of the period of unlawful detention in the present case are different from those examined in its previous judgment concerning the applicant, where the Court of Appeal had reassessed all the evidence in the case and had concluded that the applicant could have been detained lawfully during the relevant period (see V.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 45). What can be said in the present case is that the applicant was unlawfully detained from 4 March 2011 to 6 July 2011 due to the deficiencies in her detention reviews; the need to redress that unlawfulness was not lessened because the State did not make appropriate arrangements for her release during that period.",
