Further, many such prisoners were subject to special restrictions likely to exacerbate the deleterious effects inherent in long-term imprisonment; examples of such restrictions are permanent separation from the rest of the prison population, handcuffing whenever the prisoner is taken out of his cell, prohibition of communication with other prisoners, and limited visit entitlements.

Additional steps should be taken to lend meaning to their period of imprisonment; in particular, the provision of individualised custody plans and appropriate psycho-social support are important elements in assisting such prisoners to come to terms with their period of incarceration and, when the time comes, to prepare for release. Further, the negative effects of institutionalisation upon prisoners serving long sentences will be less pronounced, and they will be better equipped for release, if they are able effectively to maintain contact with the outside world.\u201d",

As regards the specific restrictions imposed by the Prison Rules which were not expressly mentioned in the Enforcement of Sentences Code (the number of persons allowed to be present simultaneously during prison visits and the manner of permitted communication), those were further restrictions aimed at organising the family visits from the practical point of view. The Prison Rules were adopted by the State Department for the Enforcement of Sentences, which was acting within its discretionary powers, and their lawfulness was reviewed by the Ministry of Justice (see paragraph 29). Having reviewed the Prison Rules, the Ministry of Justice concluded that the restrictions introduced thereby were not in conflict with any superior provisions of domestic law. It is true that the administrative courts are generally empowered to review the proportionality of an act complained of (Articles 2 and 17 of the Code of Administrative Justice) and they are governed by the principle of the rule of law as interpreted by the Court (Article 8 of the Code of Administrative Justice). Still, these powers have not been sufficiently tested in cases where the administrative courts are expected to assess the proportionality (and not the legality) of a normative act which has been adopted within the discretionary powers of a regulatory body. The Government have not supplied any comparable examples from the domestic jurisprudence suggesting that a prisoner would have any prospect of success in challenging the proportionality of secondary legislation adopted within a regulatory body\u2019s discretionary power which did not conflict with any superior law (as earlier established by the Ministry of Justice), and that such a judicial action would offer appropriate individual redress.",

(no. 2), no. 25498/94, \u00a7\u00a7 62-74, ECHR 2000X). Meanwhile, in the present case the relevant provisions of domestic law introduced automatic restrictions on frequency and length of visits for all life prisoners and did not offer any degree of flexibility for determining whether such severe limitations were appropriate or indeed necessary in each individual case even though they were applied to prisoners sentenced to the highest penalty under the criminal law. The Court considers that regulation of such issues may not amount to inflexible restrictions and the States are expected to develop their proportionality assessment technique enabling the authorities to balance the competing individual and public interests and to take into account peculiarities of each individual case (see, mutatis mutandis, Dickson v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7\u00a7 82-85, ECHR 2007V).",

In this context, \u201cpressure\u201d includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation, but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention complaint (see Visloguzov v.

Romania, no. 38565/97, \u00a7\u00a071, 3 June 2003). It has emphasised the importance of respecting the confidentiality of the Court\u2019s correspondence with the applicants since it may concern allegations against prison authorities or prison officials. The opening of letters from the Court or addressed to it undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that they will be read, and may conceivably, on occasion, also create the risk of reprisals by prison staff against the prisoner concerned (see Klyakhin v. Russia, no. 46082/99, \u00a7 118, 30 November 2004; Mechenkov v. Russia, no. 35421/05, \u00a7 123, 7 February 2008; and Ponushkov v. Russia, no. 30209/04, \u00a7 80, 6 November 2008).",

In this regard the Court notes that the first page of one of the applicant\u2019s letters to the Court had been stamped by the detention facility. Moreover, up to October 2006 the applicant\u2019s submissions to the Court were accompanied by covering letters from the detention facility briefly summarising the nature of the correspondence dispatched. These facts suggest that at least part of the applicant\u2019s communication with the Court was subject to monitoring by the officers of the detention facility. Given that in his letters to the Court the applicant raised issues concerning his ongoing imprisonment in that facility, his fears as to possible negative repercussions on account of the application to the Court do not appear to be devoid of any foundation. In sum, the circumstances of the case do not suggest that the applicant\u2019s right to free and confidential communication with the Court was ensured by the authorities.",
