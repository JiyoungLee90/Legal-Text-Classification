In response to an additional question from the Court as to whether there existed a specific remedy by which to complain about the conditions in which foreigners were detained, the Government reiterated that the applicants could have submitted a complaint to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office on the basis of section\u00a015 of the Law on the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, section\u00a056 of the Immigration Law or section 1\u00a0and\u00a08 of the Law on Enquiries (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d above).

As confirmed by the Court\u2019s case-law no legislative instrument at the material time provided for an explicit procedure whereby detainees, including foreigners, could complain about the conditions of their detention (see Kadi\u0137is v.

On the contrary, the Court observes that on the same day the first applicant was authorised to visit an office of the public notary in  where he issued a general power of attorney in favour of his daughter (see paragraph 47 above). This may imply that, if the applicants had wished to, they would also have been taken to their former place of residence.

In this connection the Court refers to its well-established case-law to the effect that while lawful detention by its nature imposes limitations on private and family life, it is an essential part of prisoners\u2019 right to respect for family life that prison authorities assist them in maintaining effective contact with close family members (see Farrell v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a09013/80, Commission decision of 11\u00a0December\u00a01982, Decisions and Reports (DR) 30, p. 96, and, more recently, Messina v.  (no. 2), no.\u00a025498/94, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2000X). As a consequence the Court normally applies Article 8 in examining complaints of alleged interferences with detainees\u2019 rights to establish and develop relationships with other persons (see X v. Iceland, no.\u00a06825/74, Commission decision of 18\u00a0May\u00a01976, DR\u00a05, p. 86). It may nevertheless happen that the circumstances relating to complaints of infringements of the right to respect for private and family life are closely linked to other complaints concerning detention conditions, such as overcrowding and poor hygiene and sanitary conditions. Therefore, in the present case the Court will take into consideration all the circumstances as a whole in order to assess whether the ill-treatment complained of attained the minimum level of severity prohibited under Article 3 of the Convention. The Court will accordingly examine this part of the complaint under Article\u00a03.",

Neither the size of the cell nor its furnishings and sanitary facilities can be considered incompatible with the requirements enshrined in Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 41 above). The fact that the cell contained properly partitioned sanitary facilities cannot as such raise a problem, especially as the applicants have not complained about the height of the partition. These circumstances must, nevertheless, be examined in conjunction with the applicants\u2019 complaints that the cell was poorly ventilated and that they were not allowed to have regular outside walks. The Court has not been able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the ventilation did not function properly (see paragraph 76 above). However, it has established that at the material time no particular measures were taken to organise outside walks (see paragraph 77 above), despite the fact that the State Border Guard Service detention unit had adequate facilities for such activities. The Court nevertheless observes that in the particular circumstances of the case this shortcoming does not reach the level of severity enshrined by Article 3 of the Convention and that the applicants could maintain regular contacts with other persons, including their family members (contrary to, for example, the situation in Poltoratskiy v. , no. 38812/97, \u00a7 145, ECHR 2003V).",

As noted above, the Court has established that for two periods, neither of which exceeded twenty-four hours, another person was placed in the applicants\u2019 cell (see paragraphs 30, 32 and 78 above). At the outset, the Court is satisfied that from the beginning of their detention the authorities of the State Border Guard Service made arrangements to protect the applicants\u2019 family unity by placing them together in a separate cell. It considers that, once family unity has been ensured, it should be preserved, given the practical demands of detention. In this connection the Court notes that on two occasions the authorities were forced by unforeseen circumstances to temporarily put another person in the applicants\u2019 cell. The Court does not find any indication that such placements were intended to humiliate the applicants or to arouse feelings of discomfort in them. The Court further notes that the above-mentioned circumstances were not aggravated by other physical conditions of detention. In particular, as concerns the first instance when a woman was placed in the applicants\u2019 cell, the Court observes that the cell was designed and equipped for four persons. In the other instance, in order to protect the applicants\u2019 family unity they were transferred to a cell designed for two persons, but it has to be noted that such circumstances persisted for less than twenty-four hours.",

According to the records of the detention unit, the applicants were provided with tableware in the cell (see paragraph 28 above) and there are no indications that there were any obstacles impeding them from storing the food in their cell until later. Nevertheless, the Court has established that on the day of the applicants\u2019 deportation they were provided only with breakfast and lunch (see paragraph 81 above). In contrast to such cases as Moisejevs v. Latvia (no. 64846/01, \u00a7\u00a080, 15\u00a0June 2006), where the detainee was regularly deprived of proper food at the end of the day, and Jeronovi\u010ds v. Latvia (no. 547/02, \u00a7\u00a038, 1 December 2009), in which the detainee suffered from hunger for a period of more than twenty-seven hours, in the instant case the Court notes that, with the exception of the relatively short period mentioned above, the applicants were not in an especially vulnerable situation. According to their own submissions, at 9\u00a0p.m. on the day of their deportation they took a train in an ordinary carriage, where they were not subjected to any restrictions or limitations similar to those imposed on persons held in custody. In this connection the Court notes that, according to the records, the applicants confirmed that at the time of their release from the detention unit they received their belongings, including money, a fact which therefore casts doubt on their allegation that on the day of their deportation they had no means of subsistence (see paragraph 49 above). Besides, it has not been established that the applicants were prevented from returning to their previous place of residence in order to take any belongings they considered necessary (see paragraph 82 above).",

Even though that case concerned the removal of a failed asylum seeker and not aliens who had overstayed a residence permit, as in the present case,\u00a0the applicable removal procedures were the same (see Longa Yonkeu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138).",

Under the first of them, the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs was authorised to issue an order to leave, followed by a deportation order if an alien did not comply voluntarily with the order to leave. Under the second procedure, the same authority was authorised to issue a deportation order if an alien had been detained by the State Border Guard Service for having infringed the rules of entry into and residence in the country (ibid., \u00a7 139). In respect of Mr Longa Yonkeu, another removal procedure than that expressly provided for in the Immigration Law\u00a0had initially been applied, with the result that the legal grounds for his detention with a view to his deportation fell short of the \u201cquality of law\u201d standard required under the Convention (ibid., \u00a7140). Later on, however, the domestic authorities chose the second removal procedure, which was expressly laid down in the Immigration Law; it was sufficiently clear and precise: if an alien was detained for having infringed the rules on residence in the country, he or she faced deportation (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0142).",

On 3 September 2003 the applicants were detained and the records of their detention referred to their failure to comply with the order of 23 May 2000, which had led to an infringement of the rules regulating residence in the . Section 51(1)(1) of the Immigration Law served as a legal basis for detention for a maximum period of ten days, the constitutionality of which had not been challenged by the applicants. The Court notes that in the present case the applicants were given ample opportunities to comply voluntarily with the order to leave and that the authorities extended the time-limit within which the applicants had to leave the country (see paragraph 18 above). Following persistent non-compliance with the orders, they were detained on the legal grounds set out in the Immigration Law which, as the Court has previously recognised, was sufficiently precise in this respect (see paragraph 102 above).",
