Detention for over forty-eight hours was permitted only on the basis of a court order and provided that the administrative removal could not be effected otherwise. The court order was necessary to guarantee protection not only from arbitrary detention of over forty-eight hours, but also from arbitrary detention as such, while the court assessed the lawfulness of and reasons for the placement of the person in custody. The Constitutional Court further noted that detention for an indefinite term would amount to an inadmissible restriction on the right to liberty as it would constitute punishment not provided for in Russian law and which was contrary to the Constitution.",

Extradition may also be refused if exceptional circumstances disclose that it may entail a danger to the person\u2019s life and health on account of, among other things, his or her age or physical condition. Russian authorities dealing with an extradition case should examine whether there are reasons to believe that the person concerned may be sentenced to the death penalty, subjected to ill-treatment or persecuted because of his race, religious beliefs, nationality, ethnic or social origin or political opinions. The Supreme Court further stated that the courts should assess both the general situation in the requesting country and the personal circumstances of a person whose extradition is being sought. They should take into account the testimony of the person concerned and that of any witnesses, any assurances given by the requesting country, and information about the country provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, competent United Nations agencies and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.",

No evidence has been presented by the Government to demonstrate that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office made any effort to evaluate the risks of extradition to the country where, according to reputable international sources, the use of torture is commonplace and defence rights are routinely circumvented. Furthermore, the Prosecutor General\u2019s unqualified reliance on the assurances provided by the Uzbek authorities was at variance with the Court\u2019s established position that in themselves these assurances are not sufficient and that the national authorities need to treat with caution the assurances against torture given by a State where torture is endemic or persistent (see Yuldashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01248/09, \u00a7\u00a085, 8 July 2010, with further references).

On the first point, the Court reiterates that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, the domestic authorities\u2019 findings as regards the failure to apply for refugee status in due time did not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention (see Ermakov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 43165/10, \u00a7 196, 7 November 2013). On the second point, the Court emphasises that the criteria that are laid down for granting refugee status are not identical to those that are used for assessment of the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant made detailed submissions about the risk of his being subjected to ill-treatment if he were returned to his home country, relying on information from various international organisations and on the judgments of this Court. However, the domestic decisions only mentioned those submissions in passing and did not analyse them in any detail.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that, in view of the absolute nature of Article 3, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a091, 22\u00a0September 2009).

Nevertheless, they had not reacted anyhow until the moment of his release due to the expiry of the time-limit for extradition arrest. As the extradition order had been given shortly before the time-limit, the applicant\u2019s release was likely to be considered as a threat to the execution of the extradition order. Hence, the authorities abused their power to order his detention pending expulsion since the real objective of ordering it was to secure his further stay in custody under the authorities\u2019 control in order to organise his return to Uzbekistan. Finally, the applicant submitted that the legal provisions governing this type of detention did not set the maximum time-limit for detention pending expulsion and that in practice such detention could last up to two years which was much longer than the maximum term of penalty for an administrative offence.",

The notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention.

Belgium, no.\u00a051564/99, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2002I, and Bozano v.\u00a0France, 18\u00a0December 1986, Series A no.\u00a0111, \u00a7 60). The Court reiterates that in Azimov, it found that a decision ordering the applicant\u2019s detention pending expulsion had served to circumvent the maximum time-limits laid down in the domestic law for detention pending extradition and that there was evidence of a recurrent practice of Russian authorities to use the expulsion procedure instead of extradition (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0165). The applicant\u2019s situation was substantially similar to that of Mr Azimov: the maximum time-limit authorised under the Russian law in the extradition proceedings expired five days after the extradition request had been granted and his further detention in the framework of the extradition proceedings was legally impossible (see, by contrast, Akram Karimov, cited above, \u00a7 182, in which the extradition request had been refused and the Court found that the order could not possibly have served to circumvent the maximum time-limit for detention pending extradition). Having regard to further evidence which the applicant\u2019s submitted in support of his claim of an administrative practice of substituting expulsion for extradition, such as the unpublished order of the Moscow Region prosecutor, no. 86/81 of 3 July 2009, the existence and content of which the Government did not dispute \n(see paragraph 28 above), the Court considers it plausible that the new ground for detention (the expulsion decision) was cited primarily to circumvent the requirements of the domestic law which set a maximum time-limit for the extradition detention. The Court reiterates in this respect \u201cdetention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith\u201d and \u201cmust be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government\u201d (see Rustamov, cited above, \u00a7 150). It appears that those two conditions have not been met in the present case, at least during the period when the applicant\u2019s extradition proceedings were still pending, and probably even after they were over (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7 165).",

Russia, no.\u00a055822/10, \u00a7\u00a0162, 5 June 2012). In the present case the applicant had already been in detention with a view to extradition for six months before the authorities ordered his detention pending expulsion. His detention pending expulsion has lasted thus far for almost one year. When deciding to keep the applicant in custody pending expulsion, the courts did not set a specific time-limit for his detention. Under Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, an expulsion decision must be enforced within two years. After the expiry of such a period, a detainee should be released. This may happen in the present case; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences for the applicant\u2019s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting the duration of the detention of an illegal alien is not set out clearly in the law. It is also unclear what will happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Egamberdiyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062, and Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171).",
