A relevant decision must therefore be supported by sufficiently sound and weighty considerations in the interests of the child, and it is for the respondent State to establish that a careful assessment of the impact of the proposed care measure on the parents and the child has been made (see, for example, Scozzari and Giunta v.

Germany, no.\u00a011057/02, \u00a7\u00a099, ECHR 2004III (extracts)). In taking a decision on removal of a child, a variety of factors may be pertinent, such as whether by virtue of remaining in the care of its parents the child would suffer abuse or neglect, educational deficiencies and lack of emotional support, or whether the child\u2019s placement in public care is necessitated by the state of its physical or mental health (see Wallov\u00e1 and Walla v. the , no.\u00a023848/04, \u00a7\u00a072, 26 October 2006 and Havelka and Others v. the , no.\u00a023499/06, \u00a7\u00a057, 21\u00a0June 2007). On the other hand, the mere fact that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his or her upbringing does not on its own justify a compulsory measure of removal (see, for example, K.A. v. Finland, no.27751/95, \u00a7 92 ECHR 2003-I). Neither can this measure be justified by a mere reference to the parents\u2019 precarious situation, which can be addressed by less radical means than the splitting of the family, such as targeted financial assistance and social counselling (see, for example, Moser v. , no.\u00a012643/02, \u00a7\u00a068, 21\u00a0September 2006; Wallov\u00e1 and Walla, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073-76; and Havelka and others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).",

Further, a number of specific conclusions (such as that the children lacked proper nutrition, were dressed inappropriately and were often left home alone) were based solely on the submissions by the municipal authorities, drawn from their occasional inspections of the applicants\u2019 dwelling. No other corroborating evidence, such as the children\u2019s own views, their medical files, opinions by their paediatricians or statements by neighbours had been examined. In fact, the only objective evidence in support of the finding about the children\u2019s inadequate state of health, to which the trial court referred in its decision, was a medical certificate dated a year earlier, attesting that O.S. and K.S. had been placed on record for first-stage anaemia, the accuracy of which, challenged by the applicants, was not verified. Similarly, as regards the failure of the applicants to ensure proper educational and social adaptation of their children, the courts referred primarily to the submissions by the municipal authorities that O.S. had been seen wandering and begging, but no reference to the dates, frequency, names of the witnesses or other relevant circumstances was solicited.",

In connection with the financial difficulties, it is not the Court\u2019s role to determine whether the promotion of family unity in the case entitled the applicants\u2019 family to a particular standard of living at public expense.

Similarly, in the courts\u2019 reasoning, no analysis was made of the applicants\u2019 attempts to improve their situation, such as requests to equip their flat with access to natural gas, recoup salary arrears or request employment assistance. On the contrary, the courts appear to have taken on trust the submissions by the municipal authorities that the applicants had failed to improve their living conditions and attitudes in spite of financial and other support as well as necessary counselling. Beyond the descriptive findings of the inspection reports, repeatedly pointing to the same problems, such as a rotting baby\u2019s mattress, no data was sought as regards the actual volume and sufficiency of social assistance or the substance of specific recommendations provided by way of counselling and explanations as to why these recommendations had failed.
