The Government partially accounted for the delay, submitting that between 5\u00a0December 2001 and 31\u00a0March 2003 the number of judges assigned to the  had been insufficient. In this regard the Court reiterates that it is for Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision within a reasonable time (see, for instance, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7 21, 3\u00a0October 2000). Therefore, the delays resulting from the understaffing of the  are imputable to the State. Furthermore, the Government's explanation accounted only in part for the four-year interruption in the proceedings. They did not furnish any explanation as to the two-year and one-year periods of the trial court's inactivity which occurred between December 1999 and December 2001 and between 31\u00a0March 2003 and 14\u00a0April 2004 respectively.",
