Five months later, the two police officers accused of physically assaulting the applicant were heard. Their statements were taken by a police officer in charge of internal affairs within the Arad County Police. There is no indication in the case file as to whether they were ever heard by a prosecutor. Statements from three additional witnesses, all police officers, were taken another month later, also by the internal affairs officer. Hence, the Court notes that the two officers accused in the case were heard for the first time nine months after the submission of the complaint against them. Also, three other police officers were asked to testify as witnesses ten months after the alleged incident. The Court considers that, in view of the importance of time in determining the exact circumstances of the two allegedly violent incidents of 8 August 2010, the authorities\u2019 delayed reaction casts doubts as to how thoroughly and effectively they investigated the case (see \u015eerc\u0103u, cited above, \u00a7 88).",
