At the same time, this rule must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. The Court has already held on a number of occasions that this rule is neither absolute nor applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to take into account the circumstances of the individual case (see\u00a0Akdivar and Others v. Turkey [GC], 16 September 1996, \u00a7 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 IV, and Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey, 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053-54, Reports 1996-VI). In particular, the Court looks into whether the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected in order to exhaust available domestic remedies (see Merit v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a066561/01, \u00a7\u00a058, 30 March 2004).",

Latvia, no.\u00a045744/08, \u00a7\u00a050, 21\u00a0December 2010).

Once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Akdivar, cited above, \u00a7 68, and Kryvenkyy v.

It was clearly not the sole and certainly not the primary body involved. The key role belonged to the Bailiffs\u2019 Service and the bailiff who was in charge of the respective enforcement proceedings and contracted company M. to hold the auction (see paragraph 8 above). According to Article 4 of the Law of Ukraine \u201cOn the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service\u201d, the bailiffs are civil servants and represent the State power (see paragraph 21 below); therefore, bailiff D. did not act in a personal capacity but represented the State authority. Furthermore, his actions were found unlawful in the ensuing criminal proceedings and the gravity of the sanction applicable to him was directly linked, inter alia, to the cost of the shed (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).
