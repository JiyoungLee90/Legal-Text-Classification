It claimed that Judge N., who had been one of the five judges sitting on the Supreme Court\u2019s panel, had been biased because he had himself purchased shares in IF whose value had dropped, following advice by the A.\u00a0company. Moreover, Judge\u00a0N. had previously declared himself biased in comparable cases concerning the purchase of shares in IF. The Supreme Court had accepted Judge N.\u2019s withdrawal from all these cases. According to the respective decisions, Judge\u00a0N. had even considered filing an action on account of the losses he had suffered due to his acquisition of the shares, with the applicant company being one of the parties against whom such an action might potentially be introduced. He had thus been subjectively and objectively biased, which constituted a reason for challenge under section\u00a019 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Act on Exercise of Jurisdiction (Jurisdiktionsnorm) (see paragraph\u00a021 below). As Judge\u00a0N. had not withdrawn from the case at hand, there had been a breach of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

In 2009 Judge\u00a0N. had offered his shares to a litigation funder (Prozessfinanzierer) in order to introduce possible actions against IF or other persons and entities involved. For this reason Judge\u00a0N., even though he had not considered himself personally biased, had withdrawn from at least two cases concerning IF shares (see the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions of 14\u00a0May 2010, 9\u00a0Nc\u00a013/10a, and of 26\u00a0November 2012, 9\u00a0Nc\u00a038/12f).

In contrast, bias of a judge (referring to its decision of 13\u00a0November 2013, 7\u00a0Nc\u00a019/13y, see paragraph 20 below) did not constitute a ground for nullity. The Supreme Court pointed out that it had recently held, in a case concerning arbitration law, that only in particularly grave cases, where the reason for challenge came close to a reason for exclusion under section\u00a020 of the Act on Exercise of Jurisdiction, could an exception be made (see paragraph 27 below). In the present case, however, no such particularly grave reason had been shown, since the participation of a judge who had in the past considered filing an action against one of the parties to the proceedings was not comparable to a ground enumerated in section\u00a020 of the Act on Exercise of Jurisdiction (see paragraph\u00a021 below). Lastly, the Supreme Court held that no issues arose under Article\u00a06 of the Convention.",

Judges were legally obliged to report any reasons that might justify fear of bias, without any delay.

According to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law, a party was obliged to raise a possible reason for bias as soon as it had actually become aware of it and not when it ought to have become aware of it (see paragraph\u00a022 above); knowledge of the court\u2019s rules on the distribution of cases was explicitly not required. It further explained that, unlike in other cases where the Supreme Court itself decided on the admissibility of an appeal before issuing a decision on the merits (see paragraph 19 above), no prior decision had been taken by the Supreme Court in the present case since the lower instance had already granted the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law.

Thus, the complaint to be submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits (see Micallef v.\u00a0Malta [GC], no.\u00a017056/06, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2009, with further references). Nevertheless, the only remedies that must be exhausted are those that are effective and capable of redressing the alleged violation. More specifically, the only remedies which Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient; the existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. It falls to the respondent State, if it pleads nonexhaustion of domestic remedies, to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see, for example, Paksas v.\u00a0Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7\u00a075, ECHR 2011 (extracts) with further references).",

The Court thus fails to see how the applicant company could have challenged Judge\u00a0N. for bias according to section\u00a019 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Act on Exercise of Jurisdiction in practical terms. Furthermore, it considers that requiring the applicant company to make enquiries with the Supreme Court\u2019s registry in order to find out the composition of the respective Supreme Court panel that was to sit on its case, as suggested by the Government, was not provided by law and could not be deemed reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The Government have not shown that these steps were commonly used by parties to Supreme Court proceedings or that domestic caselaw required such conduct from parties who may challenge a judge for bias in due time (compare paragraph 23 above). Furthermore, the Court notes that there is a general legal provision, section\u00a022 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Courts Act, which requests judges to report reasons that may justify a withdrawal or challenge on the grounds of fear of bias of their own motion (see paragraph\u00a024 above), (see also Pescador Valero v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a062435/00, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2003VII). In this context, the Court further observes that Judge\u00a0N. had in fact withdrawn of his own motion in previous comparable cases (see paragraph 17 above), so that it could have reasonably be assumed that Judge\u00a0N. would report his possible incompatibility on the grounds of fear of bias in the present case as well. Lastly, the Court notes that in another case, where the Supreme Court interacted with the parties prior to the delivery of its judgment and where the applicant company thus had prior knowledge of the respective case\u2019s file number, the applicant company did \u2013 successfully \u2013 exercise its right to challenge Judge\u00a0N. for bias in due time (see paragraph 19 above). In view of the above considerations, the Court concludes that in the circumstances of the case the applicant company cannot be reproached for not having challenged Judge\u00a0N. before the Supreme Court delivered its judgment and that the applicant company lacked the necessary knowledge unequivocally to waive its right under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see also Golubovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a043947/10, \u00a7\u00a039, 27\u00a0November 2012).",

However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2005XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075).",
