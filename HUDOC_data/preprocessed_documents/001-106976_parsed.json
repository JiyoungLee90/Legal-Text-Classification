In interviews before the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) on 5\u00a0November 2003 and 11 March 2004 the applicant stated that he was ethnic Hazara, Shia Muslim and born and raised in a small community consisting of approximately thirty-five families in the province of Ghazni. He had never been to school and was illiterate. He claimed that his problems emanated from the fact that his father was of Hazara ethnicity and his mother was of Pashtun ethnicity. As a child of mixed ethnicity, he had not been allowed to play with other children as they had been unkind to him. Since it had not been possible to leave him alone, he had always been with his father at his store in the nearest city. When the Taliban had taken power in the province, they had frequently come to the store and taken food without paying, for which reason other people in the city had believed that the family sympathised with the Taliban. The fact that his mother was Pashtun had reinforced this view. Moreover, his father had inherited everything from his grandfather, despite there being an older uncle, as the latter had been disowned due to bad behaviour. The uncle had then become very hostile to the applicant and his family. After the fall of the Taliban, the applicant\u2019s situation had worsened as other villagers looked upon the applicant and his parents as traitors. He had been assaulted and severely beaten on several occasions and twice he had lost consciousness. They had also broken his nose and cut him with a knife. During the summer of 2003 he had been kidnapped twice and ill-treated. The first time he was locked up in a cellar for one day, and some months later he was held prisoner for two days. Each time he had been released when his father had paid a large amount of money. His father had been advised by his business partner to move but he had refused as he thought things would get better over time. Moreover, the applicant did not know if his mother had any relatives as she had never mentioned any, but they could not have moved to her home town since she had married a man from another ethnic group.",

His father\u2019s business partner had helped him to leave the country and he had had contact with no one since he left.

It found that the general situation in Afghanistan was not such that the applicant could be granted leave to remain in  on this sole ground. Turning to the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, the Board observed that it had found no evidence that persons of mixed ethnicities faced specific problems in . According to the applicant\u2019s own account, ethnicity was passed down by the father, for which reason the applicant was considered a Hazara. Thus, the Board did not believe that the applicant had faced such discrimination as claimed because of his mixed ethnicity. Moreover, it noted that, again according to the applicant, everyone in his village had tried to get along with the Taliban and had paid to be well treated by them. Therefore the Board was not convinced that the applicant and his family had been suspected of being collaborators with the Taliban and ill-treated on this ground. The Board further questioned the claim that the applicant had no relatives other than his uncle, having regard to the very strong family ties in Afghan culture. In any event, his father\u2019s business partner was still there and had shown a friendly and supportive attitude to the applicant and his family. Consequently, the Board concluded that the applicant had a social network in  which made it possible for him to return. Since there was no other reason to grant the applicant leave to remain in , his application was rejected.",

Moreover, the suspicion that they had collaborated with the Taliban was also based on the fact that his mother was Pashtun and that the Taliban had not touched their home. The family\u2019s poor reputation had then been used against them by his uncle. His mother had no contact with her family since she had married outside her ethnicity. Moreover, his father\u2019s business partner had become wealthy thanks to the applicant\u2019s father and therefore had owed him a favour. In any event, it was money from their business which had paid for the applicant\u2019s trip.",

It pointed out that the estranged wife was afraid of the applicant and therefore still lived at a secret address. The children had not seen their father since August 2007 and the mother would only take part in visits if a contact person were present. An expulsion would most likely mean that the children would not have any contact with their father during the expulsion period. Generally, children needed close and good contact with both their parents. However, the courts and the social services also had to take into account the risk of children being subjected to violence, abuse, abduction, etc. Having regard to the crimes at issue, the overall assessment was therefore that the children\u2019s need for contact with their father, if convicted, should be balanced against the risk of their being subjected to, or becoming witness to, violence or other degrading treatment during access.",

The social welfare board had also met the children at their home in March 2008, and spoken to the children\u2019s nursery school and to a deaconess involved in the case. In addition, they had had access to relevant written material such as the first instance criminal judgment against the applicant and the examination conducted by the forensic psychiatrist. The report stated that in view of the applicant\u2019s abuse of his estranged wife and the fact that he had probably also physically abused his daughter, there was a high risk that the children would be harmed if the applicant were to have custody of them. The children were very young when they last had contact with the applicant and they would have no memories of their father that they could express in words. Their need for a relationship with their father would increase when they became older. Access between them and the applicant would involve an increased risk that their secret address would become known to him. This risk should be balanced against the fact that the applicant had subjected his family to abuse and that he would probably be expelled upon release from prison. Thus, it was advised that he should not have access to the children. In order to meet the children\u2019s need for contact with their origins, it was noted that such could be accommodated through letters. The social welfare board could distribute letters from the applicant to the children via the estranged wife, who in turn could reply within a month to report on the children\u2019s development.",

In general young children were directly affected by how their mother was treated and it was therefore very likely that the applicant\u2019s daughter would experience bad memories if she had to see the applicant.

Moreover, the applicant was now in prison, from where he would only be able to have very restricted access to his children. Furthermore, even if the children were able to create a safe relationship with the applicant during such limited access, the applicant would subsequently be expelled and therefore separated from his children until May 2013.

The Taliban perceived from this that his father was dissociating himself from his religion. They tried to capture him but he went into hiding. The applicant was captured instead and imprisoned. He was illtreated for thirty-five days, which included beating and being stabbed in the back with a knife, to get him to reveal his father\u2019s hiding place, which he refused. His father paid a large ransom for his release after thirty-five days and the applicant was admitted to hospital for over a month. A few weeks later he went with his father to the mosque, where they were captured by the Hazaras who told the applicant that he was not a Shia Muslim since his father was married to a Pashtun. They wanted him to prove his loyalty to the Shia by walking on burning coals. When he refused, they stabbed him in the shoulder. He walked on the coals and suffered serious burns to his feet. He was left alone and his father came in disguise in the middle of the night to pick him up. His father had to carry him home, where he was treated for his injuries. About a week later, he and his father went to the mosque again and there the others decided that his father should kill him and his mother, which his father refused. Then it was decided that the whole family should die and one of his father\u2019s friends warned them of this. The applicant was twenty-one at the time. He and his parents woke up in the middle of the night to find that the house was on fire and that people were trying to get in through the window. His father fetched a weapon and his mother opened a hatch to an escape tunnel under the house. Before jumping down he saw his mother being injured. They threw down money to him and closed the hatch. He had no choice but to crawl out through the tunnel. He stood and watched while the house burned down and then went to the home of one of his father\u2019s friends who lived in another city.

He added that he had not been in contact with his country of origin since he left but knew that his father\u2019s business partner, who had helped him escape, had been killed. Since his parents had been killed and he himself had been tortured by the Taliban, his life was in great danger. He also risked being killed upon return to Afghanistan for having married a Sunni Muslim woman although he was a Shia and for having violated a Sunni Muslim woman in the acts for which he had been convicted in . Invoking anew his poor mental health, the applicant submitted some medical certificates. One certificate was dated 16\u00a0February 2009 and written by a physician at the prison. It stated that the applicant had alleged that he had been imprisoned and tortured on several occasions in  and that the physician had seen a large number of scars on his back from cuts. He also had two scars from stab wounds to his thigh and his shin. The physician confirmed that the scars might have been caused by torture as alleged by the applicant. A second medical certificate was dated 17 April 2009 and written by a chief physician and specialist in psychiatry, and by a psychologist at the Medical Centre for Refugees. It stated that the certificate was based on the applicant\u2019s contacts with the Centre from October 2005 to October 2008. He had begun psychotherapy at the Centre in October 2005 to talk about his background and traumatic experiences. The physicians had considered that he was clearly traumatised and had several symptoms of PTSD such as nightmares, flashbacks and anxiety. However, the applicant had been found stable in May 2006 for which reason the sessions had ended. In August 2007 the applicant had contacted the physicians again because he had been feeling unwell. When he had been arrested on suspicion of raping B., he had been placed in a cell and had experienced strong flashbacks from when he had been kidnapped and tortured for one month in . He had been so desperate that he had cut his wrists with a table knife and had then spent one night in the psychiatric emergency department. He had then resumed his sessions with the psychologist and had received medication to help him sleep. However, he had overdosed on the medication in October 2007 due to the strain caused by the criminal trial against him. His last session had been in April\u00a02008, before being imprisoned, and after the judgment he had again tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of pills. According to the two physicians, the applicant suffered from PTSD, depression, anxiety and had a serious stress reaction to his situation. He was therefore in a very fragile state mentally, with a high risk of suicide if the expulsion order were to be enforced. Thus, they concluded that there were medical-psychiatric impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order.",

The Migration Board observed that it had found no evidence that persons of mixed ethnicities faced specific problems in  and the Board did not believe that the applicant had faced such discrimination as claimed because of his mixed ethnicity. Moreover, the Board noted that, according to the applicant, everyone in his village had tried to get along with the Taliban and had paid to be well treated by them. Therefore the Board was not convinced that the applicant and his family had been suspected of being collaborators with the Taliban and ill-treated on that ground. The Board further questioned the claim that the applicant had no relatives other than his uncle, having regard to the very strong family ties in the Afghan culture. In any event, his father\u2019s business partner was still there and had shown a friendly and supportive attitude to the applicant and his family. Consequently, the Board concluded that the applicant had a social network in  which made it possible for him to return. Since there was no other reason to grant the applicant leave to remain in , his application was rejected. On appeal, the Aliens Appeals Board noted that at the relevant time, the U.S. Coalition Forces had established a military base in Ghazni to stabilise the area. Against this background, and for the reasons set out in the Migration Board\u2019s decision, it found it unsubstantiated that the applicant would risk persecution upon return.",

Moreover, Article\u00a03 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight alternative in their assessment of an individual\u2019s claim that a return to his or her country of origin would expose him or her to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 98, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V and Hilal v. the , no. 45276/99, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, ECHR 2001II). However, the Court has previously held that the indirect removal of an alien to an intermediary country does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that he or she is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (see T.I. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43844/98, ECHR 2000-III). It sees no reason to hold differently where the expulsion is, as in the present case, not to an intermediary country but to a particular region of the country of origin. The Court considers that as a precondition for relying on an internal flight alternative certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility that the person expelled will find him or herself in a part of the country of origin where he or she may be subjected to ill-treatment.",

Undoubtedly, consideration of what is in the best interests of the child is of crucial importance in every case of this kind. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned. It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding custody and access issues, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation. Article 8 requires that the domestic authorities should strike a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the parents and that, in the balancing process, particular importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents. In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, amongst others, Sahin v.

The report stated that in view of the applicant\u2019s abuse of his estranged wife and the fact that he had probably also physically abused his daughter, there was a high risk that the children would be harmed if the applicant were to have custody of them. The children were very young when they last had contact with the applicant and they would have no memories of their father that they could express in words. Their need for a relationship with their father would increase when they became older. Access between them and the applicant would involve an increased risk that their secret address would become known to him. Moreover, the applicant would probably be expelled upon release from prison. Thus, it was recommended that he should not have access to the children. In order to meet the children\u2019s need for contact with their origins, it was noted that such could be accommodated through letters. The social welfare board could distribute letters from the applicant to the children via the estranged wife, who in turn could reply within a month to report on the children\u2019s development.",

But I cannot find any support in the file for the opinion that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is possible and reasonable to expect the applicant to resettle elsewhere in . This issue should have been examined separately and thoroughly by the domestic authorities. In my view, the existence of such a thorough and separate examination, focusing on internal flight alternatives and concrete possibilities of resettlement, is not apparent from the file and I cannot therefore support the majority view that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",

This reasoning was based to a large extent on the fact that, if the children were to have contact with the applicant, they would be exposed to yet another separation from him when the expulsion order was implemented and that it was not therefore in the children\u2019s best interest to see him. The authorities also relied, unconvincingly in my view, on the fact that, even if the children were able to create a safe relationship with the applicant during limited access arrangements, he would subsequently be expelled and therefore separated from his children until May 2013 (see District Court\u2019s decision of 18 November 2008, paragraph 126 of the judgment). This cannot be a reason to refuse access. Nor can it be justifiable to refuse access at an earlier stage on the ground that, in any event, access will potentially become possible after May 2013 (see paragraph 108 of the judgment concerning the non-communicated and inadmissible part of the application under Article 8). Hence, in my view, the interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention was not proportionate. I would like to stress in this context that the possibility of access after May 2013 is purely theoretical, as it is more than doubtful that the applicant would, as a matter of fact, be granted leave to return to  in 2013. In other words, and to sum up, the denial of access, in a situation where contact with the children has been impossible for such a long time, constitutes a disproportionate interference with a right protected by Article 8.",
