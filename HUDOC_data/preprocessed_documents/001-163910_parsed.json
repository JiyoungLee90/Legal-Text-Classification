His version of events was overturned by a number of pieces of evidence submitted in the case and not through any illicit means or methods (see, mutatis mutandis, Trymbach v. Ukraine, no. 44385/02, 12\u00a0January 2012). It should also be noted that the questioning of the applicant on 23 August 2001 was carried out in public, thus rasing no doubt as to possible duress on the applicant. The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s testimonies given that day were not the only source of information and evidence for the police: the major factual information appears to have already been known from V.Z., the another suspect in the case.",

It is apparent from the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment that the applicant\u2019s conviction for murder was based mainly on V.Z.\u2019s testimony, which the trial court found to be corroborated by statements made by the applicant\u2019s wife, the results of the crime-site inspection and the forensic expert\u2019s examination of the victim\u2019s body.",

The higher court did not find any such disadvantages either. In particular, the Supreme Court established no procedural violations serious enough to necessitate quashing the judgment (see paragraph 50 above). The Court finds the applicant\u2019s argument that the alleged discrepancies in his evidence details referred to by the trial court was the direct consequence of the absence of a lawyer during his first interrogation vague. It observes in this respect that the applicant was represented by a lawyer as of 31 August 2001 and throughout the pre-trial investigation and was questioned with respect to the murder on a\u00a0number of occasions. He was represented by the same lawyer during the trial. The Court thus finds that the applicant had adequate time and facilities to duly elaborate his position in the case and be consistent during the trial and that the absence of a lawyer on 23 August 2001 did not have a bearing in this respect. Furthermore, although the judgment does not refer to any particular discrepancies, it does not suggest that the judges particularly considered any difference between the applicant\u2019s statements made on 23\u00a0August 2001 and those he had given later.",
