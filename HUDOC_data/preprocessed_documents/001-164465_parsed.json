Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7 107, 7 November 2006). It is not therefore effective in cases where people are still detained in such conditions at the time of lodging their application with the Court (see, for instance, Oprea v. Moldova, no.\u00a038055/06, \u00a7 33, 21 December 2010).

Moreover, the poor food quality, lack of daylight, poor ventilation and lack of privacy when using the toilet all further increased the applicant\u2019s suffering, which exceeded the unavoidable level of hardship inherent in detention (see Onaca v. Romania, no.\u00a022661/06, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 13 March 2012). In the absence of any evidence from the Government that considerable improvements in Prison no.\u00a013 had taken place during recent years, the Court considers that there is no reason to depart from the conclusions reached in its previous judgments (see, among recent authorities, Silvestru v.\u00a0the Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a028173/10, 13 January 2015; Pisaroglu v.\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a021061/11, 3 March 2015; and Mescereacov v. the Republic of Moldova, no.\u00a061050/11, 16 February 2016).",
