It stressed that both the fact that the applicant had earlier evaded justice and the nature of his, in the court's words, \u201ccriminal relations\u201d with certain witnesses involved in the case, indicated that detention was the only preventive measure which would effectively secure the proper course of the trial. As regards the legal basis for his detention, the court pointed out that \u2013 as had already been mentioned in the previous detention decisions \u2013 his detention continued on the grounds listed in Article\u00a0258 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (2) and 2 of the 1997 Code as there was a risk that he might obstruct the proper course of the trial and a heavy penalty was likely to be imposed on him. Lastly, as to the question of which court was competent to prolong his detention, the Court of Appeal stated that the applicant had misconstrued Article\u00a0263 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and\u00a04 of the 1997 Code. That provision, the court added, indeed imposed a statutory time-limit of 2 years on pre-trial detention and laid down that only the Supreme Court could prolong it beyond that term. However, that rule applied only as long as there had been no conviction at first instance. Since the applicant had already been convicted at first instance, no time-limit for detention applied to his case, even though his original conviction had subsequently been quashed on appeal.",

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such a risk existed. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001 and Lachowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027556/03, \u00a7\u00a034, 5 December 2006). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone, or in conjunction with the other grounds relied on by the authorities, cannot constitute a \u201crelevant and sufficient ground\u201d for holding the applicant in detention for a period of 3 years and over 3 months.",

The Court agrees that the applicant's absconding justified keeping him in custody at the initial stages of the proceedings. However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed. In particular, given the absence of any further attempt on the part of the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, it is difficult to accept that that circumstance could justify the conclusion that the risk of his interfering with the proper course of the proceedings persisted during the entire period that he spent in custody (see mutatis mutandis, Harazin v. , no.\u00a038227/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 10\u00a0January 2006).
