They cited various scientific publications and went on to explain that the fact that the Silesians formed a distinct group had already been acknowledged at the end of the First World War; moreover, the Silesians had always sought to preserve their identity and had always formed a distinct group, regardless of whether Upper Silesia had belonged to Germany or to Poland. Consequently, any comparison between them and the Cracovians or Highlanders was totally unjustified, because the latter groups neither regarded themselves as national minorities, nor had they ever been perceived as such in the past.

'National minority' is a legal term (see Article 35 of the Constitution of 2 February 1997), although it is not defined either in Polish law or in the conventions relied on in the appeal on points of law. However, the explanatory report to the [Framework Convention] states plainly that the individual's subjective choice of a nation is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to his or her national identity. That means that a subjective declaration of belonging to a specific national group implies prior social acceptance of the existence of the national group in question. ...",

In practice, the electoral committee that has submitted a given national minority list [of candidates] will participate [in the distribution of seats in Parliament] ..., despite the fact that its list has not attained the corresponding threshold. This solution reflects a certain understanding of the equality principle that involves entities participating in elections being given equal opportunities ... This amounts to discrimination in favour of electoral committees of registered national minority organisations in comparison with other electoral committees.

For pluralism is also built on the genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs, artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively.",

That is a political choice and a matter on which an international court could not dictate to a  without infringing upon the subsidiarity principle. Besides which, even though the Permanent Court of International Justice delivered two famous judgments concerning Polish Upper Silesia in 1926 and 1928 (Germany v. Poland, 25 May 1926, Series\u00a0A no. 7, and 26 April 1928, Series A no. 15), questions relating to national minorities are complex and still somewhat vague.",

Section 5 of the 1993 Elections Act, which is cited in paragraph 41 of the judgment, is not devoid of ambiguity. Outwardly, it appears to give the State Electoral College the power to grant or refuse exemption. The Supreme Court was alert to this problem of construction. In finding that, on the contrary, the Electoral College's hands were tied and it was bound to grant exemption if the applicant electoral committee was a registered organisation of a national minority, it followed the authoritative interpretation given by the Polish Constitutional Court in this respect in its decision of 30 April 1997 (reproduced in paragraphs 42 and 43 of the judgment). While the Supreme Court openly acknowledged (see paragraph 36 of the judgment) that decisions of the  no longer had universally binding force, it stressed the persuasiveness of the Constitutional Court's reasons, and that is indeed a factor that cannot be neglected.",

We have, therefore, overcome our initial hesitations on this point: it must be accepted that registration would have permitted the Union to acquire electoral privileges which the Constitution and law restrict to purely \u201cnational\u201d minorities and that such privileges derogate from the constitutional principle requiring equality before the law.",

In one of these, Sidiropoulos and Others, which has already been cited, the applicants had formed a \u201cMacedonian\u201d association and the Court found that the Greek judicial authorities' refusal to register it had infringed Article 11 of the Convention. In the other, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria (nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, ECHR 2001-IX), the Court likewise found a violation of Article 11, owing to a ban on peaceful assembly. But is it the Court's role to treat the \u201cSilesian minority\u201d more severely and the \u201cMacedonian minority\u201d with greater indulgence?",

In Sidiropoulos and Others, the Court found that in the circumstances of the case the association did not represent a genuine danger to public order or the territorial integrity of . Likewise, in Stankov, the Court considered on the facts that there was no foreseeable risk that the planned meetings would lead to violent action, incitement to violence or the rejection of democratic principles. The most important aspect for the Court, therefore, will be the factual assessment, at the risk of attracting the criticism of casuistry (which in our view is inevitable) that is often levelled at it. Ultimately, the decisive factor for us in the present case was the fact that the association would not only have existed, but also have been registered, if it had changed its name and amended paragraphs 10 and 30 of its memorandum of association, as it had been asked to do by the Governor acting in his supervisory capacity (see paragraph\u00a024 of the judgment). While this would have deprived it of the electoral \u201cadvantage\u201d afforded national minorities, it would have acquired full legal capacity as an association. We thus return to the starting-point of this opinion: in practice, the measures the applicants complain of constitute not so much a real interference with their freedom of association as an attempt on the part of the domestic authorities to avoid the unforeseen consequences \u2013 which would infringe the principle of equality \u2013 of the exercise of that freedom.",

Indeed, in that regard, it seemed to us that Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France ([GC], no. 27417/95, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, ECHR 2000-VII) might be of some relevance, mutatis mutandis. In the end, despite our initial reservations, we were able to concur with the majority in this very sensitive case, thus fully justifying its examination by the Grand Chamber of the Court.",
