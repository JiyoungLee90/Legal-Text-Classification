First, all religious marriages other than those in the Church of England required a Certificate despite the fact that the evidence showed that sham marriages predominantly took place in registry offices. The treatment of religious marriages outside the Church of England was therefore a matter of concern as they were treated like registry office marriages even though evidence indicated that the same precautions which prevented sham marriages taking place in the Church of England were also present in other religious ceremonies. Secondly, there was no basis for the assumption that all religious marriages outside the Church of England were automatically to be treated as sham marriages, thus requiring a Certificate, while in contrast all marriages conducted according to the rites of the Church of England were to be regarded automatically as not being sham marriages and therefore did not require a Certificate. Thirdly, the first version of the scheme arbitrarily failed to take into account many factors which might be relevant in considering whether or not a proposed marriage was a sham, such as clear and corroborated evidence that the parties had enjoyed a loving relationship over a number of years, during which time they might have had children or bought a house together. It was difficult to understand how the scheme, which ignored factors such as these, could be \u201crationally connected\u201d to the purported legislative aim of avoiding sham marriages. Fourthly, the first version of the scheme was not rationally connected to the legislative objective as it regarded the only relevant factors in determining whether a non-EU national could marry in the  as his or her immigration status.",

There is nothing in the text of section 19 which authorises or requires the withholding of permission to marry in the case of any marriage which is not a marriage of convenience. Indeed, the section makes no reference to marriages of convenience or sham marriages and gives no hint of the grounds on which permission may be granted or withheld. Section 19 could be operated, consistently with its terms and with article 12, in a manner which required persons subject to immigration control to give notice of a proposed marriage, enabled an appropriate authority to investigate whether the proposed marriage would be one of convenience and provided for the withholding of permission only in cases where it appeared that the proposed marriage would be one of convenience.",

The vice of the scheme is that none of these conditions, although of course relevant to immigration status, has any relevance to the genuineness of a proposed marriage, which is the only relevant criterion for deciding whether permission should be given to an applicant who is qualified under national law to enter into a valid marriage. It\u00a0may be that persons falling within the categories specified in the Instructions are more likely to enter into a marriage of convenience than others, and that may be a very material consideration when the genuineness of a proposed marriage is investigated. But the section 19 scheme does not provide for or envisage any investigation at all, because (as has been explained in the evidence) such investigation is too expensive and administratively burdensome. Thus, subject to the discretionary compassionate exception, the scheme imposes a blanket prohibition on exercise of the right to marry by all in the specified categories, irrespective of whether their proposed marriages are marriages of convenience or whether they are not. This is a disproportionate interference with exercise of the right to marry.\u201d",

Likewise Baroness Hale identified a number of objections to the scheme. First, it covered all nonnationals unless they had acquired a right of abode, irrespective of how long they had been living in the United Kingdom, how close their relationship was and how small or non-existent the immigration advantage might be. Secondly, the decision whether or not to grant a Certificate of Approval did not depend upon any reasonable assessment, either of the immigration advantage which the marriage might bring, or of the genuineness of the relationship. Instead, it depended upon a rule of thumb: permission would be granted if each person needing it had been granted leave to enter or remain in the  for more than six months and had at least three months of this remaining when he made the application. Thirdly, the policy automatically excluded all asylum seekers because they did not have leave to enter. Fourthly, it was an indication of how over-inclusive the statutory scheme was that the great majority of applications for permission were granted.",

Under the first version of the scheme, only those foreign nationals with sufficient leave to remain (that is, those who had been granted leave to enter or remain for a period totalling more than six months and who had at least three months of this leave remaining at the time of making the application) could qualify for a Certificate of Approval. Although the second version of the scheme extended eligibility to persons with insufficient leave, it continued to exclude persons who had no valid leave to enter. It was only the third version of the scheme which extended eligibility to persons like the second applicant who had no valid leave to enter. The Court recalls that it has previously, albeit in different circumstances, held that a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right fell outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin was (Hirst v. the  (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 82, ECHR\u00a02005IX). Likewise, in the present case, the Court considers that there is no justification whatsoever for imposing a blanket prohibition on the right of persons falling within these categories to exercise their right to marry. Even if there was evidence to suggest that persons falling within these categories were more likely to enter into marriages of convenience for immigration purposes \u2013 and the Government have submitted no such evidence to the Court in the course of these proceedings \u2013 the Court finds that a blanket prohibition, without any attempt being made to investigate the genuineness of the proposed marriages, restricted the right to marry to such an extent that the very essence of the right was impaired. The existence of the exception on compassionate grounds did not remove the impairment of the essence of the right, as this was an exceptional procedure which was entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State. Moreover, the Secretary of State's decision whether or not to exercise this discretion appears to have been based entirely on the personal circumstances of the applicants and not on the genuineness of the proposed marriages.",

It\u00a0recalls that it has previously found, in the context of a complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that depending on the circumstances of a case, including the applicant's ability to pay, the level of a fee may in itself be such as to restrict the enjoyment of a Convention right (see, for example, Kreuz v. , no. 28249/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001VI). In view of the fact that many persons who are subject to immigration control will either be unable to work in the , such as the second applicant, or will fall into the lower income bracket, the Court also agrees that in the present case the fee of GBP 295 was sufficiently high to impair the right to marry. Moreover, the Court does not consider that the system of refunding fees to needy applicants, such as the second applicant, which was introduced in July 2010, constitutes an effective means of removing any impairment as the requirement to pay a fee, even if there is a possibility that it could be later refunded, may act as a powerful disincentive to marriage.",

Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (Burden, cited above, \u00a7 60).

However, a person without leave who was willing and able to marry according to the rites of the Church of England was free to marry unhindered.

Consequently, he was initially prohibited from marrying at all in the  and, following the amendments to the scheme, he was only permitted to marry after submitting an application to the Secretary of State and paying a sizeable fee.
