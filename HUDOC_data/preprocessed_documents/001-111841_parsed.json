The court allowed the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the extension was necessary in order to secure the applicant\u2019s extradition to . The period of the applicant\u2019s detention was assessed by the court as reasonable, since it was justified by the necessity to comply with the extradition procedure. The court found that the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case requiring his placement in custody had not changed. The court pointed out that the applicant\u2019s argument regarding the application of the interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court could not be taken into account, since the European Court of Human Rights had not examined the applicant\u2019s case on the merits at the material time and, in any event, the application of an interim measure did not constitute a ground for release. The court further rejected the applicant\u2019s submission that he had not committed the offences referred to, finding that \u201csuch an argument was rebutted by the [above] documents\u201d and, in any event, that issue could not be subject to examination in the proceedings concerning the extension of the detention period. The court further observed that the applicant did not have a permanent place of residence in  and had not been granted refugee status. It noted that the applicant had been charged with serious and particularly serious crimes in , which were also punishable under Russian law. The court further found that the applicant had previously absconded from the Uzbek authorities and therefore there were grounds to believe that he would flee from justice if released. It further decided, without giving further details, that the applicant\u2019s family situation, medical condition and age were compatible with his detention. The court concluded, with reference to Articles 109 and 466 \u00a7\u00a01 of the CCrP, that the applicant\u2019s detention should be further extended until 4 August 2011, that is for a total of eighteen months.",

The Plenary reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings or other person whose rights and freedoms were affected by actions or inaction on the part of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could rely on Article 125 of the CCrP to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them. The Plenary stated that whilst the bulk of decisions amenable to judicial review under Article 125 also included decisions to institute criminal proceedings, refusal to admit defence counsel or to grant victim status, a person could not rely on Article\u00a0125 to challenge a court\u2019s decision to apply bail or house arrest or to remand a person in custody. It was further stressed that in declaring a specific action or inaction on the part of a law-enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to quash the impugned decision or to oblige the official responsible to quash it, but could only request him or her to rectify the shortcomings indicated. Should the impugned authority fail to comply with the court\u2019s instructions, an interested party could complain to a court about the authority\u2019s inaction and the latter body could issue a special decision [\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435], drawing the authority\u2019s attention to the situation. Lastly, the decision stated that a prosecutor\u2019s decision to place a person under house arrest or to remand him or her in custody with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under Article 125 of the CCP.",

Judicial authorisation of placement in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article 108 of the CCrP and following a prosecutor\u2019s request for that person to be placed in custody. In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there were factual and legal grounds for the application of that preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order by a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court\u2019s authorisation (Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor\u2019s decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP.

In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see Saadi v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a037201/06, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2008).

The Court observes that the information contained in the written explanation signed by the applicant on that date was, indeed, not particularly detailed.

The Court observes, however, that the main thrust of the applicant\u2019s grievance was his persecution by the Uzbek authorities in connection with allegations of serious criminal offences punishable by long prison terms. The Court reiterates in this respect that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a091, 22\u00a0September 2009). It has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that the conduct of the person concerned, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be taken into account, with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article 3 of the Convention is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 138, with further references). Similarly, as regards the events of 2007, the Court observes that the main thrust of the applicant\u2019s argument is that since he will be detained if extradited to , he runs a risk of being ill-treated in the context of the criminal proceedings currently pending against him in the requesting State. These proceedings were opened in 2009, that is two years after the applicant\u2019s most recent visit to his home country. Therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, a mere reference to the events in 2007, taken separately, cannot be accepted as a sufficient ground for rejecting the complaint that there is a real personal risk of ill-treatment in case of his extradition and arrest in Uzbekistan in the context of the criminal proceedings against him.",

Likewise, in the refugee status proceedings the courts held that the applicant had not produced sufficient evidence that he would be subjected to ill-treatment if extradited to  (see paragraph 64 above). The Court further takes note of the findings in the proceedings concerning temporary asylum by the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of 22 February 2012, that the applicant \u201chad not referred to specific evidence that there existed a real threat to [his] security\u201d (see paragraph 68 above). In the absence of further elaboration by the domestic courts, the exact meaning of these similar findings in the three sets of proceedings remains obscure. The Court reiterates that requesting an applicant to produce \u201cindisputable\u201d evidence of a risk of ill-treatment in the requesting country would be tantamount to asking him to prove the existence of a future event, which is impossible, and would place a clearly disproportionate burden on him. In this respect it further reiterates its constant case-law to the effect that what should be assessed in this type of case are the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the receiving country (see, among other authorities, Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, \u00a7 108).",

For instance, in the extradition proceedings the Moscow City Court had found no evidence of politically motivated persecution of the applicant (see paragraph 25 above), and the Supreme Court of Russia upheld that conclusion. Likewise, the first-instance court in the refugee status proceedings stated that the underlying reason for the applicant\u2019s request was an attempt to avoid criminal responsibility in the requesting country (see paragraph 61 above; see also paragraph 64 above as regards the appeal proceedings). These findings were at variance with the applicant\u2019s submission, cited earlier in the same decision, that he feared being returned to  because of the risk of torture in the context of criminal proceedings concerning the charges of politically motivated offences (see paragraph 60 above).",

As regards the applicant\u2019s submission that the domestic courts were under an obligation to obtain the latest information from the public domain of their own motion, the Court reiterates that it is, in principle, for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 (see paragraph 108 above).

In its Muminov judgment the Court considered that there were serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice of persecution of members or supporters of that organisation. It found that reliable sources affirmed the existence of a practice of torture against persons accused of membership of HT, with a view to extracting self-incriminating confessions and to punishing those persons, who were perceived by public authorities to be involved in religious or political activities contrary to State interests (see Muminov, cited above, \u00a7 95).",

In this respect it is also significant for the Court that the Uzbek authorities have consistently refused to allow independent observers access to detention facilities (see paragraphs 92-93 above). Accordingly, in the light of evidence showing a persistent pattern of persecution of accused members of HT involving torture and ill-treatment the Court considers that no concrete elements have been produced to show any fundamental improvement in the area concerning this particular group (compare Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-03, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V).",

The Court considers that this reasoning applies in the present case, where the applicant is accused of membership of a group in respect of which reliable sources confirm a continuing pattern of ill-treatment on the part of the authorities, as has been stated above. Although in such circumstances the Court will normally not insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features (see NA. v. the\u00a0United Kingdom, no.\u00a025904/07, \u00a7\u00a0116, 17 July 2008), it considers it nonetheless important to point out that the applicant repeatedly submitted to the competent Russian authorities that he had already been subjected to persecution and ill-treatment at the hands of the Uzbek law-enforcement authorities in connection with his presumed membership of HT. In the proceedings concerning the validity of the extradition order he presented a detailed account of how the alleged ill-treatment had occurred (see paragraph 30 above), and referred to the witnesses\u2019 depositions. Against this background, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s submissions concerning persecution by the authorities and alleged experience of illtreatment cannot be discarded as completely without foundation.",

In any event, the Court notes that Uzbekistan is not a Contracting State to the Convention (compare, among many others, Gasayev v.\u00a0 (dec.), no. 48514/06, 17 February 2009), nor have its authorities demonstrated the existence of an effective system of legal protection against torture that could act as an equivalent to the system required of the Contracting States. Quite to the contrary, numerous reports available to the Court agree on Uzbekistan\u2019s reluctance to investigate allegations of torture and to punish those responsible, as well as to cooperate with international monitoring mechanisms (see paragraphs\u00a091-93 above). In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the assurances by the Uzbek authorities are in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment in the case at hand (see, for instance, Gaforov, cited above, \u00a7 138, and Yuldashev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085).",

In so far as the Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, since the decisions by the Perovskiy Inter-District Prosecutor were subject to appeal, the Court is mindful of its findings in the case of Dzhurayev v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a038124/07, 17 December 2009), in which the exhaustion issue had been discussed and the Court was not persuaded that the existence of the remedies relied on in that case, as well in the present case, was sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice (see Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067). However, the Court does not need to examine the exhaustion issue in the present case, for the following reason. The Court observes that the period of detention authorised by the inter-district prosecutor\u2019s orders of 5\u00a0February and 2\u00a0March 2010 ended on 25\u00a0March 2010 (see paragraph 40 above), when the applicant\u2019s further detention was authorised by the Perovskiy District Court (see, by contrast, Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01120 and 75, where no court decision had been issued to extend the applicant\u2019s custodial detention). That later decision entered into force ten days later. However, the applicant only raised his arguments as regards deficiencies of his initial remand in custody in his observations dated 11 July 2011. Thus, by operation of the six-month rule under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court does not have jurisdiction to delve into the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s arrest and the initial period of detention under the detention order of 4 February 2010 (from 4\u00a0February to 25\u00a0March 2010) (see, in so far as relevant, Solovyev v. Russia, no.\u00a02708/02, \u00a7\u00a083, 24 May 2007; Savenkova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30930/02, \u00a7 62, 4\u00a0March 2010; and Vladimir Krivonosov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a07772/04, \u00a7 109, 15\u00a0July 2010).",

He had furnished no further details in this respect. Even assuming that the applicant, represented before the Court since 25 February 2010, provided some indication of the factual basis of the complaint and the nature of the alleged violation (see, in so far as relevant, Allan v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a048539/99, 28\u00a0August 2001) \u2013 a hypothesis favourable to the applicant \u2013 the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant had failed to lodge an ordinary appeal against the detention order of 25 March 2010. In fact, the decision of 25 March 2010 contained an unequivocal indication that it could be appealed against within ten days from the date of delivery of the decision. The Court further takes cognisance of the applicant\u2019s submissions of 11 July 2011 that he was unable to challenge the decision of 25\u00a0March 2010, since during these proceedings he had been represented by a Stateappointed lawyer and not a lawyer of his own choosing. However, in the absence of any further details, the Court is not persuaded that there existed exceptional circumstances which might have precluded the applicant or the State-appointed counsel from lodging such an appeal or, in the alternative, precluding the applicant\u2019s representative before the Court from requesting an extension of the time-limits for introducing such an appeal (see also paragraph 172 below). Likewise, the Court notes that the applicant failed to introduce an ordinary appeal against the decision of 28\u00a0July 2010 by the Perovskiy District Court (see paragraphs 43-44 above). The Court thus finds that the complaint relating to the lawfulness of his detention in the period prior to 27\u00a0January 2011 should be dismissed for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, in line with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (ibid.).",

The applicant was clearly advised of the possibility of appealing. The lawfulness of that detention was reviewed and confirmed by the appeal court. At the expiry of the statutory eighteen-month period the applicant was released at the prosecutor\u2019s request.

If such proceedings are not conducted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). In other words, the length of the detention for this purpose should not exceed what is reasonably required (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

It is true that after 30 August 2010, when that interim measure was adopted under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, there existed a legal obstacle to the applicant\u2019s extradition to . The Court reiterates in that regard that the Contracting States are obliged under Article 34 of the Convention to comply with interim measures indicated under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a099-129). However, the implementation of an interim measure following an indication by the Court to a State Party not to return an individual to a particular country does not in itself have any bearing on whether the deprivation of liberty to which that individual may be subjected complies with Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2007II). In other words, the domestic authorities must still act in strict compliance with domestic law (ibid. \u00a7 75).",

The Court notes that in those proceedings the case was examined by the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction.

It is not in dispute that the first-instance court was enabled to assess the conditions which, according to paragraph 1 (f) of Article 5, were essential for \u201clawful\u201d detention with a view to extradition. In addition, it was open to the applicant under Russian law to appeal against the detention order to a higher court, which was able to review it on various grounds. As with the procedure before the first-instance court, there is no reason to doubt that an appellate court was capable of assessing the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention with a view to extradition.",
