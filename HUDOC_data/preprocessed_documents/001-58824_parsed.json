The Court observes in this respect that there was no conscious decision on the part of Mr A. Bourimi not to recognise the child Ms\u00a0Camp was carrying. On the contrary, he had intended to marry Ms\u00a0Camp and letters of legitimation had been granted precisely because his untimely death had precluded that marriage (see paragraphs 8, 12 and 17-18 above).
