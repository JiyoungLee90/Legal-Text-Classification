The court, in a plenary sitting, reiterated ... the reasons for concluding that to limit the survivor\u2019s pension to cases of institutionalised cohabitation as husband and wife, excluding other forms of partnership or cohabitation, did not constitute discrimination on social grounds. In this connection, it was submitted that the legislature retained a significant degree of discretion in determining the configuration of the social security system and in assessing the socio-economic circumstances in a context of the administration of limited resources with a view to addressing a large number of social needs, bearing in mind that an entitlement to a survivor\u2019s pension was not strictly conditional, in a contribution-related system, on an actual situation of necessity or economic dependence, or even unfitness for work, in the case of the surviving spouse. In any event, the plenary court also commented on the fact that the extension, by the legislature, of the survivor\u2019s pension to other forms of partnership was not prohibited by Article 14 of the Spanish Constitution either.",

The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

To that end the Court is entrusted with jurisdiction extending to \u201call matters concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention and the Protocols thereto which are referred to it\u201d (Article 32). In so doing the Court must as far as possible limit its examination to the issues raised by the concrete case before it (see, among many other authorities, Deweer v.

Although the majority claim to have arrived at their finding solely on the basis of the specific circumstances of the case, I have an uneasy feeling that they may have been moved to point out to the Spanish authorities what they see as the failure to adopt legislation that adequately reflects the special position of Roma. To me, this is apparent from, for example, paragraph 61 of the judgment, where they state the view that \u201cwhile affiliation to a minority does not create an exemption form complying with marriage laws, it may have an effect on the manner in which those laws are applied\u201d. I wonder whether such a statement can be based on the case-law cited in paragraphs 60 and 61 of the judgment, which \u2013 as the judgment itself admits \u2013 was developed against a wholly different factual and legal background, namely that of spatial planning.",

The corollary, in my view, is that if the Spanish authorities had refused to recognise the applicant as the mother of a large family and grant her the attendant pecuniary benefits, or if they had refused to enter the children in the family record book, they would most likely have had to be found to be discriminating against the applicant and her family.

Even so, I consider it unreasonable to impute her ignorance to the respondent Party. It would be even more unreasonable to impute the equal treatment, in certain respects, of the applicant and her family as compared to marriage-based families to the Spanish authorities as a fault.",

This is also reflected by the newspaper headlines which I have quoted above. As matters stand, there appear to be many Spanish Roma who marry twice, both in accordance with Spanish law and according to Roma traditions, to be on the safe side. This is little different from the situation in many other countries, including my own (the ), in which a lawful marriage is solemnised before a public authority after which, if the parties so wish, a religious ceremony may follow.",
