He relied on an expert's report assessing the value of his loss which included the loss of annual rents collected or expected to be collected from the use of his school and from renting out his apartment, plus interest from the date on which such rents were due until the day of payment. The rents claimed were for the period dating back to January 1987, when the respondent Government accepted the right of individual petition, until 31 December 2002. The applicant did not claim compensation for any purported expropriation since he was still the legal owner of the properties. He underlined that his family bought the apartment in  from a certain Georghios Michael Nicolaides in 1968 for CYP 6,300 (approximately EUR 10,764), as evidenced by the relevant sale agreement.
