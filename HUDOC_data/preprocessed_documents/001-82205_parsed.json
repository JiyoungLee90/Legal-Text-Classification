As he did not do so at the initial stage of the proceedings, three official lawyers were appointed to represent him one after another. He dismissed the first two lawyers for loss of confidence and finally replaced the third by a counsel of his choice. With reference to the specific period under consideration, the applicant requested a replacement of his officially assigned lawyer on 30 May 2001 and a new one was appointed to represent him on 13 September 2001.

However, on 13 September 2001 the District Court appointed the applicant a new lawyer without securing service of the decision of 15 August 2001 on him. This lack of action was classified by the  as a procedural flaw on account of which the appeal could not be determined. This error had to be corrected and the appeal resubmitted to the , which finally dismissed it on 3\u00a0October 2001. The latter decision was not pronounced publicly and there is no indication as to when it was communicated to the applicant or to his representative (see, for example, Koendjbiharie v. the Netherlands, judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 185-B, p. 40, \u00a7 28, and Singh v. the Czech Republic, no. 60538/00, \u00a7 74, 25 January 2005).

Further delays were created as a result of the District Court's failure to secure service of its decision on the applicant's new lawyer who was appointed by that very court. Finally, it must also be taken into account that while the applicant's requests for release of July 2001 were still pending, he was by law prevented from submitting a new request for release without relying on new facts (see Singh, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Letellier\u00a0v.

Taking into account all the elements at its disposal, including the total length of those proceedings, the Court finds that the proceedings in respect of the applicant's requests for release of 6 and 20 July 2001 were not \u201cspeedy\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that, in the relevant period, the applicant's detention was also examined by the Supreme Court, on 31 July 2001, in connection with the request by the prosecution service for its extension, a procedure in which the applicant had no opportunity to participate (see, for example, Assenov and Others\u00a0v.
