Turkey, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 324, \u00a7\u00a086). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life. The form of investigation which will achieve this purpose may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedure (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan v.  [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2000-VII). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken all reasonable steps to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Gongadze\u00a0v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, \u00a7\u00a0176, ECHR 2005-XI).",

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent an investigation from making progress in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force or a disappearance may generally be regarded as essential in ensuring public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7\u00a7 108-15, ECHR 2001III, and Av\u015far v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7\u00a7 390-95, ECHR 2001VII).",

It does not appear from the case-file materials that a thorough on-site inspection and appropriate forensic examinations, apart from an autopsy, had been conducted initially. The police officers that arrived on site first had not been questioned for more then a year and no on-site reconstruction of events had been conducted (see paragraphs 7 and 20 above). The Government did not demonstrate that at the initial stage of investigation any other possible cause of the death of the applicant's son had been thoroughly eliminated. Although three months later the investigator looked into the involvement of Mr Z. and Mr K. in the murder of the applicant's son, no other scenarios seem to have been pursued prior to the results of the forensic examination of 11\u00a0February 2000, which concluded that the previous examinations were incorrect and the lethal trauma suffered by the applicant's son could not have been self-inflicted.",
