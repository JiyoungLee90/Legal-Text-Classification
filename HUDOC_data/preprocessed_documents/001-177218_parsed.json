First of all, the Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Poznakhirina v.

In the absence of any alternative proposal or information on any specific deficiencies of the calculation method used in those proceedings, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument and accepts the applicant\u2019s claims based on those domestic courts\u2019 findings in this part.
