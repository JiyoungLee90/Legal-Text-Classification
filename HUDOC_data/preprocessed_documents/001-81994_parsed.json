On Wednesday, 4 June 1997 at around 11.45 pm in , they had, after having planned the operation, blown up parts of the club house in 25, , of another motor cycle club, named Bandidos. A Volkswagen Transporter had been placed in the latter's courtyard, loaded with explosives that were detonated. The force of the explosion had been such that metal and rubber parts of the vehicle had hit and killed the driver of a passing car. The building in question had in part subsided and a massive fire had broken out, putting at risk the lives of three persons inside the building. The building had burned down to the ground and a neighbouring property had been severely damaged, several vehicles had been totally or largely destroyed. The total damage had amounted to at least NOK 2,000,000.

The present case was widely covered by the media just after the explosion, regularly during the subsequent period, and later in connection with the arrest and the City Court proceedings. It appears from the judgment that this was a planned crime, within the meaning of section 148 of the Penal Code, organised by several persons where a passer-by lost her life. The explosion took place in a town and could easily have led to the loss of more lives. Damage amounting to great sums was caused. The City Court based its ruling on the fact that the matter arose out of rivalry between two Motor Cyclist milieus. The High Court adds, as a factor when assessing the case pursuant to Article 172, that this rivalry in Nordic countries has led to a number of violent confrontations, including several deaths. This case is undoubtedly likely to cause such a reaction among the general public as Article 172 is intended to counteract and must be said to lie in the core area for the application of this provision. On the basis of an overall assessment, the High Court has found that the law enforcement considerations which form the basis of Article 172 are so prominent here that the accused should remain in prison also after judgment. The accused's personal and family circumstances pointed out by the defence counsel cannot be given sufficient weight in the opposite direction, and continued imprisonment cannot be said to be a disproportionate measure under Article 170A.",

The question now is whether the other professional judges in a High Court that is convened with a jury are to be regarded as disqualified under section 108 of the Administration of Courts Act due to the fact that they have previously been involved in applying Article 172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as a basis for imprisoning one or more of the accused in the same criminal case.",

It is for the presiding judge to give instructions to the jury, see Article 368 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and this is his responsibility alone. It is true that all the professional judges take part in the subsequent assessment of whether the jury's decision is to form the basis of the judgment, or in exceptional cases be set aside, see Articles 376A, 376B and 376C of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, such a setting aside of decisions does not determine the question of guilt and is also so exceptional that, in my opinion, it cannot be given any significance worth mentioning in this context.",

Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the party concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a044).",

In this regard, the extent and nature of the pre-trial measures taken by the judge are of importance (see Fey v. Austria, judgment of 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255A, p. 12, \u00a7\u00a030).

The Supreme Court considered that the explanations given by the High Court President and W. to the police for the purposes of its own review of the impartiality issue did not give any reason to assume that she had imparted information to other jurors about her prior knowledge of the case or had in any way influenced the jury before she was discharged on 28 February 2003. According to the jury foreperson, the situation that had arisen after W. had withdrawn had been discussed by the jury members internally who had agreed that her participation during the first few days had not had any effect on the jury's verdict.",

In this regard the applicants' complaint seems markedly weaker than those made by applicants in several previous cases where the disputed jury member, unlike here, had taken part in the determination of the merits of the national case (see Pullar\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, p.\u00a0794, \u00a7\u00a037; Gregory\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I, p.\u00a0309, \u00a7\u00a046; and Sander\u00a0v. the , no.\u00a034129/96, \u00a7\u00a026, ECHR 2000V), in some of which the Court had found no violation of the requirement of objective impartiality under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Pullar, cited above, pp. 794-795, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41; and Gregory, cited above, pp. 309-310, \u00a7\u00a7 46-50).",

Sweden, judgment of 25 November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0279A, p.\u00a015, \u00a7\u00a031). Not only had the presiding judge at the opening of the trial discussed with the jury the impartiality requirement applicable to jurors. Also, the jury had been reminded of the importance of this requirement when the High Court promptly ordered juror W. to withdraw from the case on the ground of disqualification (see Gregory, cited above, \u00a7 49; cf. Remli\u00a0v. France, judgment of 23 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, p.\u00a0574, \u00a7\u00a047). While neither side in the trial had relied on W.'s statement to the police of 10 July 1997, the presiding judge would regularly remind the jury to rely only on statements presented in court and not to discuss the case with third parties (see paragraph 33 of the Supreme Court's judgment quoted at paragraph 18 above). In these circumstances, it would appear to have been superfluous for the presiding judge to point out in his directions to the jury that it should not be influenced by any affirmations that juror W. might have made to other members of the jury regarding her statement to the police before being discharged three weeks earlier (cf. Gregory, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48).",

I strongly believe that the applicants, from their perspective, had legitimate reasons to suspect that it could not be ruled out that, before the High Court's President discharged her from the jury, W. had communicated with the other members of the jury on the subject of her statement to the police of 10 July 1997. May I add that it transpires from the reasons given by the first voting judge of the Supreme Court (Judgment of 25 September 2003, \u00a7\u00a7 23 et seq., reproduced in paragraph 18 of the judgment) that the witness statement of W. to the police was not a neutral witness statement but related to precise factual circumstances.",

While the jurors were reminded of their duty not to discuss or have contact with outsiders about the case, no such safeguards applied to discussions amongst jurors. In fact, quite the contrary, it is undisputed that at the beginning of the trial the presiding judge informed the jury about the importance of conferring among themselves during the trial without making this known to others.",

The rules in the Administration of Court Act governing the impartiality of judges also applied to jurors. Not only had the presiding judge at the opening of the trial discussed with the jury the impartiality requirement applicable to jurors, but the jury had also been reminded of the importance of this requirement when the High Court ordered juror W. to withdraw from the case on the ground of disqualification. While neither side in the trial had relied on W.'s statement to the police of 10 July 1997, the presiding judge would regularly remind the jury to rely only on statements presented in court and not to discuss the case with third parties (see paragraph 33 of the Supreme Court's judgment quoted at paragraph 18 of the judgment). However, these safeguards did not in my view remove the risk that juror W. might have influenced the other members of the jury. Indeed, I am not convinced that it sufficed for the jury to have been lawfully constituted when it decided on the question of guilt, since the proceedings leading to that decision had been contaminated owing to the presence of juror W. during the initial phase of the criminal trial.",

In the circumstances, the risk appeared to be a real one and I am satisfied that it was legitimate for the applicants to entertain fears that the jury lacked the requisite impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Accordingly, I find that the High Court's refusal to accede to the applicants' request, on account of juror W's participation, to discharge the jury and to order a rehearing before a differently composed jury, also gave rise to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in respect of all the applicants.",
