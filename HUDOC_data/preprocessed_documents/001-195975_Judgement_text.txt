The case originated in an application (no. 42265/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Anton Sergeyevich Neuymin (“the applicant”), on 18 September 2006.
The applicant was represented by Ms S. Yevdokimova, a lawyer practising in Yekaterinburg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 6 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government. The parties submitted written observations on the admissibility and merits.
The applicant was born in 1979 and lived in Yekaterinburg before his arrest.
On 25 October 2004 the applicant was apprehended by police on suspicion of murder and taken to the Verkh-Isetskiy District Police Department of Yekaterinburg where he was kept until 5.40 p.m. on 27 October 2004.
According to the applicant, between 6 p.m. on 25 October and midnight on 26 October 2004 he had been ill-treated by police officers. He was kicked and hit on various parts of the body, suffocated with a gas mask, and electrocuted. The applicant remained handcuffed and blindfolded at all times.
Around midnight on 26 October 2004 the applicant, assisted by an assigned lawyer, agreed to sign a confession. He was then taken by police officers to the crime scene for the on-site verification of his statements.
On the same day the applicant’s relatives retained Ms P. as the applicant’s counsel. The investigator K. was immediately notified of the fact.
On 27 October 2004 at 5.40 a.m. the applicant arrived to the police ward (IVS) of Yekaterinburg. Upon his arrival he was examined by resident medical officers who recorded numerous bodily injuries, including epithelised thermal burns on both forearms, scratches, bruising on the back, and abrasions on the nose and forehead. These injuries had also been listed in a medical certificate issued on the same day by Traumatology Department No. 2 in Yekaterinburg Town Clinical Hospital No. 36.
Later that day the applicant, assisted by Ms P., was once again questioned by the investigator. He withdrew his earlier confession, having noted that it had been obtained under duress. He also complained about inability to choose a lawyer at the time of his arrest and to notify his relatives about it.
On 28 October 2004 the applicant was transferred to pre-trial detention facility SIZO No. 1 in Yekaterinburg. His injuries were once again recorded by the medical staff of the facility upon his arrival.
On 28 October 2004, in response to a motion filed by Ms P, investigator K. ordered a medical expert examination of the applicant. The applicant was only examined on 17 December 2004. The expert discovered that he had two scars on his right forearm, a scar on his left forearm, and a scar on his left wrist. The expert was unable to establish the exact date and cause of the injuries due to the lapse of time.
On 26 December 2005 the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court of Yekaterinburg, relying inter alia on the applicant’s confession statement, convicted him of murder. The conviction was subsequently upheld by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court on 22 March 2006. The courts took note of the applicant’s ill-treatment allegations, but dismissed them as there was no proof that the injuries had been inflicted in police custody.
Between October 2004 and February 2006 the applicant and his lawyer Ms P. lodged at least seven complaints with the Verkh-Isetskiy District of Yekaterinburg and Sverdlovsk Region Prosecutors’ Offices requesting the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers
On 10 February 2006 investigator Sh. in the Verkh-Isetskiy District Prosecutor Office refused to open a criminal case. On 17 May 2006 the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court of Yekaterinburg quashed that decision and ordered a further inquiry.
On 19 June 2006 investigator Sh. once again refused to institute criminal proceedings in absence of any evidence of ill-treatment.
On 20 November 2006 the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court of Yekaterinburg, acting upon the applicant’s appeal against the investigator’s decision of 19 June 2006, closed the proceedings on res judicata grounds. It found that the applicant’s allegations had already been examined during the criminal proceedings leading to his conviction. On 13 December 2006 the Sverdlovsk Regional Court upheld the District Court’s decision on appeal.
