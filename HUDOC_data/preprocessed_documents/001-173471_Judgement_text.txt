The case originated in an application (no. 11318/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Songül Baştürk (“the applicant”), on 2 February 2010.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Şanlıurfa.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 22 July 2008 the applicant was dismissed from her post of officer in the army due to non-compliance with disciplinary rules and immoral behavior.
On 14 August 2008 the applicant brought an action before the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested the annulment of her dismissal.
On 16 June 2009 the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case taking into account “secret documents” submitted by the Ministry of Defence. These documents were not disclosed to the applicant.
On 29 September 2009 the applicant’s request for rectification was rejected by the same court.
