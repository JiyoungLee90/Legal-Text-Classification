Accordingly, it found that the claimants had lacked a legal interest in pursuing the claim. On 31 May 1999 the first-instance court dismissed the claim for lack of legal interest. That judgment was quashed on appeal, as it had failed to state whether there had been any procedural flaws regarding the payment requests. On 15 May 2003 the first-instance court accepted the claim and annulled the employer\u2019s payment requests. On 2 March 2005 the Skopje Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and rejected the claim as inadmissible (\u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430).

It therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s claim regarding the principal debt and interest is directly linked to the outcome of the compensation proceedings. It therefore awards the applicant EUR 1,880, which is the amount of the principal debt that she was ordered to pay to the employer (see paragraph 13 above). The Court also observes that the amount of interest was calculated by a bank. The Government did not contest that calculation. In such circumstances, the Court cannot but rely on that calculation and accept as established the amount specified by the bank. It further observes that the applicant was bound, pursuant to law and the court judgment of 23\u00a0November 2006, to pay the interest. It therefore awards the amount claimed in respect of interest in full. Consequently, the Court awards the applicant EUR 6,880 in respect of pecuniary damage.",
