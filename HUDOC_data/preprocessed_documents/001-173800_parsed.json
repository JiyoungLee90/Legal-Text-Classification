Be that as it may, it transpires that the applicant was initially constructive and made efforts to have contact with his daughter. Later, after a certain period of time characterised by a continuous frustration of contact, he must have become more agitated facing the hostility of his daughter and the lack of effort on the part of the authorities to enforce his contact with her.
