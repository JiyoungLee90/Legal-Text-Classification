The case originated in an application (no. 13204/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Károly Józsefné Pintér (“the applicant”), on 22 February 2011.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 15 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Csengőd.
After the death of the applicant’s father, his second wife brought an action about the inheritance against the applicant on 13 February 2004.
At first instance, the court partly found for the applicant on 21 December 2007 but, on appeal, the Szeged Court of Appeal quashed the decision and remitted the case.
In the resumed proceedings, the second-instance court quashed a decision again on 22 February 2010, as confirmed by the Supreme Court on 8 December 2010.
In the proceedings resumed again, the Bács-Kiskun County Regional Court partly found for the applicant on 27 May 2010. The judgment became final on 4 September 2010.
