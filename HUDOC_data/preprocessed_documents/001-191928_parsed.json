Thus, even without an express complaint from the applicant, a duty to investigate had already arisen at that stage. This is so because Article 3 of the Convention requires an official investigation in cases where there are sufficiently clear indications that illtreatment might have occurred (see Velev v.

That conclusion was based on the denial of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment by the police officers and their general statements, without any details, that the applicant had resisted arrest and that unspecified physical force and handcuffs had been used (see paragraphs 18, 20-22 above). However, the head of the police unit reported that day that no incidents had taken place during the arrest operation (see paragraph 19 above), and police officer A.S. only mentioned the refusal of those arrested to get out of the car and stated that he did not remember whether any injuries had been inflicted. The lack of detailed information about the force used, the applicant\u2019s injuries and any medical aid provided to him in the report on the arrest operation of 13 May 2006, the record of the applicant\u2019s arrest of the same date and the statements by the police officers and investigator A.A. (see paragraph 23 above) undermines the credibility of the authorities\u2019 conclusion (see Davitidze v. Russia, no.\u00a08810/05, \u00a7\u00a7 91 and 95, 30 May 2013; Ryabtsev v.

Russia, no. 36620/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57, 3\u00a0October 2017). The investigating authorities did not establish any specific acts of the police officers in using force and any actions on the part of the applicant which could have justified the use of force, failing to assess whether the use of force was indispensable and not excessive, as required by Article 3 of the Convention (see Ksenz and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 94 and 103). The applicant\u2019s allegations of police violence between his arrest and his placement in the pretrial detention facility were not verified and his forensic medical examination was never carried out.",
