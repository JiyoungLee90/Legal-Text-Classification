Consequently, the applicant\u2019s complaints, as laid down in the application form, concern matters which must be addressed from the angle of the adequacy of the mechanisms in place in order to maintain the deterrent power of the judicial system and the important role it plays in upholding the prohibition of torture (see, mutatis mutandis, Okkal\u0131, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).",

Therefore, the possibility of seeking and receiving compensation represents, in these cases, only one part of the measures necessary to provide redress for wilful illtreatment by State agents (see, mutatis mutantis, Nikolova and Velichkova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 7888/03, \u00a7\u00a7 55-56, 20\u00a0December 2007).",

This investigation led to the committal for trial of the accused gendarme for the offence of ill-treatment. However, no information was submitted by the Government to demonstrate that Mr T.\u00dc. was suspended from duty while being investigated or tried (see Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7\u00a055, 2 November 2004). Moreover, the Court notes that the proceedings in question did not produce any result due to the application of Law no. 4616, which created virtual impunity for the perpetrator of the acts of violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Bat\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, nos.\u00a033097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2004IV (extracts), and Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman, cited above, \u00a7 59). In this context, the Court reiterates its earlier finding in a number of cases that the Turkish criminal law system has proved to be far from rigorous and has had no dissuasive effect capable of ensuring the effective prevention of unlawful acts perpetrated by State agents when the criminal proceedings brought against the latter are suspended due to the application of Law no. 4616 (see Nevruz Ko\u00e7, \u00a7\u00a054, cited above, Ye\u015fil and Sevim v.
