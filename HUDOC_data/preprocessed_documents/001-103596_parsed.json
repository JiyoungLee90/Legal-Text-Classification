However, as stated above, while this element is to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 3 and may justify a longer period of detention than in a case concerning an individual offender, an alleged member of an organised criminal group is also entitled to the protection against unreasonably lengthy detention afforded by this provision (see paragraphs 39-40 above). As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant's continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 41-42 above). Moreover, as demonstrated by the ever increasing number of judgments in which the Court has found Poland to be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of applicants involved in organised crime, the present case is by no means an isolated example of the imposition of unjustifiably lengthy detention but a confirmation of a practice found to be contrary to the Convention (see, among many other examples, Celejewski v. Poland, cited above; K\u0105kol v.\u00a0Poland, no. 3994/03, 6 September 2007; Malikowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a015154/03, 16 October 2007; and also Hilgartner v. Poland, no.\u00a037976/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046-48, 3 March 2009, not final). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings in Kauczor as to the existence of a structural problem and the need for the  to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62).",
