The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible, and the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners, but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property under lawful contracts.",

The Court has also already accepted that Lithuania has chosen the principle of partial restitution to rectify old wrongs (see Pauk\u0161tis, cited above, \u00a7 81). The Court finds that as the decision to restore the property rights of L.N., the third and the fourth applicants was taken on 11 April 1995 (see paragraph 9 above) and the first decision to pay L.N., the third and the fourth applicants partial compensation had been adopted on 8\u00a0October 1996 (see paragraph 14 above), the assessment of the value of the buildings was at the value that they had in that particular year. In this context the Court cannot accept the claim of L.N., the third and the fourth applicants that they should be compensated for the full market value of the buildings, since no such right had been guaranteed to them under the applicable domestic law or in the judgment of 29 March 2010 (see paragraph 21 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Nekvedavi\u010dius (just satisfaction), cited above, \u00a7 20).
