At the material time S.D. had been suffering from diabetes. She was separated from her husband and lived with her son at her grandmother\u2019s house. She knew Mr Dimitrov as she had previously had an intimate relationship with him. She also knew Mr\u00a0Momin, who worked in a shop near her home. On the morning of 13\u00a0March 1998, after consuming alcohol the previous night, the two applicants had taken a taxi to S.D.\u2019s home. Mr Dimitrov had called S.D. and she had come out of the house. He had then grabbed her by the hand, threatened her and forced her into the taxi, where the other applicant, Mr\u00a0Momin, was waiting for them. The taxi had dropped them all off in front of a bar that was being refurbished in Plovdiv city centre. Mr Dimitrov, who had the keys, had opened the door and let Mr Momin in first, before pushing S.D. inside. The two applicants had then forced S.D. to undress. Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had threatened her and hit her several times. S.D. had suffered an episode of hypoglycaemia, and the applicants had made her swallow the contents of several sachets of sugar. They had carried on threatening her, holding her down and beating her, and in that way had forced her to have sex with each of them. Subsequently, they had all left the premises in a taxi, which had dropped the applicants off at a restaurant and S.D. at her home. She had confided in her relatives, who had persuaded her to alert the police. During the subsequent investigation, S.D. had been threatened by Mr\u00a0Dimitrov and people close to the two applicants in an attempt to make her withdraw her statement. Under pressure, S.D. had changed her version of events during the course of the investigation. She had then become seriously ill. The pressure on S.D. had increased further: she had been persuaded by a lawyer, apparently sent by Mr Dimitrov\u2019s employer, to sign a declaration withdrawing her statement and her complaint; the declaration had then been sent to the investigating bodies. S.D. had subsequently been questioned by a judge, had retracted her original statement and had given evidence about the pressure exerted on her during the investigation. On 25\u00a0June 2001 S.D. had died.",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence (see AlKhawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0118). In particular, the Court has established the following criteria in its case-law for assessing the compliance with Article 6 of a trial at which a witness statement has been admitted in evidence even though the defendant has not had the opportunity to examine or to have examined the witness in question: firstly, it must ensure that there was a good reason for the non-attendance of the witness at the trial; next, it must ascertain whether the applicant\u2019s conviction was based solely or to a decisive extent on the statement of the absent witness; and lastly, it must determine whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors, including strong procedural safeguards, to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured as a result of the admission of such evidence and to ensure that the trial, judged as a whole, was fair (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 147).",

The Court observes, for its part, that Mr\u00a0Dimitrov had been informed of the date on which S.D. was to be questioned by a judge, but did not attend (see paragraph 17 above). It is obliged to take this fact into account. Nevertheless, it observes that at that stage he did not have a lawyer who could have explained the importance of the questioning for the subsequent course of the proceedings (see paragraph\u00a039 above). Accordingly, having regard to its case-law in this area (see Dvorski v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no. 25703/11, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2015, and Pishchalnikov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7025/04, \u00a7 77, 24 September 2009), the Court cannot accept that Mr Dimitrov\u2019s absence amounted to a waiver of his right to examine the witness at a later stage of the proceedings. In the case of Mr\u00a0Momin, on the date of the questioning he had yet to be formally charged and the applicable domestic law did not require the authorities to notify him of that investigative measure (see paragraphs 17, 20, 39 and 41 above). The Court considers that this fact is also relevant in the present case. It does not rule out the possibility, having regard to the criminal complaint lodged by S.D. (see paragraph 6 above) and the questioning of Mr\u00a0Momin on 18\u00a0March 1998 (see paragraph 9 above), and with reference to the criteria outlined in Simeonovi (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 110 and 111), that this applicant could have been regarded as having been \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 of the Convention and thus as being entitled to the guarantees of that Article. However, this would not imply that Mr Momin, who had yet to be formally charged at that time, should have been invited to attend the questioning of S.D. on 19 December 2000. In the light of those circumstances, the Court considers that the fact that the two applicants were not present during the questioning cannot in itself amount to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3\u00a0(d) of the Convention.",

The investigating authorities therefore have a particular duty of care towards them, especially when it comes to taking their statements and arranging a confrontation with their alleged attackers (see Przydzia\u0142 v. Poland, no.\u00a015487/08, \u00a7 48, 24 May 2016). This was especially true in the present case, where the victim was also seriously ill and had come under pressure during the investigation to withdraw her complaint and alter her statement (see paragraphs 19 and 30 above). In view of these very specific circumstances, the Court cannot reproach the investigating authorities for not arranging a confrontation between S.D. and the two applicants at the preliminary investigation stage.",

However, there is no indication in the present case that either the investigator or the prosecutor knew that S.D.\u2019s condition was so serious that she might be unable to attend the trial. It must be noted that when questioned on 19\u00a0December 2000, S.D. had explained before the prosecutor that she had cancer but was feeling well (see paragraph 19 in fine above). The Court observes that the present case differs in that respect from Schatschaschwili (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 159 and 160), where the authorities knew that the key witnesses would probably not give evidence at the trial.",

The Regional Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation addressed and rejected their arguments in decisions that contained detailed reasoning and were not arbitrary (see paragraphs 29-36 and 38-40 above). In this connection, the Court attaches particular significance to the detailed and comprehensive analysis of the credibility of the victim\u2019s statement performed by the Regional Court with a view to ensuring fairness and due process (see paragraphs 64-69 above).",

It also finds that there were valid reasons for not arranging a confrontation between the two applicants and S.D. during the preliminary investigation. Although the applicants\u2019 subsequent conviction was based primarily on the statement by that witness, the courts also took other corroborating evidence into account. Moreover, in the criminal proceedings against the applicants, sufficient procedural safeguards were available to them to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured as a result of the admission of S.D.\u2019s statement and to ensure that the trial as a whole was fair: the applicants actively participated in the trial and submitted arguments in favour of their acquittal; the courts carried out a very careful analysis of the credibility of the main evidence against the applicants, considering their objections in that regard and providing reasons for rejecting them; and lastly, the domestic courts\u2019 decisions contained detailed reasoning and were not arbitrary.",
