It noted that the applicant had not behaved badly towards the child and that he had reported regularly for the meetings. His behaviour towards the child might have been awkward but this was due essentially to the fact that he did not actually know the girl as he had had very little opportunity to get to know her. The court referred to an expert opinion prepared for the purposes of the proceedings and concerning the child's psychological situation. K. was very hostile towards her father, despite the fact that she had had no personal experience with him capable of justifying her hostility. The mother had failed to take any steps to persuade the child to have contact with her father or to alter the negative image which the child had formed of him. The court found K.'s attitude alarming. It further noted that had the mother been dissatisfied with the scope or character of the applicant's access rights, it had been open to her to challenge them in separate proceedings. The present case was concerned only with the enforcement of the existing access rights as defined by the 1997 agreement and it was obvious that the mother was not complying with them.",

There may however be positive obligations inherent in an effective \u201crespect\u201d for family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for family life even in the sphere of relations between individuals, including both the provision of a regulatory framework of adjudicatory and enforcement machinery protecting individuals' rights and the implementation, where appropriate, of specific steps (see, amongst other authorities, X and Y v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 26\u00a0March 1985, \u00a7\u00a023, Series\u00a0A no. 91, and Zawadka v. , no. 48542/99, \u00a7 53, 23 June 2005). In both the negative and positive contexts, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community, including other concerned third parties, and the State's margin of appreciation (see, amongst other authorities, Keegan v.\u00a0Ireland, 26\u00a0May 1994, \u00a7\u00a049, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0290; Siemianowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a045972/99, \u00a7\u00a097, 6\u00a0September 2005). The Court has already repeatedly held that in matters relating to their custody the interests of children are of paramount importance. The child's best interests must be the primary consideration (see, to that effect, Gnahor\u00e9 v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a040031/98, \u00a7\u00a059, ECHR\u00a02000-IX) and may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents (see Sahin v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a030943/96, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR\u00a02003-VIII). In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article\u00a08 of the Convention to have such measures taken as would harm the child's health and development (Scozzari and Giunta v.\u00a0Italy [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0169, ECHR 2000-VIII, P., C. and S. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a056547/00, \u00a7\u00a0117, ECHR 2002-VI). The Court appreciates that in respect of very young children it is essentially for the courts to make an objective assessment, in the light of all the evidence available to them, whether the contact with the parent should be encouraged and maintained or not. However, as children mature and become, with the passage of time, able to formulate their own opinion on their contact with the parents, the courts should give due weight also to their views and feelings as well as to their right to respect for their private life.",

In so doing, it must determine whether the reasons purporting to justify any measures taken with regard to an applicant's enjoyment of his right to respect for family life are relevant and sufficient (see, amongst other authorities, Olsson v.\u00a0Sweden, 24\u00a0March 1988, \u00a7\u00a068, Series A no.\u00a0130; Wojciech Nowak v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a011118/06, \u00a7\u00a045, 8\u00a0June 2010).",

The custody and access rights were determined in the divorce judgment given two years later. Subsequently, several sets of proceedings were held in connection with the applicant's access rights as certain difficulties had arisen in their execution (see paragraph\u00a07 above). Ultimately, the 1997 agreement between the parties was concluded in the context of these proceedings. Hence, in the absence of cohabitation, the relationship between the applicant and K. did not have an opportunity to develop in a way usual for children of divorced parents, who have normally lived with the non-custodial parent and developed emotional ties with him or her.

Indeed, in its decision of 10\u00a0December 2001 the\u00a0 observed that the mother had not done anything to prevent the child from having contact with her father (see paragraph\u00a013 above). In its decision of 7\u00a0November 2005 the Warsaw-Mokot\u00f3w District Court stated that the mother was not to be blamed for making contact impossible (see paragraph\u00a021 above).

It notes that during her first and only conversation with the prosecutor in connection with that request, the child's mother agreed to having DNA tests carried out for the purpose of assessing whether it was advisable to bring the relevant proceedings before the competent court. In reply, the applicant refused to undergo the test himself and insisted that the prosecutor should institute judicial proceedings against the mother and child for denial of his paternity. In the Court's view, if the applicant had any reasonable grounds on which to harbour doubts as to his paternity, his refusal cannot but be considered irrational. The mother's readiness to have the paternity test carried out supports this view. Moreover, the applicant must have been aware that such an application would not be beneficial for his relationship with his daughter and would put his relationship with his former wife, which was already strained, under additional stress.",

The Court notes that the domestic authorities were also aware that the applicant's contact with her had become dependent not only on the attitude of the child's mother, but also on the girl's own wishes. It was the child's own approach to contact which was, at least from 2001, decisive in the failure of the contact arrangements. Already in 2001 the experts noted that K. was suffering fear and stress as a result of forced contact meetings with her father (see paragraph 13 above). In 2003 the experts informed the court that the child expressed hostility towards him and did not want to see him (see paragraph 16 above). The same conclusion was reached in the subsequent proceedings, held in 2004 and concerning the applicant's request to impose a fine on the mother (see paragraph 17 above). In its decision of 16\u00a0November 2004 the Warszawa Mokot\u00f3w District Court noted that the girl had consistently refused to see her father (see paragraph\u00a019 above). From June 2006, when K. was sixteen years old, the applicant had no further contact with her as she repeatedly refused to see him.",
