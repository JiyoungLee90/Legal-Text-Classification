The majority of the Court (Assessor Tordis Kvarv and the President) have found that the use of the dinghy instead of the dory did not lead to reduced safety, having regard to the purpose which the boat was originally supposed to serve. Particular weight is attached to the fact that the parties had agreed to meet close to the beach.  Although the precise meeting point had not been agreed, it must at least be accepted that they did not intend to go much further out than about 100 metres from the beach.  In this area the waters are calm.  Moreover, reference is made to the testimony of the prosecution expert witness, Mr Alv H\u00e5kon Klepsvik, Commander.  He testified in court that he saw no safety problems in using the rubber dinghy in, or just outside, B\u00e5tvika provided it was kept away from breakers or wave peaks.  He considered that, if one stayed in the middle of B\u00e5tvika or on the lee side, using the dinghy did not give rise to any problems.  Nor would he have had any hesitation in using the dinghy to receive a person from another boat.  He further testified that there was less risk of injury in transferring a person from a boat to another when the second was a rubber dinghy, and he thought that it would be preferable to use a rubber dinghy rather than a dory for that purpose.  As regards the fact that the dinghy was not fully pumped up, he stated that it was better to use a dinghy that was not fully inflated.  Nor did this reduce the dinghy's seaworthiness.  ",

In the view of the prosecution, the breach of the duty to use a dory was so serious that it amounted to neglect.  The City Court's view that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory did not lead to reduced safety was not a sufficient reason for holding otherwise.  The instructions had been laid down on the basis of several years' experience and with a view to the particular conditions at Jan Mayen and the fact that the Station officers are not necessarily accustomed to the sea and are only stationed there for a limited period.  These considerations suggested that, save in exceptional circumstances, the Station officer was strictly required to exercise care and to follow the instructions.  In the prosecution's opinion, the instruction could be departed from only if there was an emergency or if the service might thereby be carried out in a better or safer manner; that, however, was not the situation in the applicant's case.

Section 1 ..., entitled 'Purpose', reads: 'These are general provisions which are intended as guidelines for both official and leisure traffic on and around Jan Mayen.'  Even though the provisions initially give the impression of setting out 'guidelines', it is clear that they include binding rules, as shown by section 2 on sea traffic, the first paragraph of which reads: 'Excursions by boat in the sea around Jan Mayen without seagoing support vessel are generally prohibited.' However, the rule goes on to list various exceptions.  I would point out that the provisions on sea traffic clearly must cover the operation launched to receive the injured fisherman on that occasion, even though it was presumed that the transfer would be conducted relatively close to the shore.  I also find it clear that the provisions must apply to the landing operation, even though there is no mention of assistance to the fishing fleet here or elsewhere in the instructions for Jan Mayen.

In my opinion, however, what had already happened in the earlier stages constitutes such a serious matter that it must be deemed to constitute neglect under Article 78 para. 1.  I would note that counsel for the defence has contended before the Supreme Court that the duty to use a dory could not apply when a lifeboat was launched from the shrimp trawler.  I do not find that this [argument] can be accorded decisive weight in the present case, as it is clear from the City Court's judgment that the dinghy was not simply used as a backup on this occasion.

This was compounded by the fact that, as appears from the latter judgment and the prosecution appeal to the Supreme Court, the allegation that the applicant had a duty under the relevant rules to use a dory in the rescue operation and that his failure to do so constituted an offence under Article 78 para. 1 raised serious questions (see the Helmers v.  judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 17, para. 38).

In view of the nature of the offence, sentencing was, whatever the considerations relied on by the Supreme Court, capable of raising issues going to such matters as the applicant's personality and character (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow judgment cited above, p. 45, para. 67).

As stated by the City Court, and as was undisputed, the applicant used a rubber dinghy during the rescue operation instead of a dory.  The majority of the City Court had acquitted the applicant because, in their opinion, the use of a rubber dinghy did not lead to reduced safety.  The Supreme Court decided that the acquittal was based on an erroneous application of the law because the relevant provision made it obligatory for the applicant to use a dory.  The decision on this question of law would necessarily have been the same even if not only the applicant's counsel but he himself had been present at the hearing on 20 June 1989 and he had been afforded an opportunity to address the Supreme Court. Moreover, if the judgment of the City Court had been quashed and the case had been referred back to the court of first instance for retrial, the City Court would have been bound to follow the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law, namely that the relevant provision made it obligatory to use a dory in the rescue operation.  As to the sentence, it must be observed that, according to the applicant's own submissions both before the Norwegian courts and before the Convention institutions, he attached importance to the question of whether he was guilty of an offence but not to that of sentencing.  If it were otherwise he could have availed himself of the opportunity to be present at the appeal proceedings and to have asked for leave to address the Supreme Court.  Moreover, in its judgment the Supreme Court emphasised the fact that the applicant was only at fault in respect of his conduct during the preliminary stages of the rescue operation.  In addition the penalty imposed was lenient. Indeed, one can hardly imagine a less severe penalty.  Finally, in our view, the reference in the decision of the Court to the Kremzow v.  judgment of 21 September 1993 (Series A no. 268-B) is certainly not appropriate for this case. The special circumstances mentioned in paragraphs 67-68 of that judgment - relating to a murder trial resulting in a sentence of life imprisonment - are in no way comparable to the facts in the present case, where there was no particular need to assess the applicant's personality and character.
