The applicant further submitted that, during the period of his suspension, not only had a part of his salary had been withheld from him and he had been unable to exercise his judicial mandate, but at the same time he had continued to be subject to restrictions applicable to judges, such as not being able to conduct business, engage in political activities, or be gainfully employed.

Noting that the applicant\u2019s suspension was a temporary measure taken within the context of the proceedings on the merits of the disciplinary charges against him, the Court considers that the applicability of the said guarantees to his suspension is to be viewed also under the criteria established by the Court in the case of Micallef v.

Moreover, in terms of applicability, the Court reiterates that the Eskelinen criteria are pertinent to cases concerning the right of access to a court, just as much as they are for cases concerning the other guarantees embodied in this provision (see Baka [GC], cited above, \u00a7 106).",
