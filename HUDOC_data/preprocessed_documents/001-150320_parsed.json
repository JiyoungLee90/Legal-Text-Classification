He argued, in particular, that the Novosibirsk Regional Court\u2019s brief indication in its decision of 15\u00a0December 2004 that the preventive measure applied to him should remain unchanged could not serve as a sufficient legal basis for his continued detention. In this connection, the Berdsk District Court noted that the Novosibirsk Regional Court\u2019s decision, in so far as it had concerned the preventive measure, had been lawful as it had been taken in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law. It further did not consider it possible to release the applicant pending trial on account of the seriousness of charges against him and the fact that he was a foreign national and did not reside within the territory of Russia, with the result that he might abscond if at liberty or put pressure on witnesses. The court thus ordered that his detention be extended until 15\u00a0June\u00a02005.",

In its reasoning the court firstly noted that under Article 5 of the Convention everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in breach of that provision should have the right to compensation. It further noted that by virtue of the Berdsk District Court\u2019s judgment of 19\u00a0May\u00a02006 the applicant had been acquitted and his right to \u201crehabilitation\u201d had been recognised. On this basis the court found that he had been unlawfully prosecuted, unlawfully detained from 8 April 2003 to 15\u00a0March 2006 and, subsequently, unlawfully subjected to an undertaking not to leave a specified place. It further stated that, where a person\u2019s right to rehabilitation had been recognised, the existence of non-pecuniary damage was presumed and it was only the amount to be awarded that had to be established. For these purposes the court took into account the suffering caused to the applicant and the fact that his health had deteriorated.

This right includes the right to compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and the restoration of employment, pension, housing and other rights. The damage must be fully compensated, irrespective of whether the investigating authorities, the prosecution or the courts are at fault (paragraph\u00a01). Paragraph 2 confers the right to \u201crehabilitation\u201d on defendants who have been acquitted, against whom charges have been dropped, in respect of whom proceedings have been discontinued, or whose convictions have been quashed in their entirety or in part. However, no right to compensation arises where the prosecution has been terminated on \u201cnon-rehabilitation\u201d grounds, such as in the case of an amnesty or where the prosecution has become time-barred (Article 133 \u00a7\u00a04). Paragraph\u00a03 provides that \u201cany individual who has been unlawfully subjected to preventive measures in criminal proceedings shall have the right to rehabilitation\u201d. In a judgment acquitting an individual, a court has to explicitly state that he has the right to rehabilitation (Article\u00a0134). A claim for compensation for pecuniary damage is to be lodged with the same authority which issued the decision to acquit or terminate the prosecution (Article 135 \u00a7 2), whereas any claims for compensation for non-pecuniary damage are to be lodged with the civil courts and examined under the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Article 136 \u00a7 2).",

The absence of any of these elements creates in itself a strong presumption that the conditions of detention amounted to degrading treatment and were in breach of Article 3 (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 148). Where inmates appear to have at their disposal sufficient personal space, other aspects of physical conditions of detention could be relevant for the assessment of compliance with that provision. These include, in particular, access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, the availability of ventilation, the adequacy of heating arrangements, the possibility of using the toilet in private, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygiene requirements (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0149). The Court also reiterates in this connection its well-established caselaw that the mere fact of holding an applicant for a long period of time in an unadapted cell designed only for short-term detention discloses a violation of Article 3 (see Kim v. Russia, no. 44260/13, \u00a7 31, 17 July 2014; Aslanis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 36401/10, \u00a7 38, 17 October 2013, with further references; Kuptsov and Kuptsova v.

Furthermore, the Government conceded that during the applicant\u2019s detention the number of cellmates had exceeded the number of available beds. They also admitted that the cells had not been equipped with windows, tables or chairs, and that the toilets had offered no privacy. Recalling the structural nature of the problem of the conditions of pre-trial detention in Russian custodial facilities (see Ananyev and Others, cited above), the Court considers that these elements are sufficient to enable it to conclude that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in the Berdsk IVS amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",

The only ground for awarding the applicant compensation was the termination of the criminal proceedings against him rather than any alleged procedural irregularity in the pre-trial detention. This ground for compensation did not correspond to the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 and the alleged violation could not therefore be redressed in these proceedings (ibid., see also, mutatis mutandis, El\u011fay v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 18992/03, \u00a7 32, 20 January 2009 and Mekiye Demirci v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 17722/02, \u00a7 70, 23 April 2013).",

Russia, no. 6847/02, ECHR 2005X and Dirdizov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108-11; see also Zherebin v. Russia, no.\u00a051445/09, communicated on 13 November 2012). Each time, having found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the Court has noted a number of deficiencies in the reasoning employed by the Russian courts to authorise keeping an applicant in custody. From case to case it has pointed out the following major defects in the courts\u2019 arguments: reliance on the seriousness of the charges as the primary source to justify the risk of the applicant absconding; reference to the applicant\u2019s travel passport, financial resources and the fact that his alleged accomplices are on the run as the basis for the assumption that he would follow suit; a suspicion, in the absence of any evidence, that he would interfere with witnesses or use his connections in State bodies to obstruct justice; and a failure to thoroughly examine the possibility of applying another, less rigid preventive measure, such as release on bail.",

The Court notes that while accepting the investigators\u2019 allegations that the applicant was likely to avoid or pervert the course of justice, the courts gave no heed to the important and relevant facts supporting his requests for release and reducing the risk that he would abscond or collude. Among those, the Court can see that the applicant had a child, family and property in the Novosibirsk Region, was in a poor state of health and had no criminal record. There was no evidence that he had ever tried to contact the victims or witnesses in the course of the criminal proceedings, and he had offered to post bail. The Court notes also that when extending his detention after the first trial, the courts likewise failed to take into account the fact that he had already spent a considerable amount of time in detention. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the domestic courts failed to assess his personal situation and to give specific reasons, supported by evidence, for holding him in custody.",
