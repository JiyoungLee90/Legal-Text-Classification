The court noted that it had not carried out an examination at the scenes of the various operations, as requested by the intervening parties, since there had been an initial examination and there was no purpose in any further examination having regard to the time which had elapsed since the events in question. The court held that, according to the oral evidence given by the witnesses, in all three operations the area had first been sealed off and the deceased given warnings many times by megaphone. According to some witnesses, the deceased had started shooting from the windows and the security forces had fired back. Some witnesses had stated that they could not tell clearly who had fired first. However, other witnesses confirmed that they had first heard shooting from the flats. The court therefore found it established that the police had given the necessary warnings and that, on being fired at, had started shooting back. It considered that, in all three cases, the defendants had acted in accordance with their orders and within the scope of their duties. It found that the acts of the accused had remained within the limits of legitimate self-defence.",

Both courts took evidence from the accused police officers involved in the operations and from various witnesses. The Sixth Assize Court determined that in the three locations which were the subject of the charges before it the areas had first been sealed off and the deceased given warnings by megaphone. As to the question whether the deceased or the security forces had fired first, certain of the witnesses stated before the Sixth Assize Court that the deceased had started shooting from the windows and that the security forces had returned fire, while other witnesses stated that they could not tell clearly who had fired first. On the basis of this evidence the court found it established that the police had been fired at first and that, in entering the apartments and killing all the suspected members of Dev-Sol, they had acted in accordance with their orders and within the scope of their duties and that their actions remained within the limits of legitimate self-defence. The Fourth Assize Court, which was concerned with the killing of \u0130brahim Ilc\u0131 and Bilal Karakaya during the police raid at the first location, likewise found that the deceased had opened fire first and that the police officers had fired back in lawful self-defence and in the performance of their official duties.",

The Court accepts that police chiefs, while planning the operation, could reasonably make a number of suppositions on the basis of their experience in dealing with the armed DevSol group, in particular that the suspected members of this group would be armed and would be likely to use their arms if confronted. It is also true that the authorities operated on the basis of limited information as to the actual weapons kept by the suspects in each of the premises.

The Court has been provided with no evidence that clear instructions were issued by superiors as to how to capture and detain the suspects alive or as to how to negotiate a peaceful surrender, which must have increased the risk to the lives of any who might have been willing to surrender.

Because of the inadequacies of the investigation by the national authorities, the Court is not able to rely with confidence on the findings of the domestic Courts on either of these points. Moreover, the lack of contemporary forensic and other evidence, notably photographic, fingerprint and ballistics evidence, as well as evidence derived from an examination of the clothing of the deceased, makes it difficult to arrive at a clear assessment as to the manner in which the ten suspects lost their lives.",

It was his view that the tiles showed evidence of a minimum of nine gunshots having been fired, all of which were directed downwards, as revealed by the bullet-strike marks, the evidence suggesting that the person at whom they were fired was on or close to the floor and within three metres of the shooter. He further found no evidence of gunfire from the floor upwards. The Court notes, in this regard, that the body of the \u0130brahim Erdo\u011fan appears from the police report to have been found in the main room of the apartment and, according to the autopsy report, bore nine gunshot wounds, six of which were to the back, five of them being fatal.",

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v.

Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial.
