It is established in Paragraph 2 of Article 30 of the Constitution that compensation for material and moral damage inflicted upon a person shall be established by law. Thus, the necessity to compensate material and moral damage inflicted upon a person is a constitutional principle ... This constitutional principle is inseparable from the principle of justice entrenched in the Constitution: all the necessary legal preconditions must be created by law in order to justly compensate for the inflicted damage. Thus, the Constitution imperatively requires to establish by law such legal regulation that a person, who has sustained damage as a result of unlawful actions, would be able in all cases to claim just compensation for that damage and to receive that compensation. ... [It] should be emphasised that it does not follow from the Constitution that it is possible by law to establish some exceptions, under which the moral and/or material damage inflicted upon the person is not compensated, for example, because of the reason that it was inflicted by unlawful actions of officials or institutions of the State itself. If the law, let alone another legal act, established such legal regulation whereby the State would fully or partially avoid the duty to justly compensate for material and/or moral damage inflicted by unlawful actions of the State institution or [its] officials, it would mean not only that the constitutional concept of compensation for damage is disregarded and that this is not line with the Constitution (inter alia, Paragraph 2 of Article 30 thereof), but it would also undermine the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the State itself as a common good of the whole society.",

The Court considers that the applicants\u2019 complaints do not fall under the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01, because they do not meet \u2013 neither alternatively, nor cumulatively \u2013 the criteria set out in the Court\u2019s established case-law, commonly known as the \u201cEngel\u00a0criteria\u201d: the legal classification of the offence under national law; the very nature of the offence; and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. In particular, Articles\u00a01 and 44 \u00a7\u00a06 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings specifically refer to the Code of Civil Proceedings as regards litigation for lifting fines (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the offences that had been imputed to the applicants had not been classified as criminal under national law \u2013 they were of labour law nature and were not punishable by imprisonment. Besides, it has not been argued that the applicants risked imprisonment even if they had failed to pay the fines (see and compare, most recently, Mihalache v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a054012/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-62, 8\u00a0July 2019, and the case-law cited therein). That being so, the Court also recalls that the fine imposed on the applicants was based on a provision of the Labour Code (see paragraph\u00a035 above), which regulates relations within, inter alia, private companies, and therefore is not of a purely public law character. Bearing this in mind, and given the pecuniary nature of the dispute, the Court considers that the outcome of those proceedings affected their \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

Nevertheless, case-law acknowledged that the lack of such express regulation could not be used to deprive a person of the right to request compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions of State officials, and that therefore the reimbursement of such legal costs in response to a claim for damages under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code was a reasonable and fair solution. Accordingly, since they had been formally unable to file a claim for the reimbursement of legal costs during the administrative proceedings, they had resorted to the only possible alternative \u2013 separate proceedings for damages. In that context, the applicants also referred to the administrative courts\u2019 case-law establishing the \u201closer pays\u201d principle. In the applicants\u2019 case, the fact that the court found the State Labour Inspectorate\u2019s decisions unlawful and quashed them meant that the applicants had won the case, and had accordingly acquired, under the doctrine both of the Constitutional Court and of the administrative courts, the right to reimbursement of the legal expenses by the losing party \u2013 the State. Any requirement for the winning party to prove any additional clauses to gain the right to reimbursement of litigation costs would contradict not only the \u201closer pays\u201d principle but also the practice of the Constitutional Court (they referred to the ruling of 19 August 2006, cited in paragraph\u00a026 above). The applicants thus emphasised that any risk of error on the part of public authorities had to be borne by the State itself and that errors could not be dealt with at the expense of the individuals concerned.",

It did not prevent them from choosing to be represented by an advocate, inter alia because Article 272 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Law Violations (see paragraph\u00a036 above) entitled them to the legal assistance of an advocate during court proceedings. That right also flowed from the Law on the Bar (see paragraph 31 above), which provided that a person had the right freely to choose the advocate whom he considered the most suitable and reasonable for a particular case. Given that the applicants had been found administratively liable under Article\u00a041 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Administrative Law Violations, which concerned specific labour legal relations, they had also chosen a lawyer specialising in labour law, as allowed under Article 6 of the Law on the Bar.

Firstly, the Government\u2019s position that they could have chosen not an advocate but a trainee advocate or a person with a university degree in law, did not refute the fact that even in such a situation they would have had to incur legal costs. Moreover, the claim that they could have applied to a lower-skilled specialist, in comparison with an advocate \u2013 with higher professional requirements \u2013 clearly ran counter to the constitutional right to defend his or her rights in court effectively, rather than declaratively. Secondly, the Government\u2019s proposal that the applicants could have applied to the State Labour Inspectorate \u2013 with which institution a dispute was pending \u2013 for a consultation could only be seen as a \u201ccynical approach\u201d to a person\u2019s rights. Thirdly, the mere fact that the applicants did not have to pay court fees for filing a lawsuit did not mean that this in itself was a sufficient effective remedy, or removed their right to conduct the proceedings through a qualified advocate as their representative. Fourthly, the Government had not argued that the litigation costs incurred by the applicants had exceeded the maximum amounts to be awarded according the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Recommendations. Even if the costs incurred by the applicants had exceeded those set out in the Recommendations, that would have led to the reduction of the costs awarded to the applicants but not the outright rejection of their claims. It was likewise irrelevant to argue that the applicants could have paid their legal costs in instalments, since this would not have changed their final financial situation.",

The fact that the Government\u2019s position was based not on legal but exclusively on economic grounds was also clear from their statement that the requirement to reimburse legal expenses in all administrative proceedings would impose a disproportionate financial burden on the State. Obviously, such a situation \u2013 restricting an individual\u2019s right to recover the costs incurred in court when challenging the unlawful acts of public authorities, with the sole aim of reducing the possible financial burden on the State \u2013 was incompatible with the doctrine of the Constitutional Court as well as with the Convention. Moreover, as the Government had acknowledged, the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Recommendation set the upper limits on the legal costs awarded by the courts for legal services. This meant that the State\u2019s interests in protecting the disproportionately high financial burden associated with the obligation to defray legal expenses to the winner of the case was protected by law, while the latter\u2019s right to reimbursement of such costs, as the applicants\u2019 example showed, was not adequately ensured.",

According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, the possibility of reimbursing the litigation costs incurred during the proceedings contesting the administrative violation was not explicitly established in legislation \u2013 either the Code of Administrative Law Violations, the Law on Administrative Proceedings, or any other piece of legislation, and either at the time material to the applicants\u2019 litigation or at the present time.

This also covered a possibility to be awarded the litigation costs incurred during the court proceedings seeking to contest such actions. Such a legal regime had also been confirmed by the domestic courts (they referred to the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision of 14\u00a0July 2011, see paragraph\u00a038 above). However, the Government disagreed with the applicants\u2019 interpretation of the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of 19\u00a0August 2006 (see paragraph\u00a026 above). In fact, the Government considered that the right to compensation for damage inflicted by the actions of State institutions or officials arose only when those actions had been found to be unlawful. This was not the situation in the present case, where the State Labour Inspectorate\u2019s decisions had been quashed only on the basis of a different assessment of the factual circumstances concerning the methods of posting work schedules. The courts had not established that the officers of the State Labour Inspectorate had failed to act properly when drawing up the administrative-law violation reports against the applicants. The dismissal of a case of administrative violation of the law could not per se be unequivocally regarded as an acknowledgment of unlawful action on the part of State officials (in support of this argument they referred to the Supreme Administrative Courts\u2019 ruling cited in paragraph 40 above).

In that case, the Court found the right of access to a court to be an inherent aspect of the safeguards enshrined in Article 6, referring to the principles of the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power which underlay much of the Convention. Thus, Article 6 \u00a7 1 secures to everyone the right to have a claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no.\u00a076943/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a084\u201389, 29\u00a0November 2016, and the references therein).",

In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see, for example, Mihajlovi\u0107 v.

They availed themselves of that option by suing the State Labour Inspectorate, challenging the fines imposed by that entity (see paragraphs 9 and 17 above). That being so, and contrary to what has been suggested by the Government, the Court is not ready to hold that this, of itself, satisfies all the requirements of Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01. The Court recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Zubac v. Croatia [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).\u00a0The Court finds it reasonable to accept that the applicants\u2019 intention in going to court was not to participate in court proceedings as an academic exercise, but rather to obtain a result. It refers to the applicants\u2019 statement that going to court to defend their rights is pointless if in the end they are in a worse situation than they were before litigating (see paragraph 57 above). This was exactly what occurred in this case, since the financial burden on each of the applicants was nearly double or treble that which they had initially faced. Accordingly, and although they enjoyed access to court, the Court finds that the ex post facto refusal to reimburse their costs nevertheless constituted a hindrance of the applicants\u2019 right of access to court (see, mutatis mutandis, Klauz v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a028963/10, \u00a7\u00a077, 18\u00a0July 2013, with further references).",

The Court however shares the applicants\u2019 view that legal aid as afforded by the State was an individual right and not an obligation that had to be exercised. All the more so, it did not prevent them from choosing to be represented by an advocate (see paragraph 54 above). In this connection, the Court also cannot agree with the Government\u2019s suggestion that the applicants should have chosen to be represented by a person of a lesser calibre than an advocate, in order to mitigate the costs. As correctly pointed out by the applicants, this argument as put forward by the Government appears to be primarily based on economic considerations, and disregards both the case-law of the Constitutional Court, which emphasises the importance of the right to have an advocate to defend a person\u2019s interests (see paragraph 33 above), as well as the Court\u2019s case-law which also highlights the special role of lawyers, as independent professionals, in the administration of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Correia de Matos v. Portugal [GC], no.\u00a056402/12, \u00a7\u00a0139, 4\u00a0April 2018). In this context the Court also refers to the Law on the Bar, which provides that advocates have a right to specialise in a certain field of law. As pointed out by the applicants and not rebutted by the Government, they had advocates of their own choosing specialising in labour law to challenge the lawfulness of the fines imposed on them by the State Labour Inspectorate, and the success of the applicants\u2019 appeals may be regarded as an indication that their decision to engage advocates was vindicated (see paragraphs 9, 17 and 54 above).",

While recalling that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law and that the Court\u2019s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Markovic and Others v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a01398/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0107 and 108, ECHR 2006XIV), the Court takes note of a number of rulings given by the domestic courts, including the Supreme Administrative Court, which demonstrate that legal costs, although the matter of their compensation is not explicitly regulated in the Code of the Administrative Law Violations, are reimbursed on other legal bases, including the Constitution (see paragraphs 38 in fine, 39 and 44 above). This has also been acknowledged by the Government (see paragraph\u00a062 above). At the same time, the Law on Administrative Proceedings clearly provides that legal costs are determined in accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph\u00a037 above). The latter Code in turn refers to the principle that the \u201closer pays\u201d, which has also been relied upon by the administrative courts in a number of cases concerning reimbursement of legal costs of administrative litigation (see paragraphs\u00a034, 40 and 43 above). The Court also notes the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that the State should not leave a person in a disadvantageous situation (see paragraph 26 above; as to the principle that the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned, although in the context of Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 to the Convention, see Beinarovi\u010d and Others v. Lithuania, nos.\u00a070520/10 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a0140, 12\u00a0June 2018). It also transpires from the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s practice that legal costs have been reimbursed without any apparent failure to act diligently by the authorities whose actions have been impugned (see paragraph\u00a045 above).",

On this point, the Court also refers to the applicants\u2019 argument that they had been formally unable to file a claim for the reimbursement of legal costs during the first set of court proceedings (see paragraph 53 above; for a similar situation and analogous sequence of court proceedings see paragraph\u00a042 above), this argument not having been contested by the Government (see also paragraph 46 above). Indeed, and being careful not to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts, the Court cannot but observe that the applicants\u2019 claims were rejected not on the basis of Article\u00a098 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for its interpretation by the Supreme Court, see paragraph\u00a046 above), but on the basis of the administrative courts\u2019 understanding that the State Labour Inspectorate employees\u2019 actions had not been unlawful.",

At this juncture, the Court has regard to the Lithuanian courts\u2019 decisions in other cases, in which they noted that disproportionately high or unjustified legal costs could always have been refused (see paragraphs\u00a041 and 44 above). Such an examination of proportionality is absent in the applicants\u2019 case. The Court also cannot find, and it has not been suggested, that the litigation costs which the applicants incurred in the instant case were excessive or beyond what the Recommendations by the Ministry of Justice\u2019s indicated (see paragraph\u00a055 above). Lastly, it observes that the second applicant showed good faith by referring to the principle of procedural economy, and asking that his case be joined to the first applicant\u2019s case so that he would not suffer even more pecuniary losses from litigation costs (see paragraph\u00a019 above), a request which apparently was denied. Against this background the Court therefore finds that, irrespective of whether the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation of the domestic law in the applicants\u2019 case was arbitrary (see paragraphs 65 and 67 above), the resulting disproportion created an individual and excessive burden on the applicants.",
