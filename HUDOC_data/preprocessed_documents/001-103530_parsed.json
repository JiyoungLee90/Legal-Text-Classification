It decided the applicant's appeal at a session held in private, the date of which was communicated to the public prosecutor under section 361 (1) of the Act (see paragraph 12 above). The public prosecutor attended the session and submitted a final oral statement requesting that the applicant's appeal be dismissed. The Court of Appeal addressed this statement in its decision. The applicant was not present and could not have replied to that position. In this connection the Court notes that the applicant did not exercise his right under section 362 (1) of the Act (see, a contrario, Nasteska v. the , no. 23152/05, \u00a7 17, 27 May 2010). In result, he was not informed of the Court of Appeal's session. Furthermore, that court did not request his attendance although it had such jurisdiction under section\u00a0362 (1) of the Act (see paragraph 13 above). In the Court's view, the applicant's failure to request notification should not be taken to his prejudice given the statutory inequality that the Act created by having provided only the public prosecutor with a right to be apprised of the Court of Appeal's session automatically, while restricting that right for the accused only in case he or she requires so. The Government did not provide any reasonable explanation for this procedural inequality flowing from the Act. Furthermore, it is obvious that such privilege is limited only for the public prosecutor (section 361 (1) of the Act) and does not concern any other private individual acting as a prosecutor (section 362 (1) of the Act). The Court sees no reason why such preferential treatment is offered to the public prosecutor, as a State body, which acts as a party to the proceedings and accordingly the applicant's adversary.",

The majority considered that the Criminal Proceedings Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), by having provided only the public prosecutor with a right to be apprised of the Court of Appeal's session automatically, while restricting that right for the accused only in case he or she requires so, created a statutory inequality, which in itself was contrary to a fair trial.",

However, we emphasise that the Court's role is not to rule in abstracto on the compatibility of the national legislative provisions with the Convention, but to ascertain in concreto what effect the application of the Act had on the applicant's rights under Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 28).",

This requirement did not entail the completion of any particularly complex formalities: a simple indication in his appeal in this respect would have sufficed. Had the applicant made such request in his appeal, the Court of Appeal would have been obliged, ex lege, to notify the applicant about its session. Consequently, his omission to request notification about the date of session could be regarded as an unequivocal, albeit implicit, waiver on his part of the right to attend the appeal session (see, mutatis mutandis, Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7\u00a7 77-103, ECHR 2006XII). That he defended himself in person and not through a legal representative was a matter of his own choice and cannot be understood as implying that he was not capable of realising the consequences of this failure.",

We cannot therefore agree with the majority that the violation of the principle of equality of arms stemmed directly from the Act.",
