The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the conflict between the parents, and their ensuing lack of communication, posed a risk to successful contact. However, the course of the proceedings had shown that both parents were unwilling to settle these conflicts by availing themselves of specialist help.

Against this background, the mother\u2019s personal responsibility appeared to be minor.

The demands on her educational capabilities had been high, as she had not only been obliged to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a period of a few weeks, but also to change the child\u2019s established pattern of behaviour. It had further to be taken into account that comparable contraventions would not have to be sanctioned in the mid-term future, because a contact custodian had been appointed.

Given the extremely complex and contentious situation, the District Court\u2019s assessment of the degree of the mother\u2019s accountability was comprehensible.

These contact meetings were to be followed by unsupervised visits. On 21 July 2010 the applicant asked the District Court to impose an administrative fine of at least EUR 3,000 on the mother, as none of the visits had taken place as scheduled. On 11 August 2010 the applicant lodged a further request for the remaining dates. On 12\u00a0November 2010 the District Court, jointly ruling on both requests, imposed an overall administrative fine of EUR 300 on the mother for having contravened six times the decision on contact rights. Even though the mother paid this sum in June 2011, none of the supervised visits took place as scheduled.",

The Court notes, at the outset, that the District Court\u2019s decision contains no information on the financial situation of the mother. Nevertheless, it cannot but observe that the overall administrative fine of EUR 300 appears to be rather low, given that the pertinent provisions allowed for the imposition of a fine of up to EUR 25,000 for each individual case of non-compliance. It is thus doubtful whether this sanction could reasonably have been expected to have a coercive effect on the child\u2019s mother, who had persistently prevented contact between the applicant and his son. The Court takes note of the District Court\u2019s reasoning that even though the child\u2019s mother was accountable for the failed contact, her personal responsibility proved to be minor, as the demands on her educational capabilities had been high and as she had been obliged \u201cnot only to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a few weeks, but also to change the child\u2019s established pattern of behaviour\u201d (see paragraph 30, above).",

Having regard to the fact that the mother must have been made aware during the previous court proceedings of her general obligation to allow the applicant contact to his son, it is difficult to follow the District\u2019s Court\u2019s reasoning that the mother had to reconsider her stance on the problems \u201cwithin a few weeks\u201d. The Court further observes that the decision contains no information on whether the mother had at least attempted to meet her obligations under the contact order by encouraging the child to meet the applicant. The Court finally observes that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal, in its decision given on 17 September 2014 (see paragraph\u00a080, above), conceded that the administrative fine imposed on the mother might have been insufficient.",

Finally, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that it was unlikely that the situation would repeat itself, given that the family court had, in the meantime, set up contact custodianship. Even if a contact custodian had more effective means at his disposal than a mere supervisor, it is hardly conceivable that he would be able to achieve his task of implementing contact rights without a certain degree of cooperation on the mother\u2019s side.",

The Court notes that the District Court did not give a separate decision on the applicant\u2019s first request, but awaited the submissions in reply to the subsequent requests before giving a decision. Given the special urgency of the subject matter, the Court is not convinced that the joinder, which caused a delay of several weeks, best served the interest of the efficiency of the proceedings. Furthermore, a delay of approximately one month occurred when the District Court awaited the return of the main case file from the Court of Appeal, even though the main proceedings before that Court had already been terminated six weeks before.

The Court observes that the applicant lodged two motions, and the defending party one motion, for bias against the District Court Judge, each of which caused a delay of several weeks. A further delay of almost five months was caused by the fact that the applicant rejected the courtappointed expert on grounds of bias. While this rejection was ultimately successful, it has not been established that the grounds for the suspicion of bias lay within the sphere of the District Court or could have been known to the District Court prior to his appointment. Hearings were postponed twice upon the request of the applicant, who finally stated that he was unfit to appear in court. The Court further observes that the applicant did not appear at any of the hearings scheduled by the Court of Appeal and rejected the Chamber of the Court of Appeal for failure to comply with his request to postpone a hearing.",

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, Akdivar and Others v.

A remedy therefore fulfils these criteria if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7 17, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII; and S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2006VII). However, in proceedings in which the length of the proceedings has a clear impact on the applicant\u2019s family life (and which thus fall to be examined under Article\u00a08 of the Convention) the Court has considered that a more rigid approach is called for, which obliges the States to put into place a remedy which is at the same time preventive and compensatory (see Macready, cited above, \u00a7 48; and Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46). The Court has observed in this respect that the State\u2019s positive obligation to take appropriate measures to ensure the applicant\u2019s right to respect for family life risked becoming illusory if the interested parties only had at their disposal a compensatory remedy, which could only lead to an a posteriori award for monetary compensation (see Macready, ibid.).",
