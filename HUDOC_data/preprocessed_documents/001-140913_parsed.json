For instance, in a recent case of Norkin v. Russia ((dec.), no.\u00a021056/11, 5\u00a0February 2013) the applicant obtained a final judgment in 2010 awarding him derisory compensation in respect of unacceptable conditions of detention he had endured in a remand centre in 2007. The Court considered that by that time, its case-law on the absence of an effective remedy for complaints concerning inadequate conditions of detention had been sufficiently established (see Mamedova v. Russia, no.\u00a07064/05, \u00a7 55, 1 June 2006; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, \u00a7 39, 29 March 2007, and Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, \u00a7 20, 10 May 2007). The Court concluded that the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the inadequate conditions of his detention should have been lodged within six months of the day following his transfer out of the remand centre. The applicant should have been aware of the ineffectiveness of the judicial avenue he had made use of, long before he lodged his application with the Court.",

Russia the Court also mentioned that in older cases concerning conditions of detention and domestic proceedings before 2007, as in the present case, a different approach could be warranted. Indeed, at the time there were only two examples of case-law in which the Court rejected as unsubstantiated the Russian Government\u2019s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in relation to conditions of detention in remand centres (see Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a047095/99, 18\u00a0September 2001, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a062936/00, 9\u00a0December 2004). In several cases lodged in 2003, the Court calculated the six-month period as starting to run from the date of the final judgment in a civil action for compensation in the cases in which it found no indication that the applicant, having no access to legal advice, was aware, or should have become aware, of the futility of that action (see, among others, Skorobogatykh v. Russia, no. 4871/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 22\u00a0December 2009; Roman Karasev v. Russia, no. 30251/03, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 25\u00a0November 2010, and Gladkiy v.

Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for hearings or other procedural acts would have no bearing on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 78).

The Government\u2019s assertion about three meals per day is unsubstantiated. They did not account for the contradiction between their submissions and the results of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry, in particular as regards the provision of bedding. It also appears that the sanitary facilities in the cell were unsatisfactory and were not sufficiently partitioned off for privacy. Lastly, despite referring to a logbook relating to the provision of daily outdoor walks to detainees, the Government omitted to submit any such document. Thus, the Government failed to confirm that the applicant had regular outdoor exercise and was not confined in the cell for the majority of his time in the TDC. It has not been argued that the difficulty of the applicant\u2019s situation was in any significant way attenuated for some reason, for instance on account of the time spent out of the TDC during the trial.",

Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to provide photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or the amount of natural light. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention, mentioning specific factors, such as the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. A credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government (see also Sakhvadze v. , no. 15492/09, \u00a7 87, 10\u00a0January 2012). Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation), as in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting allegations, for instance as to conditions of detention (see Idalov v.

In view of the vulnerable position of detainees, it should be incumbent on the State to dispatch their correspondence to the Court by registered mail, which allows for traceability. In breach of domestic law, detention facilities kept no record of the date the correspondence was actually dispatched, while also omitting to indicate the date when it was received from the detainee. This omission made it possible for correspondence to the Court being delayed, or even overlooked, as appeared to be the case with the letters of 19 August 2005 and 29 May 2006, neither of which reached the Court.",
