Accordingly, Mr Damir Mammadov is still entitled to the enforcement of the judgment in his favour. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicants, as far as possible, are put in the position they would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). Having regard to the violation found, the Court finds that this principle also applies in the case of Mr Damir Mammadov (application no. 7526/10). It, therefore, considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment in his favour.",
