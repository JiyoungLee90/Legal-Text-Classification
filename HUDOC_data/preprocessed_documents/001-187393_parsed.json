By way of example, it notes that following the remittal of the case on 24 October 2002, it took the District Inspector nearly six months to issue a decision (see paragraph 13 above). Subsequently, there was a period of seven months of inactivity between the Mayor\u2019s decision of 25\u00a0July 2005 and the decision of the District Inspector of 21\u00a0February 2006 (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). The Court further notes that there were other unexplained periods of inactivity in the subsequent proceedings, such as a period of nearly two and a half years between 30\u00a0July\u00a02009, when an inspection of the site was held, and the District Inspector\u2019s decision of 8\u00a0December 2011 (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Lastly, there was a period of nearly four years of inactivity when the case was before the Regional Inspector (from 27 December 2011 until 26 October 2015) (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above).",
