With regard to the jurisdiction of the Swiss courts, he argued that the purpose of the introduction of a forum of necessity in section 3 of the LDIP (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a037 below) had been to avoid denials of justice, especially in cases of political persecution, and that he had provided sufficient evidence that he could not reasonably bring proceedings before a foreign court. As to the immunity from jurisdiction purportedly enjoyed by Tunisia and A.K., the applicant submitted that the exercise of public power did not include an entitlement to commit international crimes such as torture. He specified in this regard that the very definition of torture in Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of 10 December 1984 (hereafter: \u201cthe Convention against Torture\u201d; see paragraphs 45 et seq. below) ruled out any immunity.

Specific obstacles that impede the enjoyment of the right to redress and prevent effective implementation of article 14 include, but are not limited to: inadequate national legislation, discrimination with regard to accessing complaints and investigation mechanisms and procedures for remedy and redress; inadequate measures for securing the custody of alleged perpetrators, State secrecy laws, evidential burdens and procedural requirements that interfere with the determination of the right to redress; statutes of limitations, amnesties and immunities; the failure to provide sufficient legal aid and protection measures for victims and witnesses; as well as the associated stigma, and the physical, psychological and other related effects of torture and ill-treatment. In addition, the failure of a State party to execute judgements providing reparative measures for a victim of torture, handed down by national, international or regional courts, constitutes a significant impediment to the right to redress. States parties should develop coordinated mechanisms to enable victims to execute judgements across State lines, including recognizing the validity of court orders from other States parties and assisting in locating the assets of perpetrators.\u201d",

She had attempted, unsuccessfully, to bring a civil action for compensation before the Australian courts against, inter alia, the former President of China and a member of that country\u2019s communist party. The action had been dismissed by the Australian courts on the grounds that members of the government of a foreign State enjoyed immunity. The Committee, called upon to examine the case, reiterated its approach concerning the geographical application of Article 14 of the Convention against Torture, but dismissed the communication, accepting that the State Party had been unable to establish its jurisdiction for acts of torture committed outside its territory by officials of another State (references omitted):",

The Committee also notes the complainant\u2019s assertion that article 14 applies irrespective of the places of the acts of torture; and that, because the Australian courts have not declined jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens, the State party is required to afford an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation. The Committee recalls its general comment No. 3 (2012) on the implementation of article 14 by States parties, in which it considers that \u2018the application of article 14 is not limited to victims who were harmed in the territory of the State party or by or against nationals of the State party\u2019 and that \u2018article 14 requires States parties to ensure that all victims of torture and ill-treatment are able to access remedy and obtain redress\u2019.

Admittedly, it is evident that the obligation to put in place a compensation system lies on the State responsible for acts of torture, and on the State in which such acts were prepared or on the territory of which the torturers have attempted to obtain refuge. However, the system recommended by the Convention against Torture does not impose on a State an obligation to provide reparation in respect of acts having no connection with that State or for victims whose protection does not fall within its sphere of interest, whether that is expressed in terms of jurisdictional criteria, political stakes, or in any other manner.

These include the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment in the Ferrini case (6\u00a0November 2003, 11 March 2004), concerning Germany\u2019s liability for the claimant\u2019s arrest in Italy and his deportation to Germany during the Second World War. In the context of those proceedings, the Court of Cassation placed particular emphasis in its reasoning on the need to ensure respect for jus cogens as a fundamental value of the international community. Reference should also be made to a series of subsequent judgments delivered by the Italian courts against Germany in the period 2004-2008. One of those judgments declared enforceable in Italy a judgment by a Greek court which ordered Germany to compensate the victims of the Distomo (Greece) massacre of 10 June 1944. These Italian judgments were the subject of the judgment by the International Court of Justice (hereafter, \u201cthe ICJ\u201d) of 3 February 2012, in the case on Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy: Greece intervening), judgment, ICJ Reports 2012, p. 99), which found that Italy had breached customary international law guaranteeing States jurisdictional immunity.",

Saudi Arabia ([2006] UKHL 26), the House of Lords held that Article 14 of the Convention against Torture did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction, and that there was no evidence that States had recognised an international-law obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches of peremptory norms of international law. Equally, there was no consensus of judicial and learned opinion that they should. The House of Lords distinguished the Jones case from another case previously examined by it, namely Pinochet (no. 3) [ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 3) [2000] 1 AC 147], concerning the former Chilean dictator, on the grounds, specifically, that the Pinochet case concerned criminal proceedings which fell squarely within the universal jurisdiction mandated by the Convention against Torture (see \u00a7\u00a7 25-32 of the judgment). The House of Lords thus found no reason to set aside the applicability of the rule laying down absolute State immunity for acts committed by their representatives acting in their official capacity. That case subsequently came before this Court, which held that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Jones and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 34356/06 and 40525/06, ECHR\u00a02014).

However, this jurisdiction is subject to the condition that the victim is a Canadian citizen or is a permanent resident of Canada, or that the civil action has a \u201creal and substantial connection to Canada\u201d. In contrast, universal jurisdiction does not apply to actions in respect of damage sustained as a result of other violations of international law, including torture, except where it is shown that it took place in the context of acts of terrorism. In the case of Bouzari\u00a0v.\u00a0Islamic Republic of Iran ([2004] 243 DLR (4th) 406), the Ontario Court of Appeal held that Article 14 of the UN Convention against Torture did not impose an obligation on Canada to ensure civil-law remedies for acts of torture committed outside its territory.

In that case, the court accepted the complaint by the parents of a victim who had been tortured to death in Paraguay; the complaint was brought against the perpetrator of the impugned acts, who was then resident in the United States.

The broad scope of judicial power leads the courts to set limits on it. These limits are the equivalent of the grounds of jurisdiction in the civil-law tradition, in that they determine the cases that may be heard and determined by the courts. In the majority of cases, therefore, the aim is not to resolve a conflict as to proper jurisdiction by allowing for an additional or exceptional forum, but, conversely, to prevent too broad an exercise of judicial power at international level. To this end, an exception known as the forum non conveniens has been developed. Under this exception \u201ca national court can decline jurisdiction on the grounds that a court with equal jurisdiction, situated in another State, would, objectively speaking, be a more appropriate forum for examining a dispute, that is, before which the dispute could be suitably settled, for the interests of all parties and for the ends of justice\u201d (see House of Lords judgment in Spiliada Maritime Corporation/Cansulex Ltd, [1987] AC 460, esp. p. 476).

On receipt of this request, the police immediately contacted the hospital, which informed them that A.K. had indeed been a patient there, but that he had left the hospital on 11\u00a0February 2001 and had subsequently left Switzerland. The decision to discontinue the proceedings was not challenged by the applicant. The Court concludes that the Swiss prosecuting authorities cannot be accused of negligence in dealing with the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint.

Lastly, these \u201crights and obligations\u201d must be \u201ccivil\u201d ones within the meaning of the Convention, although Article\u00a06 does not itself guarantee any particular content for them in the substantive law of the Contracting States (see, for example, Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v.

Whether or not a right is to be regarded as civil within the meaning of that term in the Convention must be determined by reference not only to its legal classification but also to its substantive content and effects under the domestic law of the State concerned (see Perez v.

He referred to General Comment no. 3 (2012) of the United Nations Committee against Torture (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53 above), which stated that \u201c[t]he Committee consider[ed] that the application of article 14 [was] not limited to victims who [had been] harmed in the territory of the State party or by or against nationals of the State party ...

In this regard, he specified that Swiss practice contained numerous legal or case-law examples substantiating the notion that the \u201ccase\u201d [\u201ccause\u201d] could not be confined solely to the set of facts which gave rise to the legal question to be determined. In respect of those situations, the legislature or the courts had taken the view that if the action could not be brought in the forum to which it would ordinarily have been assigned, or if it could not reasonably be required that it be brought there, an alternative forum had to be provided in Switzerland where there existed a further connection, which might range from the nationality of one of the parties to the mere fact of property having been attached by the courts. In none of these situations was the fact that the legal basis for the action was to be found in another country regarded as inconsistent with recognition of an appropriate forum in Switzerland.",

He added that the situation had been such that the refusal by the Swedish court to accept jurisdiction had left the applicant with little choice but to apply to a foreign court, whose jurisdiction was not in dispute but which was manifestly inappropriate.

Ministry of Interior Al-Mamlaka Al-Arabiya as Saudiya and others [2006] UKHL 26, and Court of Appeal for Ontario, Bouzari v. Iran, cited above (see paragraph 73).

The Court notes that the possibility of joining a compensation claim to ongoing criminal proceedings presents fewer practical difficulties, given that such a claim can rely on the advantages inherent in the criminal proceedings, such as the institution and pursuit of the proceedings, of its own motion, by the competent prosecuting authority, or the centralised establishment and assessment of the facts and evidence as part of the investigation carried out by that authority. It is therefore natural and legitimate for the States to accept more easily such a procedure, namely joining the proceedings as a civil party, without however recognising universal jurisdiction in the context of autonomous civil proceedings. In any event, the Court points out that in the present case the applicant lodged a criminal complaint in 2001 and applied to join the proceedings as a civil party, but that the complaint was discontinued on the ground that A.K., the presumed perpetrator of the acts of torture, had left Swiss territory.",

With regard firstly to the text of this provision, it must be observed that Article 14, which enshrines in a general manner the right of victims of torture to obtain redress, is silent on how this right is to be implemented effectively and on the geographical scope of the States Parties\u2019 obligations to that end.

It is thus necessary to take them into account on a subsidiary basis and with a certain restraint when interpreting the terms of a treaty (see, to similar effect, the prudence expressed by the ICJ in the Case of Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain, Jurisdiction and Admissibility (judgment, ICJ Reports 1995, \u00a7 41). The Court further points out that the Chamber concluded that no concrete element could be derived from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires for the Convention against Torture with regard to the geographical scope of Article\u00a014 (see Chamber judgment, \u00a7 117). Having studied the matter itself, the Grand Chamber shares this opinion. Admittedly, the proposal by the Netherlands to include the words \u201ccommitted in any territory under its jurisdiction\u201d had disappeared when the Convention was adopted. However, the reasons for this omission remain unknown (see Manfred Nowak/Elizabeth McArthur, op.cit., paragraph 49 above). In those circumstances, it is difficult to attach decisive importance to it. It cannot therefore be concluded from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires that the authors of the Convention against Torture intended to accept universal jurisdiction in the framework of Article\u00a014.",

The Court does not share this view either. It cannot be ruled out that, faced with a text which makes no mention of this scenario and with travaux pr\u00e9paratoires which are almost silent on the subject, the States simply did not envisage the possibility of universal jurisdiction and, accordingly, did not feel obliged to enter reservations to Article 14 in order to exclude such jurisdiction from its scope.",

Moldova and Russia [GC], no.\u00a048787/99, \u00a7\u00a0312, ECHR 2004VII). In principle, the Convention applies within the area of jurisdiction of each High Contracting Party, defined in accordance with the applicable rules of international law. However the scope of the Convention is not always identical to the area of jurisdiction of the States Parties, jurisdiction in the sense of what is \u201clegally possible\u201d. On the one hand, if a State cannot effectively exercise full territorial jurisdiction over part of its territory, the Convention applies only to the extent that the State can effectively exercise its jurisdiction (see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, Series A no. 310; Cyprus v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 76-80, ECHR 2001IV; and Ila\u015fcu, cited above, \u00a7 312). On the other hand, if a State exercises its authority beyond its international area of jurisdiction, the actions undertaken fall within the scope of the Convention and must comply with the rights guaranteed by that treaty (compare with Ila\u015fcu, cited above, \u00a7 314, and \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2005IV). Furthermore, the States have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the Convention applies to the territories for whose international relations they are responsible.

A State is not obliged to prosecute persons suspected of acts of torture committed outside its territory where no other link exists between the State and those acts if those persons are not present within its territory. It is the suspected person\u2019s physical presence which in practice defines and limits the use of universal jurisdiction in criminal matters. The use of universal civil jurisdiction is, in principle, triggered by the claimant. The question of universal civil jurisdiction arises if the respondent is not resident in the territory of the State in which the action is brought. In such a situation, in the absence of assets that can be seized for the purpose of enforcement in the territory of the State concerned, the civil action may result in failure to recover the sums claimed.

I ought to point out that even without the above Convention, the prohibition of violations against human dignity, such as torture, slavery or racial discrimination, has already become jus cogens.",

He was then taken to Tunisia by Tunisian officials, and in the course of his subsequent detention in the premises of the Tunisian Ministry of the Interior was allegedly subjected to physical and psychological torture on the orders of A.K., the then Minister of the Interior.

I must clarify, of course, that when I say that section 3 and section 129 \u00a7 2 are mutually exclusive, I do not mean that the judge can pick the section he or she prefers and assume jurisdiction, since section 3 is subject to section 129 \u00a7 2 and any other provision of the LDIP which vests a Swiss court with ordinary jurisdiction.

Of course, as is rightly noted in paragraph 116 of the judgment, it is for the national courts to interpret and apply the domestic law and it is only when their interpretation is manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary that the Court may intervene.

This aspect of the principle of effectiveness is usually defined by the Latin maxim ut res magis valeat, quam pereat, literally meaning that \u201cit is better for a thing to have effect than to perish\u201d. In the present case, in my humble view, one can see that the result of the interpretation and application given to section 3 of the LDIP by the Swiss courts was manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary. This could be explained because the principle of effectiveness was not applied in reading the relevant provisions of the LDIP, the one in conjunction with the other, and the Act as a whole, so as to give full weight and effect to its object and purpose and achieve internal harmony or coherence as regards its interpretation. Of course, the concepts that the Convention or a domestic act must be read a whole, and \u201cthat the law should be coherent and selfconsistent\u201d, could be regarded as separate principles and interpretative tools in themselves, but they could simultaneously be considered as properties, faculties or elements of the principle of effectiveness. With due respect, the principle of effectiveness was not applied by the Swiss courts in the present case as they interpreted the relevant provisions of the LDIP in a manner that was incompatible with the relevant provisions of the Convention, namely, Article 6 of the Convention as well as Articles 1 and 13 of the Convention.",

However, the case-law frequently refers to the practical and effective manner in which the Convention provisions must be interpreted and applied; it is obvious that this is nothing other than the use of the principle of effectiveness as an interpretative method or tool. The following extract from El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ([GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7 134, ECHR 2012) clearly shows that the principle of effectiveness concerns the interpretation not only of substantive provisions but also of the procedural provisions of the Convention, and that it impacts on the obligations imposed on Governments:",

And what is even more strange is that this connecting factor, thus the locus commissi delicti, becomes relevant under section 129 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 only if the defendant does not have (a) his domicile, or (b) his habitual residence, or (c) his place of business, in Switzerland. As to the point in time these last connecting factors have to be present in order to vest the Swiss court with jurisdiction, it is apparent from these provisions that this is the point at which the action is brought before the Swiss court. It is therefore paradoxical for the Federal Supreme Court to hold, on the one hand, that when the acts of torture have taken place in a foreign country, only the facts related to that period of time are relevant, to the effect that they exclude its jurisdiction, irrespective of any sufficient connection between the applicant and Switzerland at the time that he lodged his action, and on the other hand, that if the acts of torture take place in Switzerland, the issue of whether the defendant has his domicile or habitual residence or place of business in Switzerland is examined with reference to the time that the action is lodged, and that these three connecting factors take priority over the locus commissi delicti, as explained above.",

The Court rightly notes in paragraph 209 of the present judgment that \u201cthe courts enjoy considerable discretion in defining the connecting links and applying them on case-by-case basis\u201d and \u201cin so doing the domestic courts most frequently take account of the nature of the dispute or the identity of the parties\u201d. This admission is extremely significant. The restrictive interpretation given to section 3 of the LDIP by the Federal Supreme Court and the Grand Chamber in the present case is refuted by this very admission. In the present case the nature of the original event is very important, in that the alleged acts are acts of torture falling within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention, one of the most fundamental provisions of the Convention and one which contains an absolute prohibition. As regards the identity of the parties, connecting factors such as nationality, domicile and residence may be relevant. These factors concern the person of an applicant, in other words his status, and are totally irrelevant to the question of where the alleged acts of torture took place. It is clear from the above considerations that the meaning of a \u201csufficient connection\u201d varies from topic to topic, but there is nothing to exclude the applicant\u2019s residence and domicile from being taken into consideration in establishing whether the case has a sufficient connection with Switzerland. As was noted in Marckx v. Belgium (13\u00a0June\u00a01979, \u00a7\u00a042, Series A no. 31), which also supports what is maintained with regard to the issue of arbitrariness, \u201c[i]t is for the respondent State, and the respondent State alone, to take the measures it considers appropriate to ensure that its domestic law is coherent and consistent\u201d.

One of these facts was that \u2013 after the applicant\u2019s alleged torture in Tunisia \u2013 he fled to Switzerland, where he has stayed with his family for many years. Another fact is that he sought refuge in 1993 in Switzerland, where he applied for asylum in the same year and where the Swiss authorities granted him asylum on 8\u00a0November 1995.

Substantial or sufficient connection with a country is by its nature a connecting factor belonging to ordinary international jurisdiction because there is nothing exceptional in it, since this factor is deeply rooted in or related to the forum. What is considered as a forum of necessity varies from country to country and depends on each country\u2019s ordinary rules of international jurisdiction.

By comparison, Article 6 of the Convention does not compel States to institute a system of appeal courts.
