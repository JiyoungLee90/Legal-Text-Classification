The most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan v.

First, the Court has had regard to the \u201cintensity\u201d of the suffering (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 167, Series A no. 25). Therefore, the special stigma of torture should be attached to \u201cdeliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering\u201d (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 96, ECHR 1999V; and G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2010). Second, the Court has noted the \u201cpurposive\u201d element in torture, namely \u201cthe aim,\u00a0inter\u00a0alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating\u201d (see Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2000X, and G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 90; see also Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment).",

Some forms of ill-treatment might not be sufficient to constitute torture by themselves, but might be so when attached to a particular purpose such as extracting information from a suspect. When the ill-treatment has been inflicted with the purpose of obtaining a confession, the Court has paid particular attention to that fact (see Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a064; Dikme v. Turkey, no. 20869/92, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, ECHR 2000VIII; Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2000VII, in which the Court had regard not only to the \u201cnature and degree of the ill-treatment\u201d but also to the \u201cstrong inferences that [could] be drawn from the evidence that it [had] occurred during interrogation\u201d; and Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 98).",

This should be viewed in conjunction with the fact that the treatment he suffered was severe enough to place it, in our view, at the boundary of what constitutes torture: according to his account of events, he was kicked and punched several times all over his body (see paragraph 7 of the judgment). The applicant\u2019s account was confirmed by a forensic medical expert who noted, inter alia, the existence of eleven bruises on his back and a further nineteen on his chest and stomach (see paragraph 15 of the judgment).",
