The applicant was a police officer in Zawiercie. The Zawiercie police conducted an investigation into a car theft. On 30 November 1992 the applicant was instructed to verify whether a certain B.Ł. was in possession of the stolen car. The applicant and the previous owner of the car arrived at the house of B.Ł. where her parents returned the car to the owner.
On 24 December 1992 the Mysłowice District Prosecutor charged the applicant with abuse of power by having intimidated the parents of B.Ł. into returning the car which had been purchased by their daughter. The prosecutor ordered the applicant’s detention for a period of one month. On the same day the Mysłowice District Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the detention order. On 30 December 1992 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor ordered the applicant’s release.
On 14 June 1993 the District Prosecutor altered the charges against the applicant.
On 21 February 1994 the prosecution service filed a bill of indictment with the Mysłowice District Court. The applicant was charged with abuse of power. The charge related to the applicant’s actions on 30 November 1992, when he had allegedly intimidated the parents of B.Ł. into returning the car purchased by their daughter from the previous owner.
B.Ł. took part in the proceedings as an auxiliary prosecutor. The trial court held hearings on the following dates: 30 March, 5 September, 17 October, 5 December 1994, 2 March, 12 June, 31 August 1995, and on 1 and 26 March 1996.
On 6 February 1996 the trial judge who heard the case was replaced by another judge. Consequently, the case had to be heard de novo.
Hearings scheduled for 10 November 1994, 3 April and 28 December 1995 were adjourned due to the absence of the applicant’s counsel. A hearing scheduled for 19 January 1995 was cancelled at the applicant’s counsel’s request since he had other hearings listed for that day. Hearings scheduled for 15 May and 26 October 1995 were adjourned due to, respectively, the applicant’s illness and the auxiliary prosecutor’s absence. At the hearing on 23 April 1996 the applicant felt unwell and was taken to hospital. He was diagnosed with a heart condition.
Hearings scheduled for 25 June, 6 August and 6 September 1996 were adjourned due to the applicant’s illness. On the last mentioned date the trial court ordered that the applicant be brought by the police to the next hearing fixed for 27 September 1996. However, the police failed to execute the order since the applicant had objected to his arrest on the grounds of his poor health.
On 27 September 1996 the trial court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody on the ground that he had unlawfully obstructed the proceedings. The court noted that the applicant had submitted certificates of illness, although he had failed to have them confirmed by the court’s medical expert. On 10 October 1996 the applicant was detained. The detention order was upheld on appeal on 11 October 1996.
The hearing scheduled for 6 November 1996 was adjourned, since the applicant had complained about the state of his health. The trial court accordingly ordered a report to be prepared in order to determine whether the applicant could participate in the trial. The report, submitted on an unspecified date, concluded that the applicant could take part in the proceedings and that he could receive adequate medical treatment in detention.
On 13 November 1996 the District Court held a hearing. During the hearing the applicant was examined by a doctor. On the same day the trial court gave judgment. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 18 months’ imprisonment, suspended on probation, and a fine.

The applicant’s counsel was present at the delivery of the judgment. No further appeal lay against that judgment.
