As stated in a report by the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards (\u201cthe Sector\u201d) within the Ministry of the Interior (\u201cthe Ministry\u201d) (see paragraph 11 below), during the arrest no force had been used against X, who had cooperated with the police.

R.U. had noticed that Y, his son, who had been thirteen years old at the time, had been \u201cevidently upset, crying, had urinated in his pants and had an intense redness on his face\u201d. The same night he had called the emergency police number from his mobile to report the incident. In the police station, X had initially been interrogated for two hours in the absence of his father or a lawyer. During that time he had allegedly been beaten. After his father had been called to attend the examination, he had not been assisted by an interpreter, despite the fact that he had limited command of Macedonian. Under duress (insulted and threatened with the words \u201cfind the bag or I\u2019ll kill you in front of your father\u201d), X had admitted the crime.

A fairly large group of people (around forty) had gathered. Further police officers and several police cars had arrived at the scene. Y had been handed over to his father with an instruction to bring him to the police station for identification. As stated in the judgment, these facts were established on the basis of the exchange between the Sector and the HCHR (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) and R.U.\u2019s testimony. According to the court minutes, R.U. also stated that when he had arrived on the scene, he had seen that Y had blood on his nose and mouth. He had taken him to a doctor who had noted no injury, but said that Y had been frightened and stressed. By decision of 17 November 2017, the court dismissed the claim by Y and noted that X had meanwhile (on 21 September 2017) withdrawn the claim in his regard (by a written statement to which his father consented). It found no evidence that the defendant had suffered any discriminatory conduct motivated by Y\u2019s Roma origin. On the contrary, the complexity of the case, namely the fact that the criminal complaint had concerned unidentified officers accused on several counts, required extensive examination irrespective of the ethnic belonging of the persons concerned. The time required for the public prosecutor to take the necessary actions was not excessive and could not imply the existence of discrimination. The evidence adduced by Y (reports and Court\u2019s case-law) could not lead to different facts that would require the shifting of the burden of proof on to the defendant.",

It has not been argued that these requests had no basis in the domestic law or that they lacked any prospect of success from the outset. Indeed, the higher public prosecutor did not reject the requests: on the contrary, he informed the applicants that he had sought information from the lower prosecutor\u2019s office (see paragraph 14 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was not unreasonable for the applicants to apply to the higher public prosecutor and await the outcome of its inquiry (see, mutatis mutandis, L.R. v. North Macedonia, no. 38067/15, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 67, 23\u00a0January 2020, and, conversely, Deari, cited above, \u00a7 48). Their further request of 21 October 2016 also fitted into this context (see paragraph 14 above).

In order to be \u201ceffective\u201d, such an investigation must firstly be adequate, which means that it must be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts and to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and of identifying and \u2013 if appropriate \u2013 punishing those responsible (see Jeronovi\u010ds, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103). Furthermore, it must be both prompt and thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or illfounded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see El Masri, cited above, \u00a7 183). Furthermore, for an investigation to be effective, the institutions and persons responsible for carrying it out must be independent from those targeted by it. This means not only a lack of any hierarchical or institutional connection but also practical independence (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 118). The investigation should be independent from the executive. Lastly, the victim should be able to participate effectively in the investigation in one form or another (see El\u00a0Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 184 and 185).",

In support of their allegations they submitted copies of their earlier application to the Sector (which contained written statements by alleged eye-witnesses) and the latter\u2019s reply. They also asked the public prosecutor to examine them, the police officers concerned and five identified eye-witnesses to the alleged incident. Lastly, X submitted medical evidence (see paragraph 12 above).

Furthermore, and more importantly, there is no indication that that period had any effect on the investigation. Indeed, the Government\u2019s objection in this respect was of a general nature and did not mention any actual adverse effect on the investigation of the passage of that period of time.",

That prompted the applicants to apply to the higher public prosecutor on three occasions, asking it to review the work of the lower prosecutor or to take over the prosecution (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). These requests, as stated above, were an available remedy and constituted a reasonable attempt by the applicants to pursue their complaint before the prosecuting authorities (see paragraph 41 above). It is to be noted that at the first meeting with the applicants\u2019 representative of 25 November 2016, the public prosecutor did not discuss the applicants\u2019 complaint, but X\u2019s unavailability in the proceedings against him (see paragraph 15 above). It was only on 2 December 2016 that the public prosecutor contacted the Ministry, for the first time, with a view to obtaining the identity of the police officers concerned. Since that request was apparently fruitless, he made the same request nearly one year later, on 6 November 2017 (see paragraph 16 above). The Court, furthermore, cannot but note that it was only on 25 November 2017, namely more than three years after the applicants\u2019 criminal complaint, that the public prosecutor examined Y and the police officers involved, whose identity had meanwhile been revealed (see paragraph 17 above). No explanation was given for these delays, which are solely attributable to the public prosecutor. Moreover, there is no indication that the public prosecutor examined any witness (proposed by the applicants) or took other steps to uncover evidence concerning the incident. X has not yet been examined and it has not been shown that the public prosecutor dealing with the applicants\u2019 criminal complaint made any serious attempt to hear evidence from him. In this connection the Court notes the steps taken in the criminal proceedings against X, as an accused (see paragraph 25 above), which, despite the difficulties in securing X\u2019s presence, ended with a final decision on the merits. More than six years after the critical events of 19 May 2014, the investigation into the applicants\u2019 allegations of police brutality is still pending. The Court has already found in respect of the respondent State that the passage of unreasonable time for the investigation of allegations of police brutality, unlike the processing of cases against the applicant, as in the present case, suggests that the authorities did not submit the applicants\u2019 case to the careful scrutiny required by Article 3 of the Convention (see\u00a0Andonovski v.\u00a0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a024312/10, \u00a7 91, 23\u00a0July 2015).",

Soon after, many onlookers gathered at the scene. There was also a significant police presence (see paragraphs 11 and 19 above). The applicants consistently submitted before the domestic authorities and before the Court that on that occasion the police had also apprehended Y. That fact was confirmed by the civil courts in the compensation proceedings against the first-instance public prosecutor\u2019s office, which established that the police had handed Y over to his father (see paragraph 19 above). On the other hand, the Court notes X\u2019s statement in the context of the proceedings against him (see paragraph 25 above) that Y had managed to escape.

Neither in the criminal complaint nor later in the proceedings before the public prosecutor did the applicants provide details sufficient to reverse the burden of proof.
