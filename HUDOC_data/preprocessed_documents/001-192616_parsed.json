She added that she had been imprisoned for eleven years and that her conduct in prison had been satisfactory; there had been no incident justifying fears that she would try to escape; in addition, she would be eligible for conditional release on 24 May 2014, which also undermined the likelihood of the alleged risk of absconding. She gave the example of a fellow prisoner in Rennes, who had been transferred to Saint-Jean-de-Luz in May 2013 in order to be able to attend her son\u2019s funeral. She was asking only to be allowed to pay her respects before her father\u2019s coffin in the funeral home and to embrace her mother and her daughter. She noted that her father\u2019s cremation had been postponed to 27\u00a0January 2014 in order to give the prison authorities time to organise her trip. The applicant further emphasised that her health problems had never presented an obstacle to her transfers from the Paris region to Bordeaux, from Bordeaux to Roanne and from Roanne to Rennes; she added that she had undertaken to ensure that her health problems would not complicate her absence from prison, and had decided not to eat during the journey, which showed how important it was for her to be with her family during this time of grief.",

They specified that the criminal profile of the applicant, who had been convicted of terrorist acts and continued to assert her membership of ETA and for whom completion of her prison term was still distant (17\u00a0June 2019), indicated a serious risk of absconding. They considered that this risk had not been mitigated by the cessation of ETA\u2019s armed struggle. In their view, the risk of public disturbance was high, given the location and context of the funeral of the applicant\u2019s father. It was due to take place in Bayonne, in the Basque Country, where ETA organised its activities. In addition, the applicant\u2019s brother and sister, who were themselves identified as being active in the Basque movement, were due to be present. According to the Government, the high risk of public-order disturbances and of absconding implied a reinforced escort team, which it had not been physically possible to organise, given the time available and the geographical distance involved. They added that surveillance of a prisoner by an escort during authorised leave was more complicated than during transfers from one prison to another (on these latter occasions, prisoners did not exit into open public areas).",
