Indeed, the case was orally heard at public hearings before three court instances in the principal proceedings as well as before the first-instance court in the retrial. The latter hearings had essentially concerned a question of law, namely whether objects with cultural and historical, rather than commercial, value could be the object of the offence of embezzlement. In the Government's view, if an appeal court decides only on questions of law, the court's failure to hear the applicant in person or to hold a public hearing does not amount to a violation of the right to a fair trial. In the present case, no special circumstances had existed requiring the applicants to be heard in person by the appeal court, since their credibility, intentions or motive had not been decisive for the matter at hand. It could not therefore be argued that the proceedings before the appeal court in the retrial had constituted a full review governed by the same rules as a principal trial on the merits.",

The Court takes this view notably because the charges against the applicants \u2013 aggravated embezzlement \u2013 indisputably belong to the hard core of criminal law. Furthermore, what was at stake for the applicants was imprisonment, and they were actually sentenced to a suspended prison term, which obviously carried a significant degree of stigma (see, a contrario, Jussila v.
