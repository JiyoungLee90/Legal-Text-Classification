In the context of the non-enforcement of pecuniary debts of a socially-owned company, an applicant\u2019s obligation to lodge his or her complaint with the Court with reasonable expedition should be directly linked to the progress of the enforcement of the relevant judgments at domestic level. In Sokolov and Others, the Court stated that once the applicants had become aware or should have been aware that the insolvency proceedings had been terminated and/or the debtor company liquidated without any legal successor or remaining assets, it should have been apparent to them that there was no legal avenue available at domestic level by which they could obtain enforcement of the judgments in their favour against the company or against the State. As to when the applicants knew, or ought to have learned, that enforcement was no longer possible, the Court stated that they should have lodged their applications with the Court within six months of the commercial court\u2019s decision terminating the insolvency proceedings being published in the Official Gazette or, at the latest, from when that decision had become final. In those cases, the applicants registered their claims within the insolvency proceedings, no enforcement proceedings having been instituted.",

The Court has previously found that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant, as far as possible, is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85, and Bobi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 38).

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v. Russia, no.\u00a074826/01, \u00a7 53, 24 November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the present case, the Court has established the Government\u2019s obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant\u2019s individual situation, that is to say to ensure compliance with his enforceable claim under the final domestic judgment of 20 December 2006 (compare with Fadeyeva v.\u00a0Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-IV). As regards the pecuniary part of the judgment in question (costs), the Government are to pay the applicant the sums awarded in the judgment, less any amounts which may have already been paid in respect of the judgments in the course of the insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, in the particular circumstances of the present case (notably, in the context of the reinstatement), whether such measures would involve reinstating the applicant into a job at the debtor company or, in case of difficulties in doing so, granting him reasonable compensation for non-enforcement (see paragraph 35 above), or a combination of those and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State. The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in its judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references; compare and contrast with Tarverdiyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065-66, and Efendiyeva v.\u00a0Azerbaijan (just satisfaction), no. 31556/03, 11\u00a0December 2008).",
