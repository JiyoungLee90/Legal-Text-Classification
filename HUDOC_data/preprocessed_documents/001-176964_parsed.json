The fact that the applicant had amended her claim several times, requested suspension of the proceedings for more than two years and the postponement of several hearings due to her health significantly contributed to the length and complexity of the proceedings.

Some of the delays in the main maintenance proceedings were caused by T.G.\u2019s and his liquidator\u2019s requests (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above) and others by necessary procedural steps (see paragraph 19 above). The applicant, who modified her claim several times and requested the questioning of further witnesses by means of letters (see paragraphs 15, 25 and 27 above), further contributed to delays. However, the fact that T.G. made use of all legal remedies available in order to oppose the applicant\u2019s claim cannot be held against either of the parties. Even though some of the delays in the proceedings, such as the interruption of the main maintenance proceedings for more than two years, can be attributed to the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a028 and 31 above), the Court does not lose sight of the overall duration of the proceedings. Moreover, it appears that major delays occurred because of long periods of inactivity by the domestic courts. The Court therefore takes the view that the complexity of the proceedings and the conduct of the parties are insufficient to explain an overall duration of the proceedings of twenty-five years and more than eleven months.",
