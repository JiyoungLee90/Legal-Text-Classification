The Court of Appeal noted that an independent expert examination was mandatory in proceedings related to the initial ordering of coercive treatment. The danger to society posed by O.T. and the preconditions for applying coercive treatment had already been independently established by a court on 6 May 2011. In the proceedings at issue \u2013 which concerned the proposed discontinuation of inpatient coercive treatment or its replacement with outpatient treatment \u2013 it was not mandatory to obtain an alternative expert opinion (see paragraph 21 below). The Court of Appeal held that in a situation where the state of O.T.\u2019s health and adherence to the treatment had not improved and the discontinuation of his inpatient treatment or its replacement with outpatient treatment was in the doctors\u2019 opinion excluded, ordering another expert examination would have been irrelevant.",

The Supreme Court went on to add that the applicant did not herself have rights in the proceedings in question that she could protect by means of securing legal aid and that there was therefore no need to recognise her right of appeal.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in monitoring compliance with this rule, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of each individual case. This means among other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, \u00a7 40, 19 February 2009).",

However, such a right was clearly granted to his mother, as a person close to the patient. She exercised this right in the two lower-instance courts, where no issues of standing arose. She also lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court in which she asked to be granted State-funded legal aid, as the appeal could only be validly submitted by a lawyer. However, the Supreme Court not only refused to grant State-funded legal aid to the applicant but also found that, under the domestic law, the applicant herself did not have any personal right to protect in the particular proceedings, and that there was therefore no grounds to recognise her right of appeal against the ruling of the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 18 above).",

In any event, although not questioning the right of the States to set certain formal requirements for the lodging of appeals with the Supreme Court (such as being represented by a lawyer and laying down criteria for the granting of State-funded legal aid), the Court finds that in the particular circumstances of the case, it would be overly formalistic to consider that the applicant had not done everything that could reasonably be expected of her in order to exhaust the domestic remedies.",

In view of the central role of a medical opinion in such proceedings, the domestic courts relied on the expert opinion of 11 December 2012 of the medical committee comprised of O.T.\u2019s attending doctor and the head of the department of the hospital where O.T. was being treated (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above).",
