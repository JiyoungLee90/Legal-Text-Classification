They were wearing a particular camouflage uniform, were armed and opened fire without fear of the lawenforcement agencies located in the town.

The investigation in case no.\u00a022054 was instituted on 4 April 2003, that is two days after Artur Akhmatkhanov's abduction. Further, within the first two months of the investigation, where crucial action has to be taken as soon as possible, the investigators took only two actions (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). Such a postponement per se was liable to negatively affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances and negate the chances for its possible solution at a later date. From the documents submitted by the Government it is clear that a number of the most essential steps had not been taken by the investigators at all or that they had been taken with irreparable delays and only after the investigation had been criticised by the supervising prosecutors (see paragraphs 44, 45, 50, 61, 66, 76, 85, 86, 88 and 93 above). In spite of the numerous concurring witness statements to this effect (see paragraphs 40, 42, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54-57, 64, 68, 72-74 and 91 above), it does not appear that the investigators tried to question the officers of the Shali law-enforcement agencies or the military commander's office about their possible involvement in the abduction or that they took any measures to identify the APCs used by the abductors and question their drivers. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation had begun. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the adjourning or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to adjourn were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
