It recalled that the guarantees in paragraphs 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court underlined that its primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see, also Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 84, 16\u00a0November 2010, with further references therein).

Furthermore, the admissibility of evidence is a\u00a0matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and references therein).",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of\u00a0the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of\u00a0proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

The trial court was very much alive to the need to approach the evidence of R.N. with caution. The conclusion of the trial court was that the statements of R.N. were reliable since they had been corroborated in a number of important aspects by other evidence, such as the location of the victim\u2019s body, the protocol of autopsy, the evidence of the victim\u2019s family regarding the contacts with R.N. prior to the murder, the evidence of the meetings between R.N. and the\u00a0applicant and the evidence of telephone contact between them (see\u00a0paragraphs 38-39 and 44 above). The Court is satisfied that the trial court scrutinised R.N.\u2019s statements rigorously (see, mutatis mutandis, F\u0105frowicz v. Poland, no. 43609/07, \u00a7 61, 17 April 2012). It took into consideration various factors which were of relevance in the assessment of their credibility, including, inter alia, the fact that R.N. had been a\u00a0cosuspect, his possible motives for incriminating the applicant, the spontaneous nature of the statements and the lack of any coercion at the time of his questioning. The Court observes in this respect that the trial court heard evidence from all police officers who had questioned R.N. during the three initial interrogations which shortly followed his arrest. It is of significance to note that during these interrogations R.N. explained of his own volition the facts relating to the gun and the murder (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above). Furthermore, it was excluded that the police officers could lead R.N. in his answers, since at the time of the initial interrogations they had not known about the victim\u2019s death (see paragraphs 36 and 54 in fine).",

This concerns in particular the uncontested evidence of at least three meetings between R.N. and the applicant during the period when R.N. had been hiding before and after the commission of the crime. There was also the evidence of their extensive telephone contact at critical times in the lead-up to and aftermath of the murder and the demand for ransom. This evidence led the trial court to dismiss as entirely unreliable the applicant\u2019s assertion that he had been in conflict with R.N. over the latter\u2019s debt and that his contacts with R.N. had been related to his efforts to recover his debt (see\u00a0paragraph 30 above). There was also the evidence that the applicant had been interested in guns and had possessed a gun up until June 2000 (see\u00a0paragraph 32 above).",

In the present case the evidence of witnesses which was supposed to cast doubt on the reliability of R.N.\u2019s statements was examined by the courts with great caution and was eventually found unreliable. This concerns, in particular, the evidence regarding the possession of the gun. The trial court carefully examined the evidence of witnesses D.I. and M.A. who were called to demonstrate that R.N. had possessed the gun prior to the date on which he had claimed to receive from the applicant. Their evidence was found unreliable as it was inconsistent and changing over time (see paragraphs 40-41 above). The evidence of witness M.\u0141. who was called to demonstrate that R.N. had been a drug user and had possessed a gun was also carefully assessed and found to be entirely unreliable (see paragraph 43 above).",

The Court of Appeal identified that the evidence of R.N. belonged to the category of \u201cincriminating evidence\u201d given by a co-suspect and recalled the conditions, defined in the case-law of the Supreme Court, which had to be considered in the assessment of this particular kind of evidence (the nature of a statement, the timing of making it, the motive for making it, the reliability of such statements and the lack of any pressure at the time of making the statement; see paragraph 53 above). The Court of Appeal found that the assessment of the evidence by the trial court complied with those requirements. In particular, it confirmed that the statements of R.N. to the police in which he had explained his and the applicant\u2019s role in the crimes had been spontaneous and there had been no coercion of any kind involved (see paragraph 54 above). Furthermore, with regard to the murder charge, R.N. primarily incriminated himself and described the applicant\u2019s role as limited to the provision of the gun and the offer of assistance in hiding the body. The Court of Appeal concurred with the first-instance court that the reliability of R.N.\u2019s incriminating statements was corroborated by other evidence examined at the trial (see paragraph 55 above). It concluded that the trial court had analysed in a very thorough manner all statements of R.N. and assessed their reliability in the light of all the other evidence available in the case.",

The\u00a0domestic courts explained why there were no grounds to assume that R.N. had wrongly accused the applicant or P.D. of involvement in the impugned crimes.
