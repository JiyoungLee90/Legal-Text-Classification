It stressed that the issue of which interest rate was to be applied was of a legal rather than a technical nature. It qualified the founding agreement as a non-commercial contract, thereby effectively sidestepping the contestation as to the applicability of \u201crevaluation interest\u201d (see paragraphs 26-29 above), because that interest could only potentially be applied to claims arising out of commercial contracts.

It explained that over a number of years it had lent substantial sums of money to Textil, which had later been unable to repay those loans. Given that Textil had been incorporated into Turist Trip company on 15 March 1994, and that it had, on 18\u00a0December 1995, assigned the claim against the applicant bank to Texhol (later named Retag), the applicant bank had been entitled to offset its claim against Textil with Retag\u2019s claim against the applicant bank, pursuant to section 440(2) of the 1978 Obligations Act, which entitled the debtor in the event of assignment to offset its debt against a claim existing at the time of assignment against either the assignor or the assignee (see paragraph 130 below).

The applicant bank explained that it had a claim against the bankruptcy debtor for restitution of HRK\u00a0168,618,419.60 on account of unjust enrichment and that it had instituted civil proceedings to that end. Given that the seizure of the amount in question had taken place in the enforcement proceedings on 22\u00a0December 2003, that is, after the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings against Retag on 21 June 2000, the applicant bank had become a creditor of the bankruptcy estate (vjerovnik ste\u010dajne mase). Under the Bankruptcy Act claims of such creditors had precedence over bankruptcy creditors (ste\u010dajni vjerovnici), that is, those creditors whose claims against a bankruptcy debtor had arisen before the opening of bankruptcy proceedings. The applicant bank argued that its claim was well-founded because the enforcement proceedings and the resultant seizure of the above sum had been based on the non-existent assignment contract between Textil and Texhol of 18\u00a0December 1995, the validity of which was being contested in parallel civil proceedings. That being so, the applicant bank argued that the bankruptcy administrator should have reserved an amount corresponding to its claim, pursuant to section 87a of the Bankruptcy Act (see paragraph 155 below), and deposited it in a special account pending the outcome of the civil proceedings for unjust enrichment instituted on 22\u00a0December 2004, which were expected to end in the bank\u2019s favour. Since the bankruptcy administrator had not (and, having been informed of the bank\u2019s claim a month after he had prepared the final distribution list, could not have) done so, the applicant bank invited the bankruptcy judge to set aside the measures taken so far, take steps to protect the bank\u2019s interests as a creditor of the bankruptcy estate, and fix another date for the final hearing.",

Potential impracticability of future satisfaction of the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim is not an obstacle to the court\u2019s deciding on [it] in adversarial proceedings. Whether the plaintiff may seek payment of damages and default interest from the bankruptcy debtor is a different matter. The powers of the bankruptcy administrator are not entirely extinguished with the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings. The [civil] proceedings pending at the moment of the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings continue in the name and on behalf of the bankruptcy estate of the bankruptcy debtor. The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act concerning the bankruptcy debtor and its organs (section 199 paragraph 4) apply to the bankruptcy estate mutatis mutandis. On [its] behalf proceedings to collect the assets pertaining to the bankruptcy estate may continue, and the bankruptcy administrator is still required to represent the bankruptcy estate in proceedings instituted by the bankruptcy creditors against the bankruptcy estate. These rules apply even where the funds have not been reserved on a special account, [in which case it is] for a creditor to assess whether he or she has [any] interest in pursuing such a suit.\u201d",

The rationale behind separation of patrimonies is to prevent that the property forming the estate be confounded with the property of the heirs, and thus to shield it from the claims of the heirs\u2019 creditors who would otherwise be entitled to satisfy their claims out of the estate.

In each appeal lodged after February 1998, the applicant bank had routinely sought the withdrawal of four judges of the , in particular judges J.\u010c., L.\u0106, Z.J. and R.S., as well as the withdrawal of Judge\u00a0N.\u0160. from his role of president, and later on a judge of that court. Most of those motions for withdrawal had not contained any reasons whatsoever. Where reasons had been given it had been clear that the withdrawal had been sought because of the applicant bank\u2019s dissatisfaction with the decisions rendered by those judges and their legal views. In not a single case had the applicant bank adduced arguments to demonstrate subjective or objective partiality on the part of any of the judges concerned. The domestic courts had, notwithstanding, decided on all the withdrawal motions made by the applicant bank. Accordingly, when assessing the impartiality of the High Commercial Court it had to be taken into account that the applicant bank had exercised its right to seek the withdrawal of judges on account of their alleged bias in an extremely non-selective way, and thereby a priori seriously weakened the well-foundedness of those motions.",

In particular, in the withdrawal motion of 2\u00a0December 2003 (see paragraph 63 above), which had been submitted after the publication of the article in question, where the applicant bank sought, as a matter of routine, the withdrawal of Judge N.\u0160. and three other judges, his statement to the press was not mentioned at all as an argument for withdrawal. What is more, at the time he had given the impugned statement, Judge N.\u0160. was no longer the President of the High Commercial Court (see paragraph 67 above), nor was he after that a member of any panel of the High Commercial Court which rendered any of the decisions in the applicant bank\u2019s case.

His comments had been injudicious and intensely hostile to the applicant bank. In particular, he had stated that the principal amount of the debt the applicant bank owed to Retag was DEM\u00a056,000,000 (see paragraph 67 above), a figure for which there had been no foundation in the original judgment of 7 June 1995, writ of execution or any other document. For the applicant bank it was not a coincidence that the decision of the High Commercial Court of 6 April 2004 to dismiss the applicant bank\u2019s appeal of 14 October 2003 had referred to a figure of DEM\u00a056,000,000 as equivalent to the principal amount owed (see paragraph 51 above). That highly prejudicial and unfounded allegation and its similarity to that previously made by Judge N.\u0160. in the media cast doubt on the impartiality of the High Commercial Court.

The applicant bank explained that its complaint had not been that he should have been required to withdraw because of the contents of the article, but that the similarity of the reasoning of the High Commercial Court, in a decision subsequent to his prejudicial and unfounded allegations, had given rise to real doubts about that court\u2019s impartiality as an institution when it had on 6\u00a0April 2004 ruled on the applicant bank\u2019s appeal.",

The applicant bank did not do so even when raising its impartiality complaint in the proceedings before the Court (see paragraphs 161 and 169-172 above), thus leaving the impression that it considered the mere fact that the judge in question had previously sat in the case or that it had brought criminal charges against him, sufficient to cast doubt on his impartiality. However, the Court has already held that the obligation to be impartial could not be construed so as to prevent judges from sitting in the same case upon remittal (see, for example, Stow and Gai v.

Finland (dec.), no. 42114/98 42185/98, 26 February 2002). That is so because to require their automatic withdrawal in such circumstances would enable discontented litigants to engage in \u2018judge shopping\u2019 by artificially creating bias or prejudice and thus provide them with an easy instrument to remove judges whom they consider unfavourable simply because they ruled against them or otherwise seemed inclined to do so.",

This was more than six months after the programme in question was broadcast. In this connection the Court reiterates that, even though no plea of inadmissibility concerning compliance with the six-month rule was made by the Government in their observations, it is not open to it to set aside the application of the six-month rule solely because a government has not made a preliminary objection to that effect (see Walker v. the United Kingdom\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a034979/97, ECHR 2000I). This is so because the six-month rule, in reflecting the wish of the Contracting Parties to prevent past decisions being called into question after an indefinite lapse of time, serves the interests not only of the respondent Government but also of legal certainty as a value in itself.

That decision had been reached in the enforcement proceedings \u2013 which had continued in 2003 following the quashing decision of the  \u2013 after the parties had been given the opportunity of presenting their arguments, including those concerning the rate and methods of calculating interest. They had done so in several comprehensive submissions. Each party had had the opportunity of responding to the allegations of the other. The  had given detailed reasons for its decision, in which it had referred to all the key arguments of both parties and had clearly explained its legal view on the rate and methods of calculating interest. The decision had been served on both parties and they had been given the opportunity to appeal against it, of which they had availed themselves. As a result, the decision had been examined by the  and upheld. On the other hand, the technical issue of calculation of interest had been, in accordance with standard practice, conferred on the institution which performed payment operations, namely the Croatian National Bank. This was so because the interest was calculated up to the day of payment, for which reason the institution authorised to carry out payment operations must be able to calculate interest up to the moment when the transfer of funds takes place. In the present case, since the Croatian National Bank had not had the information on interest rates on savings deposits in the period between 15\u00a0September 1986 and 6\u00a0October 1989, the Zagreb Commercial Court had deviated from the standard procedure only in as far as it had conferred the calculation of interest on the institution which had been responsible for payment operations in that period, that is to say to FINA. Accordingly, the Government argued, the calculation of interest compiled by FINA had not been decisive for the outcome of proceedings, since all the parameters for that calculation had been established previously in the Zagreb Commercial Court\u2019s decision of 3\u00a0October 2003.",

In the Government\u2019s view, this meant that both parties had been on an equal footing in the proceedings. They emphasised, referring to the case of Peri\u0107 v. Croatia (no. 34499/06, 27 March 2008), that under the Court\u2019s case-law each party in a civil case must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis their opponent. Thus, the decision of the  not to communicate FINA\u2019s calculation to the parties had represented an interpretation of the domestic procedural law that had had equal effects on both parties, which was essential for the observance of the adversarial principle.",

The applicant bank further explained that the compound method of calculating the interest for the period before 6\u00a0October 1989 had been the primary cause of the significant difference between the total amount calculated by FINA (HRK 37,915.96) and the total amount calculated by the applicant bank\u2019s financial expert for that period\u00a0(HRK\u00a03,192.20). The difference between these two sums had magnified greatly over the subsequent years owing to the statutory default interest payable in the period after 6\u00a0October 1989.

It might also have considered this to be an appropriate course of action because of the applicant bank\u2019s behaviour in the proceedings, in particular its numerous dilatory manoeuvres (multiple motions for withdrawal of judges and postponement of enforcement) aimed at delaying the enforcement.",

Austria, no. 30428/96, \u00a7 18, 6\u00a0February 2001; and \u0160ven\u010dionien\u0117 v. , no.\u00a037259/04, \u00a7 26, 25\u00a0November 2008). The Court notes that FINA\u2019s calculation of the statutory default interest, which was prepared at the request of the Zagreb Commercial Court, was manifestly aimed at influencing that court\u2019s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7\u00a026; and Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41). Therefore, in the Court\u2019s view, the  should have more carefully balanced the principle of expeditious hearing with the principle of adversarial hearing in the present case. As already noted above (see paragraph 198), the main issue in the case was the calculation of statutory default interest, over which a dispute arose only in the enforcement proceedings, de facto transforming them from the proceedings for mere execution of a judgment into the second phase of litigation. In such specific circumstances the  could have been expected to strictly observe the principle of adversarial hearing and give the applicant bank an opportunity to comment on the calculation made by FINA.",

It was therefore of paramount importance to give the applicant bank an opportunity to comment on that calculation (see, mutatis mutandis, Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others, ibid.). Indeed, to do so was even more compelling in view of the aggravating fact that no appeal lay against the Zagreb Commercial Court\u2019s instruction of 28 October 2003 ordering the Croatian National Bank to transfer from the applicant bank\u2019s account to Retag\u2019s account the amount calculated by FINA. However, FINA\u2019s calculation was never disclosed to the applicant bank, which thus had no opportunity to challenge the accuracy of that calculation.",

What is particularly at stake here is the litigants\u2019 confidence in the workings of justice, which is based on, inter alia, the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file (see, for example, Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029; Beer, ibid.; F.R. v.

Thus they may legitimately expect to be consulted as to whether a specific document requires their comments (see Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 43). It follows that in the present case it was for the applicant bank to assess whether FINA\u2019s calculation required its comments. The onus was therefore on the Zagreb Commercial Court to afford the applicant bank an opportunity to comment on that calculation prior to that court\u2019s instruction of 28 October 2003 (see, mutatis mutandis, K.S. v. Finland, no. 29346/95, \u00a7 23, 31 May 2001, and S.H. v. Finland, no. 28301/03, \u00a7 35, 29 July 2008).",

The fact that Retag had later on, on 12\u00a0December 2007, been deleted from the register of commercial companies (see paragraph 87 above) did not prevent the determination of the applicant bank\u2019s claim in those proceedings, because the proceedings could continue against \u201cthe bankruptcy estate of Retag\u201d, which had standing to sue and be sued (jus standi in judicio) under the domestic law (see paragraphs 155-156 above).

The fact that the applicant bank had properly reported its claim for restitution of the sum seized from it on 12 February 1996 (see paragraph 25 and 70 above) and that the bankruptcy administrator had therefore reserved HRK 41,752,238.68 for that purpose (see paragraph 83 above), only proved that he would have reserved the amount corresponding to the sum seized on 22 December 2003 had the applicant bank properly reported that claim.",

After that moment there was no legal remedy available in the Croatian legal system which would enable it to recover the amount of HRK 168,618,419.60 seized from it on 22 December 2003. In particular, as regards the Government\u2019s suggestion that it was also possible for the applicant bank to bring a civil action against Retag\u2019s shareholders, relying on section 10 of the Commercial Companies Act, the applicant bank retorted that they had not provided any detail or authority to support that suggestion, which was an incorrect one. That was so because the shareholders and creditors of Retag had been paid from that company\u2019s estate pursuant to the final decisions of the bankruptcy court, against which the applicant bank had exhausted all available remedies. Thus, those persons who acquired some of Retag\u2019s bankruptcy estate had not made unlawful gains from the enforcement proceedings, though Retag had. The applicant bank further submitted that, even if that action had offered it any prospects of success (which it would not have), by so arguing, the Government had actually admitted that it would not be able to recover the entire sum seized from it on 22\u00a0December 2003 as it could not retrieve the part of that sum which had been distributed to Retag\u2019s creditors.",

The Court further notes that under Croatian bankruptcy law claims generated after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings are considered obligations of the bankruptcy estate (obveze ste\u010dajne mase) and creditors having such claims are creditors of the bankruptcy estate (vjerovnici ste\u010dajne mase). According to the case-law of the Supreme Court and the High Commercial Court, creditors of the bankruptcy estate are, unlike bankruptcy creditors (ste\u010dajni vjerovnici, that is, creditors whose claims against the bankruptcy debtor arose before the opening of bankruptcy proceedings), not required to formally report their claims to the bankruptcy administrator (see paragraph 155 above).

By their decisions of 27\u00a0October 2003 and 6 April 2004 the Zagreb Commercial Court and the High Commercial Court had decided not to postpone the enforcement further because they had considered that none of the grounds for doing so had existed in the applicant bank\u2019s case (see paragraphs 49 and 51 above). In particular, the applicant bank\u2019s motion of 14 October 2003 for postponement of enforcement had been based on the argument that Retag\u2019s claim against it had been discharged by means of offset, which did not constitute a ground for postponing the enforcement (see paragraph 46 above).

In so doing the real value of the principal debt had to be taken into account. In that connection the Government noted that the principal amount the applicant bank had been ordered to pay corresponded to the establishment sum, that is, the amount Textil had in 1986 invested as a founder of the applicant bank, which was some eleven billion Yugoslav dinars (YUD) (see paragraph 8 above). That amount corresponded at the time to almost fifty-seven million German marks (DEM), which would today represent more than twenty-eight\u00a0million euros (EUR). Therefore, even though the principal amount of YUD 11,000,000,000 had, after several denominations and changes of domestic currency (see paragraphs 140-142 above), been reduced to the apparently modest amount of 1,100 Croatian kunas (HRK), the applicant bank had been aware that in reality the amount it would have to pay would be many times higher.

In the applicant bank\u2019s view, clear grounds for doing so had existed and ought to have been taken into consideration in terms of section 87a of the Bankruptcy Act (see paragraph 155 above). In particular, the bankruptcy administrator and the bankruptcy judge had been very well aware of the applicant bank\u2019s argument that Retag had not been entitled to seek enforcement of the original judgment, as that argument had already been raised by the applicant bank in the bankruptcy proceedings on 21 July 2000, when as a bankruptcy creditor it reported to the bankruptcy administrator its claim for restitution of the amount seized from it on 12\u00a0February 1996 and the statutory default interest accrued on that amount (see paragraph 70 above). In so doing the applicant bank had informed the bankruptcy administrator that it had instituted civil proceedings to challenge the validity of the assignment contract of 18 December 1995 on account of the fact that by that time Textil no longer existed as a legal entity, and enclosed therewith the extract from the register of commercial companies of 6\u00a0December 1999 showing that that company had been deleted from the register on 15\u00a0March 1994. The likelihood that the applicant bank would succeed in those proceedings and that, consequently, the obligation of the bankruptcy estate to return the amount seized from the applicant bank on 22\u00a0December 2003 would arise could easily have been determined by reference to the above-mentioned extract from the register of commercial companies.",

In deciding as they did those courts took the view that the outcome and the state of various proceedings instituted by and against the applicant bank had not at the time given rise to a legitimate assumption that the applicant bank\u2019s claim for restitution of HRK\u00a0168,618,419.60 was well-founded and thus would have to be settled in the future (see paragraphs 81-82 above). Indeed, on 23\u00a0March 2005, that is, at the time the High Commercial Court rendered its decision: (a) the enforcement proceedings resulting in the seizure of the sum in question had lasted some nine years and two months and the bankruptcy proceedings themselves had been pending for almost five years, (b) the applicant bank\u2019s civil action to declare the enforcement inadmissible had been dismissed by a first-instance court (see paragraph 114 above), (c) the first-instance decision setting aside the original judgment and allowing the applicant bank\u2019s petition for reopening had been quashed and the case remitted to the first-instance court (see paragraph 16 above), (d) the criminal proceedings against the sole shareholder of Retag, Mr A.K., had been discontinued (see paragraph 100 above), (e) the applicant bank\u2019s first civil action for unjust enrichment had been declared inadmissible by a final decision (see paragraphs 102-103 above), and (f) the assignment contract of 18\u00a0December 1995 was assumed valid, as in the civil proceedings to contest its validity, which would eventually lead to a finding that it was non-existent, not even a first-instance judgment had been adopted (see paragraphs 88-89 above). Having regard to these reasons, the Court finds it understandable that those courts perceived the applicant bank\u2019s second action for unjust enrichment brought on 22\u00a0December 2004 (see paragraph 106 above), as another part of its strategy, and consequently, that the appropriate course of action was to distribute the assets pertaining to the bankruptcy estate to Retag\u2019s creditors in satisfaction of their claims.",

It further notes that it has been standard practice for the Croatian courts in judgments ordering payment of certain sums of money to indicate only the amount of\u00a0principal debt to be paid (see paragraph 131 above). For statutory default interest a standard formula \u201cwith statutory default interest in accordance with the applicable regulations ... accruable from...\u201d has been used. This practice has not given rise to difficulties, as the relevant legislation has been relatively clear in respect of the rates and methods of calculation of statutory default interest. In the present case the difficulties arose because the domestic courts had to calculate the statutory default interest, inter alia, for the period between 15\u00a0September 1986 and 6\u00a0October 1989, during which the relevant legislation in force referred to information (bank interest rates paid on time savings deposits) which \u2013 by the time those courts where about to render their decisions \u2013 was due to the lapse of time no longer easily obtainable (see paragraphs 56, 58 and 134-137 above). Therefore, to the extent that in the present case the calculation of the statutory default interest might have gone beyond its inherent uncertainty, the Court considers that this could have primarily been the result of the described problem in the application of that legislation and the ensuing evidentiary difficulties, rather than of the manner the Zagreb Commercial Court applied it in its decision of 3\u00a0October 2003 and the instruction of 28\u00a0October 2003.",

In this respect the Court reiterates that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited (see, among other authorities, Allan Jacobsson v.  (no. 2), 19\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7 57, Reports 1998I). It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law, even in those fields where the Convention \u201cincorporates\u201d the rules of that law, since the national authorities are, in the nature of things, particularly qualified to settle the issues arising in this connection (see Pavlinovi\u0107 and Toni\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no. 17124/05 and 17126/05, 3 September 2009). This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law (see Anheuser-Busch Inc., cited above, \u00a7 83). Consequently, the Court finds no indication that the Zagreb Commercial Court\u2019s decision of 28\u00a0October 2003 or the instruction of 28\u00a0October 2003 were unlawful under domestic law, arbitrary or otherwise manifestly unreasonable.",

It further notes that statutory default interest was accumulating on the principal sum of HRK 1,100, the sum the applicant bank had been ordered to pay by the original judgment, for more than seventeen years, that is from 15\u00a0September 1986 to 22\u00a0December 2003, and that during that period the rate of statutory default interest was often very high and the interest was calculated on a monthly basis in order to compensate for high inflation (see paragraph 138 above). That being so, and given that the compound method was used to calculate the statutory default interest during a large part of that period (see paragraphs 59 and 138 above), the Court does not find it surprising and thus unforeseeable that the amount eventually seized from the applicant bank reached HRK\u00a0168,618,419.60.",

However, at this juncture the Court also finds it important to emphasise that each and every violation of Article\u00a06 of the Convention does not automatically lead to a violation of the State\u2019s procedural positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in cases where both Articles are applicable to the same facts (see, for example, Ukraine-Tyumen v. , no. 22603/02, \u00a7 52, 22\u00a0November 2007). The latter Article concerns the substance of the right of property and its breach cannot be determined solely in the light of the same criteria relevant for determining whether there was a breach of Article 6 of the Convention, as other elements are also relevant (see Wiesinger v.

To accept the applicant bank\u2019s argument and oblige the States to provide a mechanism capable of recovering unjustifiably seized amounts even in situations where the enforcement creditor went bankrupt (see paragraph 249 above), would run contrary to the Court\u2019s established case-law according to which the States cannot be held responsible for the obligations of a private company which, having become insolvent, is no longer able to pay off its debts (see, for example, Bobrova v. , no. 24654/03, \u00a7 16, 17 November 2005).",

(see paragraphs 95-100 above), the Court reiterates that an additional positive obligation arises for the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention where the interference with the property rights perpetrated by private individuals is of a criminal nature (see Bl\u016bmberga v.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a039272/98, \u00a7\u00a7 151-153, ECHR 2003-XII). In that respect, it is clear that the obligation, like the obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation into loss of life or allegations of ill-treatment, is one of means and not one of result; in other words, the obligation on the authorities to investigate and prosecute such acts cannot be absolute, as it is evident that many crimes remain unresolved or unpunished notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the State authorities. Rather, the obligation incumbent on the State is to ensure that a proper and adequate criminal investigation is carried out and that the authorities involved act in a competent and efficient manner. Moreover, the Court is sensitive to the practical difficulties which the authorities may face in investigating crime and to the need to make operational choices and prioritise the investigation of the most serious crimes. Consequently, the obligation to investigate is less exacting with regard to less serious crimes, such as those involving property, than with regard to more serious ones, such as violent crimes, and in particular those which would fall within the scope of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. The Court thus considers that in cases involving less serious crimes the State will only fail to fulfil its positive obligation in that respect where flagrant and serious deficiencies in the criminal investigation or prosecution can be identified (...).",

Ploti\u0146a v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a016825/02, 3 June 2008). While the outcome of criminal proceedings may have a significant or even decisive effect on the prospects of a civil claim, whether lodged in the context of the criminal proceedings or brought in separate civil proceedings, the State cannot be held responsible for the lack of prospects of such a claim simply because a criminal investigation has not ultimately led to a conviction. Rather, the State will only fail to fulfil its positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if the lack of prospects of success of civil proceedings is the direct consequence of exceptionally serious and flagrant deficiencies in the conduct of criminal proceedings arising out of the same set of facts, as outlined in the preceding paragraph.\u201d",

Furthermore, since the domestic law (see paragraph 143 above) in such cases does not require a final conviction in criminal proceedings in order to claim damages in civil proceedings (see Bl\u016bmberga, cited above, \u00a7 72), nothing has prevented the applicant bank to pursue its pecuniary claim (lodged in the criminal proceedings in its capacity of the injured party, see paragraph 99 above), by bringing a civil action for damages against A.K.\u2019s heirs after his death (see paragraphs 129 and 158 above). In addition, within three months from his death the applicant bank could have, if it considered it necessary, applied for separation of patrimonies (separatio bonorum) under section 140 of the Inheritance Act (see paragraph 158 above) and in that way secured its claim for damages. However, the applicant bank did not submit any evidence that it had instituted such proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court finds that it cannot be established that a civil action for damages did not constitute an appropriate means whereby the State could fulfil its above-described (see the preceding paragraph) positive obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Bl\u016bmberga, loc. cit.).",
