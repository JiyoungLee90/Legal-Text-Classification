A child born out of such a relationship is ipso jure part of that \u201cfamily\u201d unit from the moment, and by the very fact, of its birth. Thus, there exists between the child and the parents a relationship amounting to family life (see Keegan v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no.\u00a0290, pp. 17-18, \u00a7 44; Elsholz v.

The existence or non-existence of \u201cfamily life\u201d for the purposes of Article 8 is essentially a question of fact depending upon the real existence in practice of close personal ties (see K.\u00a0and T. v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 150). Where it concerns a potential relationship which could develop between a child born out of wedlock and its natural father, relevant factors include the nature of the relationship between the natural parents and the demonstrable interest in and commitment by the father to the child both before and after its birth (see Nylund v. Finland (dec.), no. 27110/95, ECHR 1999-VI).",
