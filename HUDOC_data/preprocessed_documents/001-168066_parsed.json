Thus, situations such as in the Czech Republic, where health professionals were not allowed to assist mothers giving birth at home and where there was no special emergency aid available, actually increased the risk to the life and health of mother and newborn. At the same time, however, the Government had argued that the risk for newborn children was higher in the case of home births and it was true that even where a pregnancy seemed to be without complications, unexpected difficulties requiring specialised medical intervention could arise during delivery. In these circumstances, the Chamber held that the mothers concerned, including the applicants, could not be said to have had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden, and that accordingly, in adopting and applying the policy relating to home births, the Czech authorities had not exceeded the wide margin of appreciation afforded to them or upset the requisite fair balance between the competing interests.",

Although the case could be analysed through the lens of both positive and negative obligations, she considered it appropriate to assess the case primarily in terms of the negative obligation, since the fact that midwives were prohibited from assisting pregnant women with home births could be viewed as an interference with her right to respect for her private life.

The Decree identified three possible workplaces for midwives: a workplace where childbirth was allowed; a workplace where physiological childbirth was not allowed; and a midwife\u2019s office for in-home care. It did not actually forbid midwives to perform home births, so it was unclear whether a midwife who had an office for in-home care could or could not provide assistance with home births outside her workplace. The applicant added in that connection that section\u00a018(1) of the People\u2019s Health Act permitted in-home care as part of health care. The Decree failed to regulate midwifery in a detailed manner. The applicant argued that even a midwife who had a registered workplace where childbirth was not allowed could offer assistance with a hospital birth and accompany a woman to hospital, despite not being employed by the hospital in question, provided that she concluded a special contract with it. The Decree had been in force only until 31 March 2012, and therefore had been unable to change the ambiguous situation which had existed before its adoption. Indeed, under section 2(1), health-care facilities already in operation had been given a twelve-month interim period to comply with the requirements of the Decree. The applicant noted in that connection that at the time when she had given birth, the Decree had been in force for only eight months and the existing health-care facilities \u2013 including midwives, who faced an unclear and unforeseeable registration process \u2013 had been under no obligation to comply with it.",

Indeed, the Medical Services Act provided for in-home care as one of the forms of health care, one of its variants being nursing care (section 10). The applicant stated that the definition of nursing care clearly included health care provided during pregnancy and childbirth (section 5(2)(g)). Furthermore, the Decree set down the requirements for technical equipment for midwives providing in-home care (Appendix no. 9). However, the Act contained a new provision enshrining the right of patients to receive health services in the least restrictive environment possible, provided that the quality and safety of such services was ensured as well (section 28(3)(k)). The applicant emphasised that neither the Act nor the Decree contained any restrictions preventing midwives from providing health services during home births in the form of in-home care. However, the legislation was interpreted by the Government and other public authorities in such a way that midwives were not allowed to provide assistance at home births, and this had a clear chilling effect on midwives, who were unwilling to provide such assistance. The applicant contended that the legislation was not accessible and foreseeable in its application as different interpretations were possible. She therefore disputed the Chamber\u2019s conclusion that she could have reasonably foreseen that the assistance of a medical professional at a home birth was not allowed by law.",

However, she pointed out that during most of her pregnancy she had been bound by the pre-April 2012 legislation. The applicant reiterated in that connection that prior to 1 April 2012, there had been no statutory restriction on midwives providing health care during home births. In order to provide care, a midwife needed, inter alia, an \u201coperational\u201d licence authorising her to be regarded as a non-governmental medical facility. After the adoption of Decree no. 221/2010, which required midwives to have equivalent human, material and technical resources to those available in a delivery room in maternity hospitals, no midwife had been granted such a licence. However, although it had imposed extensive requirements on midwives in terms of equipment, the Decree had not automatically terminated the operational licences already issued. As a result, while they were still bound by the availability of compulsory equipment, there were midwives who theoretically could carry on their activities in line with the previous regulations, or rather the previous legal vacuum. As a result, pregnant women lacked legal certainty as to whether they could enjoy the assistance of a midwife during a home birth, and similarly midwives lacked the same certainty as to whether they could legally provide such assistance. Such a situation contravened the notions of foreseeability and absence of arbitrariness.",

The Government had thus had two decades to procure scientific data concerning out-of-hospital midwifery care and to carry out a comprehensive analysis of such care. However, they had never even claimed to have performed such a background analysis. Therefore, when denying women in 2010 and 2012 the right to decide on the circumstances in which they gave birth, the Government had not actually known what specific negative aspects and risks relating to assisted home births were to be eliminated by the legislation in question and what specific positive aim was to be achieved.",

The right to self-determination included the freedom to decide whether to expose one\u2019s body at all, and to what extent, to specific third parties.

The mere assistance of a midwife at a home birth was insufficient. If sudden complications occurred, the newborn could be the subject of risks which were, however, avoidable. Health professionals, including midwives, could not deal effectively with such complications in private homes, since the premises would not be adequately equipped for that purpose and often were not in close proximity to a higher level of health care.

Birth was in all cases a dynamic process which could become complicated at any stage, with a direct threat to the life of the foetus and obviously the woman in labour. None of these complications could be resolved at home, as was attested by births with lasting consequences, either for the child or for the mother. Problems such as acute hypoxia for the child, or embolism or bleeding for the mother, could not be handled outside health-care institutions. A further trend that had been overlooked was the constantly increasing age of mothers and the complications associated with this.

It was inevitable to stress the need for protection of children\u2019s rights, their chance to live and their right to health, all of which were diminished during birth outside a health-care institution. The majority of women opting for delivery in a domestic environment referred to the need for intimacy, the opportunity to select the method and position of delivery and to decline particular types of medical intervention during childbirth, the need for the presence of a person close to them, and the importance of not being separated from the child. The Slovak Government noted in this connection that the United Nations Committee for the Rights of the Child required States to support the Mother and Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (MBFHI), whereby the WHO and UNICEF had set down the criteria for maternity and neonatal units of health-care institutions. While cooperating with the above-mentioned organisations, the Slovak Republic had since 1996 implemented quality projects for perinatal care, including support for physiological birth, a behavioural approach to nursing for newborns and mothers, support for breastfeeding, and emphasis on the inseparability of the mother/child bond. Each health-care provider should be responsible for ensuring the highest standard of humanisation of birth. Some providers had rebuilt health-care institutions in order to offer alternative methods of giving birth, for example the vertical birth position or water birth; to tailor birth arrangements to the mother\u2019s request; and to provide separate rooms allowing the husband or other family members to be present during the birth and throughout the stay in the institution. Immediate contact between the mother and the newborn after delivery should be ensured in each delivery room and was a precondition for the MBFHI. From the point of view of breastfeeding support, the MBFHI was considered in the European Union to constitute a model of best practice as regards care for the mother and the newborn after delivery. Among other things, it required the newborn child, once dried, to be placed on the mother\u2019s body within half an hour after delivery, and the newborn and mother to be given the opportunity to be together for breastfeeding \u201cupon request\u201d.",

She emphasised that the legal requirements for minimum equipment in medical facilities and home-care centres could not, in principle, be complied with in a home-delivery environment or in any other environment. She observed that delivery rooms meeting the conditions set out by the legislation were thus located exclusively in health-care facilities. The Public Defender pointed out in this connection that some mothers-to-be would have found it sufficient if the delivery in the medical facility had been performed by their \u201cown\u201d midwife. However, the medical facilities only allowed deliveries to be performed by midwives with whom they had concluded an agreement, and such agreements often proved impossible to obtain.",

The Act empowered the Ministry of Health to lay down technical and material requirements for equipment in health-care institutions. This was done by means of Decree no.\u00a0221/2010, which entered into force on 1\u00a0September 2010 and set out detailed conditions to be complied with in order to practise the profession of midwife independently, identifying, inter alia, three possible categories of workplaces for midwives: workplaces where delivery was not allowed, workplaces where delivery was allowed, and contact workplaces which had to be equipped with the furniture appropriate for a midwife and a mobile phone.

The essential equipment which had to be available to midwives in the places where they were to assist with deliveries was described in detail in Decree no. 92/2012, which indicated, inter alia, three different categories of workplaces for midwives, namely: workplaces where delivery was not allowed, workplaces where delivery was allowed, and contact workplaces for nursing care relating to gynaecology and childbirth (see also paragraph 82 of the Chamber judgment).",

Moreover, the responsibility of the State in this field necessarily implies a broader boundary for the State\u2019s power to lay down rules for the functioning of the health-care system, incorporating both State and private health-care institutions. In this context the Court notes that the present case involves a complex matter of health-care policy requiring an assessment by the national authorities of expert and scientific data concerning the risks of hospital and home births. In addition, general social and economic policy considerations come into play, including the allocation of financial means, since budgetary resources may need to be shifted from the general system of maternity hospitals to the provision of a framework for home births (see, mutatis mutandis, Maurice, cited above, \u00a7 84, with further references, and Stec and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052).",

In particular, the Court notes that planned home births are provided for in domestic law and regulated in twenty member States, but the right to choose this mode of delivery is never absolute and is always dependent on certain medical conditions being satisfied. In addition, national health insurance covers home birth in only fifteen of these countries. The Court further notes that home births are unregulated or under-regulated in twenty-three other countries. In some of these countries private home births do take place, but in a legal vacuum and without national health cover. Moreover, no legislation has been found which explicitly prohibits the assistance of midwives at home births. In a very small number of the member States surveyed, disciplinary or criminal sanctions are possible, but appear to be rarely imposed.",

In cases arising from individual applications the Court\u2019s task is not to review the relevant legislation or practice in the abstract; it must as far as possible confine itself, without overlooking the general context, to examining the issues raised by the case before it (see S.H. and Others v.\u00a0Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, with further references). Consequently, the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute its own view for that of the competent national authorities in determining the most appropriate policy for regulating matters regarding the circumstances of giving birth.

The Court notes in this connection that while there is generally no conflict of interest between the mother and her child, certain choices made by the mother as to the place, circumstances or method of delivery may be seen to give rise to an increased risk to the health and safety of newborns, whose mortality rate, as shown in figures for perinatal and neonatal deaths, is not negligible, despite all the advances in medical care (see also paragraph 94 of the Chamber judgment).",

Moreover, a maternity hospital can provide all the necessary urgent medical care, whereas this would not be possible in the case of a home birth, even with a midwife attending (see also paragraph 97 of the Chamber judgment). It is to be noted in this connection that the Czech Republic has not set up a system of specialist emergency assistance for cases of home births. Contrary to the applicants\u2019 argument (see paragraph 79 above), the lack of such a system would be likely to increase the potential risks for women giving birth at home and their babies.",

The existence of a margin of appreciation should not be equated with any kind of \u201ccarte blanche\u201d in favour of the national legislature. Otherwise, the rights guaranteed by the Convention would be devoid of any substance. In deciding any case under Article 8 of the Convention, a number of factors must be taken into account in order to determine the breadth of the margin of appreciation to be enjoyed by the State. Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin granted to the State will normally be restricted. Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see S.H. and Others v.

Childbirth represents one of the most intimate aspects of a woman\u2019s life. In this regard we agree with the majority, who describe birth as a unique and delicate moment in a woman\u2019s life (see paragraph 163 of the judgment). Secondly, we would like to underscore that there is generally no conflict of interest between the mother and her child (see paragraph 185). In other words, under ordinary circumstances we trust that a mother will choose the best option for the birth of her child, taking into account her own health and the health of her baby. Thirdly, the Court must always submit absolute prohibitions or blanket bans to the closest scrutiny. In Costa and Pavan v. Italy (no. 54270/10, \u00a7 68, 28 August 2012), concerning the Italian ban on the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), the Court reiterated that it had the power to examine the compatibility with the Convention of domestic measures even in areas in which the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation. In that case, the Court came to the conclusion that the measures taken had not been proportionate given that, although the applicants could opt for a termination of pregnancy on medical grounds, they did not have access to PGD (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 69\u201370). In other words, the Court has to be convinced that the national legislature has taken the different issues at stake into account (see S.H. and Others v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117) and that the final legislative framework does not lead to a paradoxical result.",

The law in the two countries \u2013 despite a different set of rules \u2013 renders assisted home births impossible in the case of Hungary and unsafe in the case of the Czech Republic. The parents concerned thus do not enjoy a real choice in the latter State, either, since a home birth without a midwife incontestably puts the lives of mother and child at risk.

When Ms Krejzov\u00e1 became pregnant again in 2011, she was unable to find a midwife willing to assist her because of the risk of a heavy fine (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). The national authorities contacted were unwilling to provide a solution. She was therefore obliged to give birth in hospital.

The argument itself is questionable given that the perinatal mortality rate in countries where home births with the assistance of a midwife are permitted is sometimes even lower or only insignificantly higher than the Czech rate (see above, paragraph 21). Moreover, the Czech Constitutional Court has itself stated that there is a certain degree of acceptable risk in these matters (see above, paragraph 29).",
