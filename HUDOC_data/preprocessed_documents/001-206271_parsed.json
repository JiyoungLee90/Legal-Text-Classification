According to the indictment, members of the group had entered into negotiations with officers of the Guardians of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Corps on the territory of Iran, had accepted several payments in cash from Iranian secret service officers, and had planned attacks in Baku against citizens of the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel, as well as attacks on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. With that purpose in mind, members of the group had undergone fitness and military training. Furthermore, in order to finance their operations, members of the group had planned robberies of persons and organisations and had smuggled 100,000 counterfeit United States dollars into the territory of Azerbaijan.

The Court further observes that the domestic courts did not take any measures to counterbalance the detrimental effect that the decision to hold the trial in camera must have had on public confidence in the proper administration of justice for the sake of protecting the State\u2019s interest in keeping its secrets. The Government did not argue \u2013 and there is no indication to the contrary in the documents submitted by the parties \u2013 that it was not open to the trial court to hold the trial publicly subject to clearing the courtroom for a single or, if need be, a number of non-public sessions to deal with classified documents or information. The Court therefore finds it remarkable that in such a situation the trial court preferred to close the entire trial to the public (see Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a084, 4 December 2008).",
