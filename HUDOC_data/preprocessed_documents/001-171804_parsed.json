The evidence in the file indicates that he has no fixed and lawful occupation (having declared himself available for employment from February 2008) and that the serious offences under consideration are such as to warrant the conclusion that he has, up until now, derived a significant part of his means of subsistence from criminal activity, by repeatedly resorting to crime either alone or in association with habitual offenders (whether in his municipality of residence or elsewhere). To ensure more thorough monitoring, it is therefore necessary to order not only special police supervision for a period of two years (a measure deemed reasonable on account of the subject\u2019s character as clearly emerges from the acts attributed to him), but also compulsory residence for the same duration.\u201d",

The reasoning of that judgment states that \u2018in determining the circumstances (requiring a preventive measure), the legislature should normally use different criteria from those employed to define the constituent elements of a criminal offence; it may also have recourse to elements of presumption, although these must always correspond to objectively identifiable types of behaviour. This does not mean less rigour, but a different type of rigour in defining and adopting preventive measures in comparison with the definition of criminal offences and the imposition of sentences.\u2019 With regard specifically to subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 1 of Act no.\u00a01423/1956, the court ruled out the possibility that \u2018preventive measures could be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion\u2019, instead requiring \u2018an objective assessment of the facts revealing the individual\u2019s habitual behaviour and standard of living, or specific outward signs of his or her criminal tendencies, which must have been established in such a way as to preclude purely subjective and unverifiable assessments by the authority ordering or applying the preventive measures\u2019.",

However, it concluded that in view of the particular circumstances of the case, the applicant had been \u201cdeprived of his liberty\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 and could therefore rely on the guarantees under that provision. The applicant, who was suspected of belonging to a \u201cband of mafiosi\u201d, had been forced to live on an island within an (unfenced) area of 2.5 sq. km, mainly together with other residents in a similar situation and supervisory staff. The requirement to live on the island was accompanied by other restrictions similar to the measures imposed on Mr de Tommaso. The Court attached particular significance to the extremely small size of the area where the applicant had been confined, the almost permanent supervision to which he had been subjected and the fact that it had been almost completely impossible for him to make social contacts (ibid., \u00a7\u00a095).",

The relevant provision was no longer in force at the time when the impugned measures were applied to the applicant. In respect of all other categories of individuals to whom the preventive measures are applicable, the Constitutional Court has come to the conclusion that Act no.\u00a01423/1956 contained a sufficiently detailed description of the types of conduct that were held to represent a danger to society. It has found that simply belonging to one of the categories of individuals referred to in section 1 of the Act was not a sufficient ground for imposing a preventive measure; on the contrary, it was necessary to establish the existence of specific conduct indicating that the individual concerned posed a real and not merely theoretical danger. Preventive measures could therefore not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion, but had to be based on an objective assessment of the \u201cfactual evidence\u201d revealing the individual\u2019s habitual behaviour and standard of living, or specific outward signs of his or her criminal tendencies (see the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law set out in paragraphs 45-55 above).",

For example, in Enea (cited above, \u00a7 107) the Court held that the complaint concerning the restrictions to which the applicant had allegedly been subjected as a result of being placed in a high-security unit was compatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention since it related to Article 6 under its civil head.

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State (see Nada, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 208-209; see also B\u00fcy\u00fckda\u011f v.

In certain circumstances, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may satisfy the requirements of Article 13 (see, among other authorities, Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, \u00a7 77, Series A no. 116).",

The Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning and its application of Act no. 1423/1956, as interpreted in the relevant case-law, show that there were important safeguards and conditions to be observed. This can be seen from the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in relation to the \u201ccurrent danger\u201d posed by the individual concerned. It noted that several different factors had to be taken into consideration, including previous criminal record, ongoing investigations and current activities, the individual\u2019s standard of living and means of subsistence, and the persons with whom he or she associated. It follows that the assessment required objective aspects, a sufficient factual basis and up-to-date evidence and information. It was precisely by applying the requirements as established in the case-law that the Bari Court of Appeal was able to quash the Bari District Court\u2019s judgment. This amounts to clear recognition of the foreseeability of the application of Act no. 1423/1956. In any event, the applicant \u2013 by seeking appropriate advice if need be \u2013 was in a position to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, whether he might belong to one of the categories of individuals to whom the preventive measures could be applied, as well as the nature and duration of the applicable measures.",

Despite the formal separation between criminal proceedings, governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and proceedings for the application of preventive measures, governed by the 1956 Act, evidence collected in the former proceedings could be used in the latter proceedings as indicative of the need for preventive measures.

They had an inherent anti-resocialising nature. This in turn increased the probability of the suspected person committing criminal offences whenever he or she breached the regime of restrictions imposed, since such a breach was punishable in itself as a criminal offence carrying a severe prison sentence. Hence, as Bricola quite rightly put it as far back as 1974, the application of personal measures for the purposes of crime prevention resulted in the commission of new criminal offences which provided a legal basis for the criminal prosecution of someone who initially could not be prosecuted because of lack of evidence. As a matter of fact, the tortuous logic of the 1956 Act did indeed have a great criminogenic potential.",

In practice, the interchangeability between preventive measures and interim measures, whose nature, regime and effects are different, became an escamotage of the law contained in books. Pending criminal proceedings, preventive measures under the 1956 Act functioned, in reality, as a powerful endo-procedural bargaining chip of the police and the prosecutors. To put it in crude terms, the tactical ascendancy of the police and the public prosecution service over the defence was much enhanced by the use of preventive measures as a means of putting pressure on a presumably innocent defendant to cooperate in the pending criminal proceedings.",

In this context the guarantee of judicial review was nothing but an illusion.

In the light of Buzadji, house arrest is a form of deprivation of liberty under Article 5 of the Convention. House arrest consists in the prohibition on the suspect leaving his or her home without permission from the relevant authorities. Pursuant to Article 284 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as a rule the person concerned may not leave home while he is under arresto domiciliario. But the court may authorise a defendant to leave home for work or other \u201cindispensable business\u201d (indispensabili esigenze di vita). The provision does not specify how many hours the person can spend away from home, leaving this determination to the court\u2019s discretion. The provision on detenzione domiciliare (section 47 ter (4) of Act no. 354/1975) refers to the above-mentioned Article 284 as for the regime governing the penalty. A breach of these provisions is punishable under Article 385 of the Criminal Code, which provides for a prison sentence of up to one year, and in cases involving the use of violence, up to five years.",

I put the word \u201cpreventive\u201d in quotation marks, since, as it unambiguously transpires from the case file, for the purposes of the domestic law applied there was nothing at all to \u201cprevent\u201d in the applicant\u2019s conduct. (I shall expand on this issue in due course.) I also agree as to the argument that, in the circumstances of the case, these measures would have equated to deprivation of liberty had they been assessed \u201ccumulatively and in combination\u201d, as required by the Guzzardi standard. In particular, the applicant in the instant case, unlike the one in Guzzardi (6 November 1980, \u00a7 108, Series A no. 39), was indeed not forced to live on an island, but the \u201cpreventive\u201d measures were imposed on him for a much longer period \u2013 221\u00a0days (and nights) as against 165 days in Guzzardi. In the instant case, a \u201ccumulative\u201d assessment of the impugned measures would have required undertaking a much more detailed examination of all the relevant factual circumstances, including the essence of each restrictive measure, individually and in \u201ccombination\u201d, as well as the fact that they had been imposed on the applicant under the (most realistic) threat of imprisonment. The need for such a thorough examination of the factual circumstances presupposed the examination of the complaint under Article 5.",

In the light of this finding, the majority\u2019s conclusion in the instant case that Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 is applicable to the applicant\u2019s situation, whereas Article 5 is not, means no less than that at least one form of deprivation of liberty is considered to be deprivation of liberty until the member State becomes a fully-fledged party to Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a04 and that the same form of deprivation of liberty ceases to be deprivation of liberty once Protocol No. 4 enters into force for the member State concerned (or, at the earliest date, once it ratifies this Protocol).

Some of these measures were very restrictive and included an element of deprivation of liberty in its most direct \u2013 \u201cphysical\u201d! \u2013 sense. To wit, the applicant was obliged \u201cnot to return home later than 10 p.m. or to leave home before 6 a.m., except in case of necessity and only after giving notice to the authorities in good time\u201d, which effectively included an element of house arrest and in this sense amounted to \u201cinterrupted\u201d, or \u201cincomplete\u201d, house arrest (on this issue, again, I concur with the arguments of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque). The majority\u2019s argument that this measure was not house arrest on the basis that \u201cunder Italian law, a person under house arrest is deemed to be in pre-trial detention\u201d (see paragraph 87 of the judgment) runs counter to the fundamental canons of interpretation of the Convention: it may well be that the measure discussed here \u2013 \u201cnot to return home later than 10 p.m. or to leave home before 6 a.m., except in case of necessity and only after giving notice to the authorities in good time\u201d \u2013 is not considered to be house arrest under Italian law, but is it not house arrest under the Convention? In my opinion, Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova ([GC], no. 23755/07, ECHR\u00a02016) speaks to the contrary. Firstly, the Convention is an instrument which is autonomous of domestic (in this case, Italian) law and has always been treated as such by the Court. Not any longer? Secondly, the 221 nights which the applicant spent while subjected to this measure (under the threat of imprisonment) indicate that the \u201cdegree and intensity\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 104) of the measure was far from negligible.",
