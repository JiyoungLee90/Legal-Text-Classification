As regards her claim for non-pecuniary damages, the court found that the applicant\u2019s great emotional suffering was established during the trial. However, the suffering was more intense during the several months immediately following the municipal council\u2019s initial refusal to sell the premises to the applicant. The court further noted during a hearing on 21\u00a0April 2008 that the applicant had interrupted her activities as a sole trader at the time, having moved to another city with her family. Given that it had not been demonstrated that the applicant had felt resentment and tension specifically as a result of the failure to enforce the judgment in her favour, no award for non-pecuniary damage was due to her.",

The Court reiterates that a \u201cclaim\u201d can constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v.

The Court then observes that the final judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour has now been fully enforced (see paragraphs 14 and 19 above). However, it notes that this only happened after the authorities opened two separate privatisation procedures in respect of the same property identified in the final judgment (see paragraphs 12 and 18 above). The time that elapsed between these procedures was significant and constituted a delay, given the date on which the judgment had become enforceable \u2013 18\u00a0February 2005.

Consequently, without prejudice to the steps the municipal authorities found necessary to take in order to implement the judgment (see paragraph 13 above), the Court considers that the overall time it took the authorities to open and complete the privatisation procedure, the fact that enforcement was initially only partially completed without a valid reason and that no compensation was awarded for this domestically, are sufficient for it to conclude that the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour was complied with after unreasonably long delay during which the applicant was unable to privatise and use the property in issue.",

Nonetheless, the administrative courts rejected her claim for pecuniary damages chiefly on the basis of the uncertainty that she would have actually complied with the steps needed on her part in order for the sale to materialise. In taking this approach the domestic courts failed to address the specific aspects of the violation under the Convention, namely the excessive delays in the enforcement of a final judgment by making a privatisation offer to the applicant. While the Court does not underestimate the difficulties in the assessment of damages as a result of loss of gains and opportunity, the Court finds the approach taken by the domestic courts in the present case excessively rigid, and one that failed to address the substance of the applicant\u2019s claim following from the violation of her Convention rights. Similarly, their approach in respect of establishing whether she had suffered non-pecuniary damage (see paragraph 16 above) did not sit well with the particularly strong presumption in favour of it established by the Court in cases of long delays in enforcement of final judgments.",

Furthermore, the sum she claimed for pecuniary damage included the difference between the price she paid for part of the property when she bought it in 2008 and the much lower price she would have paid for the same property had she bought it in 2005; that difference was in the amount of about EUR 477,000.

They further emphasised that the applicant\u2019s case did not concern restitution of property which had previously belonged to the applicant or to her predecessors, but only an obligation for the municipal authorities to start an administrative procedure for privatisation.

Thus, for an award to be made in respect of pecuniary damage, the applicant must demonstrate that there is a causal link between the violation and any financial loss alleged (see, for example, Dru\u017estevn\u00ed z\u00e1lo\u017ena Pria and Others v. the Czech Republic (just satisfaction), no. 72034/01, \u00a7 9, 21 January 2010).",

The applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damages, however, is based on a scenario of potential activities, which is not entirely supported by the evidence presented by her and which does not reflect the inherent degree of risks and uncertainty of commercial activities. In resolving this issue, the Court must take into account the many imponderables brought about by the commercial nature of the activities and the limitations the Court faces in establishing the relevant facts. As to the claim for non-pecuniary damages, the violations the Court has found must have caused the applicant disruption and prolonged uncertainty in the conduct of her business activities. This must also have caused her feelings of helplessness and frustration (see and compare Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. , \u00a7 221, ECHR\u00a02012).",
