Without prejudging the adequacy and proportionality of this measure, the Court observes that the time period of 1992-1994 corresponds roughly to the period of intensive military actions in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas when hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee their permanent places of residence in the conflict area. In the present case, it has been conclusively established by the domestic courts that H. settled in the applicant's apartment in 1997, i.e.\u00a0approximately three years after the expiry of the \u201cprotection period\u201d provided for by the IDP Settlement Regulations and approximately four years after they fled Agdam in 1993. Accordingly, the applicant's case was outside the scope of Article 4 of the IDP Settlement Regulations.",

It would appear that, in the present case, the decision to postpone the execution of the judicial eviction order was in breach of these provisions.
