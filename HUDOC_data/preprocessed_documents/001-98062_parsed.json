The local public had not been aware of the incident until the article in question was published in the mass media. All members of the baseball team had suffered non-pecuniary damage due to the false accusations published in the article. The court concluded that the accusations were so serious that their accuracy should have been verified very carefully, which the applicants had failed to do. As to the compensation awarded, the court noted that the defamation was directed at all players of the team and that they could receive compassionate support from each other. The court took this into account when reducing the amount of compensation awarded for their suffering.",

The text on the front page of the magazine as well as the headline and the text of the article had clearly indicated that the rape had been a fact that had actually taken place.

The rape suspicion had thus been conducive to complicating the everyday life of the players and their families.

Moreover, the allegations were of a serious nature and were presented as statements of fact rather than value judgments.

However, the Court observes that in the instant case the applicants were at no stage required to disclose the identity of their sources.

In addition, all three defendants in the domestic proceedings, together with the publishing company, were ordered to pay damages and costs and expenses jointly and severally in a total amount of EUR 89,000 plus interest, of which EUR\u00a081,600 plus interest was attributable to the three applicants in the present case before the Court. However, it should be borne in mind that the amount of compensation to be paid by the applicants to the members of the baseball team was only EUR\u00a04,000 or EUR 5,000 per member although there were twelve members in the team.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a047579/99, \u00a7 50, 20 April 2006, and the case-law cited therein). In view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.\u00a0France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007-..., Radio France and Others v. France, no.\u00a053984/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2004-II and Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, \u00a7 68, 14 February 2008). Nevertheless, the Court notes that when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court recalls that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists' freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article\u00a010 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired, as for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a033348/96, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2004-XI). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate. The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4\u00a0October 2007).",

Nor can it be argued that the penalties imposed produced a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on media freedom seen in terms of investigative journalism and the right of the public to be informed of matters of public concern. The commission of a crime and the circumstances in which it is committed are matters of public concern. The Court's case-law, however, clearly illustrates that other imperatives have to be weighed in the balance before an incident is reported by the media to the public as fact. The Court has already underscored the importance of the presumption of innocence in this connection.

While the accusation made in the article was doubtless very serious, I attach importance to the fact that it did not suggest that all or any particular members of the team were involved in the alleged rape; one was, indeed, expressly exonerated, the article recording that the player had intervened to stop the assault. In this respect the case bears a strong resemblance to that of Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-III, in which it was alleged that members of the 17-man crew of a seal hunting vessel, the M/S Harmoni, had committed reprehensible and unlawful acts of cruelty on the animals. The impugned article named 10 crew members whom the seal hunting inspector had exonerated. While the remaining crew members of the vessel were easily identifiable, the Court observed that the potential adverse effect of the impugned statement on the reputation and rights of each individual was \u201csignificantly attenuated by several factors. In particular the fact that the criticism was not an attack against all the crew members or any specific crew member (see the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v.  judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 28, \u00a7 66)\u201d. In the same way, in the present case the impact of the article was substantially attenuated by the fact that no accusation was levelled against any specific team member or against all the members of the team.",

It was an allegation which had been formally made in a signed and witnessed statement and notified not merely to public officials but to the management of the team itself some 8 months before. What, to my mind, is more striking than any failure on the part of the applicants to seek the comments of the team on the allegation, is the apparent failure on the part of the public officials or management of the team to investigate the allegation at the material time with a view to establishing its truth or falsity and, in the event of its being found to be false, to issue a denial or to take action against the student herself for defamation. In these circumstances, to hold not only that the applicants, as defendants, were required to adduce further proof of the truth of the allegation but that they could only do so by disclosing their sources and identifying witnesses to whom they had guaranteed anonymity is to set the bar too high.",

According to the press release issued by the police in April 2002, the investigation was suspended only because the victim of the alleged rape had not been able to identify the offender or offenders or \u201cto clarify the event in such detail that the offence could be attributed to a particular person or persons\u201d.",

However, it is also true that, in holding an interference with freedom of expression to have been disproportionate, the Court has on several occasions placed reliance on the fact that recourse could have been had to measures other than criminal sanctions, notably civil remedies (see, for example, Lehideux and Isorni v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 57; Raichinov v. Bulgaria no. 47579/99, \u00a7 50, 20 April 2006).

I cannot agree. The individual applicants were not only convicted of a criminal offence but were ordered to pay 60 day-fines amounting to EUR 3,540 and EUR 1,920, respectively. In addition, all three defendants to the domestic proceedings, together with the publishing company, were ordered to pay damages and costs and expenses jointly and severally in a total amount of EUR 89,000 plus interest to the members of the baseball team, out of which EUR 81,600 plus interest was attributable to the present applicants before the Court. Even if, contrary to my view, the prosecution and conviction of the applicants had been otherwise justified under Article 10, I consider that the very substantial sums imposed by way of fines and awarded in compensation, in a case where no individuals had been identified as having committed or participated in the alleged rape, were out of all proportion to any legitimate aim served.",

I do consider that the reaction \u2013 especially inaction - of public authorities in cases of allegations of rape is of public interest and even concern, which leads also to a positive obligation of the authorities to intervene (see X and Y v.
