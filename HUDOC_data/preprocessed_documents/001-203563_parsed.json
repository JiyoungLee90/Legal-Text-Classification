It also emphasised that no formal decision on gender reassignment was delivered; the registration of the gender change in the birth register itself served as the decision. As a non-Hungarian citizen enjoying refugee status in Hungary, the applicant did not have a family register record in Hungary, so the practice followed in respect of Hungarian citizens could not be applied to his case.

The Constitutional Court held that the right to change one\u2019s name was a fundamental one. This was even more the case when it came to changing name after gender reassignment, because of the inviolability of human identity and human dignity. Changing name following a change of gender fell within the ambit of the right to a name. In fact, changing name went hand in hand with changing gender, in so far as everyone was entitled to have a name that was aligned with his or her gender. The State was therefore obliged to adopt regulations that acknowledged gender reassignment and provided a discrimination-free opportunity to enter the resulting name change into the register. The complete lack of regulations excluded lawfully settled non-Hungarian citizens from the name-changing procedure, including those whose country of origin did not allow for such a procedure. The Constitutional Court considered that the legislative omission identified was disproportionately restrictive and unconstitutional. In its view, the legislator was under the obligation to find a different solution for petitioners without Hungarian birth certificates, for example by entering the change of name in other documents received from the Hungarian authorities. The Constitutional Court called upon Parliament to meet its legislative duty by 31 December 2018 and invited the applicant to resubmit his request.",

The Budapest Administrative and Labour Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s case, reiterating that the Hungarian administrative authorities had no jurisdiction in the matter (see paragraph 11 above). In its decision of 19 June 2018, the Constitutional Court established that there existed an unconstitutional legislative omission with respect to the name-changing procedure for lawfully settled non-Hungarian citizens such as the applicant (see paragraph\u00a013 above). It required Parliament to introduce a remedy for this omission by 31 December 2018, which has yet to be done. Accordingly, the Court considers that it was not unreasonable for the applicant to initiate judicial proceedings to have his position settled at domestic level before submitting his complaint to the Court. It therefore considers that the applicant\u2019s court action cannot be regarded as futile. The Court is satisfied that it interrupted the running of the six-month time-limit and, consequently, dismisses the Government\u2019s objection on non-compliance with the six-month rule.",

While the applicants for legal gender recognition had to provide a medical expert opinion diagnosing transsexuality and recommending gender reassignment surgery, the latter was not in itself a prerequisite for the recognition (see ibid.). However, as observed by the Constitutional Court, there was a gap in the relevant legislation in that there was no statutory basis allowing for recognition of gender reassignment and access to the name-changing procedure for lawfully settled non-Hungarian citizens (see paragraph 13 above). Therefore, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint falls to be examined from the standpoint of whether or not the respondent State has failed to comply with the positive obligation to secure the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life, in particular by not providing him with a procedure allowing him to have his gender identity legally recognised in the absence of a Hungarian birth certificate (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 29683/16, \u00a7\u00a7 63-65, 17\u00a0January 2019, and L. v.

It stresses that its task is not to take the place of the competent national authorities in determining the most appropriate policy governing procedures for changing gender and name. Therefore, the Court does not call into question as such the choice of the Hungarian authorities to regulate the legal recognition of gender change as a special kind of name-changing procedure performed by a registrar keeping the register of births (see paragraphs 14-16 above). Nevertheless, as regards the balancing of the competing interests, the Court also notes that an essential aspect of individuals\u2019 intimate identity is central to the present application because it concerns an individual\u2019s gender identity, a sphere in which the Contracting States have a narrow margin of appreciation (see H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7 67, and A.P., Gar\u00e7on and Nicot, cited above, \u00a7 123).",

It further observes that the domestic authorities rejected the applicant\u2019s application purely on formal considerations, without examining his situation and therefore without conducting any balancing exercise of the competing interests. In particular, the relevant authorities did not take into account the fact that the applicant had been recognised as a refugee precisely because he had been persecuted on the grounds of his transgenderism in his country of origin. The Court considers that in the circumstances of his case the applicant could not reasonably have been expected to pursue the recognition of gender reassignment and the namechange procedure in his country of birth.
