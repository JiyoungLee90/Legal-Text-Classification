In view of the applicants\u2019 submissions and the UN Special Rapporteur\u2019s report, and in the absence of any convincing information to the contrary from the Government, the Court accepts the applicants\u2019 argument that Chios Prison was filled beyond its capacity during the course of their detention, to the point that there was a flagrant lack of personal space.
