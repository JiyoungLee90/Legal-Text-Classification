In particular, the allegation of overcrowding of the living areas is not supported by, at the very least, an indication of the actual living space or number of convicts. It appears therefore that the applicant was allocated at least 2.3 square meters of personal space in the sleeping area and that he was at all times provided with an individual bunk bed. The Court observes that this figure conforms to the domestic standard of 2.0 sq. m for male convicts in correctional colonies. Furthermore, it reiterates that the personal space in the dormitory must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees in correctional colonies during the daytime, which ensures that they have unobstructed access to natural light and air (see Solovyev v. Russia (dec.), no.76114/01, 27\u00a0September 2007; Nurmagomedov v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004; and Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a044558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107, ECHR 2001-VIII). Although it has been alleged that the lighting, ventilation and sanitary conditions in the dormitory were inadequate, no further details were provided. Finally, the allegation about the presence of inmates infected with tuberculosis is not accompanied by any examples of such detainees being placed in the applicant\u2019s dormitory, or by mention of any incidents, known to him, of other inmates contracting tuberculosis in Uch-398/5. In view of the applicant\u2019s failure to substantiate his allegations concerning conditions in the correctional colony, the Court considers the applicant\u2019s complaint manifestly ill-founded. Furthermore, as regards the complaint under Article 13, in this respect the Court reiterates that the applicant has no arguable claim and that therefore the requirement of a remedy does not materialise. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected pursuant to Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and 4 of the Convention.",

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101). When a person is held in detention, the State must ensure that he is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7 102, and Kudla v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR 2000-XI). When assessing conditions of detention, one must consider their cumulative effects as well as the applicant\u2019s specific allegations (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001II). The duration of detention is also a relevant factor.",

In this respect the Court has already found a violation of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (c) of the Convention in a number of cases concerning a similar set of facts. In particular, it has held that the absence of any grounds given by judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time is incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0134; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71, 2 March 2006; and Sta\u0161aitis v. , no. 47679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002). Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 142).",
