Thus, it cannot be said that she did not show an interest in having the relevant facts elucidated through a criminal investigation at the domestic level (contrast Akhvlediani and Others, cited above, \u00a7 25; Manukyan v. Georgia (dec.), no. 53073/07, \u00a7\u00a030, 9 October 2012; and Deari and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 54415/09, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 6 March 2012). The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s claim that the six-month timelimit ought to be calculated from the prosecutorial decision of 18 May 2011. That decision was of a rather anodyne procedural nature, merely rejecting the applicant\u2019s request to have access to the criminal case file; it was not a decision on the final discontinuation of the proceedings, nor was it a decision undermining the eventual effectiveness of the investigation by prejudging its outcome (compare, for instance, Sakvarelidze v.

Turkey, no. 3598/03, \u00a7 61, 16 April 2013). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see, among other authorities, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7\u00a7 97-100, ECHR 2000-VII, and Akta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 24351/94, \u00a7\u00a7 289-91, ECHR 2003-V (extracts)).",

Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital for maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. In order to comply with the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention, the investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to the establishment of the relevant facts and to the identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those responsible. This is an obligation which concerns the means to be employed and not the results to be achieved. The authorities must take reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning an incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death. The requirements of promptness and reasonable expedition are implicit in this context (see, as a recent authority, Vazagashvili and Shanava v. Georgia, no. 50375/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08081, 18 July 2019, with further references). In a significant number of cases already brought before the Court, the finding of a violation was largely based on the existence of unreasonable delays and a lack of diligence on the authorities\u2019 part in conducting the proceedings, regardless of the final outcome of those proceedings (see, for example, Merkulova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 21454/04, \u00a7 51, 3 March 2011, with further references).",

This means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection, but also a practical independence. Moreover, an investigation must be accessible to the victim\u2019s family to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests. There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation, the degree of which may vary from case to case. Furthermore, the investigation\u2019s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation\u2019s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and, where appropriate, the identity of those responsible. The authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7 175, 14 April 2015, and El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2012). While compliance with the procedural requirements of Article 2 is assessed on the basis of several essential parameters, including those mentioned above, these elements are interrelated and each of them, taken separately, does not amount to an end in itself. They are criteria which, when taken jointly, enable the degree of effectiveness of the investigation to be assessed. It is in relation to this purpose of an effective investigation that any issues, including those of promptness and reasonable expediency, must be assessed (see, as a recent authority, Kukhalashvili and Others v. Georgia, nos. 8938/07 and 41891/07, \u00a7 131, 2 April 2020, with further references).",

However, the very first investigative measures were carried out, in the immediate aftermath of his death, by investigators of the same authority, and not by the prosecution authority, contrary to what was required by the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 18 above). Although the prosecution authority took charge of the investigation at a later stage, the public prosecutors relied, as was acknowledged by the Government, exclusively on the evidence previously collected by the Ministry (see paragraph 11 above). That being so, the Court considers that the primary and most decisive investigative steps taken by the investigators of the Ministry of the Interior, apart from apparently constituting an unexplained deviation from the domestic procedural rules, manifestly fell foul of the requisite requirements of independence and impartiality under Article 2 of the Convention. Such a procedural deficiency could not but taint the subsequent developments in the investigation (see, for instance, Vazagashvili and Shanava, cited above, \u00a7 87, and Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, no. 25091/07, \u00a7\u00a7 245-49, 26\u00a0April 2011). As regards the conduct of the investigation after it had been taken over by the regional prosecutor\u2019s office on 18 August 2008, the Court is particularly concerned by the latter authority\u2019s inexplicable, persistent and, therefore, possibly deliberate refusal to involve the applicant by allowing her to benefit fully from the civil-party status she was entitled to. Without that procedural standing, the applicant was not able to exercise any procedural rights at all (see paragraphs 18-20 above). She could not obtain any information about the investigation and was not even allowed to consult the report on the post-mortem forensic examination of her husband\u2019s body (see also paragraph 39 below, and compare with Vazagashvili and Shanava, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

Such a prohibitive delay points to the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to comply with the requirements of promptness and reasonable expedition (see, for instance, Star\u010devi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 80909/12, \u00a7 58, 13\u00a0November 2014). The Court cannot discern any particular reason for such a protracted investigation at the domestic level. This lack of due diligence, which in the eyes of the Court looks like a deliberate delay, is yet another indication that the criminal review has proved to be far from rigorous and has deprived the applicant of any possibility of obtaining redress (compare Sakvarelidze, cited above, \u00a7 54). In this connection, the Court reiterates that justice delayed is often justice denied, as the existence of unreasonable periods of inactivity and a lack of diligence on the authorities\u2019 part in conducting the proceedings renders the investigation ineffective irrespective of its final outcome (see, as a recent authority, Vazagashvili and Shanava, cited above, \u00a7 89).",

The burden of proof is therefore on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation as to how exactly the events in question unfolded (see, among many other authorities, Khayrullina v\u00a0 Russia, no.\u00a029729/09, \u00a7\u00a7 69-72, 19 December 2017), the absence of which will, according to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part (see, among many other authorities, Saribekyan and Balyan v.

Since the next of kin of the deceased has not been given access to and, without any explanation, the Government have not provided the Court with the results of the post-mortem examination of the body of the applicant\u2019s husband despite its crucial relevance for explaining his injuries and establishing the cause of his death, the Court cannot accept the official version of the reasons behind the use of lethal force. In this connection, the Court also takes note of the eyewitness accounts of police brutality surrounding the arrest of the applicant\u2019s husband and of the nature of the injuries clearly visible on the video-footage of the deceased\u2019s body, observations which are hardly compatible with the Government\u2019s claim that the taking of R.Sh.\u2019s life had been a result of the use of force necessary to prevent his escape from arrest (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 21 above, and compare Vatsayeva v.\u00a0Russia [Committee], no.\u00a044658/12, \u00a7 61, 21 January 2020).",
