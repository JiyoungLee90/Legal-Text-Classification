The Court finds no reason which would require it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In particular, criminal charges were pending against the applicant for a considerable length of time, and he could not be sure that he would not face further legal consequences if he, as a publisher, published other books on similar matters, either during those criminal proceedings or at any future stage. The Court considers that the seven and a half years of criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant, in view of the chilling effect which those proceedings may well have caused, cannot be viewed as solely comprising purely hypothetical risks to the applicant, and considers that they constituted genuine and effective restrictions per se. The declaration that the proceedings had become time-barred merely put an end to the above-mentioned risks, but did not alter the fact that those risks had put the applicant under pressure for a substantial period of time (ibid. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049 and 50; see also Semir\u00a0G\u00fczel\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 29483/09, \u00a7\u00a7 26-31, 13\u00a0September 2016).

In the Court\u2019s view, given that serious disturbances have occurred between the security forces and members of the PKK since approximately 1984, involving a very heavy loss of life and the imposition of emergency rule in much of the south-east of Turkey for many years, it may be concluded that the book may be considered to contain issues of public concern.

In particular, in the preface, the results of the war are presented as \u201cvaluable\u201d and the deaths of members of the PKK are romanticised. On page 106, the destruction of the security forces\u2019 vehicles was announced as very good news, and the author expresses his desire to \u201cget in a good shot\u201d. Lastly, on page 107, an armed clash between the PKK and the security forces was described as an enjoyable event. Hence, the Court finds that the domestic authorities\u2019 assessment that the passages in question constituted incitement to violence and to other methods of terrorism was reasonable. Indeed, the message which was communicated to the reader in those parts is that recourse to violence is necessary, satisfactory, and even pleasant (see, mutatis mutandis, S\u00fcrek (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a062).",

While it is true that there is nothing in the case file showing that the applicant personally associated himself with the views contained in the preface and on pages 106 and 107, he nevertheless provided the writers with an outlet for stirring up violence (see S\u00fcrek v.

For that reason, he was vicariously subject to the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d which authors take on when they disseminate their writings to the public, and which assume an even greater importance in situations of conflict and tension (see S\u00fcrek\u00a0(no.\u00a01), cited above, \u00a7 63; S\u00fcrek (no. 3), cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; Halis\u00a0Do\u011fan v.
