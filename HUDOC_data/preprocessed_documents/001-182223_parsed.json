The purpose of the limitation is clear \u2013 to guarantee the effectiveness of tutelage or guardianship. It is incumbent on the relevant Custody and Care Authority to supervise the conditions in which a child is maintained and educated; and it would seem very difficult, indeed impossible, to conduct such supervision abroad, periodically reviewing the conditions of the child\u2019s placement.",

Whatever good reasons the authorities had for not granting her request, such ignorance on their part was unacceptable. \u201cNo more humiliating reply than a contemptuous\u00a0silence\u201d as Michel de Montaigne would have it. Contemptuous silence from judicial authorities dealing with private interests of the utmost importance is in itself a violation of the Convention.",
