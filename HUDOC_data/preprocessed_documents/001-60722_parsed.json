In 1969 the lease was renewed until September 1973, with the option to extend until September 1977. In paragraph\u00a01 of the third page of the lease, the rented property was described as being \u201csituated at Grivas Digenis Avenue on plot\u00a0565\u201d. Paragraph 5(e) of the lease provided that the landlord authorised the tenant as her agent to sign all applications concerning the plants and works which Mobil would construct, reconstruct, operate and continue to operate on the plot, and generally to do all things necessary on her behalf.",

The legal effect of the publication of the street-widening scheme was merely to impose a restriction upon any future development of plot 565. The restriction could only take effect if and when the applicant applied for a permit for the development of that plot. In such a case, the development would not be unfettered; the affected part of the plot would become part of the street. The restriction in question was imposed by Cap 96, which at the material time was the key legislation controlling town planning and the development of immovable property. The street-widening scheme was enforced pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of Cap 96 in the public interest, namely the improvement of the existing road network. At the time, Grivas Digenis Avenue was becoming one of the most central streets of Nicosia. In assessing the proportionality of the interference, the Government recall that Article\u00a023(3) of the Constitution provides for the payment of just compensation for any restriction or limitation which materially decreases the economic value of property.

Section\u00a013 of Cap. 96 provides a machinery which is completely different from a procedure of compulsory acquisition and which amounts to a direct and automatic expropriation without compensation because a permit is being given. The permit is used as an excuse to facilitate the streetwidening scheme without the public authorities paying compensation to the owners of the property. The fact that a permit is needed to activate the procedure cannot change the nature of the measure. The threat contained in section 13 prohibits the owner from doing anything with his land unless he transfers that part of the land affected by the street-widening scheme. Although expropriation under section 13 is effected automatically on the grant of a building permit, the street-widening scheme may never be implemented, but Cap. 96 does not provide for the return of the property taken, whereas Article\u00a023 \u00a7\u00a05 of the Constitution does foresee the return of unused property compulsorily acquired.",

France (judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no 253-B). In the present case the applicant was aware of the provisions of the street-widening scheme upon its publication in the Official Gazette; she was notified of the fact that the building permit could only be issued in accordance with the requirements of the street-widening scheme and she failed to challenge the acts of the public authorities. As to the question of locus standi, the Government submit that, even if the requirements under domestic law impose a limitation on the right of access, such limitation is reasonable and pursues a legitimate aim: the smooth operation of public administration. On 8 December 1992 the applicant did not transfer 21,428 square feet of land. She transferred her entire legal title in plot 565. This is why she no longer had an interest in the proceedings.",

Even if the Supreme Court was right in saying that the applicant had lost her locus standi, it should not have dismissed the appeal without giving her daughter an opportunity to intervene in the proceedings. As a result of the decision of the Supreme Court, neither the old nor the new owners of the remainder of the plot could have had a right to participate in a hearing determining ownership claims. However, the Supreme Court held that for a party to have locus standi it must have a legitimate interest at all relevant times: at the time the disputed act was effected, at the time of filing the application and at the time of its adjudication. Finally, had the applicant been informed about the deprivation 22 years ago when it occurred (1978 to 1979), the question of its legality would have been settled many years earlier, without the fate of the applicant\u2019s appeal being affected by the transfer of the applicant\u2019s property to her children on 8 December 1992.",

However, if the Court decided to grant an award, the Government stress that the deprivation of the property took place on 27\u00a0March 1978 and maintain that it would be difficult to accept the relevance of the market value of the property at any time after that date, in particular in view of the fact that in 1992 she transferred her rights to her children. Furthermore, the Court should take into consideration that in 1978 the market value of plot 565 was 70 Cyprus pounds per square meter, and that by 1978, because of the street-widening scheme, considerable betterment had accrued to the remaining part of plot 565 and its market value thus increased.",
