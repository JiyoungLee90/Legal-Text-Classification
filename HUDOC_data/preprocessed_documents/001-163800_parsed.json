Having examined the Government\u2019s respective objection in detail, the Court held that the existing legal framework in Russia did not provide unitary enterprises with the degree of institutional and operational independence that would absolve the State from any responsibility under the Convention for any such companies\u2019 debts (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0193-204). In order to determine the issue of State responsibility for the debts of unitary enterprises, the Court must examine whether and how the extensive powers of control provided for in the domestic law were actually exercised by the authorities in a given case (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0204-06). Applying that approach to the same unitary enterprise which appears in the present case, and referring to the same facts as outlined in paragraphs\u00a05-6 above, the Court found that the company\u2019s assets and activities were, as a matter of fact, controlled and managed by the authorities to a decisive extent at the relevant time. Therefore, the Court concluded that the company had not enjoyed sufficient institutional and operational independence from the municipal authority (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0215-19).",

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the judgments given in the applicant\u2019s favour in 2004 and 2006 have remained unenforced to date. While liquidation proceedings, which in this case ended in October 2006, may objectively justify some limited delay in enforcement, the facts of the present case would rather suggest that the municipal authority did not consider itself bound to honour the salary-related judgment debt in the employee\u2019s favour after it decided to liquidate the company (see, mutatis mutandis, Yershova v. Russia, no. 1387/04, \u00a7\u00a072, 8 April 2010, and Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0220-21, with further references).
