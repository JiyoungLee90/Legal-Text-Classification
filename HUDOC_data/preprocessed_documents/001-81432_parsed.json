Secondly, paediatricians had made a mistake when attending to the child immediately after birth. The parents alleged that a catheter inserted into the child's umbilical artery had been abnormally bent to a U-shape and left that way for approximately 32 hours.

The situation in which the doctors found themselves when they decided to leave the catheter alone must be kept in mind; as noted above, this provided the only arterial access, as matters had developed.

It is not, therefore, possible to say that there is a causal relationship between the positioning of the catheter and the respondent's brain damage.

It was incomprehensible that such a decision should have been taken without giving the parties an opportunity to comment on the measure beforehand. A large number of similar cases had been decided without first obtaining the SMLB's opinion. It had been the view of both parties that the evidence that had already been submitted was sufficient for the Supreme Court's examination. In the applicant's view, since the parties had, in accordance with their right to determine the subject matter of the dispute, been in agreement as to what evidence should constitute the basis for the Supreme Court's adjudication, the latter had had no authority to take investigative measures of its own. When the Supreme Court had, contrary to the principles of Icelandic procedural law, nevertheless sought of its own accord the opinion of the SMLB, the applicant had had legitimate grounds to fear that it lacked the impartiality required by Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

The Supreme Court's conclusion was obviously based on a comprehensive assessment of the evidence as a whole, i.e. both the expert opinions submitted to the District Court, provided by doctors from both the NUH and elsewhere, and those provided by the SMLB in the form of answers to particular questions, where four of the nine members were employees of the NUH.

The Court sees no reason to call into doubt the correctness of the Supreme Court's interpretation and application of domestic law to the effect that it was empowered to request an opinion from the SMLB irrespective of the parties' stance on that question.

The Court further reiterates that the Convention does not lay down rules on evidence as such. In the Court's view, a decision to appoint an expert, be it with or without the parties' consent, is a matter that normally falls within the national court's discretion under Article 6 \u00a7 1 in assessing the admissibility and relevance of evidence, which has been recognised by the Court in its case-law (see Eskelinen and Others\u00a0v.

France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, p.\u00a0436, \u00a7\u00a033). However, the opinion of an expert who has been appointed by the competent court to address issues arising in the case is likely to carry significant weight in that court's assessment of those issues. In its case-law the Court has recognised that the lack of neutrality on the part of a court appointed expert may in certain circumstances give rise to a breach of the principle of equality of arms inherent in the concept of a fair trial (see B\u00f6nisch v. Austria, judgment of 6 May 1985 (Merits), Series A no. 92, \u00a7\u00a7 30-35; and Brandstetter v. Austria, judgment of 28 August 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0211, p.\u00a021, \u00a7\u00a033).

Their task was not simply to give an expert opinion on any given subject that might or might not differ from an opinion previously stated by their colleagues and the management at the NUH on the same subject. In preparing the SMLB's expert opinion for the Supreme Court, the four members in question were called upon to do something more intricate, namely to analyse and assess the performance of their colleagues at the NUH with the aim of assisting the Supreme Court in determining the question of their employer's liability. Therefore, the Court is unable to share the Government's view that this was merely a question of experts being employed by the same administrative authority as that involved in the case (see B\u00f6nisch, cited above, \u00a7 32; cf.

Austria, judgment of 22 October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a084, pp.\u00a019-20, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, relating to the independence of civil servant members of a tribunal in a subordinate position vis-\u00e0-vis one of the parties). In the Court's view, that endorsement is an important consideration. Conversely, the Court sees no need to consider the applicant's additional argument that the Supreme Court's refusal to exclude the said statements from the case-file disclosed a lack of fairness in the proceedings.
