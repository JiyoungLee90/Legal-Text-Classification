The applicant later further specified the period for which he was complaining as being from 29 November 2007 to 27\u00a0September 2011. He argued that the conditions in which he had been held in the remand prison had been degrading: the cells had been overcrowded; there had been rats and insects; and his sight had deteriorated owing to insufficient lighting. The court applied the three-year period of limitation and found that the relevant period to be considered was from 10\u00a0June 2009 to 10 June 2012. The court held that the applicant had been held in overcrowded cells for two years, although the period was nonconsecutive, and awarded him LTL 300 (approximately EUR 87) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The court held that the applicant had failed to substantiate his other complaints with evidence.",

Although the Court cannot apply the presumption of overcrowding automatically, it has, however, already accepted the conclusions of the CPT that overcrowding in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison was further aggravated by deplorable conditions on account of dilapidated and dirty cells and furnishings, a lack of sufficient heating in winter, and poor ventilation (see Mironovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 142). Moreover, it has also already accepted the CPT\u2019s findings that inmates in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison spend about twentythree\u00a0hours a day in cells (see Mironovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0143). The Court has repeatedly held that a short length of time for outdoor exercise, for instance when it is limited to about one hour per day, may be a factor that exacerbates the situation of a prisoner confined to his or her cell the rest of the time (ibid., \u00a7 143; see also Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 151, 10\u00a0January\u00a02012; Neshkov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 36925/10 and 5 others, \u00a7 235, 27 January 2015; and contrast Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 161).",

Lithuania, no. 41252/12, \u00a7 58, 19 April 2016). It was the Government\u2019s view that Mr\u00a0S. Tomas was seeking to mislead the Court by formally using the other lawyer\u2019s name, while de facto continuing to represent the applicants. The Government argued that in those exceptional circumstances the applicants, who had been informed about the Court\u2019s decision on Mr S. Tomas, should have sought alternative representation under Rule 36 \u00a7 4 (b) of the Rules of Court. In the alternative, the Government argued that the sums requested were excessive, ungrounded and unsubstantiated. In addition, as copies of the payment order for those sums had not been included, some doubts could arise as to whether the applicants had in fact paid them.",
