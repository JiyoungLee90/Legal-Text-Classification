However, one of the characteristics of sufficient redress relates to the amount awarded. The Court has already had occasion to indicate that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court. The Court also reiterates that in order to constitute sufficient redress, the compensation must be paid without delays (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v.

On the other hand, it will assess, on the basis of the material in its possession and in the light of its case-law, whether the compensation awarded in respect of non-pecuniary damage was sufficient. The applicant was awarded RUB\u00a01,200 \u2013 which was equivalent to approximately 35 euros (EUR) at the date of the adoption of the judgment \u2013 for the two-year delay in enforcement. The Court observes that this amount is approximately one per cent of what it has normally awarded in similar cases against .

France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7\u00a015, ECHR 2002-VIII). The exhaustion rule must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case. This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account, in particular, of the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.

However, the applicant had already had recourse to that remedy in respect of the delay in enforcement of another judgment. The remedy proved to be ineffective because of the insufficient amount and belated payment of the compensation awarded (see paragraph 39 above).

The Government claimed that the Ministry of Finance could not enforce it because the applicant had not submitted a certified copy of the judgment and had not indicated his bank details. The Court notes that the Ministry of Finance did not inform the applicant about those defects until seven months later. After the applicant re-submitted the writ, it took the authorities another six months to pay the award. The Court accepts that a certain delay in the enforcement of the judgment of 26 March 2001 was caused by the applicant\u2019s failure to indicate his bank details. However, having regard to the overall delay in the enforcement \u2013 at least thirteen months of which were attributable to the authorities \u2013 the Court finds that the judgment of 26 March 2001 was not enforced within a reasonable time.",
