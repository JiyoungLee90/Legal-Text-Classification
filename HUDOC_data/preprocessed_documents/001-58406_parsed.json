In accordance with its aim to ensure a regular medical supply for the population, it introduced a licencing system, whereby the grant of a licence depended exclusively on public interest considerations. Such considerations also underlie a number of other provisions of the Pharmacy Act. The Government also referred to case-law of the Constitutional Court according to which the grant of a licence to exercise a gainful profession was a State measure which, in the Austrian legal tradition, was rooted in public law. In sum, the Government contended that in the regulation of the profession of pharmacists in Austria, the public-law features prevailed over the elements of private law.",
