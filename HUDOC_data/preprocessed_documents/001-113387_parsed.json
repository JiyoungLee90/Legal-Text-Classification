In particular, he emphasised that there was a large number of aliens for whom deportation proceedings were pending. He added that they were detained in police stations for periods varying between ten days and three months. The Ombudsman observed that the infrastructure of the Thessaloniki Police Headquarters and of police stations in general was quite unlike that of detention centres, and therefore they were only suitable for detentions of very short duration. The Ombudsman made reference to a police document (no. 1026/5/22/1-\u03b8/30.3.2007) which acknowledges a lack of sufficient space in police stations, total absence of space to walk around, hygiene problems, deficiencies with respect to medical care, and security problems. In addition, the Ombudsman notes the lack of infrastructure for feeding the prisoners. It was observed that, instead of providing food to inmates, each one received from the authorities the amount of 5.87 euros (EUR) per day. For the Ombudsman, this amount would not always be sufficient, since this depended on the pricing of the dishes offered by the restaurant, which was the sole meal provider for the police station.",

According to the Ombudsman, this problem proved to be more important in northern Greece because of the refusal of the  judicial prison to accept a greater number of inmates. The Ombudsman noted that the conditions of detention had not improved in the two year period that had elapsed since May 2007. He noted that the situation was critical for both detainees and police officers, as it was also confirmed by a report of the Police Directorate of Imathia. The Ombudsman had already received complaints on the subject from the Thessaloniki Bar Association and the Greek League of Human Rights. At the same time, a group of detainees began a hunger strike. In conclusion, the Ombudsman asked the Ministry to take all necessary steps to tackle the issue in question.",

As the Court has already considered, such a place was not adequate for the needs of a prolonged imprisonment (see Dougoz v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a040907/98, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR 2001II, and Kaja v.\u00a0Greece, no. 32927/03, \u00a7 49-50, 27 July 2006). Moreover, the Court has already considered the conditions of detention at the Thessaloniki General Police Headquarters, where the applicant was detained, in previous cases, and a violation of Article 3 of the Convention was found (see Vafiadis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 24981/07, \u00a7\u00a7 30-39, 2 July 2009, and Shuvaev v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a08249/07, \u00a7\u00a7 28-41, 29 October 2009). In this respect, the Court observes that, even though the present case does not refer to the same period as the aforementioned cases, the Government do not dispute the applicant\u2019s allegations regarding the general conditions of detention, and they did not submit any evidence that the conditions had been substantially improved, especially with regard to the problem of overcrowding. Further, the problematic conditions about which the applicant complains are also confirmed by the report and the letter of the Greek Ombudsman (see paragraphs 19-22 above) and the findings of the CPT (see paragraph 23 above).",
