The case originated in four applications (nos. 7834/12, 43801/13, 19327/14 and 63535/16) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Croatian nationals, Mr Željko Lopac (“the first applicant”), Mr Zvonimir Poščić (“the second applicant”), Mr Irfan Zjakić (“the third applicant”) and Mr Goran Kamenjašević (“the fourth applicant”), on the dates listed in the Appendix to this judgment.
Each applicant was represented by a lawyer. The names of their representatives are listed in the Appendix.
The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The Government were given notification of the complaints concerning the right of property and the breach of the principle “no crime without law” on 26 April 2017 (applications no. 7834/12, 43801/13, and 63535/16) and 27 November 2017 (application no. 19327/14), and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants’ personal details are set out in the Appendix.
The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 8 May 2001 the Austrian authorities granted the first applicant permanent residence.
When entering Croatia every year from 1998 onwards the first applicant declared the temporary importation of a vessel in his ownership to the Croatian customs authorities with a view to being exempted from paying the relevant taxes. He did so also on 17 July 2004.
However, on 29 March 2005 the Customs Administration instituted administrative-offence proceedings (prekršajni postupak) against him for having imported a vessel into Croatia without paying the relevant taxes.
Concurrently, the Customs Administration instituted tax-related administrative proceedings and in a decision of 13 June 2005 ordered the first applicant to pay the import duties due on his vessel in the amount of 166,886.70 Croatian kunas (HRK) plus the statutory default interest. They found that the first applicant had not satisfied the conditions for exemption from payment of customs duties provided for in Article 5 of Annex C to the Convention on Temporary Admission (hereafter “the Istanbul Convention”).
On 7 November 2005 the Ministry of Finance, as the secondinstance administrative authority, dismissed an appeal by the first applicant and upheld the first-instance decision of 13 June 2005.
On 15 December 2006 the first applicant paid customs duties in the total amount of HRK 198,439.45. At the same time, he brought an action for judicial review, which the Administrative Court dismissed in a judgment of 31 July 2008. The Administrative Court upheld the administrative authorities’ decisions, finding that the first applicant’s registered domicile had been in Croatia, that he had been registered as a tax payer in Croatia, and that it was irrelevant that he had been granted the right to reside permanently in Austria.
Meanwhile, on 29 May 2007 the Customs Administration discontinued the aforementioned administrative-offence proceedings because they found that the first applicant had satisfied the conditions for exemption provided for in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.
On 25 October 2008 the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Administrative Court’s judgment of 31 July 2008, claiming that there had been a breach of his constitutional rights to equality before the law, appeal, judicial review, fair hearing and freedom of movement. He also relied on his Convention rights to a fair hearing and an effective remedy, and the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence. He complained, in particular, that the administrative authorities and the Administrative Court had wrongly interpreted the term “person resident” in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention by equating it with the term “domicile” as defined in domestic legislation.
By a decision of 6 July 2011 the Constitutional Court declared inadmissible a constitutional complaint lodged by the first applicant, finding that the case did not raise any constitutional issue. This decision was served on the first applicant’s representative on 18 July 2011.
On 4 April 1996 the second applicant was granted the right to reside permanently in the Czech Republic.
By a decision of 23 May 2006 the Customs Administration ordered the second applicant to pay the relevant taxes for having imported a vessel, in the amount of HRK 904,334.78 plus the statutory default interest. They found that he did not meet the conditions for exemption provided for in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.
On 18 October 2013 the Ministry of Finance, as the second-instance administrative authority, dismissed an appeal by the second applicant and upheld the first-instance decision.
In its judgment of 23 July 2015 the Administrative Court dismissed an action for judicial review lodged by the second applicant, finding that at the relevant time his registered domicile had been in Croatia and that as a Croatian citizen he had been obliged to pay import duties.
The second applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against the Administrative Court’s judgment of 9 September 2009 claiming, inter alia, that the administrative authorities had violated his constitutional rights to equality before the law, appeal, judicial review, a fair hearing, personal and family life, the right to leave Croatia, and the right of ownership, and breached the principle of nullum crimen sine lege. He also relied on his Convention right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.
By a decision of 21 November 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed on the merits a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant, finding, inter alia, that there had been no violation of his constitutional right of ownership. This decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 10 December 2012.
On 15 November 2006 the Czech authorities granted the third applicant a long-term residence permit valid until 15 November 2016.
On 15 September 2012 the Customs Administration instituted administrative-offence proceedings (prekršajni postupak) against the third applicant for having imported a car into Croatia without paying the relevant taxes.
On 19 November 2012 the Customs Administration found the third applicant guilty of having committed the relevant administrative offence and fined him HRK 3,000. The Customs Administration found that the third applicant’s registered domicile had been in Croatia at the time of the commission of the offence. Therefore, it was irrelevant that he had been granted long-term residence in the Czech Republic.
On 3 April 2013 the High Court for Administrative Offences dismissed an appeal lodged by the third applicant and upheld the firstinstance decision, endorsing the reasons given therein.
The third applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against the secondinstance decision, claiming that there had been a breach of his constitutional rights to a fair hearing, freedom of movement and freedom to choose residence. He also alleged that there had been a violation of his constitutional right guaranteeing that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty. In so doing, he explicitly relied on the relevant provision of the Croatian Constitution. He further claimed that the Customs Administration and the High Court for Administrative Offences had misinterpreted the text of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.
Concurrently, the Customs Administration instituted tax-related administrative proceedings and in a decision of 20 June 2013 ordered the third applicant to pay import duties in the amount of 79,871.84 Croatian kunas (HRK) plus the statutory default interest. On 13 August 2013 the Customs Administration had issued a decision impounding the third applicant’s car. It is not clear whether the third applicant appealed against those decisions.
By a decision of 24 October 2013 the Constitutional Court declared a constitutional complaint lodged by the third applicant inadmissible because the case did not raise any constitutional issue. This decision was served on the third applicant’s representative on 18 November 2013.
On 12 October 1992 the fourth applicant was granted the right to reside permanently in Germany.
During a roadside inspection carried out on 23 January 2012, Customs Administration officials found that the fourth applicant was driving his wife’s vehicle, which had German registration plates.
By a decision of 22 January 2013 the Customs Administration ordered the fourth applicant to pay import duties in the amount of HRK 402,412.05 plus the statutory default interest. They found that he did not meet the conditions for exemption provided for in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.
On 6 July 2006 the Ministry of Finance, as the second-instance administrative authority, dismissed an appeal by the fourth applicant and upheld the first-instance decision.
In its judgment of 23 July 2015 the Administrative Court upheld the administrative authorities’ decisions, finding that the fourth applicant’s registered domicile had been in Croatia and that it was irrelevant that he had been granted the right to reside permanently in Germany.
On 26 November 2015 the High Administrative Court dismissed an appeal by the fourth applicant and upheld the first-instance decision, endorsing the reasons given therein.
The fourth applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against the High Administrative Court’s judgment of 26 November 2015 claiming that the administrative and judicial authorities had wrongly interpreted Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention and thereby had violated his constitutional rights to judicial review and to a fair hearing.
By a decision of 13 April 2016 the Constitutional Court declared the fourth applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible because the case did not raise any constitutional issue. This decision was served on the fourth applicant’s representative on 27 April 2016.
Section 76 of the Administrative Disputes Act (Zakon o upravnim sporovima – Official Gazette nos. 20/10 with subsequent amendments) allows for the possibility of reopening proceedings on the basis of a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. The text of that provision is reproduced in the case of Guberina v. Croatia (no. 23682/13, § 28, 22 March 2016).
The remaining relevant international and domestic law and practice is summarised in the case of Žaja v. Croatia (no. 37462/09, §§ 26-27 and 2961, 4 October 2016).
