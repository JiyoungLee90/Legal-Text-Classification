In particular, there was no proof that he had ever applied to the first-instance court to obtain that certificate. In any event, the Government further argued, the applicant could have applied for the enforcement of the partial judgment ordering his reinstatement even without the certificate of finality. That was so for several reasons, all of which the applicant must have been aware of because he was represented by a qualified representative (an advocate). First, under the domestic law a judgment became final and enforceable when the statutory requirements were met, and not when the competent court so certified (see paragraph 32 above). Second, section 33(1) of the Enforcement Act (see paragraph 28 above) had not required that an application for enforcement be accompanied by a certificate of (finality and) enforceability if it was to be lodged with the same court which had adopted the judgment sought to be enforced. That had been precisely the situation in the applicant\u2019s case. Third, since in his reply to the defendant\u2019s appeal of 5 December 1996 (see paragraph 11 above) the applicant had argued that the appeal had been lodged out of time, he must have been aware that the partial judgment ordering his reinstatement had already become final when the statutory time-limit for that appeal expired (see paragraph 27 above). The Government therefore concluded that the applicant\u2019s loss of salary arrears was solely attributable to his own failure to institute enforcement proceedings in due time.",

That is so because from the Court\u2019s perspective the hierarchy between different organs of the State is not relevant while examining an application before it. Municipalities are public-law entities which exercise public authority and whose acts or failures to act, notwithstanding the extent of their autonomy vis\u00e0-vis the central organs, can engage the responsibility of the State under the Convention (see, for example, D\u00f6\u015femealt\u0131 Belediyesi v.

This case-law of the Court is in line with customary international law in this sphere reflected in the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. According to Article 4 of the Draft Articles the conduct of any State organ is considered an act of that State under international law whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State (see paragraph 37 above). The fact that the municipality was represented by the State Attorney\u2019s Office (see paragraph 9 above) further corroborates this principle in the present case.",

It also notes that the applicant had after the delivery of that judgment on a number of occasions requested the local authorities to reinstate him, which fact was acknowledged but considered irrelevant by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 10 and 21 above). It thus cannot be argued that the applicant gave up his claim to be reinstated or that the local authorities were unaware of the judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Lukavica, loc. cit.).",

Furthermore, the case-law of the domestic courts developed in the application of that provision, as well as the opinions of legal scholars, seem to suggest that the starting date of that time-limit was the date when an employee had learned (normally by being served with the second-instance judgment) of the fact that the judgment sought to be enforced had become final (see paragraphs 31-33 and 35 above). Since the domestic courts in the applicant\u2019s case in their judgments did not deal with the practical implications of the above-mentioned interval, it is difficult to discern whether they simply overlooked it or consciously regarded it as irrelevant.",

If national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (see Iatridis v.\u00a0Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection the Court notes that under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 26 above) an applicant may seek the reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention. Given the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint and the reason for which it has found a violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate way of repairing the consequences of that violation is to reopen the proceedings complained of (see Vrbica v. Croatia, no. 32540/05, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, 1 April 2010). As it follows that the domestic law allows such reparation to be made, the Court considers that there is no call to award the applicant any sum in respect of pecuniary damage.",
