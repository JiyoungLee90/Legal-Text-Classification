It noted that the offence of which he stood accused was punishable with a fine and confiscation, and said that his being charged was enough to consider that the charges were probably well-founded. There was also evidence that the bank accounts and properties belonged to him. It was necessary to freeze them to secure the satisfaction of a possible fine or confiscation. The court\u2019s asset-freezing order was issued on 1 December 2008.

His argument ran as follows: that provision prohibited the confiscation of funds needed by a convicted person and his or her family for living expenses for one year. It was, then, impermissible to freeze such funds to ensure their confiscation. Yet, the Haskovo Regional Court had not checked what sum would be needed by him and his family to live for one year with a view to excluding it from the scope of the freezing order. That was especially problematic in the light of his son\u2019s medical conditions (see paragraph 7 above), which generated medical expenses on top of the family\u2019s ordinary living expenses.",

This meant that, if the BGN\u00a02,000 awarded in the previous proceedings were to be deducted, she was entitled to BGN 3,000. The claim was, however, time-barred. The court analysed in detail the applicable statutory provisions and case-law, and held that the applicable five-year limitation period had started to run when the Haskovo Regional Court had decided to issue the freezing order \u2013 28\u00a0November 2008 \u2013 and had thus expired on 28 November 2013.

He did, however, concomitantly seek to have it lifted (see paragraphs 18-20 above). Contrary to what the Government suggested, without however citing any domestic case-law in support of their assertion, it does not appear that there was at that point a material difference between those two procedures, as they were applied in practice by the national courts. So far as relevant for the complaint at hand, the request to have the order lifted could, just like the appeal against it, be made immediately. Moreover, the reasons for which the Haskovo Regional Court and the Plovdiv Court of Appeal rejected the request show that, rather than citing any limitations on the kind of circumstances that they could take into account when dealing with it, those courts concerned themselves with the same questions as the judge who had decided to issue the order: (a) whether the charges against the first applicant justified, in view of the possible confiscation and fine to which they could lead, the blocking of his assets pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him, and (b) whether the assets belonged to him (see paragraphs 17, 24 and 26 above). If anything, the proceedings pursuant to the request to have the order lifted entailed a broader assessment, as the Haskovo Regional Court also considered, albeit briefly, whether any fresh developments had obviated the need to keep the order in force. If an applicant has pursued one apparently effective remedy, he is not required to have used another one directed to essentially the same end and not presenting a better prospect of success (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 1999-II; and, specifically in relation to the domain at hand, Borzhonov v.

Although his appeal against the dismissal of his request did not in terms reiterate those points, it did refer to the arguments in the initial request. As evident from the brief reference, in its reasons, to the medical condition of the first applicant\u2019s son, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal had regard to those arguments (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).

That had happened in response to the first applicant\u2019s second request to have the freezing order lifted by a court \u2013 the first time he had tried to do so since early 2009 \u2013 which he made at some point in mid-2013 (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). It cannot be said with full certainty that, if made earlier, such a request would have been likely to succeed. It is nevertheless striking that the Haskovo Regional Court allowed it purely on the basis of arguments relating to the proportionality of maintaining the freezing order (see paragraph 31 above). It is hard to fathom to what extent that court\u2019s position was influenced by the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s 2012 interpretative decision \u2013 which had broadly highlighted the need for a proportionality assessment in relation to the freezing of assets in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 50 above) \u2013, by the manner in which the criminal proceedings against the first applicant had unfolded up to that point (see paragraphs 9-14 above), or by fresh arguments about the difficulties that he faced as a result of the restriction (see paragraph 30 above). However, it cannot simply be presumed that an earlier request to the competent courts to lift the freezing order would have been treated differently. By not making one until mid-2013, the first applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies with respect to the continued freezing of his assets.",

It had not lasted an inordinate amount of time, in particular in view of the complexity of the criminal case against the first applicant. It had also been attended by proper safeguards, such as an appeal against the freezing order and a possibility to seek to have it lifted. Both of those procedures offered the full plethora of safeguards under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, including the possibility for a hearing on appeal. Also, they often entailed, even before the 2012 interpretative decision, an examination of whether the measure was necessary, including whether there existed a reasonable suspicion against the person concerned and whether the assets sought to be frozen exceeded the potential penalty. The first applicant had failed to use those remedies properly before mid-2013. When he had done so, the courts had in large part allowed his request, precisely on the basis of arguments concerning the proportionality of the measure, even though the need to have his assets frozen had not truly vanished until it had become clear that the prosecution would not appeal against the March 2016 judgment of the Haskovo Regional Court. The measure, though preventing the first applicant from drawing on the money in his bank accounts, had not fully prevented him from using his immovable properties \u2013 for instance letting them out. Lastly, it could not be overlooked that his wife\u2019s assets had been unfrozen as early as July 2009, enabling the family to use them to meet its living expenses.",

Moreover, when deciding to issue the freezing order the Haskovo Regional Court had not checked the reasonableness of the suspicion against the first applicant, but had simply considered whether charges had been brought against him. The available safeguards had also been insufficient. Appeals against freezing orders and requests to have them lifted were examined solely on the papers. Until the 2012 interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation, when dealing with such cases the courts had not been required to check the existence of a reasonable suspicion, and had confined their review to formal criteria. Nor was there any cap on the duration of the measure during the judicial phase of the proceedings. In 2009 the competent courts had disregarded the arguments concerning the disability of the applicants\u2019 son, which should have instead been seen as compelling, and the necessity of leaving the first applicant enough unencumbered funds to meet his family\u2019s living expenses. The courts had only assessed the proportionality of the measure in the light of those factors and the length of the criminal proceedings in late 2013 and early 2014.",

It is also true that, as remarked by the Supreme Court of Cassation in its ensuing interpretative decision, in the context of the legislative scheme at hand this was a key safeguard against an unjustified interference with possessions (see paragraph 50 above).

When first seeking to have the freezing order lifted, the first applicant pointed out that he needed unencumbered access to at least some funds on which to draw to meet the medical expenses of his disabled son (see paragraph 22 above). Neither the first-instance court nor the court of appeal dealing with his request engaged with that argument, which potentially had a crucial impact on the proportionality of freezing the entirety of the first applicant\u2019s assets. Although the argument was not very specific \u2013 the first applicant did not tell the courts how much money he needed for those expenses, or provide any evidence or details in support of his assertion that he had no other sources of income \u2013, the fact remains that it had been expressly raised and that it was of considerable importance. It is also true that the first applicant did not repeat the argument in terms on appeal. But in his appeal he said that he fully maintained his original arguments (see paragraph 25 above). The Plovdiv Court of Appeal\u2019s brief statement that the argument was irrelevant (see paragraph 26 in fine above) is unsurprising in view of the absence of any statutory provisions covering such situations (see paragraph 46 above). This absence is all the more striking when juxtaposed with the express provisions in the Criminal Code which shield the funds needed by a convicted person and his or her family for living expenses for one year from confiscation or the enforcement of a fine (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above). This is hard to reconcile with the need to afford those affected by such freezing measures procedures that make it possible to strike a fair balance between their rights and the public interest (see paragraph 96 above, and, mutatis mutandis, Paulet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68). Indeed, when recently legislating in a closely related domain, the Bulgarian legislature recognised the need to have regard to such matters: a 2005 statute providing for the forfeiture of proceeds of crime by way of proceedings before the civil courts expressly envisaged a possibility to permit payments out of assets frozen with a view to their forfeiture if this was necessary for medical treatment or other humanitarian needs (see Nedyalkov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

The total sum of money in the frozen bank accounts at the time of the freezing order (see paragraph 17 in fine above) was not negligible, and the applicants have not presented any evidence about the specific amount of money that they needed to take care of their disabled son. But this cannot, in itself, affect the above analysis, since it was the domestic courts\u2019 duty to satisfy themselves that the freezing of the first applicant\u2019s assets would not cause him more damage than that which inevitably flows from such measures. The Court has had occasion to say that although any seizure entails damage, the actual damage sustained by those affected by it should not be more extensive than that which is inevitable, if it is to be compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Borzhonov, \u00a7 61; D\u017eini\u0107, \u00a7 68 in fine; and Piras, \u00a7 55 in fine, all cited above).",
