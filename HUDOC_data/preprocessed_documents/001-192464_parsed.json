As regards proper separation between the sanitary facilities and the cell and alleged lack of ventilation, the court found no violation. As for the fire, the court held that the applicant had been hospitalised between\u00a07 and 18\u00a0January 2012 for irritation of the respiratory system due to acute poisoning caused by smoke inhalation. The applicant had been referred to a psychiatrist later and had received medication. The court further held that the prison authorities had merely provided a general description of the actions of the relevant representatives of the prison during the fire and had not provided any information about the specific actions they had taken in order to immediately remove the applicant from his cell or about the first aid he had received. Although the authorities had stated that the inmates had been instructed how to act in case of fire, the applicant had indicated that he had received no such instructions. The authorities had not indicated within what period of time the applicant had received medical help and what that help had entailed. The applicant had stated that he had spent approximately ninety minutes in a cell full of smoke. The court held that the fact that the applicant had been taken to hospital in a coma had proven that the authorities had failed to evacuate him on time. The applicant had had bronchial asthma but the authorities had failed to provide evidence that his condition had been taken into account during the fire. The applicant\u2019s liberty had been restricted because of his status, and the responsibility for his health had fallen on Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison. However, it had not been proved that the officers had acted in a manner prescribed by the law in order to avoid negative consequences to the applicant\u2019s health. As a result, the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court awarded the applicant 10,000\u00a0Lithuanian litai (LTL\u00a0\u2013\u00a0approximately 2,896 euros (EUR)) in compensation in total: LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 579) for the conditions of detention and LTL\u00a08,000 (approximately EUR 2,317) for the consequences suffered because of the fire.",

The court further held that the prison staff had been active in their response and thus no unlawful actions by the authorities had taken place.

He remained in the hospital for several days. In that connection, the Court notes that it only took seven minutes after the telephone call for the fire brigade to arrive at the prison; the first ambulance also arrived without undue delay. In that connection, the Court notes that, although Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison is in the city centre, it being the rush hour at the time of the fire, it might have made it difficult for the ambulances and fire brigades to reach. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant\u2019s condition was taken into account by the prison authorities and the medical staff and that he was transferred to the hospital without undue delay.",

The applicant, who was granted victim status (see paragraph 10 above), thus could not appeal against the decision to suspend the pre-trial investigation. The Court reiterates that it is not its role to speculate as to whether the outcome of the proceedings would have been different if the applicant had been informed about the suspension of the pretrial investigation. Nevertheless, the fire had had an impact on the applicant\u2019s life and health, and in these circumstances the deprivation of the possibility to appeal had been of certain importance.",

Italy (no. 1) ([GC], no. 36813/97, ECHR 2006V). In that connection, the Court notes that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not, in principle, sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for the breach of the Convention. One of the characteristics of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status relates to the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. The Court indicates that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0180 and\u00a0202).",

However, the Court considers that even though the applicant was awarded EUR\u00a0579 for the time spent in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison, this amount, whilst apparently consistent with Lithuanian case-law at that time, is significantly lower than the amounts the Court awards in similar cases (see Mironovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a099 and 156). The Court thus considers that the applicant retains his victim status under Article 34 of the Convention and dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection of loss of victim status.",

The Court finds that this is the relevant period to consider because although he had spent time also in other facilities, the applicant had less than 3 sq. m of personal space at his disposal for the majority of this period, and this created a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 13637). As for the days he had between 3 and 4 sq. m at his disposal, which, according to the information at the Court\u2019s disposal, amounted to twentyfive and a half days and in respect of which no strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention arises, the Court must have regard to other relevant factors (ibid., \u00a7 139).
