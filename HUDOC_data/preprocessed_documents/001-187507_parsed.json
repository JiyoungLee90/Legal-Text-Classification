The CSM noted that in disciplinary case no. 333/10 the applicant had knowingly agreed to use testimony containing false statements concerning the acts of which she had been accused. It observed that those acts had been established on the basis of calls made by the applicant on her mobile phone, the records of which had been obtained with her consent at the request of the judicial investigator F.M.J. In view of the scope of the duty of honesty, which it considered to be a personal duty, the CSM found that the applicant had been the perpetrator of the acts in question, rather than the co-perpetrator as indicated in the judicial investigator\u2019s final report, and imposed a disciplinary penalty of 100 days\u2019 suspension from duty. Noting that the indictment had conformed to the requirements of section 117(1) of the Act, it dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that it was null and void. The CSM also held that the applicant\u2019s defence rights had not been infringed given that, after examining the evidence, the judicial investigator had set out in his final report the facts he considered established and their legal classification, and had proposed a specific penalty under section 122 of the Act.",

Regarding the existence of a \u201cright\u201d, it observed that the proceedings in question had been decisive for the applicant\u2019s rights in so far as they could have led to the setting-aside of the disciplinary sanctions imposed by the CSM if the domestic courts had allowed her appeals. As to the \u201ccivil\u201d nature of such a right, the Chamber found that the first condition of the test established in the judgment in Vilho\u00a0Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 62, ECHR\u00a02007-II) had not been met, as domestic law \u2013 in the form of section\u00a0168 of the Act (see paragraph\u00a071 above) \u2013 made provision for persons with an interest in bringing proceedings to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court challenging the lawfulness of a decision by the CSM to impose a disciplinary penalty on a judge. The applicant had in fact made use of that option. Accordingly, the Chamber held that Article 6 was applicable under its civil head. In view of that finding, the Chamber did not consider it necessary to ascertain whether that provision was applicable in the present case under its criminal head, and decided not to examine the complaints submitted in that regard.",

In the instant case the Supreme Court had confined itself to conducting a review of lawfulness with regard to the establishment of the facts and had thus not properly addressed important arguments advanced by the applicant concerning questions of fact that were crucial to the disciplinary proceedings against her.",

The Court\u2019s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d, to be considered in determining whether or not there was a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d (see Engel and\u00a0Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 22). The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, among other authorities, Jussila v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 30-31, ECHR 2006-XIV, and Ezeh and\u00a0Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 2003-X). The fact that an offence is not punishable by imprisonment is not by itself decisive for the purposes of the applicability of the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention since, as the Court has stressed on numerous occasions, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake cannot deprive an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Nicoleta Gheorghe v. Romania, no. 23470/05, \u00a7 26, 3 April 2012).",

It will start by considering the complaint alleging that the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court lacked independence and impartiality (see point 3 below).",

However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 119). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III).",

These problems related firstly to structural shortcomings in the procedure before the HCJ, notably the inclusion of the Minister of Justice and of the Prosecutor General as ex officio members of that body and the fact that the great majority of its non-judicial members were appointed directly by the executive and legislative authorities. Secondly, the Court took into account the appearance of bias on the part of some members of the HCJ who had determined the applicant\u2019s case. It observed that the members of the Ukrainian HCJ who had carried out the preliminary inquiries in the applicant\u2019s case and submitted requests for his dismissal had subsequently taken part in the decisions to remove him from office. Moreover, one of them had been appointed President of the HCJ and had presided over the hearing of the applicant\u2019s case. The Court therefore found that the proceedings before the HCJ had been incompatible with the principles of independence and impartiality set forth in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117). The subsequent determination of the applicant\u2019s case by Parliament, the legislative body, had not remedied the structural defects of a lack of \u201cindependence and impartiality\u201d but rather had served to contribute to the politicisation of the procedure and to aggravate the inconsistency of the procedure with the principle of the separation of powers (ibid., \u00a7 118). In those circumstances, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, it was extremely important for the Ukrainian Higher Administrative Court to afford the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention in order to be able to remedy any lack of independence and impartiality.",

The Court also notes the absence of any specific evidence of a lack of impartiality, such as, for instance, the existence of pending disciplinary proceedings against one of the members of the benches that examined the applicant\u2019s appeals. In more general terms the Court considers it normal that judges, in the performance of their judicial duties and in various contexts, should have to examine a variety of cases in the knowledge that they may themselves, at some point in their careers, be in a similar position to one of the parties, including the defendant. However, a purely abstract risk of this kind cannot be regarded as apt to cast doubt on the impartiality of a judge in the absence of specific circumstances pertaining to his or her individual situation. Even in the context of disciplinary cases a theoretical risk of this nature, consisting in the fact that judges hearing cases are themselves still subject to a set of disciplinary rules, is not in itself a sufficient basis for finding a breach of the requirements of impartiality.",

It is beyond doubt that, in order to address that issue, the CSM had to exercise its discretionary powers. That authority has specific responsibility under the Constitution (see paragraph 70 above) for the autonomous management of the judiciary, and in particular for disciplinary matters concerning judges, with the wider aim of guaranteeing the independence of the justice system (see, mutatis mutandis, TsanovaGecheva, cited above, \u00a7 100, regarding the power of the Bulgarian Supreme Judicial Council to appoint the President of a court). The Court therefore recognises the particular importance of the CSM\u2019s responsibilities under the Constitution in a key area from the perspective of the rule of law and the separation of powers. As a body specifically set up to interpret and apply the rules governing the disciplinary conduct of judges, the CSM has the task of contributing to the smooth operation of the justice system. However, in the instant case, the assessment of the facts and the review of the disciplinary sanctions imposed did not require specialised knowledge or specific professional experience, but could have come within the jurisdiction of any court. This was not a classic exercise of administrative discretion in a specialised area of law (see, conversely, Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, \u00a7 161).",

It considers, firstly, that the review of a decision imposing a disciplinary penalty differs from that of an administrative decision that does not entail such a punitive element. Secondly, it notes that the disciplinary proceedings in question concerned a judge. In that connection the Court stresses that, even if they do not come within the scope of Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head, disciplinary penalties may nevertheless entail serious consequences for the lives and careers of judges. The accusations against the applicant were liable to result in her removal from office or suspension from duty, that is to say, in very serious penalties which carried a significant degree of stigma (see, mutatis mutandis, Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10 and 4\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a0122, 4 March 2014). In accordance with the general principles set forth above and taking into account the policy objectives pursued by the legislation in this sphere (see paragraph 180 above), the Court considers that the judicial review carried out must be appropriate to the subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, in the instant case, to the disciplinary nature of the administrative decisions in question. This consideration applies with even greater force to disciplinary proceedings against judges, who must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties. When a member State initiates such disciplinary proceedings, public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary is at stake; in a democratic State, this confidence guarantees the very existence of the rule of law. Furthermore, the Court has stressed the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 313; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no.\u00a029492/05, \u00a7\u00a086, 26 February 2009; and Stafford, \u00a7 78; Kleyn, \u00a7 193; and Baka, \u00a7\u00a0165, all cited above).",

As to the procedural safeguards applied by that body, the Court is prepared to accept that, as the Government argued, the proceedings conducted in the present case afforded the applicant the opportunity to mount a defence. The applicant was notified of the indictment drawn up by the judicial investigator (see paragraphs 16, 19, 37 and 52 above) and filed defence pleadings (see paragraphs 17, 21, 37 and 53 above). She was also able to consult the final report and had a period of time in which to submit possible observations, although these were examined by the same judicial investigator (see paragraphs 17, 39 and 57 above).",

Firstly, as the Government acknowledged, the CSM is not authorised by law to hold public hearings, and, secondly, in the third set of proceedings it refused the applicant\u2019s request for such a hearing on the grounds, inter alia, that there was no legal basis for the case to be heard in public before the CSM sitting in plenary (see paragraph 56 above). Furthermore, the applicant did not have an opportunity to make oral representations, either on the factual issues and the penalties or on the various legal issues. Likewise, the plenary formation of the CSM did not hear any evidence from witnesses, although it was not only the applicant\u2019s credibility that was at stake but also that of crucial witnesses, in particular the judicial inspector H.G. and the judicial investigator F.M.J. In these circumstances the Court considers that the CSM did not exercise its discretionary powers on an adequate factual basis.",

As a result, point 5 of the operative part of the judgment was formulated in a manner that does not distinguish between those two aspects but refers more generally to \u201cshortcomings in the conduct of the proceedings against the applicant\u201d. In our opinion, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 only on account of the applicant\u2019s complaint under application no. 74041/13 regarding the lack of an oral hearing in the third set of disciplinary proceedings against her. Thus, while we agree that there was a shortcoming in the conduct of those proceedings, we reach this conclusion on that narrower ground. The combined approach, and the broader finding of a violation adopted in the present judgment, are in our view not well-founded and the reasoning on which that position is based is particularly problematic, for the reasons discussed below. Therefore, although the vote on the outcome in point 5 of the operative provisions has technically been unanimous, we do not share the reasoning leading up to that conclusion.

This is part of well-established case-law. What is required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is access to a court with \u201cfull jurisdiction\u201d. Both the Commission and the Court have acknowledged in their case-law that the requirement that a court or tribunal should have \u201cfull jurisdiction\u201d will be satisfied where it is found that the judicial body in question has exercised \u201csufficient jurisdiction\u201d or provided \u201csufficient review\u201d in the proceedings before it (see Sigma Radio Television Ltd v. Cyprus, nos. 32181/04 and 35122/05, \u00a7 152, 21\u00a0July 2011, and the case-law cited therein). Thus, the requirement of full jurisdiction has been given an autonomous definition in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention, one that does not necessarily depend on the legal characterisation in domestic law. As the well-established case-law shows, this notion requires the exercise of \u201csufficient jurisdiction\u201d, or \u201csufficient review\u201d. While this approach is reiterated in the present judgment as a general principle (see paragraph 177 of the judgment), it is not, in our view, taken seriously enough in its application to the present case (see below).",

In this domain, too, the Court has held that the access to court enshrined in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 requires that the court must have \u201cfull jurisdiction\u201d, within the abovementioned autonomous meaning, to deal with the appeal. Thus, although the sufficiency of judicial review does depend on the subjectmatter of the case (see Tsanova-Gecheva v.

Under the first scenario, what the party contesting the administrative decision must achieve, in order to be successful with the appeal, is to argue before the court, and to persuade the latter, that the facts as established by the administrative authority did not constitute a sufficiently solid basis for the legal consequences which the decision entails, or that the facts were established in a manner not affording the necessary procedural safeguards. Where the appeal succeeds, the court must then annul the impugned decision. Depending on the circumstances, the court may remit the case for fresh examination by the administrative authority or, if the correct factual basis has already become sufficiently clear, possibly issue a new decision on the merits.

Even in situations where Article 6 was applicable under its criminal head, the Court has considered the judicial review sufficient although the competent court did not conduct a fresh examination of the evidence or make its own assessment of that evidence (see, for instance, A.

A particular variant of that type of situation can be seen in Tsfayo v. the United Kingdom (no. 60860/00, \u00a7\u00a047, 14\u00a0November 2006), where the Court was faced with a case in which the decision under judicial review had been taken by an organ that was not only lacking in independence from the executive but was directly connected to one of the parties to the dispute. Under those special circumstances, the Court considered that the independence of judgment in relation to the finding of primary fact could be infected in a manner which could not be adequately scrutinised or rectified by judicial review. As the competent court lacked jurisdiction to rehear the evidence and, therefore, a crucial question of fact had not been re-examined by it, the Court found a violation of Article 6 as the central issue had not been determined by a tribunal that was independent from the parties. In other words, that case concerned a particular kind of situation where there was a combination of deficiencies in the form of a lack of independence from one of the parties at first instance, allied to a failure to re-examine and determine a decisive factual issue on appeal.",

Firstly, it is true that the judicial review of an administrative decision imposing a disciplinary penalty may often raise issues different from those involved in the review of administrative decisions which do not entail a specific punitive element. Nevertheless, the Court has not previously considered that the access to court enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that appeals against administrative decisions imposing a disciplinary penalty or another kind of administrative sanction should be subject to procedural rules that are separate from the paradigm of judicial review described above. On the contrary, the Court has not, even in the context of proceedings concerning administrative sanctions falling under the criminal limb, been inclined to abandon the approach whereby the necessary access to a court with \u201cfull\u201d jurisdiction is sufficient, entailing judicial review but not necessarily a reexamination of the case, especially on the facts and the evidence relied on by the administrative authority.",

                        "content": "19.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, as regards the subject-matter of the decision appealed against, it can be noted that the Court, when assessing the sufficiency of judicial review, has taken into account to what extent it concerned a specialised issue requiring professional knowledge or experience and to what extent it involved the exercise of administrative discretion (see, for instance, Fazia Ali, cited above, \u00a7 84). The underlying consideration here is that where an administrative decision is based on the application of specialised expertise or the exercise of discretionary powers incumbent on the administration, the judicial review should not result in such characteristics of administrative decision-making being \u201coverridden\u201d by the courts. In the present context, similar considerations should be borne in mind. While it is true that the impugned disciplinary proceedings did not concern issues of a highly technical nature or otherwise requiring a particular kind of special expertise, the point to be taken into account in the present case relates to the special function and constitutional position of the CSM. The latter is the authority entrusted under the Portuguese Constitution (see paragraph 70 of the present judgment) with specific responsibility for the autonomous management of the judiciary, and in particular for disciplinary matters concerning judges, with the wider aim of guaranteeing the independence of the justice system. The Court should therefore recognise the particular importance of the CSM\u2019s responsibilities under the Constitution in a key area from the perspective of the rule of law and the separation of powers. As a body specifically mandated to interpret and apply the rules governing the disciplinary conduct of judges, the CSM has the task of ensuring the proper operation of the justice system. In this context, just as the courts exercising judicial review should not take over the functions of the administrative authority whose decisions they examine, the judicial review performed by the Supreme Court when it comes to disciplinary proceedings within the competence of the CSM should likewise not result in the disciplinary function of the latter being taken over by the Supreme Court.",

Given its function of verification rather than re-examination, a court of judicial review typically enjoys a degree of discretion as to the extent to which, in the light of the submissions made by the parties, it needs to order particular investigative steps to clarify whether the facts have been established in an adequate manner. Thus, the court is not required to order such steps simply because certain facts have been contested by a party on appeal. In its case-law under Article 6, the Court has held that the requirement of a fair trial does not \u2013 even in the context of criminal proceedings before a trial court \u2013 impose on the competent court an obligation to order an investigative measure merely because a party has requested it. Thus, it is for the court to consider and to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to accept evidence for examination (see Poletan and\u00a0Azirovik v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 26711/07 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7 95, 12 May 2016, with further references).

It is against this historical background that the Judicial Division\u2019s powers of review over the CSM\u2019s decisions must be assessed. Both the law in books and the law in action show that the body empowered to review decisions of the CSM has traditionally had very limited powers when it comes to reviewing and establishing the \u201ckey facts\u201d and collecting and reassessing the evidence. In paragraphs\u00a0203 and 214 of the judgment, the Grand Chamber specifically upheld the Chamber judgment with regard to the \u201cdecisive\u201d nature of the facts disputed by the applicant and the lack of proper judicial review of the CSM\u2019s decision on these facts.

Two main issues were discussed in the case at hand. First, the majority of the members of the CSM are not judges elected by their fellow judges. For example, out of the fifteen members who ruled in the applicant\u2019s case on 10\u00a0January 2012, only six were judges (see paragraph 26 of the judgment). In the other two sets of proceedings, a slight majority of the CSM\u2019s members were judges, because some of the non-judicial members happened to be absent. Indeed, there is no guarantee that a majority of the CSM\u2019s members will even have legal training, since there is no legal requirement in this regard for the non-judicial members of the CSM. Prior to the CSM\u2019s deliberations there is no way of knowing who is going to participate in those deliberations. The indicted judge cannot find out who is going to be a member of the formation voting on his or her case. To aggravate things, it is not ruled out that a non-judicial member of the CSM may be the rapporteur in a disciplinary case, which raises the possibility of a person without any legal background performing that function.",

This nominalist interpretation of the Convention is even less convincing when it accepts that the criminal limb of Article 6 is applicable in certain cases involving heavy financial penalties for disciplinary offences.
