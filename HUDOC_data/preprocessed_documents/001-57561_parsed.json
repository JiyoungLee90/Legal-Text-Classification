In addition, and even according to Italian law (Article 120 of the Royal Decree of 18 December 1941, see paragraph 13 above), there should not have been so long an interval between the adoption of the Venice Court of Appeal\u2019s and the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgments and their deposit in the court registry (8 October - 12 December 1974 and 19 October 1976 - 5 February 1977, respectively).
