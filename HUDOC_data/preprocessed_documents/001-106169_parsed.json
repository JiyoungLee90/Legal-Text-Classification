According to the Government, this period was covered by a judicial order of 4 May 2001 (a copy of which has not been provided), in which the presiding judge found no reasons for the applicant\u2019s release and changing the custodial preventive measure imposed on him. According to the applicant, this period was not covered by any decision.

In the light of this case-law, even assuming that the applicant\u2019s detention was, as required by the applicable domestic law, extended on 4 May 2001 as suggested by the Government, the Court considers that this decision was not lawful for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Convention.",

Moreover, regard being had to the applicant\u2019s educational and professional background as a lawyer and a police officer, his participation in the questioning on 1 July 1999 was rather well-informed and deliberate.",

In a number of its judgments the Court, being mindful of the vulnerable position of a suspect vis-\u00e0-vis the investigative authorities, has emphasised the paramount importance of access to a lawyer before the first questioning as a means to counter the power imbalance between the parties (see, among other authorities, Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 50-55 and 58, 27\u00a0November 2008 and Leonid Lazarenko v. Ukraine, no. 22313/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04852, 28 October 2010). It has noted, in particular, that the rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 55). Likewise, the very fact of restricting access of a detained suspect to a lawyer may prejudice the rights of the defence even where no incriminating statements were obtained as a result (see e.g. Dayanan v. Turkey, no. 7377/03, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, 13 October 2009). On the other hand, neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial, as long as a waiver of the right is given in an unequivocal manner and was attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

In examining to what extent the authorities\u2019 reliance on this waiver for proceeding with the applicant\u2019s questioning was compatible with the Convention, the Court must analyse whether it constituted an act of the applicant\u2019s free will and informed procedural choice.",

While this fact may not mean that he was not vulnerable or in need of an advocate\u2019s support in his procedural capacity as a suspect, the level of the applicant\u2019s expertise cannot be discounted in assessing whether his consent to participate in the particular questioning was well-informed. Further, the applicant\u2019s testimony given on 1 July 1999 was not only free from self-incriminating statements, but also fully endorsed by him two days after the questioning in issue, when he obtained access to the lawyer he initially intended to hire (see paragraph 11 above). It can therefore neither be concluded that the applicant was coerced to give any statement in defiance of his will, nor that his initial statements were detrimental to the advocate\u2019s further defence strategy.",

However, it is notable that the applicant in the present case did not expound in any detail on the nature of his sufferings in connection with his questioning on 1 July 1999. Moreover, the applicant does not appear to have ever raised the matter during his trial and, while complaining in his cassation appeal in general terms that his right to defence had been breached, he made no express mention of the above questioning. Instead, he alleged, in particular, that the trial court had refused to admit certain (unspecified) individuals as his defenders and that charges against him had been amended during trial. In the absence of any plea concerning non-exhaustion on the Government\u2019s part, the Court will normally assume that the applicant duly exhausted the available domestic remedies (see Dobrev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 55389/00, \u00a7\u00a7 112-114, 10 August 2006). However, absent the applicant\u2019s investment in soliciting the domestic authorities\u2019 reaction to the fact of his questioning without a lawyer and his failure to provide more detailed submissions to the Court concerning the reasons why he offered himself for such a questioning, in context of the present case the Court is unable to draw an inference that the applicant was pressured in this respect.",
