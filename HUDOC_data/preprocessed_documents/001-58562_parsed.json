I think that the application by analogy of the test in the \u00d6ZDEP case to the present one is not correct. In that case, the legal person was a political party (which, by its nature, is a looser organisation) and the protected right in question was the freedom of association of the members of that party who established and organised it. Here the situation is different: the company is an independent living organism, protected as such by the legal order of the State concerned, and whose rights also receive autonomous protection under the European Convention on Human Rights. It should not be forgotten that Article 34 of that Convention specifically refers to the right of non-governmental organisations to claim to be the victims of violations of the Convention and to seek protection, with all the legal consequences implicit in such a right, including the awarding of just satisfaction. Although I accept that a number of provisions of the Convention may be inapplicable to companies or other juristic persons (for example, Articles 2 and 3), the great majority of them apply directly to such persons as autonomous legal entities deserving the protection of the Convention. I do not see why, in matters of compensation, the Court should be obliged to deviate, even partly, from such an approach and why it should be prevented from accepting, without any reservation, implied or otherwise, that a company may suffer non-pecuniary damage, not because of the anxiety or uncertainty felt by its human components, but because, as a legal person, in the society in which it operates, it has attributes, such as its own reputation, that may be impaired by acts or omissions of the State.",
