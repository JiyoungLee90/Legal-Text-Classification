Italy (no. 1) ([GC], no. 36813/97, ECHR 2006V). In that connection, the Court notes that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not, in principle, sufficient to deprive him or her of his or her status as a \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for the breach of the Convention. One of the characteristics of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status relates to the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. The Court indicates that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0180 and 202).",

However, the Court considers that even though the applicant was awarded EUR\u00a01,200 for the time spent in \u0160iauliai Remand Prison, this amount, whilst apparently consistent with Lithuanian case-law at that time, is significantly lower than the amounts that the Court awards in similar cases (see Mironovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99 and\u00a0156).

It firstly notes that the domestic courts established that the temperature in one of the cells was lower than the standard and that the toilets and the cells had not been properly separated, which was contrary to both domestic hygiene norms and the standards of the CPT (see paragraph 12 above). The Court further observes that the CPT, in its reports concerning Lithuania, repeatedly stated that the vast majority of remand prisoners in \u0160iauliai Remand Prison were locked up in their cells for twenty-three hours per day, the only regular daily out-of-cell activity being one hour of outdoor exercise (see Mironovas and Others, cited above, \u00a7 149). In such circumstances, the Court finds those facts sufficient to create a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 in relation to the period of 283 days when it can be assumed that the applicant did not have enough personal space at his disposal. The Court is unable to find that the lack of personal space was compensated for by appropriate material conditions of detention, sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities. It follows that the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention in \u0160iauliai Remand Prison subjected him to hardship going beyond the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and thus amounted to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Court has information concerning his conditions of detention only as far as 418.5 days (between 13 March 2013 and 5 May 2014) are concerned. During that period, there was one evening when he did not have enough personal space at his disposal. The Court considers it as a short, occasional and minor reduction in his required personal space. Moreover, for 316.5 out of those 418.5 days the applicant was alone in his cells (see paragraph 9 above). For 102 days, the applicant had between 3 and 4 square metres of personal space at his disposal. It cannot be said that the dimensions of his cells were so small as to restrict the applicant\u2019s freedom of movement below the threshold tolerated by Article 3. However, even in cases where a prison cell \u2013 measuring in range of 3 to 4 square metres of personal space per inmate \u2013 is at issue the space factor remains a weighty factor in the Court\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of the conditions of detention. In such instances a violation of Article 3 will be found if the space factor is coupled with other aspects of inappropriate physical conditions of detention related to, in particular, access to outdoor exercise, natural light or air, availability of ventilation, adequacy of room temperature, the possibility of using the toilet in private, and compliance with basic sanitary and hygienic requirements (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0139). In cases where a detainee disposed of more than 4 square metres of personal space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prison and where therefore no issue with regard to the questions of personal space arises, other aspects of physical conditions of detention remain relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of adequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention under Article 3 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 140).",

Bulgaria, nos.\u00a036925/10 and 5 others, \u00a7 241, 27 January 2015; Shkarupa v.

In the present case, the height of the partitions installed to separate the lavatory from the living area in cells where the applicant was kept, was not able to ensure his privacy when he had to use the toilet. The Court notes that in the absence of any information provided by the Government, even though explicitly requested by the Court, about the partition between the sanitary facilities and the cell in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison concerning the applicant, it will take into account the schemes the applicant has provided together with the courts\u2019 decisions (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 13 above). For several months of his detention, the applicant could be seen by his cellmates, and possibly by guards, while carrying out such intimate procedures. Even during the time he spent alone in the cells, he could be possibly seen by guards, as the lavatories had no doors and, as it appears, they had not been separated from the entrance by any partition.",

During that period, the applicant had not addressed the prison administration with a request for a long-term visit. The Government noted that the exercise of a person\u2019s right to a long-term visit depended on his or her will. In the absence of such will, the prison administration could not be obliged to organise a long-term visit.",

Lithuania (no. 42615/06, 9 July 2013) and the provisions of the Convention before the domestic courts, because by the time his administrative case had been examined in the domestic courts, the judgment in Varnas v. Lithuania had already become final. The Government also argued that the domestic courts had established an effective domestic compensatory remedy: the Supreme Administrative Court had taken account of the difference in treatment between remand detainees and convicted people as regards long-term visits, had found violations and had awarded compensation (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). However, the applicant had failed to use that remedy.",

According to the Court\u2019s established case-law, the concept of \u201cvictim\u201d must be interpreted autonomously and irrespective of domestic concepts such as those concerning an interest or capacity to act (see Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2004-III, and \u010ciapas v.\u00a0Lithuania (dec.), no.\u00a062564/13, \u00a7 27, 4 July 2017). The word \u201cvictim\u201d, in the context of Article 34 of the Convention, denotes the person or persons directly or indirectly affected by the alleged violation (see Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos.\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",
