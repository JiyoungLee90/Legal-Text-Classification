The case originated in an application (no. 66217/10) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Aleksandr Ivanovich Krasnyuk (“the applicant”), on 30 October 2010.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, most recently Mr I. Lishchyna.
The applicant complained, in particular: under Article 3 of the Convention about the physical conditions of detention and the alleged lack of medical care in the Kharkiv pre-trial detention centre (“the Kharkiv SIZO”), the conditions of his transportation on hearing days, and his alleged ill-treatment by Oleksiyivska Prison officials; under Article 5 § 3 about the length of his pre-trial detention; under Article 6 § 1 about the length of the criminal proceedings against him; and under Article 8 of the Convention about the refusal to allow him meetings with his common-law wife while he had been in detention.
On 29 May 2012 the Court gave notice of the application to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Lyman, Kharkiv Region.
In the evening on 26 November 2006 the applicant had a dispute with his former common-law wife, G. (with whom he had been co-habiting until October 2006) and her mother T., having met them in the street. He stabbed T. in the stomach with a knife that he had with him. Her injury was assessed as grievous and life-threatening. The applicant also pulled the knife on G. and cut her jacket, without injuring her. Furthermore, he inflicted an insignificant knife wound on G.’s 14-year-old niece, who was also present. An ambulance was called. G. also called the neighbourhood police officer, S. The applicant followed G., T. and G.’s niece to G.’s home, where he took her mobile telephone from her and left before the arrival of the ambulance and the police.
On the following day police officer S. arrested the applicant on suspicion of disorderly conduct (namely, being drunk and swearing in public). The officer questioned the applicant, however, in respect of the incident involving G. and her relatives. No further details are known concerning that questioning.
On 28 November 2006 the Izyum Town Court (“the Izyum Court”) found the applicant guilty of an administrative (minor) offence of disorderly conduct and sentenced him to ten days’ administrative detention.
The case file before the Court does not contain any documents in respect of the above-mentioned administrative-offence proceedings against the applicant, apart from officer S.’s testimony, as summarised in the judgment of the Izyum Court of 27 July 2011, which had been given in the course of the criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 28 below).
On 4 December 2006 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily injuries.
On 7 December 2006 he was arrested as a suspect in those proceedings.
On the following day the Izyum Court remanded the applicant in custody as a preventive measure pending trial. It referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and held that, if at liberty, he might abscond, interfere with the investigation, or resume his alleged criminal activities.
On 27 December 2006 the applicant was officially charged with hooliganism, inflicting grievous bodily injuries, and robbery.
On the same day, however, the charge of inflicting grievous bodily injuries was reclassified to that of attempted murder.
On an unspecified date a lawyer was appointed to defend the applicant, at the latter’s request.
On 30 December 2006 the pre-trial investigation was completed and the applicant was provided with access to the case file.
On 8 February 2007 the case was referred to the Izyum Court for trial.
On 7 March 2007 that court held a preparatory hearing. In so far as its ruling concerned the issue of the preventive measure, it stated – without further reasoning – that the applicant was to be kept in pre-trial detention.
In April 2007 the applicant requested the trial court to admit Ms Kr., to whom he referred as his “wife”, to the proceedings as his lay representative in the capacity of a close relative. The latter, however, refused to act as his representative, informing the court that they had divorced. The applicant’s request was therefore rejected.
On 23 January 2008 the Izyum Court found the applicant guilty of hooliganism, inflicting grievous bodily injuries (rather than attempted murder) and robbery, and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment.
On 19 March 2009 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal (“the Regional Court”) quashed that judgment and remitted the case for additional pre-trial investigation. It held, in particular, that the bill of indictment had not complied with all the legal requirements. Furthermore, there were some unexplained discrepancies in the sequence of the events in question and the applicant’s motives, as presented by the accusation and in the judgment. The appellate court held that the preventive measure that had been earlier applied in respect of the applicant (that of pre-trial detention) remain unchanged, without providing further reasoning in that regard.
On 25 June 2009 the additional pre-trial investigation was completed.
On 31 July 2009 the Izyum Court held a preparatory hearing. It ruled that the preventive measure in respect of the applicant was to be the same as before (that of pre-trial detention).
On 17 November 2009 it found the applicant guilty of making murder threats, the premeditated infliction of grievous and light bodily injuries, and the forcible assertion of his rights (самоправство) (in respect of his withholding G.’s phone). The applicant was sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment.
On 9 September 2010 the Regional Court quashed that judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination to the first-instance court. It held that some conclusions by the Izyum Court concerning the facts of the case and their legal classification did not correspond to those determined by the pre-trial investigation and that no explanation had been given in that respect. The first-instance court was criticised, among other things, for finding the applicant guilty of forcibly asserting his rights in respect of his withholding G.’s mobile phone, whereas in fact he had had no rights in that respect.
In so far as the above-mentioned ruling of the Regional Court concerned the preventive measure in respect of the applicant, its wording was identical to that of its earlier ruling of 19 March 2009 (see paragraph 21 above).
On 5 October 2010 the applicant requested the trial court to admit Ms Ko., referred to as his “common-law wife”, to the proceedings as his lay representative. On the following day Ms Ko. joined the applicant in that request and expressed her willingness to represent him. That request was refused on the grounds that, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, only close relatives could be admitted as lay representatives in criminal proceedings, whereas there was no evidence proving that Ms Ko. complied with that condition.
On 27 July 2011 the Izyum Court delivered a new judgment by which it found the applicant guilty of hooliganism, robbery, and inflicting grievous bodily injuries, and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. At the court hearing, the applicant did not deny the incident, but claimed that he had injured G.’s mother and niece accidentally. He also admitted to having taken G.’s mobile telephone, but argued that he had intended to call an ambulance and had forgotten to give the telephone back to G.
On 17 April 2012 the Regional Court upheld that judgment.
On 29 May 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law.
On 20 June 2012 the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters (“the Higher Specialised Court”) rejected that appeal on points of law as not complying with certain procedural requirements and set a time-limit for the applicant to rectify the indicated shortcomings. The case file before the Court does not contain a copy of that ruling.
It appears that the applicant lodged his appeal on points of law again, but only after the expiry of the relevant time-limit. As a result, on 12 November 2012 the Higher Specialised Court rejected it as belated.
On 14 February 2013 the applicant lodged an application with the Izyum Court for an extension of the time-limit for him to lodge an appeal on points of law. He argued that he had only belatedly received a copy of the appellate court’s above-mentioned ruling.
On 25 April 2013 the Izyum Court rejected the applicant’s request. It noted that he had had three months in which to lodge an appeal on points of law after the appellate court had given its ruling on 17 April 2012. There was documentary evidence proving that the applicant had received a copy of the ruling in question on 19 June 2012. However, he had asked for the timelimit extension only eight months later.
On 5 December 2014 the applicant was released, having served his sentence.
The applicant was detained in the Kharkiv SIZO from 12 December 2006 until 18 August 2011 and from 8 September 2011 until 28 April 2012.
Physical conditions of detention
Overcrowding was a major issue. Sometimes a cell with thirty-eight sleeping places accommodated up to fifty inmates.
Sanitary conditions were unacceptable. There was only one washstand and one toilet for all the inmates in the cell.
There was no access to natural light, while electric light was insufficient. Ventilation was not sufficient either. The temperatures in the cell were too high in summer and too low in winter.
The applicant was not allowed to receive parcels with home-made food or hygiene items, and food and hygiene items sold in the SIZO were exorbitantly priced.
The applicant was detained in the following cells:
from 12 December 2006 until 15 January 2007 – cell no. 285 (8.3 sq. m, with a window of 0.6 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and one 100watt electric bulb);
from 15 January until 14 February 2007 – cell no. 247 (7.7 sq. m, with a window of 0.6 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and one 100-watt electric bulb);
from 14 February 2007 until 8 February 2008 – cell no. 141 (48.8 sq. m, with two windows measuring in total 1.4 sq. m, mechanical ventilation and three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 8 February 2008 until 6 August 2009 – cell no. 129 (47.6 sq. m, with two windows measuring in total 2.05 sq. m, mechanical ventilation, three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 6 August until 24 September 2009 – cell no. 117 (45.7 sq. m, with two windows measuring in total 2.05 sq. m, mechanical ventilation, and three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 24 September until 21 November 2009 – cell no. 141;
from 21 November 2009 until 18 October 2010 – cell no. 117;
from 18 October 2010 until 25 February 2011 – cell no. 116 (60.6 sq. m, with two windows measuring in total 1.8 sq. m, mechanical ventilation, and three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 25 February until 1 March 2011 – cell no. 58 (17.5 sq. m, with a window of 3.75 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 1 until 4 March 2011 – cell no. 201 (3.8 sq. m with a window of 0.6 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and one 100-watt electric bulb);
from 4 March until 18 August 2011 – cell no. 116;
from 8 September 2011 until 4 March 2012 – cell no. 129;
from 4 until 5 March 2012 – cell no. 51 (13.9 sq. m, with a window of 3.75 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 5 until 10 March 2012 – cell no. 208 (3.6 sq. m, with a window of 0.6 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and one 100-watt electric bulb);
from 10 until 21 March 2012 – cell no. 275 (58.3 sq. m, with seven windows measuring in total 12.7 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and three 100-watt electric bulbs);
from 21 until 29 March 2012 – cell no. 117;
from 29 March until 25 April 2012 – cell no. 695 (17.8 sq. m, with two windows measuring in total 0.57 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and one 100-watt electric bulb);
from 25 until 28 April 2012 – cell no. 696 (16.3 sq. m, with two windows measuring in total 0.57 sq. m affording natural ventilation, and one 100-watt electric bulb).
Each cell was equipped with a table, a bench, and a washstand.
Furthermore, there was a toilet in each cell, separated by a brick wall from the living area.
The conditions in all the cells complied with the applicable sanitary requirements. There was “wet cleaning” on a daily basis, using a disinfectant solution.
During the cold period of the year there was central heating, which did not allow the temperatures inside to drop below 18oС.
Medical care
The applicant started suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in March 2012 as a result of his detention for six days in a punishment cell (карцер), where he “had been subjected to physical pressure”.
On 11 June 2012 the applicant’s representative wrote to the Court that the poor conditions of the applicant’s detention in the Kharkiv SIZO were the reason for his TB.
On 4 June 2013 the applicant’s lawyer additionally wrote, in her reply on the applicant’s behalf to the Government’s observations, that he had been “subjected to electric shocks” and that cold water had been “poured on him” during his six-day detention in that punishment cell, after which he had been diagnosed with TB.
There were no further submissions from the applicant or his representatives regarding his TB and its treatment.
The applicant suffered from influenza on a number of occasions, for which the medical unit did not provide any free-of-charge medications.
The applicant’s eyesight seriously deteriorated in detention: prior to his arrest on 27 November 2006 he had needed glasses of 1.25-1.50 dioptres, while on 16 June 2011 an ophthalmologist who examined the applicant in detention noted that he needed glasses of above 4 dioptres.
As confirmed by his medical file, the applicant was diagnosed for the first time with pulmonary tuberculosis in 1986, during his detention in Raykiv Prison no. 73. The applicant then underwent medical treatment for tuberculosis for about nine months in Snigurivska Prison no. 5.
Immediately after the applicant’s arrival at the Kharkiv SIZO on 12 December 2006 he underwent a medical examination and was found to be essentially healthy.
On 19 December 2006 the applicant underwent chest X-rays as part of the standard medical supervision.
On the same day he was examined by a TB specialist and placed under outpatient observation on account of a diagnosis, arising from the Xray results, of “residual post-tuberculosis changes in the lungs (category 5.1)”. In connection with that diagnosis, the applicant was provided with anti-relapse treatment consisting of two anti-TB drugs: Isoniazid (0.3) and Rifampicin (0.6). It was recommended that the applicant be X-rayed every six months.
Subsequently, the applicant was X-rayed and examined by a TB specialist on a regular basis – namely, on 11 June, 12 June and 4 December 2007 and 13 February and 15 February 2008. No signs of TB were documented.
On 15 February 2008 the TB specialist who had examined the applicant concluded that there was no further need for his continued outpatient observation.
On 27 March 2012, following a routine X-raying of the applicant, he was diagnosed with pneumonia. A TB specialist examined him on the same day and prescribed him with the following anti-pneumonia medications: Doxycycline (one capsule three times per day for fourteen days) and Ceftriaxone (one intermuscular injection per day for fourteen days).
On 25 April 2012 the applicant’s medical documents were transferred to a panel of doctors from Kharkiv TB Dispensary no. 1, who gave him a final diagnosis of “relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis”.
The applicant underwent anti-TB treatment in a tuberculosis isolation ward at the Kharkiv SIZO for five days.
On 29 April 2012 he was transferred for further examination and treatment to the specialised TB hospital attached to Zhovtnevska Prison no. 17 (“Zhovtnevska Prison”; of medium-security level).
As at the date of the Government’s observations, 26 September 2012, the applicant had been undergoing treatment in Zhovtnevska Prison. More specifically, the following anti-TB medications were administered to him: Isoniazid (0.3), Rifampicin (0.6), Pyrazinamide (2.0) and Ethambutol (1.2). According to the Government, there was no shortage of the required medications and the applicant was receiving them in full.
The applicant’s health was improving and his state was considered satisfactory.
No other health-related concerns of the applicant were brought to the attention of the authorities.
On one occasion, in a letter to the Court of 27 January 2012, the applicant briefly mentioned that he was being transported to court hearings during the winter period not by train (which was the usual practice), but in unheated vans, despite his not having sufficient warm clothing, and that such trips lasted for about three hours. That was the only submission from the applicant on that issue. None of the parties commented on it after the notice of that complaint was given to the Government.
According to the applicant, upon his arrival at Oleksiyivska Prison no. 25 (“the Oleksiyivska prison”) at 10.30 a.m. on 18 August 2011 he was made to take off all his clothes in order to undergo a personal search; he was kept completely naked until 7 p.m. – including during his questioning by the prison staff.
All the documents that he had with him, including copies from his case file, were allegedly withheld by the guards.
The applicant further alleged that, when he had objected to the guards’ actions, he was taken to the prison’s duty unit (чергова частина), where he was forced to stand facing a wall at a distance from it of one metre, with his feet and hands spread apart and his hands on the wall. He alleged that he was forced to remain in that position for three days without sleep or water.
On 21 August 2011 he was taken to the prison’s transfer unit (етапна частина).
On the following day the applicant was allegedly taken back to the duty unit where he had been subjected, for the following two days, to the same ill-treatment as he had received prior to 21 August 2011. According to the applicant, he was told that that was his punishment for violating prison rules, arguing with the guards, and disobeying their orders.
On 26 August 2011 the applicant was allegedly placed in the prison’s disciplinary unit (дисциплінарний ізолятор) for three days as punishment for having asked the guards to return his documents. During his detention there he was allegedly forced to follow military-type orders, such to stand upright, to run with his arms behind his head, or to learn poems or songs after his spectacles were taken away. When he disobeyed, he was allegedly beaten up.
Ms Ko., who also acted as the applicant’s representative before the Court at the early stages of the proceedings, wrote to the Court that she had learned of the arrest of the applicant, to whom she referred as her commonlaw husband, three and a half years later, by pure chance, from third persons.
On 5 July 2010 the applicant requested the Izyum Court for a short-term visit by Ms Ko., without further explanations.
On 22 July 2010 the Izyum Court wrote to the applicant that it was for Ms Ko. to request such a visit.
There is no information regarding whether Ms Ko. did in fact ask to be allowed to visit the applicant.
On 14 September 2011 the applicant again requested the Izyum Court to be allowed to meet with Ms Ko, this time specifying that she was his common-law wife.
On 15 September 2011 the Izyum Court replied to the applicant that his request had been rejected for the following reasons: firstly, there was no evidence proving that Ms Ko. was his “close relative”, within the meaning of Article 345 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 83 below); secondly, Ms Ko. herself had not asked for such a visit.
On 7 July 2012 Ms Ko. applied to the administration of Zhovtnevska Prison, in which the applicant was detained at the time, to be allowed to make a short-term visit to him.
On the same day the applicant had a short-term meeting with Ms Ko.
According to the Government, thereafter neither the applicant nor Ms Ko. asked for further meetings. The applicant’s comment on that was limited to an observation that since June 2012 he and Ms Ko. had been trying to get married, but that this had not been possible because of the loss of his passport by the authorities.
The relevant provisions concerning pre-trial detention can be found in Krivolapov v. Ukraine (no. 5406/07, §§ 60 and 61, 2 October 2018).
Article 162 provided, at the relevant time, that visits by relatives or other people to a detainee could be allowed by the official or authority in charge of the case in question.
Under Article 345, the presiding judge or the president of the relevant court was obliged to grant close relatives of a convict, upon their request, permission to visit him or her, prior to the entry into force of a judgment in his or her criminal case.
Under Article 110, prisoners were entitled to short-term visits lasting no longer than four hours and to long-term visits lasting no longer than three days. Short visits could be granted to prisoners to meet with relatives or other persons and were to be held in the presence of a prison officer. Long-term visits could be granted to prisoners in order for them to meet with close relatives only (that is to say a spouse, parents, children, foster parents, foster children, siblings, grandparents, or grandchildren). Long-term visits could also be granted to a prisoner to meet with a person who had lived with him or her as a spouse without being actually married, provided that they shared parentage of minor children.
Article 139 provided that prisoners held in medium-security-level prisons were entitled to one short-term visit per month and one long-term visit every three months.
Section 12 read as follows in the relevant part:
“Visits by relatives or other people can be allowed to individuals remanded in custody by the administration of a pre-trial detention facility only with the written permission of the investigator, the investigating authorities or the court examining the case – as a rule, once per a month. The duration of [such a] a visit shall be from one to four hours.”
