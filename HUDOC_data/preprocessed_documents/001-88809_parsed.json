Moreover, she unsuccessfully alleged bias of the first instance court twice. Further, on 2\u00a0September\u00a02002 her first counsel withdrew from representing her. Subsequently, legal aid proceedings were pending until 28\u00a0February\u00a02003. Her new counsel did not submit his power of attorney until 21\u00a0November\u00a02002 and then had to familiarise himself with the case-file. In August\u00a02003 the evidence order was extended in accordance with the applicant\u2019s motion of June\u00a02003. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s mental illness and her submissions to the domestic court cast doubt on her capacity to litigate. In April and May 2004 this question had to be clarified by the court with the assistance of the expert. Finally, the applicant failed to quantify her maintenance claims after the partial judgment of 23\u00a0November\u00a02004. Thus, the approximately four and a half months delay which occurred after service of that judgment on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 31\u00a0January\u00a02005 is attributable to the applicant.",
