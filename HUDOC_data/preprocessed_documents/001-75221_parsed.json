It quashed the Ruzayevskiy District Court\u2019s judgment of 30\u00a0June\u00a02000 because the first instance court had miscalculated the amount of the monthly benefits to be paid to the applicant.

The applicant noted that in the case of Ryabykh v. Russia (no.\u00a052854/99, \u00a7\u00a7 51-57, ECHR 2003IX) the Court found the supervisory review procedure incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1.

The applicant averred that the quashing of the Ruzayevskiy District Court\u2019s judgment of 30\u00a0June\u00a02000 under supervisory review violated the principle of legal certainty.
