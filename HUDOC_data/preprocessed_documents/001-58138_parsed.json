The gunfire was directed at them from a rocky area, a creek and from the hills around. The security forces, numbering about sixty, took cover and returned fire using mainly G3 and A4 guns with an effective range of between 300 and 1,000 metres as well as longer range MG3 and K23 machine guns. The firing distance between the security forces and their assailants varied between 300 and 500 metres. The terrorists retreated after about thirty minutes and in the lull a search of the scene of the attack was carried out during which the security forces recovered a dead body alongside of which lay an automatic assault gun (later confirmed as Chinese-made in the ballistics report \u2013 see paragraph\u00a032 below) bearing the serial number 59339 together with ammunition including three cartridge clips, three rounds of which were spent and three unused.

Secondly, no tests for fingerprints or gunpowder traces on the deceased\u2019s clothes or body were made at the scene.

The handing over of the body to the villagers precluded any further examination. Thirdly, it appeared to the Commission that the authorities took it for granted that the deceased was a PKK terrorist and they did not consider it necessary to examine seriously the possibility that he had been killed in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the security forces. In this respect, the Commission had regard to the mention made in the autopsy report that the deceased was a PKK terrorist, to the wording of the non-jurisdiction decision issued by the public prosecutor, Mr Ekrem Y\u0131ld\u0131z, (see paragraph 31 above) and to the apparent failure of the public prosecutor attached to the Diyarbak\u0131r National Security Court to put any questions to Hikmet Aksoy about the deceased\u2019s possible involvement with the PKK (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",

The effect of Article\u00a013 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article\u00a013 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article\u00a013 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the above-mentioned Aksoy judgment, p. 2286, \u00a7 95; the above-mentioned Ayd\u0131n judgment, pp. 1895\u201396, \u00a7 103; and the above-mentioned Mente\u015f judgment, pp. 2715\u201316, \u00a7\u00a089).",

In the view of the Court the nature of the right which the authorities are alleged to have violated in the instant case, one of the most fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, must have implications for the nature of the remedies which must be guaranteed for the benefit of the relatives of the victim. In particular, where those relatives have an arguable claim that the victim has been unlawfully killed by agents of the State, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a013 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy and Ayd\u0131n judgments at p. 2287, \u00a7 98, and pp. 1895\u201396, \u00a7 103, respectively).

There were, moreover, a number of features of the security forces\u2019 version of the events which required independent clarification. It is true that the Court has concluded that it has not been established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was indeed unlawfully killed. Nevertheless, the fact that the applicant\u2019s allegations were not ultimately substantiated does not prevent his claim from being an arguable one for the purposes of Article\u00a013 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27\u00a0April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, \u00a7 52).

Having regard to the absence of any effective investigation into the circumstances of the killing, it must be concluded that the applicant and the next-of-kin were on that account also denied an effective remedy against the authorities in respect of the death of Abd\u00fclmenaf Kaya, in violation of Article\u00a013 of the Convention, and thereby access to any other available remedies at their disposal, including a claim for compensation.

Furthermore, the attitude of the security forces was to treat the Kurdish civilian population as in some way involved with the PKK. No distinction was made between terrorists and ordinary civilians.
