The court found that an average reader would understand the article as putting the expert opinion from 1993 in direct relation to the applicant\u2019s work as an expert now, thus questioning the quality of her work. The article, that also featured the applicant\u2019s full name and the description of her psychological impairment, touched her intimate personal sphere, since it created a link between her mental state and the quality of her work. However, the information itself did not allow for such a link, especially since the expert opinion dated from 1993 and dealt only with a very specific question in the context of civil proceedings at the time. The incomplete and manipulative content of the article was not able to meet the standards of reporting on matters of fact. Furthermore, the court did not consider that there was a direct link between the contents of the article and the applicant\u2019s public position, given that she mainly worked as an expert in custody cases, which were not usually heard in public. Furthermore, it could be assumed that the applicant, a psychiatrist herself and a medical doctor, was managing her illness well and was able to do her work without any impairments.",

The Court of Appeal confirmed that the article and the impugned passages giving opinions on the applicant\u2019s mental state affected her intimate personal sphere and were capable of compromising her. However, the content of the article was true, as it only repeated true information that had not been disputed by the applicant. Furthermore, the court did not find the article to be incomplete or manipulative, but sufficiently well-balanced and faithful to the different sides of the story in that it also referred to the fact that the applicant\u2019s integrity had never been questioned in ten years; the court also asked for statements from the Vice-President of the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court, a member of the Green Party, and the Youth Advocate of the Regional Government of Lower Austria.",

She had been included in the list of experts to be appointed by the courts since the year 2000 and had been appointed in several cases. This regular work as an expert in court proceedings belongs beyond doubt to the public sphere (\u201c...ist zweifellos dem \u00f6ffentlichen Leben zuzuordnen...\u201d) as she took part in association with the State-organised judiciary and held an important position in connection with the decision-making process of judges. Even though the impugned expert opinion dated from 1993 and concerned a period in the applicant\u2019s life prior even to that date, the reporting in question touched sufficiently upon the present public activities of the applicant. Considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field, the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt. Any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts \u2013 if based on sufficient reasons \u2013 had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of good conduct of the administration of justice, which was what had happened as the next step in the present case. According to the Court of Appeal, the article took up doubts arising from the neurologist opinion in 1993 without denying the applicant\u2019s abilities as an expert in the area. The truthful information in the article and the public interest in the subject matter justified the article\u2019s critical questioning of exactly those abilities.",

The court found that the average reader would understand the article as stating that the applicant was incapable of being an expert in custody proceedings because of her own mental health impairments in 1993 and that this placed in question the quality of the applicant\u2019s work so far. That the applicant\u2019s psychological illness was directly linked to the intimate personal sphere was beyond doubt. The present article not only mentioned the applicant\u2019s mental health status, but also grossly exaggerated individual symptoms, which was also capable of compromising her. The article was so incomplete and distorted that it could not be considered a report of matters of fact. The Regional Court in particular noted that the article did not mention that the period of examination was even earlier than 1993 and that only certain aspects of the expert opinion had been published, while others had not. Scandalously the article created the impression that the applicant had rendered decisive opinions in custody proceedings for over a decade while herself suffering from the symptoms described above. Furthermore, the publication was not linked in any way to the applicant\u2019s public status (\u201c...steht [...] in keinem unmittelbaren Zusammenhang mit dem \u00f6ffentlichen Leben der Antragstellerin\u201d).

The applicant had been included in the list of court-commissioned experts since the year 2000, and her repeated work as an expert in court proceedings must be considered as belonging to the public sphere. The activity was closely linked to the administration of justice, and had a considerable influence on judges\u2019 decision-making processes. The impugned article concerned the applicant\u2019s activity as an expert in custody proceedings. Considering the importance and sensitivity of the area of custody proceedings and the dominant role of experts in the field, the psychological integrity of an expert assigned to those cases had to be beyond doubt. Any reservation in relation to the mental health of experts \u2013 if based on sufficient reasons \u2013 had to be met with a thorough investigation in the interest of the proper administration of justice, which had happened as a next step in the present case. Insofar, a truthful report linked to a person\u2019s public status, which also contained information belonging to the intimate personal sphere must be permitted to be published. The Court of Appeal concluded that the article, by way of an appropriate commentary, critically examined a matter of public interest and therefore exercised its role as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d.",

Furthermore, the content of the article was balanced, informing on facts and not only intended to satisfy public curiosity.

Moreover, in the Continental legal systems experts are appointed by the court: in other words, they are not chosen by the parties. Where a judge does not have the requisite specialised knowledge, in this case psychological knowledge concerning, inter alia, custody cases, he or she will appoint an expert from the roster. An expert witness does not testify only to the facts, as is the case with ordinary witnesses. He or she testifies about the facts, as he or she has established them, and is also bound to give his or her opinion on the same facts. Given that those facts and that opinion overlap to the point of being consubstantial, a judge is rarely in a position to question the expertise of the courtappointed expert.

The whole case hinged on this established fact, yet the diagnosis of paedophilia was at that time already 20 years old. For this reason, one cannot a priori maintain that a long-standing psychiatric diagnosis was not relevant. Of course, much depends on the nature of the underlying psychiatric disorder, and we do not maintain that the situation is different here, where the diagnosis referred to mood swings, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts and visual hallucinations, as well as paranoid ideas. The way to invalidate the former diagnosis would have been for the applicant to submit to another bona fide psychiatric evaluation. This might have disproved the previous opinion.",

In the present case, however, the applicant\u2019s story was gratuitously trumpeted about in an article which implied that certain mental-health problems from which she had reportedly suffered in the distant past impeded her professional skills. As will be shown, there was no public debate at the material time regarding any decision which the applicant might have taken in her professional capacity or any other circumstance of her life, let alone any criminal investigation against her. In the B\u00e9dat case, Switzerland, by safeguarding the defendant\u2019s rights under Article 8, had not violated the freedom of the media under Article 10. The present judgment is based on the idea that whatever rights the applicant might have had under Article 8 (related to her mental suffering when going through a difficult period of her life related to the alleged breach of promise of marriage) were superseded by the freedom of the media under Article 10, and that therefore the non-sanctioning of the latter by the Austrian courts was in line with Article 8.

One does not have to consult dictionaries to ascertain that the word \u201cresponsible\u201d encompasses much more than a merely formalistic legal liability for violations of human rights by the media. This capacious notion relates to the media\u2019s overall mission, on account of which it enjoys an exceptionally high degree of protection. The minimum level of this broader responsibility is somewhat similar to Hippocrates\u2019s \u201cthou shall do no harm\u201d commandment to the medical profession: the media shall do no harm to the community\u2019s general interest, as well as no gratuitous harm to the persons about whom it imparts information. Whereas at times it is not obvious how the first part of this commandment is to be fulfilled (because the general interest may not be understood by all in the same way), the second part is less contradictory: in ethical journalism it is undisputed that what the media publishes or broadcasts may be hurtful, and therefore it should constantly be aware of the impact of its words and images on the lives of others. If this precept is not respected, responsible journalism is an empty phrase. If it is ignored by the Court when examining a case where the freedom of the media comes up against personality rights, then responsible journalism, although often referred to in its case-law, is to be considered not as a principle of the law of the Convention, but a mere decoration.

Such an interpretation has no basis in the undisputed democratic requirement of citizens\u2019 supervision of politicians and other officials. Indeed, it turns things inside out: the idea that those whom the community has entrusted with an official function should not be rewarded with privacy incommensurable with the attention which the public may legitimately pay to their activities and their persons is distorted and downgraded to a belief that persons in an \u201cofficial capacity\u201d must be subject to a form of retribution for taking up that function whereby they enjoy virtually no privacy at all, so long as they are not verbally attacked in an \u201coffensive and abusive\u201d manner.
