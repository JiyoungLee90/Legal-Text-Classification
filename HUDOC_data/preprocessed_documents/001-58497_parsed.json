The Federal Court held that the mere fact that the applicant had been named in the file as a \u201ccontact with the Russian embassy\u201d could hardly be considered as an infringement of his personality rights. Moreover, even if part of the case number meant \u201cespionage established\u201d, there was nothing to indicate that the authorities had considered the applicant to be a spy and although the expression \u201ccontact with the Russian embassy\u201d could conceivably imply that the applicant had effectively had regular contact with the embassy, his card had to be seen, not in isolation, but in the wider context of the card index as a whole and the other circumstances of the case; in particular, the fact that no other entry had been made on his card suggested that the authorities did not suspect the applicant of having illegal contacts with the embassy. Furthermore, it could not be presumed that the applicant had been subject to surveillance on other occasions or that the recorded information had been disclosed to third parties.
