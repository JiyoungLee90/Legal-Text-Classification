The Government confirmed that the Romanian authorities fully understood and shared the concerns about the hospital. Ensuring the protection of handicapped persons remained a governmental priority and the Ministry of Health would start inquiries into all similar medical institutions in order to make sure Poiana Mare was an isolated case. Regarding Poiana Mare, immediate measures had been taken to improve the living conditions of the patients and these steps would continue until the hospital was completely rehabilitated. On 25 February 2004, the Minister of Health conducted an enquiry into Poiana Mare. There were deficiencies with the heating and water systems, food preparation, waste disposal, living and sanitary conditions, and medical assistance. Most of the problems connected with medical assistance were caused by the insufficiency of resources and bad management. The Government confirmed that the following measures were required: clarification by forensic specialists of the cause of death of those patients whose death was unrelated to pre-existing disease or advanced age; implementing the hospital\u2019s plan of 2004; hiring supplementary specialized health professionals; reorganizing the working schedule of physicians to include night shifts; ensuring specialized medical assistance on a regular basis; and allocating supplementary funding to improve living conditions. The Government also confirmed that the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health, as well as the Secretary of State of the National Authority for Handicapped Persons, had been discharged following the irregularities found at the Poiana Mare Psychiatric Hospital, and that the Director of the Hospital had been replaced by an interim director until a competitive selection for the vacant position was finalized. The Government confirmed that the hospital would be carefully monitored by representatives of the Ministry of Health throughout 2004 and that representatives of the local administration would be directly involved in improving the situation at the hospital. Finally, the Government confirmed that the Ministry of Health would start very soon an independent investigation of all other similar units, and would take all necessary measures to prevent any such unfortunate situations from ever happening again.\u201d",

The Government should also support other needed measures including: making appropriate medication available, providing adequate rehabilitation for patients, ensuring that patients are able to access effective complaint mechanisms, and the provision of human rights training for hospital staff.

Consequently, the frequent abuses committed against people with disabilities were often not reported to the authorities and were ignored, and an atmosphere of impunity surrounded these violations. In order to prevent and put an end to such abuses, NGOs played an important role, including by facilitating vulnerable people\u2019s access to justice. Against that backdrop, allowing NGOs to lodge applications with the Court on behalf of people with disabilities would be fully in line with the principle of effectiveness underlying the Convention, and also with the trends existing at domestic level in many European countries and the case-law of other international courts, such as the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights, which granted locus standi to NGOs acting on behalf of alleged victims, even when the victims had not appointed these organisations as their representatives (for instance, in the case of Yatama v. Nicaragua (preliminary objections, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 23 June 2005, Series C No. 127).",

In this context it may be reiterated that it is essential that the person concerned should have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation, failing which he will not have been afforded \u201cthe fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty\u201d (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v.

Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Where the authorities decide to place and maintain in detention a person with disabilities, they should demonstrate special care in guaranteeing such conditions as correspond to any special needs resulting from his disability (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, \u00a7 59, 21 December 2010, with further references). More broadly, the Court has held that States have an obligation to take particular measures to provide effective protection of vulnerable persons from ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR\u00a02001V). Consequently, where an individual is taken into custody in good health but later dies, it is incumbent on the State to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of the events leading to his death (see Carabulea v. Romania, no. 45661/99, \u00a7 108, 13 July 2010) and to produce evidence casting doubt on the veracity of the victim\u2019s allegations, particularly if those allegations are backed up by medical reports (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V, and Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v. Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7 43, 2 November 2004).",

Ultimately, the European Court of Human Rights (\u201cthe Court\u201d) is faced with these questions: Can judges create law? And if they can, how should they proceed, and within what limits? Without expecting to solve problems of this magnitude in the limited confines of a separate opinion, I felt that, nevertheless, I had an obligation to explain my vote for the majority position with a concurring opinion, in which these problems could at least be approached. What apparently seemed a case involving a simple procedural problem of legal representation could have become a groundbreaking case in which the Court addressed, in novel and solid terms, the interplay between legal principles and rules in the task of human rights treaty interpretation, and the limits of the Court\u2019s own legal creativity.

He had no relatives, legal guardians or representatives, was abandoned at birth and lived in various public orphanages, centres for disabled children and medical facilities, where he allegedly did not receive proper health and educational treatment. Since these facts were abundantly proven and revealed ad nauseam a flagrant violation of the deceased teenager\u2019s human rights, the only apparent question to be determined in this case was the right of the Centre for Legal Resources (\u201cCLR\u201d) to act on his behalf before the Court. As the Commissioner for Human Rights stressed, an intolerable legal gap in the protection of human rights emerged in this situation in view of Mr\u00a0C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s lifelong state of extreme vulnerability, the absence of any relatives, legal guardians or representatives and the unwillingness of the respondent State to investigate his death and bring to justice those responsible. This legal black hole, where extremely vulnerable victims of serious breaches of human rights committed by public officials may linger for the rest of their lives without any possible way of exercising their rights, warranted a principled response by the Court.

The judgment was simply downgraded to an act of indulgence on the part of the Court, which was willing to close its eyes to the rigidity of the requirements of the concept of legal representation under the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) and the Rules of Court in \u201cthe exceptional circumstances of this case\u201d (see paragraphs 112 and 160 of the judgment), and to admit the CLR as a \u201cde facto representative of Mr\u00a0C\u00e2mpeanu\u201d (see paragraph 114 of the judgment).

Otherwise, that would make accountability for a human rights violation dependent on the de facto acknowledgment of the applicant by those same institutions which might be responsible for the violation. Also irrelevant is the close link established in the last sentence of paragraph\u00a0111 of the judgment between the nature of the grievance (an Article\u00a02 complaint) and the right of the CLR to act on behalf of the victim. This supposed link prejudices applications based exclusively or cumulatively on Articles\u00a03, 4 or 5 of the Convention, and therefore on situations where an extremely vulnerable person has been tortured, ill-treated, enslaved or illegally detained and is not in a position to exercise his or her right of access to a court. Furthermore, in relation to Article 2 cases, I do not agree with the statement that the applicant must have become involved as a representative before the alleged victim\u2019s death. In the case at hand, it is certainly a fiction to assume that the CLR became \u201cinvolved as a representative\u201d on the day of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death (see paragraph 111 of the judgment). The only action undertaken by the CLR was to take notice of Mr\u00a0C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s deplorable situation and to suggest that the hospital\u2019s manager transfer him to another facility, and this laudable, but limited, action by the CLR cannot be characterised as \u201clegal representation\u201d for the purposes of national law or the Convention. Putting fictions aside, the Court does not have to consider whether the applicant has ever interviewed the alleged victim of human rights, or even seen him or her alive, because that would make the application depend on fortuitous facts which are not within the applicant\u2019s power.",

If the case reveals a wider problem, then it is not exceptional. Ultimately, the majority acknowledge that this is not an exceptional case, but this acknowledgment is conceded only for the purpose of imposing a positive obligation on the respondent State. This way of proceeding based on double standards is not acceptable. It is not acceptable that the same set of facts is exceptional for the purpose of the definition of the Court\u2019s remit and the conditions of admissibility of applications, whereas it is not exceptional and even \u201creveals a wider problem\u201d for the purpose of imposing positive obligations on the respondent State.",

The argument is purely consequentialist: \u201cTo find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at an international level\u00a0...\u201d (see paragraph\u00a0112 of the judgment). Hence, the majority admit the applicant association as a \u201crepresentative\u201d of the victim because they want to examine the alleged violation, and rejecting the application would prevent them from doing so. This self-authenticating proposition begs the question. Such a strictly opportunistic and utilitarian case-sifting methodology cannot in my view suffice. The words that follow in the argument are even less fortunate: \u201c... with the risk that the respondent State might escape accountability under the Convention.\u201d Whilst expressing the purpose of ensuring that the respondent State is held accountable, which is again stressed in the next sentence of the same paragraph, the majority imply that the selection of the case for examination is, ultimately, determined by the need to punish the respondent State with a finding of a violation, and the subsequent imposition of general remedial measures.

The reason is quite obvious: exceptional findings cannot be extended to other situations. What I regret most is the fact that, by treating this case on the basis of the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, the majority have in fact assumed that the Convention is not a living instrument and does not have to adapt to other new circumstances where the applicability of a concept of de facto representation might be called for. Moreover, the implicit claim that each case is sui generis is subversive in international law, indeed in any field of law, since it frequently leads, as experience has shown, to a discretionary understanding of justice determined by non-legal \u2013 that is, political, social or purely emotional \u2013 considerations on the part of those tasked with the sifting of cases.

Applied in the light of the interpretative theories referred to above, the principle of equality could have filled the legal gap that I mentioned earlier, by providing a principled basis for expanding the limits of the concept of representation for the purposes of the Convention. When confronted with a situation where the domestic authorities ignored the fate of the alleged victim of human rights violations, and he or she was unable to reach the Court by his or her own means or those of a relative, legal guardian or representative, the Court has to interpret the conditions of admissibility of applications in the broadest possible way in order to ensure that the victim\u2019s right of access to the European human rights protection system is effective. Only such an interpretation of Article 34 of the Convention accommodates the intrinsically different factual situation of extremely vulnerable persons who are or have been victims of human rights violations and are deprived of legal representation. Any other interpretation, which would equate the situation of extremely vulnerable persons to that of other victims of human rights violations, would in fact result in discriminatory treatment of the former. Different situations must be treated differently. Thus, the right of access to court for extremely vulnerable persons warrants positive discrimination in favour of these persons when assessing their representation requirements before the Court.",

These two cumulative conditions, namely the extreme vulnerability of the alleged victim and the absence of any relatives, legal guardians or representatives, should have been laid down clearly by the Court. Extreme vulnerability of a person is a broad concept that should include, for the above purposes, people of tender age, or elderly, gravely sick or disabled people, people belonging to minorities, or groups subject to discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation or any other ground. The absence of relatives, legal guardians or representatives is an additional condition that must be assessed according to the facts known to the authorities at the material time. What is relevant is the fact that the victim has no known next of kin and no representative or guardian appointed by the competent authority to take care of his or her interests. These two conditions would have provided legal certainty to the Contracting Parties to the Convention and guidance to any interested institutions and persons who might be willing in future to lodge applications on behalf of other extremely vulnerable victims of human rights violations. By not providing clear and general criteria, and by linking its finding to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d of the case, the Court\u2019s judgment not only weakens the authority of its reasoning and restricts the scope of its findings and their interpretative value, but also provides less guidance, or no guidance at all, to States Parties and interested institutions and persons who might be willing to intervene in favour of helpless, vulnerable victims of human rights violations. Instead of extending the benefit of its work to as many individuals as possible, the Court has restricted the reach of its work to the bare confines of the present case.",

The Janus-faced nature of the interpretation of international human rights texts \u2013 both remedial and backward-looking on the one hand and promotional and forward-looking on the other \u2013 further propels judges into becoming \u201csubsidiary legislators\u201d (Ersatzgesetzgeber). But the promotional role of international courts, which is aimed ultimately at the furtherance of human rights across the domestic jurisdictions under their supervision, is circumscribed by the judge\u2019s responsibility to be \u201cfaithful\u201d to pre-existing treaty law, and especially to the legal principles upon which it is based. In the Convention, these principles are the \u201cprinciples of law recognised by civilised nations\u201d, to which explicit reference is made in Article 7. Such principles are posited in the domestic laws of European and non-European nations at any given moment. Only such legal principles can provide a solid basis for the interpretative work of the international judge, and for limiting his or her remit. Only they can furnish the intersubjectively controllable passerelle between the letter of the treaty and the \u201claw of the case\u201d when no specific rules are applicable. Only they can assist the judge in his or her tasks of optimising conflicting rights and freedoms, distinguishing cases from one another and overruling a precedent. By preferring fact-sensitive reasoning based on the \u201cexceptional circumstances of this case\u201d, and not displaying greater congruence with the principles embedded in the Convention, in practical terms the Court exponentially increases the impact of the element of irreducible subjectivity in the adjudicative process, and by so doing, it promotes the very judicial activism that it apparently seeks to limit. Without solid principled grounds, judge-made law is nothing but a disguised policy decision in the epiphenomenal form of a self-fulfilling prophecy based on the judge\u2019s personal predilections.",

To this extent, the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions are acts of potestas. But the Court should also aim to provide authoritative legal statements based on the intrinsic strength of the principles enshrined in the Convention and developed in the Court\u2019s own case-law in the light of the \u201cgeneral principles recognised by civilised nations\u201d. For it is through principled reasoning that judicial statements are normative, and it is only by being normative that they can be fully intelligible and implemented. In their substance, the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions are acts of auctoritas, which must avoid a fallacious over-simplification of the factual and legal problems raised by the case and resist the easy temptation of convenient omissions. Such auctoritas can be exercised only when the judge shies away from a one-sided selection of the domestic and international case-law and does not turn a blind eye to fundamental scholarly work pertinent to the discussion of the case under adjudication. Most importantly of all, the consistency and coherency of the Court\u2019s output cannot be secured if the judge runs away from definitional issues, leaving to legal writers the sometimes extremely difficult exercise of putting order into a chaotic sample of disparate legal statements. Otherwise, the direction of the Court\u2019s case-law will rely on an opportunistic, cherry-picked list of cases, selected and adjudicated in accordance with an unpredictable measuring stick, which can vary according to the power of the respondent State and the notoriety of the alleged victim involved in the dispute. Otherwise, the domestic courts will be strongly tempted to neglect, or even purposely flout, their duty to implement the Court\u2019s case-law, when they are faced with judgments and decisions based on vague, succinct formulations that they do not understand. Otherwise, the lack of clarity and guidance of the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions will prompt more and more applications, drowning the Court in a vicious circle of case-specific jurisprudence, an increasing number of applications and discretionary disposal of cases.

Justice cannot be sacrificed on the altar of expediency. It is precisely at a time of growth that sufficiently clear reasons are most needed, not only for all the Court\u2019s final Committee, Chamber and Grand Chamber decisions and judgments (output), but also for the sifting (input) of cases by the single judge and the Grand Chamber panel.

I disagree with this methodological approach. In order for this case not to be an exhortation to bend the law on account of exceptional individual hardship, and consequently a free-riding exercise of judicial creativity and reconstruction of treaty obligations, the Court should have addressed the case on the basis of legal principles, namely the principle of equality before the law. If we cannot delude ourselves into dreaming of uniquely correct legal answers to hard cases, we can at least assume that the exercise of distilling from the principle of equality, which is firmly embedded in the Convention and the European human rights protection system, a rule on \u201cde facto representation\u201d before the Court would have avoided a strictly consequentialist application of the Convention.",

We are of the opinion that the Romanian authorities should have taken concrete steps to protect Mr C\u00e2mpeanu from the suffering related to his condition, and of which the authorities were perfectly aware (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2001\u2013V). Mr C\u00e2mpeanu\u2019s death was the result of a long period during which the authorities\u2019 response to his situation was insufficient and inadequate; during this time he clearly suffered a violation of his Article 3 substantive rights, having received neither appropriate medical treatment nor even food and adequate shelter in the medical centres where he was kept.
