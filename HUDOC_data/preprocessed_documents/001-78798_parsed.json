In this connection the Court reiterates that a situation as the one in the present case calls for a fair distribution of the social and financial burden involved. This burden cannot be placed on a particular social group or a private individual alone, irrespective of how important the interests of the other group or the community as a whole may be (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska v.

Contrary to the applicant's view, the 2002 Amendments had not (re)established but merely confirmed the existence of that jurisdiction and the right of owners to sue for repossession of their property. In spite of that, the Government conceded that to lodge an appeal against the Karlovac Municipal Court's decision of 10 March 2000 \u2013 by which that court declined jurisdiction in the case \u2013 would have been futile. The appeal would have ultimately resulted only in a negative decision on the merits instead of a negative procedural decision because at the material time the decision allowing M.V. to use the applicant's flat had not yet been set aside in the administrative proceedings. However, once the Housing Commission had done so on 16 October 2000 (see paragraph 18 above), the situation became completely different and from then on to bring a (second) civil action would have resulted in a decision favourable to the applicant.

However, as already noted above (see paragraph\u00a045), prior to his eviction the authorities had to provide him with alternative accommodation. As they were unable to do so before December 2003, for the applicant to bring another civil action for his eviction, as suggested by the Government, would have had no prospects of success. Given that the remedies to which the applicant previously resorted proved equally ineffective, the Court concludes that she had no effective remedy for the protection of her Convention right to property.",
