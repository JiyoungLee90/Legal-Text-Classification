Before the applications for supervisory review were lodged, the merits of the applicants' claims had been examined by the courts below. Nothing suggests that the courts had acted outside their competences or that there had been a fundamental defect in the proceedings before them. The fact that the Presidium disagreed with the assessment made by the courts below was not, in itself, a judicial error or miscarriage of justice warranting the quashing of binding and enforceable judgments and reopening of the proceedings (see Kot v. Russia, no.\u00a020887/03, \u00a7 29, 18 January 2007).",
