In August 2001 the cell housed forty inmates; that number had increased to forty-seven by the end of the year. The inmates took turns to sleep due to the lack of beds. By the beginning of 2003 twenty-three inmates were kept in the cell. The cell did not have any ventilation. It was stiflingly hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. Most of the inmates smoked and the applicant, a non-smoker, was exposed the tobacco smoke of others. The cell was infested with cockroaches and lice. Disinfection of the cell was performed once every three months and was to no avail. The television and the light were constantly on. Window panes were installed only in late 2002. The toilet was elevated from the floor by 0.5 metres. It was separated from the living area of the cell by a partition measuring one metre in height. The person using the toilet could be seen by both the inmates and the guards watching the inmates through the peep-hole in the door. The dinner table was some four metres away from the toilet. On several occasions HIV-infected inmates were placed in the cell. The applicant was allowed to take a 20-minute shower once a week. On one occasion between December 2001 and January 2002 the applicant did not have the opportunity to take a shower for three weeks. He was allowed to be outside for approximately one hour per day.

In particular, they submitted that it had been open to the applicant to bring his grievances to the attention of the prosecutor. They cited the following examples from the domestic practice in support of their position. In response to a Mr N.'s complaint about the conditions of his detention the  prosecutor's office conducted an inquiry which confirmed N.'s allegations that the food rations had been insufficient and the water supply had been irregular. As a result, the prison administration renovated the detention facility and purchased medical supplies. In the Vladimir Region, a special section for detention of inmates diagnosed with tuberculosis was established following an NGO's complaint on behalf of a Mr\u00a0B. In the Khabarovsk Region the administration of the prison where Mssrs\u00a0Sh. and Z. were detained renovated the shower and laundry rooms, upgraded the ventilation system in the disciplinary block and set up an area for medical consultations. Alternatively, in the Government's opinion, the applicant could have brought a civil action for damages resulting from the conditions of his detention. The Government cited three cases in this connection. The Yoshkar-Ola Town Court in the Mariy El Republic granted a Mr S.'s action for compensation for non-pecuniary damage resulting from a violation of his rights set forth in Article\u00a03 of the Convention on account of the appalling conditions of his detention in a remand prison. A Mr\u00a0D. had been awarded\u00a025,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage arising from the unsatisfactory conditions of his pre-trial detention. On 23\u00a0April 2004 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Oryol found that a Mr\u00a0R.'s pre-trial detention had been unlawful that he had not received food for five days of his detention. The court awarded Mr\u00a0R. RUB\u00a030,000.",

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-94).",
