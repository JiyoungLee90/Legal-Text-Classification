Moreover, this action is not susceptible to time-bar, meaning that the applicants can still make use of it (see paragraph 15 above).\u00a0Since the mere existence of doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust that avenue of redress (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 71) and given that there is no evidence in the case file that the applicants made use of this remedy, the Court considers that these complaints must be rejected under Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
