The reasons that lead us to this interpretation are: (a) first, from a purely literal point of view, the Criminal Code by no means considers the maximum term of thirty years as a new sentence to which any reductions to which the prisoner is entitled should apply, quite simply because it says no such thing; (b) on the contrary, the penalty (pena) and the resulting term of imprisonment to be served (condena) are two different things; the wording used in the Criminal Code refers to the resulting limit as the \u201cmaximum term to be served\u201d (condena), establishing the different lengths of that \u201cmaximum term to be served\u201d (condena) in relation to each of the respective \u201csentences\u201d imposed, and calculated in two different ways, by taking the different sentences in order of gravity, in accordance with the first rule, until one of the two maximum limits provided for is attained (three times the length of the heaviest sentence pronounced or, in any event, no more than thirty years); (c) this interpretation is also suggested by the wording of the Code, since after completing the successive sentences as mentioned, the prisoner will stop \u2018discharging [that is, serving] the remaining ones [in the prescribed order] as soon as the sentences already served reach the requisite maximum length, which may on no account exceed thirty years\u2019 ... (e) and from a teleological point of view, it would not be logical, simply because of the aggregation of sentences, for a copious criminal record to be reduced to a single new sentence of thirty years, with the effect that an individual who has committed a single offence is treated, without justification, in the same way as someone convicted of multiple offences, as is the case here. Indeed, there is no logic in applying this rule in such a way that committing one murder is punished in the same way as committing two hundred murders; (f) were application for a pardon to be made, it could not apply to the resulting total term to be served (condena), but rather to one, several or all of the different sentences imposed; in such a case it is for the court that pronounced the sentence to decide, and not the judicial body responsible for applying the limit (the last one), which shows that the sentences are different; and in any event, the first rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 states how, in such a case, to verify the successive completion of the sentences \u201cwhen the previous ones have been extinguished by pardon\u201d; (g) and to conclude this reasoning, from a procedural point of view Article 988 of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly states that it is a matter of fixing the maximum limit of the sentences pronounced (in the plural, in keeping with the wording of the law), \u201cin order to determine the maximum length of these sentences\u201d\u00a0(the wording is very clear).",

Consequently, the prisoner serves the different sentences, with their respective specificities and with all the benefits to which he is entitled. That being so, for the extinction of the sentences successively served, the reduction of sentences for work done may be applied in conformity with Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973.",

In this case, it would be the maximum term of thirty years. The successive serving of the sentences (the total term to be served) begins with the first sentence, which is the longest one (30 years in this case). If [the prisoner] were granted a ten-year remission for whatever reason, he would have served that sentence after 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, and the sentence would be extinguished; next, [the prisoner] would start to serve the next longest sentence (15 years), and with a remission of 5 years that sentence will have been served after 10 years. 20 + 10 = 30.

They called it \u201cthe sentence to be served\u201d, that is to say the one resulting from the application of the limit fixed in Article 70 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, which effectively extinguished the sentences that went beyond that limit. This new \u201cunit of punishment\u201d was the term the prisoner had to serve, to which remission for work done should be applied. Remissions should therefore be applied to the sentences imposed, but only once they had been processed in conformity with the rules on the consecutive serving of sentences. The dissenting judges also pointed out that for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, all Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court (agreements adopted at the Plenary sessions on 18 July 1996 and 12 February 1999), had agreed to the principle that reductions of sentence should be applied to the sentence resulting from the application of Article 70 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (the thirty-year limit). In application of that criterion no fewer than sixteen people convicted of terrorism had recently had their sentences reduced for work done although they had each been given prison sentences of over a hundred years.",

This new interpretation was also contra reo, constituted a policy of full execution of sentences alien to the Criminal Code of 1973, could be a source of inequalities and was contrary to the case-law of the Supreme Court (judgments of 8 March 1994, 15 September 2005 and 14 October 2005, see paragraphs 25-26 above).

In two cases (4893-2006, 4793-2009) it allowed the appeals for violation of the right to effective judicial protection (Article\u00a024\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Constitution) and the right to liberty (Article 17\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Constitution). The  considered that the new method of calculating remission following the Supreme Court\u2019s departure in 2006 from its earlier case-law was in contradiction with the earlier final judicial decisions in the appellants\u2019 cases. In those earlier firm and final decisions, in order to determine which was the most lenient criminal law applicable (the Criminal Code of 1973 or that of 1995), the courts had based themselves on the principle that the reductions of sentence for work done provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973 should be applied to the thirty-year maximum sentence, not to each sentence individually. In so doing they had reached the conclusion that the regime of the Criminal Code of 1973, with its reductions of sentence for work done, was more favourable to the appellants than the new Criminal Code of 1995. In a third case (appeal no. 10651-2009), the Constitutional Court found in the appellant\u2019s favour for violation of the right to effective judicial protection (Article 24 of the Constitution), considering that the Audiencia Nacional had changed the date of the prisoner\u2019s final release, thereby disregarding its own firm and final judicial decision given a few days earlier.

Even assuming that it did fall within the scope of Article 7, the legislative provisions governing prison benefits had not changed. It was only the courts\u2019 interpretation of them that had changed. In this connection the Government pointed out that according to the Court\u2019s case-law Article 7 could not be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case (Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2001II, and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 141).

The Supreme Court explicitly departed from that precedent, in a reasoned and reasonable manner. The departure from precedent was foreseeable because of the legal provisions applied, which clearly stated that remission for work done was calculated in respect of each sentence until the legal maximum was reached. Moreover, by the time the prison had to calculate the reductions applicable to the numerous sentences imposed on the applicant, a precedent had already been clearly set in judgment 197/2006. However, the prison authorities did not take that precedent into account in their initial proposal, which led the court responsible for the execution of sentences \u2013 the Audiencia Nacional \u2013 to ask them to make a new proposal, more in keeping with the established case-law.",

Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7\u00a052, Series A no. 260-A), as well as the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, \u00a7\u00a0145, ECHR 2000-VII, and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a021906/04, \u00a7 138, ECHR 2008-...). The result is that an offence and the penalty incurred for it must be clearly defined by law. This condition is fulfilled when the individual can tell from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for the act committed and/or omission (see Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 140). Furthermore, the foreseeability of the law does not rule out the person concerned having to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, \u00a7 35).",

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).

To render the protection offered by Article 7 effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \"penalty\" within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307-A, and Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 317-B). The wording of Article 7 \u00a7 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28, and Jamil, cited above, \u00a7 31). To this end, both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a \u201cpenalty\u201d and a measure that concerns the \u201cexecution\u201d or \u201cenforcement\u201d of the \u201cpenalty\u201d. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relate to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 (see, among other authorities, Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996; Grava v.

In this connection the Court notes that a decision of the Audiencia Nacional of 30 November 2000 fixed the maximum term of imprisonment to be served by the applicant in order to discharge all the sentences pronounced against her at thirty years, in accordance with Article 988 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article 70 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, in force at the time when the offences were committed. On 24 April 2008 the prison authorities set 2\u00a0July 2008 as the date for the applicant\u2019s release, a date arrived at by applying the remission for work done to which she was entitled to the maximum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. Subsequently, on 19 May 2008, the Audiencia Nacional asked the prison authorities to change the proposed date of release and calculate a new date based on the new precedent set by the Supreme Court in it judgment 197/06 of 28 February 2006. According to the new precedent, the prison benefits and remissions to which the applicant was entitled were to be applied to each of the sentences individually and not to the thirty-year maximum term. Applying the new criterion, the Audiencia Nacional fixed the new date of the applicant\u2019s final release at 27 June 2017.",

There thus seemed to be a distinction between the concept of \u201csentence to be served\u201d (\u201ccondena\u201d) and the sentences actually \u201cpronounced\u201d or \u201cimposed\u201d, that is to say the individual sentences pronounced in the different judgments convicting the applicant. Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973, on reduction of sentence for work done, established that, in discharging the \u201csentence imposed\u201d, the detainee was entitled to one day\u2019s remission for every two days\u2019 work done. However, that Article contained no specific guidance on calculating reductions of sentence when the multiple sentences pronounced added up to far more than the thirty-year limit provided for in Article 70 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, as they did in the applicant\u2019s case (where they totalled over 3,000 years). Article 100 ruled out the application of reductions of sentence for work done in only two specific cases: when detainees escaped or attempted to escape, even if they did not succeed, and when they repeatedly misbehaved while serving their sentence (see paragraph 20 above). The Court observes that it was not until the entry into force of the new Criminal Code of 1995 that the law made express provision for the possibility of applying prison benefits to all the sentences imposed, not to the maximum term to be served by law, and only in exceptional cases (Article 78 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 23 above).",

It notes, and the Government admit, that when a person was convicted and sentenced to more than one term of imprisonment, the prison authorities, with the agreement of the judicial authorities, generally considered that the limit provided for in Article 70 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (thirty years\u2019 imprisonment) became a sort of new, independent sentence to which prison benefits should be applied (see paragraph 41 above). The prison authorities thus took the approach that reductions of sentence should be determined with reference to this maximum term of thirty years. This approach is also found in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 8 March 1994 (see paragraph 25 above), which was the Supreme Court\u2019s first ruling on the subject, as well as in the practice of the Spanish courts when called upon to determine which was the most lenient criminal law following the entry into force of the Criminal Code of 1995, as pointed out by the dissenting judges in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment 197/2006 (see paragraph 29 above). Indeed, this approach was applied to numerous prisoners in situations similar to that of the applicant, having been convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973, whose remissions for work done were deducted from the maximum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 29 above).",

That practice gave the applicant a legitimate expectation while serving her prison sentence, particularly after the decisions of the Audiencia Nacional of 30 November 2000 (grouping the sentences together) and 15 February 2001 (setting 27 June 2017 as the date for her release), that the reductions of sentence to which she was entitled for the work done since 1987 would be applied to the maximum legal term of thirty years.",

In so doing, the Audiencia Nacional based itself on the new case-law established by the Supreme Court in its judgment 197/06, of 28 February 2006 (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above), which was pronounced long after the applicant had committed the offences and the decision to combine the sentences had been taken. The Court notes that in this new judgment the Supreme Court departed, by a majority, from the precedent it had set in 1994. For the majority of the judges the new method of calculating remission was more consistent with the actual wording of the provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973, which made a distinction between \u201cpenalties imposed\u201d and \u201csentence to be served\u201d (\u201ccondena\u201d).",

In such circumstances, even if the Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the calculation of remission as such falls outside the scope of Article 7, the way in which the provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973 were applied went beyond this. As the change of method used to calculate the sentence to be served had a significant impact on the effective length of the sentence, to the applicant\u2019s detriment, the Court considers that the distinction between the scope of the sentence imposed on the applicant and the manner of its execution was not immediately apparent (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 148).",

The Court considers it necessary, in order to ensure that the protection afforded by Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention remains effective, to examine whether the applicant could, if necessary after having consulted a lawyer, have foreseen that once the court had ordered the sentences to be combined, the domestic courts would adopt such an interpretation of the scope of the penalty imposed, having regard in particular to the judicial and administrative practice prior to the judgment of 28 February 2006 (see paragraph 54 above). In this respect the Court notes that the only relevant precedent cited in that judgment was that of 8 March 1994, in which the Supreme Court had taken the opposite approach, referring to Article 59 of the Prison Rules of 1981 in force at the time the applicant committed the offences. Furthermore, as the dissenting judges pointed out in the judgment of 25 February 2006, the other judgments cited, even though they applied the new Criminal Code of 1995, took a similar approach in considering the maximum legal term of imprisonment as a new, independent sentence (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above).",

In other words, the sentence the applicant was required to serve was increased to 30 years\u2019 effective imprisonment, on which the applicable remission to which she would previously have been entitled had no effect whatsoever. The Court observes that this change of case-law came about after the entry into force of the new Criminal Code of 1995, which did away with the system of reductions of sentence in exchange for work done (see paragraph 23 above) and introduced new, stricter rules on the calculation of remissions of sentence for offenders sentenced to multiple lengthy terms of imprisonment (see paragraph 23 above, Article\u00a078 of the Criminal Code of 1995 as amended by institutional law 7/2003). While the Court accepts that the States are free to amend their criminal policy, including by increasing the penalties applicable for criminal offences (see Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2006IV), it considers that the domestic courts must not, retroactively and to the detriment of the individual concerned, apply the spirit of legislative changes brought in after the offence was committed. The retroactive application of later criminal laws is permitted only when the change of law is more favourable to the accused (see Scoppola v.  (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, 17 September 2009).",

It had therefore been clear to the applicant that she would have to serve the different custodial sentences consecutively, up to the legal limit of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment, that is, until 7\u00a0July 2017. The Government considered that the applicable legal provisions had been sufficiently clear and precise to meet the required standards of \u201cquality of law\u201d. Relying on the Kafkaris judgment, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0120-121, they maintained that the fact that the prison authorities had proposed a certain date for the applicant\u2019s final release (2\u00a0July 2008) could not possibly have any incidence on the judgments by which she had been sentenced to over 3,000 years\u2019 imprisonment.

This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention see (Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 116, and M. v. Germany, no.\u00a019359/04, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2009). The \u201cquality of the law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. , 25\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996III). The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see M. v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 90, and Oshurko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a033108/05, \u00a7 98, 8 September 2011).",

In particular, she could not have foreseen, at the time when all her sentences were combined into one, that the method used to calculate remissions of sentence would change as a result of a departure from precedent by the Supreme Court in 2006, and that the new approach would be applied retroactively.",
