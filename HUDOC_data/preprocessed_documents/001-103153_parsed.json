Thus, the Court considers that the six months period in the instant case started running as from the date of the Court of Cassation's decision dated 25 December 2006 and that the application was introduced prior to that date, namely on 27 January 2006.

During this meeting the lawyer was able to ask the applicant if he needed anything and the applicant informed him that he wished to be represented by Mr H.D. during the trial. It is undisputed between the Parties that the applicant had no legal assistance before or when making his police statement or during the interrogation before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge. In this connection, the Court recalls that in its Salduz judgment ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55, 27\u00a0November 2008), it underlined the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial. In order for the right to a fair hearing to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires, as a rule, access to a lawyer as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the specific circumstances of the particular case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Having regard to the foregoing, and bearing in mind that the restriction imposed concerning access to a lawyer was systemic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no.\u00a03842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, the Court concludes that although the applicant met his lawyer during police custody, this meeting cannot be considered to have been sufficient by Convention standards (see, Fatma Tun\u00e7 v.  (no. 2), no. 18532/05, \u00a7\u00a014, 13 October 2009).",
