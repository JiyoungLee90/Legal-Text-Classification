The court doubted the authenticity of an employment certificate from a private company submitted by the applicant. Given that he had not produced any official documents confirming his employment, the court found that he had not proved that he had a permanent income. There was no evidence that the applicant had supported his children financially during the period since his separation from I. in February 2011 until October 2011, when the children had been living with their mother. He had started to pay child maintenance only after he had lodged his application for a residence order in October 2011. The applicant had moreover asked that the children\u2019s residence be fixed at his mother\u2019s address, which showed that he did not have any intention of taking care of them personally. It was clear from the audio recordings submitted by the applicant, as analysed by a psychologist, that the applicant had attempted to manipulate the children and to force them to make a choice between the parents. He was therefore willing to reach his aims by any means, even at the price of making his children suffer. He had moreover taken the children away from their home in Vladimir and brought them to his mother\u2019s residence in Shakhunya without I.\u2019s consent. According to witness statements, I. had always taken good care of the children. It was I. who had always accompanied them to school and extracurricular activities. The fact that she had a partial disability had never so far prevented her from raising them and caring for them. The fact that the applicant\u2019s living conditions were better was insufficient in itself for making a residence order in his favour. Nor was the court convinced by the applicant\u2019s assertion that the children had a stronger attachment to him than to their mother. The children had always lived with their mother, except for several weeks during the summer holidays when they had stayed with him at his mother\u2019s residence in Shakhunya. There was no evidence that I. had shouted or excessively punished the children. Although the experts had indeed found her manner of upbringing to be erratic, their report did not mention that she could cause detriment to their psychological development. Moreover, it was evident from the audio recordings that it was the applicant who had tried to turn the children against their mother. The childcare authorities had also considered that it was in the children\u2019s interest to live with the mother. Given that I. had never prevented the applicant from seeing the children, the applicant would be able to visit them as often as he liked, while the children would continue living in the environment familiar to them.",

The Regional Court held that, given that the children were under ten years old, their opinion on the residence issue could not be taken into account. As regards the expert report of 19 January 2012, it had been made in the framework of separate proceedings and had been already assessed by the courts in those proceedings.

They had been however repeatedly interviewed by the childcare authorities, which had established their relationship with each of the parents and their wishes as regards residence arrangements. The children had been moreover assessed in March 2013 by a psychologist, who had found that their psychological state had been good and that their relationship with their mother had been friendly and supportive (see paragraph 17 above).

That expert report had been moreover outdated and the judge had therefore decided to order a new expert examination of the children\u2019s relationship with each of the parents.

The Court accepts that, as it had been issued before the initial residence order of 20 February 2012, the expert report of 19\u00a0January 2012 was not relevant for the assessment of whether there were new circumstances warranting an overturning of that residence order. In such circumstances the domestic courts\u2019 decision to order a fresh expert report appears to have been reasonable. However a new expert examination could not have been performed because I. refused to be examined or to have the children examined. Faced with that difficulty, the domestic courts considered that it was not necessary to insist on obtaining an expert report as there was sufficient material for making a decision on the case (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). The Court observes in this connection that although the domestic courts did not interview the children personally (because of their young age), their relationship with each of the parents was assessed by the childcare authorities who had followed the family for some time and had repeatedly talked to the children and to both parents (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). On the basis of the childcare authorities\u2019 opinion, the domestic courts were able to reasonably consider that they had sufficient recent specialist information on the children\u2019s relationship with their parents and that an expert report on that issue was not necessary. In these circumstances the Court is not persuaded that the failure to obtain an expert report on the children\u2019s relations with each of the parents constituted a serious flaw in the proceedings (see, for a similar reasoning, Drenk, cited above, \u00a7 90, and Petersen v.

A judicial travel authorisation could be given only if one of the parents formally objected to the child\u2019s going abroad. He submitted examples of judicial practice to confirm his interpretation of domestic law. Given that the applicant had never lodged such an objection in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, the judicial travel authorisation had been unlawful and unnecessary. The fact that I. had been able to leave Russia before the judicial travel authorisation had become enforceable had clearly demonstrated that such an authorisation had not been required for leaving Russia. It had been required however for obtaining a German visa, which had been ultimately granted by the German authorities on the basis of the judicial travel authorisation, even though it had not yet entered into force. In such circumstances the refusal of the applicant\u2019s application for interim measures without any valid reason which had resulted in the children\u2019s permanent departure to Germany had violated his right to maintain contact with his children and the children\u2019s right to maintain contact with their father.

Article 8 requires that the domestic authorities should strike a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the parents and that, in the balancing process, primary importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see Sahin, cited above, \u00a7 66, and P\u0142aza v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a018830/07, \u00a7 71, 25 January 2011).",

He therefore both complains about what the State did and did not do. The Court reiterates in this connection that the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not always lend themselves to precise definition; nonetheless, the applicable principles are similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests (see Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2007V).",

The courts which examined the applicant\u2019s case found that such an authorisation was necessary and proceeded to issue it. The Court reiterates in this connection that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. The \u201claw\u201d is therefore the enactment in force as the competent courts have interpreted it. While the Court should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 8, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law, except in cases of flagrant nonobservance or arbitrariness (see Goranova-Karaeneva v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a012739/05, \u00a7\u00a046, 8\u00a0March 2011; Galovi\u0107 v.

The Court cannot discern any such flagrant non-observance or arbitrariness in the present case. It accepts that the interpretation of the relevant legislation by the courts in the applicant\u2019s case was not such as to render the contested decisions unlawful in the Convention terms (compare Kazakov v. Russia, no.\u00a01758/02, \u00a7 24, 18 December 2008).",

The domestic courts considered that a trip to Germany would be beneficial to their development, education and broad-mindedness and found no reasons to prevent such a trip. They found that in that instance the children\u2019s right to travel outweighed the applicant\u2019s interest in maintaining weekly contact with them. It is significant that the trip was supposed to last no more than three months and that the domestic courts specifically indicated a timelimit within which the children should return to Russia. The Court is not persuaded that at that time the domestic courts could have foreseen that the children would not return. Indeed, although the applicant referred \u2013 briefly and without any detail \u2013 to the risk of non-return, he did not substantiate the fears which he might have had in that connection with objective evidence (compare Diamante and Pelliccioni v. San Marino, no.\u00a032250/08, \u00a7 185, 27\u00a0September 2011). In view of the above, the Court finds that the decisions of the domestic courts, clearly showing that it was the interests of the children which were considered paramount, were based on relevant and sufficient reasons (compare Petersen, cited above).",
