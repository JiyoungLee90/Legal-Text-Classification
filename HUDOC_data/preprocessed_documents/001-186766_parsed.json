In particular, they pointed out that the applicants\u2019 attacks had been aimed at two judges of the Regional Commercial Court and, given the special role of the judiciary in society, it had been necessary for the State to protect them. On the other hand, the applicants had not been journalists. Nor had they acted as private persons. The applicants had been members of the Bar and their status had imposed certain restrictions on their conduct. The disbarment proceedings had been carried out in accordance with law. The national courts had thoroughly examined the applicants\u2019 argument and had established that their conduct had been incompatible with Bar membership. The complaints lodged by the applicants had contained rude and indiscreet expressions. The allegations that the Deputy President of the Regional Commercial Court and the lawyer S. had had an extraprofessional relationship had been unsubstantiated and false and had demonstrated disrespect towards the judiciary. The interference with the applicants\u2019 rights had pursued a legitimate aim of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. Lastly, the Government submitted that interference with the applicants\u2019 rights had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The applicants had had their own agenda of promoting their supporter to the position of President of the Bar. They had attempted to exert undue pressure on the judiciary and the then President of the Bar. The applicants\u2019 effort had been aimed at disseminating untruths about the judges among the judicial authorities and beyond. The sanction imposed on the applicants should not be considered extremely harsh. Having made false accusations against the judges of the commercial court, the applicants had demonstrated blatant disrespect towards the judiciary. Accordingly their disbarment had been proportionate to their conduct. As regards the second applicant, the Government submitted that, having joined a bar in another region, she had continued to practise law. Accordingly, her disbarment had not prevented her from pursuing her professional activities.",

The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that it was commensurate with the seriousness of the applicants\u2019 behaviour, considering the alternatives available (see paragraph 22 above). Neither the Bar nor the national judicial authorities assessed the adequacy of the disciplinary sanction imposed or furnished any reason justifying their decision to apply the heaviest penalty.",
