There had been Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The armed men who had abducted Aslambek Ismailov, Aslan Ismailov, Yaragi Ismailov, Khizir Ismailov and Yusi Daydayev spoke Russian without accent, which proved that they were not of Chechen origin. The men had arrived in military vehicles, such as APCs, which could only have been deployed at the time by representatives of the State.

The men acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. All the information disclosed from the criminal investigation file supported their assertion as to the involvement of State agents in the abduction.

The investigation in case no. 44009 was instituted on 17 January 2003, which is three days after the abduction of Aslambek Ismailov, Aslan Ismailov, Yaragi Ismailov, Khizir Ismailov and Yusi Daydayev. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were not taken at all. The Court notes that the investigators had not questioned the district military commander or other commanding officers of the local power structures about possible participation of their servicemen in the abduction; they had not established the identity of the owners of the APCs used by the abductors; they had failed to elucidate the discrepancies in the witness statements concerning the movement of the APCs on the night of the abduction (see paragraphs 43, 48 and 51 above). In addition, it does not appear that the investigators took tangible measures to verify the information concerning the detention of the abducted men on the ORB's premises in Grozny (see paragraphs 53, 54, 61 above) or that they tried to identify and question colonel L.Ch. (see paragraph 58 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).]",

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to adjourn were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

Their detention was not acknowledged, was not logged in any custody records and there exists no official trace of their subsequent whereabouts or fate.

Furthermore, the absence of detention records noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee, as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

Having regard to its above conclusions, it finds that there is a direct causal link between the violation of Article\u00a02 in respect of the applicants' relatives and the loss by the applicants of the financial support which they could have provided. Having regard to the applicants' submissions and the fact that Aslambek Ismailov, Aslan Ismailov, Yaragi Ismailov, Khizir Ismailov and Yusi Daydayev were not employed at the time of their abduction, the Court awards EUR\u00a013,000 to the first applicant; EUR 10,000 to the second, third and fourth applicants jointly; EUR 1,500 to the fifth applicant and EUR 10,000 to the eighth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first applicants jointly in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on these amounts.",
