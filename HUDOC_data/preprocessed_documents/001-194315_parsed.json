According to the text in force as from 8 May 2006 (Law no. 66-FZ of 8\u00a0May 2006), the State was to ensure that servicemen be provided with housing or monetary funds to allow them to purchase housing in accordance with the procedure and under the conditions set by the federal laws and regulations. Construction and purchase of housing for servicemen was performed by the federal executive authorities at the expense of the federal budget. A right to be provided with State housing is granted to servicemen only once.

The Court reiterates its settled approach that any dispute concerning the proper method of enforcement and full and appropriate compliance with a judgment must be first foremost examined by domestic courts (see Gerasimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0173). However, in the present case the applicant\u2019s appeal against both the removal from the housing list and the dismissal without housing provision was examined by the first-instance court and rejected as belated (see paragraph\u00a021 above). As his subsequent appeals were disallowed owing to his failure to comply with formal requirements, that decision became final. With reference to those proceedings, domestic courts at two instances further ordered to terminate the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph\u00a034 and 35 above). In any event, the Court does not need to examine the issue of either the legal status of the flat in Shchemilovo or the applicant\u2019s entitlement to State housing, for the following reasons.",

As regards the subsequent period, the Court notes that in 2017 the domestic court confirmed that the possibility to enforce the judgment had not been lost at the material time (see paragraph\u00a031 above). The defendant did not appeal against that decision which accordingly became final. Instead, the debtor authority chose to introduce a new request for termination of the enforcement with military courts, which granted it on 21\u00a0April 2018 (see paragraphs\u00a034 and 35 above). Without delving into the issue of an alleged discrepancy between the courts\u2019 conclusions in those two sets of proceedings, the Court finds it sufficient to note that at least by 21\u00a0April 2018, when the authority\u2019s request to discontinue the enforcement was granted by the first instance court, the judgment of 17\u00a0February 2010 in the applicant\u2019s favour had already remained without execution for more than eight years, and its enforceability was confirmed by the final domestic court\u2019s decision in 2017 (see paragraphs\u00a031 and 32 above; see, mutatis mutandis, Kotsar v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a025971/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 29\u00a0January 2009, and Anankin and Others, no.\u00a079757/12, \u00a7\u00a062, 22\u00a0January 2019). Accordingly, the period until at least 21 April 2018 is attributable to the authorities and is clearly in breach of the Convention requirements (see Gerasimov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171).",

That statute, which entered into force on 1\u00a0January 2017, enables those concerned to seek compensation for damage sustained as a result of excessive delays in the enforcement of court judgments ordering the domestic authorities to fulfil various obligations in kind (see Kamneva and Others v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), nos.\u00a035555/05 and 6\u00a0others, 2\u00a0May 2017).
