For the Court, this ten-month period of inactivity is irreconcilable with the requisite \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in such cases (cf. Toth v. Austria, op.cit., \u00a7\u00a7 74 to 78), especially in view of the fact that the applicant's detention had already exceeded one year and three months when the bill of indictment was preferred. This grievance could not be remedied by the diligence which the authorities displayed afterwards, during the trial period.
