According to the Government, this had been clear since 3 October 2003, when the Constitutional Court published its decision no. U-III-402/2002 of 12 September 2003 in the Official Gazette. The Government thus considered, citing the Court\u2019s case-law in De Parias Merry v. Spain (dec.), no. 40177/98, ECHR 1999II, that the applicants, by relying on the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision as the final domestic decision and by lodging their application with the Court on 3 February 2011, had failed to comply with the six-month time-limit.",

Thus, it could not be said that the judgment of the Zagreb County Court was not liable to a review before the Constitutional Court. In the applicants\u2019 view, this had been so given that the practice of the courts had been evolving and it had always been possible for the Constitutional Court to take their complaint into examination. The applicants considered that by refusing to do so the Constitutional Court had acted contrary to the Constitution and the Convention and had allowed a manifest breach of the right to a fair trial to persist.

Finally, it should ensure the possibility of ascertaining the facts of the case before the chance to do so fades away, making a fair examination of the question at issue next to impossible (see Kelly v. the United Kingdom, no. 10626/83, Commission decision of 7\u00a0May 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 42, p.\u00a0205; Baybora and Others v.

Accordingly, whenever an applicant lodged a constitutional complaint by relying on that provision complaining of a violation that fell within its substantive scope, the Court considered, irrespective of the possible decision of the Constitutional Court, that it did not amount to an unreasonable use of that remedy (see, for example, Dolenec, cited above, \u00a7 200; Remetin, cited above, \u00a7 83; Grega\u010devi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 41; and \u0160imecki, cited above, \u00a7 33).",
