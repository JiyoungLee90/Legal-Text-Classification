The applicant's lawyer had been aware that the proceedings had been instituted since 6 August 1993; he had been given a power of attorney on 11\u00a0August 1993 and had submitted the request to produce evidence on 16\u00a0August 1993. Thus, he had had enough time to prepare his arguments.  The court indicated that it had requested the Ministry of Internal Affairs to produce the documents requested by the applicant. On 20 August 1993 the Ministry had refused to do so as those documents were subject to official secrecy and could only be produced in court in criminal proceedings, in accordance with the Bureau of State Security Act. The court further observed that it could not call the witnesses proposed by the applicant; they could only have given evidence as to whether S. N. had been put on the list of informants prepared by the Ministry, but not as to whether S. N had in fact been an informant. Moreover, in view of the serious nature of the allegations advanced against S.N. by the applicant's newspaper, in the absence of any documentary evidence these allegations could not have been considered proved, even if they had been confirmed by the witnesses. Thus, as the applicant had not adduced any other evidence to prove that the information concerning S. N. was true, the court found against him.",

Furthermore, the applicant's interests could not be protected properly as he did not have sufficient time to prepare his arguments between the date of receipt of the summons and the date of the hearing.

The court considered that the complaint concerning the summons was unfounded.  Both the applicant and his lawyer had been summoned one day before the hearing, which was justified, given the special nature of the proceedings under Article 139 of the Election Act. The court recalled that, although this provision provided for such cases to be decided within 48 hours, failure to do so did not oblige the court to deal with the case according to the normal procedures for contentious civil proceedings laid down in the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Moreover, the applicant, being aware of the special nature of the proceedings, should have expected that he might be summoned from one day to the next and should have taken effective measures to ensure that the summons reached him in time. These considerations were especially relevant as the applicant was represented by a lawyer who was under a professional obligation to take appropriate measures to this end. In any event, the lawyer received the summons in time to appear at the hearing, even though he contended, unconvincingly, that he had learned about the date of the hearing from a journalist. ",

However, this request had been refused. In the light of Article 12 of the Bureau of State Security Act, the refusal had to be considered lawful. Moreover, the very fact that an individual's name had been included in the list prepared by the Ministry could not be deemed proof that this person had in fact been an informant. The veracity of information contained in the list had been repeatedly called into question both by interested parties and, more widely, in numerous press articles. It had been emphasised that the list had been prepared and used as a weapon in a political battle, intended to discredit the persons concerned. Therefore, the veracity of a claim that a particular person had been a police informant could not possibly be established solely on the basis of the list itself and without prior verification of the list and, in particular, without some legally established means whereby the rights of persons branded as police informants could be defended. The court accordingly considered that the burden of proof lay with the defendant, who had failed to demonstrate that, at the time of the publication of the information at issue, he had possessed sufficient evidence that S.N. had been an informant as alleged.",

In certain cases the courts held that an analysis of Article 139 read together with the general principle of Article 6 of the Civil Code led to the conclusion that the burden of proof, in cases in which the information concerning a candidate was harmful to his or her good reputation, lay on the person who had published the information in question. The courts argued that in such cases the approach taken in Article 24 of the Civil Code should be followed, in that there was a presumption that attacks on the personal rights of the plaintiff were unlawful. Consequently, it fell to the defendant to prove their lawfulness, in particular by pointing out that the information published about the plaintiff, and which was deemed to be harmful to him or her, was true. Thus the plaintiff was exempted from the obligation to demonstrate that the allegations against him were untrue (the Kielce Regional Court, I Ns 60/93, Dec. of 11.09.1993; the Krakow Court of Appeal, I Acz 406/93, Dec.  of 16.09.1993).

It notes, firstly, that this Article did not impose a blanket prohibition on the disclosure of such information, but limited such disclosure to proceedings of a criminal nature. The applicant was or should have been aware that any documents containing such information were covered by official secrecy and that they could not be disclosed in court in proceedings other than criminal proceedings. Moreover, the Court also observes that the Regional Court did not reject de plano the applicant's request for documentary evidence to be admitted, but first requested the Ministry of Internal Affairs to submit the relevant documents to the court. Thus it cannot be held  against the court that it had failed to consider the applicant's request to admit evidence.  ",

These requests were subsequently refused. In the first-instance decision of 25 August 1993 the Regional Court observed that it would not call the witnesses proposed by the applicant; they could only have given evidence as to whether S.N. had been put on the list of informants prepared by the Ministry, but not as to whether S. N had in fact been an informant. Moreover, the court added that in view of the serious nature of the allegations advanced against S.N. by the applicant's newspaper and in the absence of any documentary evidence, these allegations could not have been verified by witness evidence alone. Thus, as the applicant had not adduced any other evidence to prove that the information concerning S. N. was true, the court found against him. ",

Belgium judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32-33, \u00a7 32; the Edwards v. the United Kingdom judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247-B, \u00a7\u00a034).  In the circumstances of the present case, the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts examined the applicant's requests to have witnesses called and gave detailed reasons for their refusals, which, in the Court's view, were not tainted by arbitrariness.  For these reasons, the refusal to take evidence proposed by the applicant did not amount to a disproportionate restriction on his ability to present arguments in support of his case in the proceedings.
