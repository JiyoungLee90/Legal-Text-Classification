In the Court\u2019s view, any request for release, in such circumstances, would be limited to the purely hypothetical question of whether the person could be released if he was not already serving a prison sentence. Therefore, even if the applicant\u2019s continued detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) ceased to be reasonable, it would not automatically cease to be lawful and justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) (see Kushnir v.
