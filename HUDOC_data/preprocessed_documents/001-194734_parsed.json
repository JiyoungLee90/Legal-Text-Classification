The second public auction was held shortly thereafter, but it was prematurely terminated owing to the disturbances caused by Borac-R\u2019s attorney (see paragraph 25 above). The Government have not provided any information suggesting that the domestic authorities reacted in any way to that behaviour or used the measures available to them to discipline the participants in the proceedings and ensure that the auction was completed (see, mutatis mutandis, Georgiy Nikolayevich Mikhaylov v. Russia, no.\u00a04543/04, \u00a7 68, 1 April 2010). There was a further delay of nine months before the continuation of the second auction (see paragraph 28 above). The Court cannot accept the argument, put forward by the Constitutional Court and repeated by the Government (see paragraphs 58 and 79 above), that the repeated burglaries had prevented the authorities from holding the auctions sooner. It took more than one year and ten months to order a new inventory of the movable property belonging to Borac-R (see paragraphs 31-40 above).",
