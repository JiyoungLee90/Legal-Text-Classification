However, the Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51; also see Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a081, 26 July 2001). This is particularly true in cases, such as the present one, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 was determined by the prosecution without judicial control of the issue whether collected evidence supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the imputed offence (see Rokhlina v.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067; Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85).",

Such assessment should be based on personal circumstances of the detainee. In the present case, the domestic courts did not point to any aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that she presented a persistent flight risk. The applicant, on the other hand, constantly invoked the facts mitigating the risk of her absconding. However, the domestic courts devoted no attention to discussion of the applicant\u2019s arguments that she had no criminal record, had a permanent place of residence and employment in Vladimir, a stable way of life, two minor children, and that her father had been seriously ill. They did not address the fact that the applicant had had an opportunity to flee after the search of her flat but she had remained at the investigator\u2019s disposal.

The Court accepts that at the initial stages of the investigation the risk of interference with justice by the applicant could justify keeping her in custody. However, after the evidence had been collected, that ground became irrelevant. Moreover, the domestic authorities gave no reasons why they believed that there was such a risk. The Government referred to the records of the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations and submitted that she could intimidate witnesses or forge evidence. The Court reiterates that it is not its task to take the place of the national authorities who ruled on the applicant\u2019s detention and to supply its own analysis of facts arguing for or against detention (see Nikolov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7\u00a074, 30\u00a0January 2003; Labita, cited above, \u00a7 152).

In this connection the Court recalls that Article 5 \u00a7 3 obliges the \u201cofficer\u201d to hear himself the accused, to examine all the facts militating for and against pre-trial detention and to set out in the decision on detention the facts upon which that decision is based (see Hood v. the  [GC], no. 27267/95, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR 1999I; Schiesser v.

Therefore, the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention without hearing her opinion, giving her an opportunity to comment on the materials submitted by the prosecutor and having proper regard to her arguments in favour of the release is incompatible with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

However, in the present case the Court cannot but disagree with the Government\u2019s assertion that the applicant\u2019s refusal to testify slowed the proceedings down and generated delays which were attributable to her. The applicant was not obliged to co-operate with the authorities and she cannot be blamed for having taken full advantage of her right to silence (see, mutadis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v.

Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2005...., with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties.

See also paragraph 12 of the facts of the case). Given the fact that the appeal court attached particular importance to the applicant\u2019s character, her appearance in person could have assisted the appeal court to assess with more clarity this issue, and could have given the opportunity to the applicant to defend her position effectively (See, mutatis mutandis, Grauzinis v.\u00a0Lithuania, paragraph 34).",

We think that complaints of a person about conditions of detention, although they may establish a ground of invocation and/or violation of Article 3 of the Convention, do not enter into the ambit of protection of Article 5, paragraph 4, which entitles everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention to take proceedings \u201cby which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if detention is not lawful\u201d.",

The terms \u201clawfulness\u201d and \u201clawful\u201d have been constantly interpreted as to include only procedural guarantees contained in national law or the Convention, and not the substantive conditions of detention. After all, the examination of the lawfulness is not an abstract exercise, but is linked to the demand of the release of a detained person, if the detention proves not to be lawful; and we very much doubt that the consequence of a judicial decision, in the event that the conditions of detention are not in conformity with internal or international standards, is the release of a detained person. Obviously such a complaint, if accepted by the courts, could lead to a change of the conditions of detention, but not to a release. Hence an invocation of these conditions by a detained person cannot constitute a ground for the applicability of Article 5 paragraph 4, although, admittedly it falls under the protection of other articles of the Convention.",
