It acknowledges that, in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080 and\u00a081, 26\u00a0July 2001). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone, or in conjunction with the other grounds relied on by the authorities, cannot constitute a \u201crelevant and sufficient ground\u201d for holding the applicant in detention for a considerably long period of over 4 years and 10 months.",

Firstly, it notes that the judicial authorities appeared to presume the risk of tampering with evidence or the obstruction of the proceedings, based on the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant and on the nature of the offences in question (see paragraphs 5-8 and\u00a011 above). It notes however that the relevant decisions did not put forward any argument capable of showing that these fears were well-founded. The Court considers that such a generally formulated risk flowing from the nature of the offences with which the applicant was charged may possibly be accepted as the basis for his detention at the initial stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, in the absence of any other factor capable of showing that the risk relied on actually existed, the Court cannot accept those grounds as a justification for holding the applicant in custody for the entire relevant period.",

Indeed, that provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Neumeister v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a08, p.\u00a03, \u00a7 3; and Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.

Nor did they mention any factor indicating that there was a real risk of his absconding or obstructing the proceedings. In that regard the Court would also point out that, although such a potential danger may exist where an accused is charged with a serious offence and where the sentence faced is a long term of imprisonment, the degree of that risk cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the offence and anticipated sentence (see Muller v.\u00a0France, judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p.\u00a0388,, \u00a7 43).",
