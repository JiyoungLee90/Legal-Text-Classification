On the first point the Court reiterates that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, the domestic authorities\u2019 findings as regards the failure to apply for refugee status in due time do not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention (see Ermakov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 43165/10, \u00a7 196, 7 November 2013). On the second point, the Court emphasises that the criteria laid down for granting refugee status are not identical to those that are used for assessing the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant made detailed submissions about the risk of being subjected to ill-treatment if he were returned to his home country, relying on information from various international organisations and on the judgments of this Court.

However, they did not provide information regarding any other country willing to accept him. The Court observes, moreover, that the expulsion proceedings were initiated by the prosecutor\u2019s request directly referring to the \u201cdate of [the applicant\u2019s] actual handing over to the competent authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan\u201d (see paragraph 17 above).

Thus, his situation is no different from that of other Muslims who, on account of practising their religion outside official institutions and guidelines, are charged with religious extremism or membership of banned religious organisations and, on that account, as noted in the reports and the Court\u2019s judgments cited above, are at an increased risk of ill-treatment (see, in particular, Ermakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0203).",

It has also been the Court\u2019s established position that the diplomatic assurances are likewise incapable, on their own, to prevent the risk of ill-treatment from materialising and that the national authorities need to treat with caution the assurances against torture given by a State where torture is endemic or persistent (see Yuldashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01248/09, \u00a7\u00a085, 8 July 2010, with further references).

That review should be capable of leading, where appropriate, to release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Muminov, cited above, \u00a7 113, and Ismoilov and Others v.

The thrust of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 was not directed against the initial decision placing him in custody but rather against his inability to obtain a judicial review of his detention after a certain lapse of time. Detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) lasts, as a rule, for a significant period and depends on circumstances which are subject to change over time. Given that since the delivery of the City Court\u2019s appeal judgment of 22 November 2013 the applicant has spent more than a year in custody, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen during that period. In such circumstances the Court considers that the requirement under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 was neither incorporated in the initial detention order of 18 October 2013 nor fulfilled by the appeal court (see Rakhimov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 50552/13, \u00a7\u00a0147).",

However, it was not until six months later that the prosecutor instituted expulsion proceedings against him.

Moreover, the relevant provisions were open to the interpretation that by the expiry of that two-year time-limit the applicant would again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground. Lastly, the applicant claimed that such a long stay in detention significantly exceeded the maximum custodial sentence permissible under the Code of Administrative Offences and that his detention pending expulsion was of a punitive, rather than preventive, nature.",

The Court reiterates that in Azimov it found that a decision ordering the applicant\u2019s detention pending expulsion had served to circumvent the maximum time-limits laid down in the domestic law for detention pending extradition (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0165).

Under Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, an expulsion decision must be enforced within two years (see paragraph\u00a027 above). Thus, after the expiry of such a period, a detainee should be released. This may happen in the present case; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences for the applicant\u2019s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting the duration of detention of an illegal alien is not set out clearly in the law. It is also unclear what will happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Egamberdiyev, \u00a7\u00a062, and Azimov, \u00a7 171, both cited above).",
