The court considered that the question of permissibility of a railway project was within the power of the Government, which had to take into account public interests such as environmental, industrial, economic and regional policy. The Government\u2019s permissibility decision was binding for the subsequent proceedings in that courts and other decision-making bodies could not examine issues that had been determined by that decision. Thus, in the proceedings concerning the construction permits requested by the NRA, the various instances could decide on conditions and other details but not on the general permissibility as defined in the Government\u2019s decision. Similarly, in the third stage of the decision process \u2013 the adoption of the railway plan \u2013 it was for the authorities and courts to decide only on the precise location of the railway, within the area designated by the Government\u2019s decision.

The fact that the court, on 1 December 2004, had concluded that no individual petitioner could be considered to have locus standi in relation to the permissibility decision did not compel it to include in its current examination of the adoption of the railway plan the issues of permissibility of the project or its general location.",

However, the other issues raised by the applicants, in particular the effects of the railway project on their homes and land, related to their \u201ccivil rights\u201d.

Given the binding nature of the Government\u2019s permissibility decision on the later proceedings \u2013 as confirmed by the judgments and decisions taken in regard to construction permits and the adoption of the railway plan \u2013 it would seem natural for discontented property owners to challenge that very decision by the only means available, a petition for judicial review. However, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the petition without an examination of its merits in respect of all petitioners. The reason for the dismissal was not that the court found itself incompetent to rule on such a petition or that the particulars of the individual property owners were such that they lacked a justifiable interest in having a judicial review of the Government\u2019s decision. Instead, the Supreme Administrative Court considered that it could not be assessed with any certainty who would be sufficiently affected by the railway project until the railway plan had been drafted. In other words, it was too early to determine who would be entitled to bring a legal action against the Government\u2019s decision.

It would not have made any difference if all applicants had joined that petition. The same goes for the subsequent proceedings relating to construction permits. Whether or not it was at all possible to have an assessment of the impact of the railway project on the enjoyment of individual homes and property in these proceedings, it is clear that the environmental courts found themselves bound by the Government\u2019s permissibility decision and limited their examination to more general environmental issues.

Sweden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-52, and Marinkovic v. Sweden (dec.), no. 43570/10, \u00a7 43, 10 December 2013, and \u2013 in regard to the domestic case-law developments \u2013 the latter decision, \u00a7\u00a7 21-31). However, this remedy, which introduced a general principle of law that compensation for Convention violations can be ordered without direct support in Swedish law, was established after the present application had been lodged on 4 June 2009. The assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally carried out with reference to the date on which the application was lodged to the Court. The question arises whether the applicants should still be obliged to make use of this remedy, for which the limitation period has not yet expired. Such an obligation may exceptionally exist, depending on the particular circumstances of each case (see, for example, Brusco v.  (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001-IX, and Andrei Georgiev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a061507/00, \u00a7 78, 26 July 2007). In this respect, it should be noted that the domestic developments have been gradual and set out in case-law with no specific reference to the type of case or situation in which the applicants have been involved. Moreover, the various domestic proceedings relating to the construction of the railway in question lasted for nine years, from 1999 to 2008. In these circumstances, it would not be reasonable to expect the applicants to turn again to the domestic courts or to the Chancellor of Justice to make use of a remedy established after the introduction of the present application. Consequently, there are no exceptional circumstances in the instant case which would justify a departure from the general rule that the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies is assessed with reference to the time when the application was lodged to the Court. It has not been shown that, at that time, there was case-law demonstrating that compensation for Convention violations could be awarded for a lack of access to court. Nor had a compensation remedy of general applicability been established yet.",

Nevertheless, the courts in the subsequent proceedings, including the Supreme Administrative Court when it examined the railway plan in 2008, found, in accordance with the applicable rules, that they were bound by the Government\u2019s permissibility decision, and accordingly did not examine any issues that had been determined by that decision.",
