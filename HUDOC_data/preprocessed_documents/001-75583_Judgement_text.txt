The case originated in an application (no. 7497/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Viktor Nikolayevich Kryachkov (“the applicant”), on 15 September 2001.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs V. Lutkovska.
On 2 July 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 1 April 2006 this case was assigned to the newly constituted Fifth Section (Rule 25 § 5 and Rule 52 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in the town of Makyyvka, the  region.
The applicant is an employee of the State Joint Stock Company “Mine Zuyevska”.
In 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings in the  against his employer seeking recovery of salary arrears and compensation.
On 6 November 2000 the court found for the applicant and ordered the company to pay him UAH 860.90 (around 142 euros – “EUR”). The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 17 November 2000.
On 6 December 2000 the Zhdanivskyi Local Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings.
According to the Government, by two instalments of 16 and 18 September 2003, the full amount awarded by the judgment was transferred to the applicant’s bank account. The applicant did not contest this fact.
In 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Khartsyzk Town Court against his employer seeking recovery of salary arrears and higher sums of disability benefits, which had been allegedly incorrectly calculated by the defendant.
On 7 May 2001 the court found in part for the applicant. The court ordered the company to pay the applicant UAH 975.94 (around 161 euros – “EUR”) in salary arrears and UAH 590 (around 98 euros – “EUR”) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and rejected the applicant’s claim for higher sums of disability benefits.
The applicant did not appeal in cassation against this judgment, as he did not trust the higher judicial authorities.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).
