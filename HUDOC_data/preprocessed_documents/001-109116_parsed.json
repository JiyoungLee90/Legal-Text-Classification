This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq.). Consideration is often given to the date of commencement of investigations, delays in taking statements (see Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000-VI, and Tekin v.\u00a0Turkey, 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, \u00a7 67), and the length of time taken to complete the initial investigation (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7\u00a037, 18 October 2001). There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. More specifically, as regards involvement of a victim, in order to ensure sufficiency of public scrutiny, victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC], no. 26307/95, \u00a7 225, ECHR\u00a02004III).",

The decision to discontinue proceedings was quashed on 3 May 1999 for failure to investigate the applicant\u2019s allegations sufficiently (see paragraph 20 above). However, the ensuing proceedings were suspended as the suspects could not be established (see paragraph 20 above). They were reinitiated one month later, on 26 November 1999, but terminated on 20 January 1999, on the same grounds as before, i.e. for lack of corpus delicti in the actions of the police officers (see paragraph 21 above). It is only after a resolution of the first instance court of 6 April 2000, which again established that the investigation was incomplete, that the proceedings were again resumed on 12 May 2000. On 30 May 2000 they were again discontinued for the same reasons as criticised by the first instance court and prosecutor\u2019s office before (see paragraph 23 above). Later, on 10 July 2000 the investigation was again reinitiated and discontinued on 14 December 2000 again as there was no evidence of a crime (see paragraph 25 above). The Court notes in this respect that discontinuance of the proceedings for insufficiency and lack of proper investigation resulted from the shortcomings in the initial investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaints (see paragraph 44 above).",

In particular, the investigation was renewed on 7 April 2001 and lasted until August 2001, when it was again discontinued on account of a lack of corpus delicti and the grounds for initiating criminal proceedings were reclassified (see paragraph 27 above). On 14 and 19 January 2002 all the resolutions adopted in the course of the investigation were quashed by the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office and investigation after remittal lasted from 1 to 27\u00a0February 2002, when the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office again discontinued proceedings against the police officers as it found no evidence of abuse of power or illegal infliction of injuries on the applicant (see paragraph 28 above). The proceedings were reinstituted on 6 March 2002 and discontinued on 23 August 2002 as the investigation found no evidence of a crime (see paragraph 29 above). The proceedings were again reinstituted on 28\u00a0November 2002 and the proceedings on the charges of bodily injuries were discontinued on account of the expiration of the statutory limitation period on 19 December 2002 by the court (see paragraph 31 above). The new additional investigation had been ordered on 10 October 2003, after judicial review by the court of appeal, and lasted from 27 June to 10\u00a0October 2003, when the proceedings were discontinued again due to lack of corpus delicti (see paragraphs 33 \u2013 34 above). Thus, the Court notes that the resolutions discontinuing the investigation were repeatedly quashed and the proceedings re-initiated because of a lack of proper findings of fact and serious deficiencies in the conduct of the investigation, which were established by the hierarchically superior prosecutors and courts of two instances on at least nine occasions (see paragraphs 20 - 22, 24, 16 - 27, 30, 33 and 35 above).",

It has not been contested that by 2004, the proceedings still remained unfinished and the investigation incomplete for almost 7 years after entry of the Convention into force with respect to Ukraine. It considers that the present case is similar to other judgments against Ukraine where it has already found a breach of the procedural limb of Article 3 of the Convention as the respective investigations were initiated with substantial delay, there were delays in the medical examination of the victim and the investigation was repeatedly re-initiated because of failure of the investigating authorities to adequately establish the facts of the case and due to serious errors in the conduct of the investigation, which were repetitively acknowledged by the domestic authorities themselves (see, among many other authorities, Davydov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 17674/02 and 39081/02, \u00a7 162, 1 July 2010; Kucheruk v. Ukraine, no. 2570/04, \u00a7 162, ECHR 2007X; Oleksiy Mykhaylovych Zakharkin v.

The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the above reasoning its previous case-law on the matter and its findings in similar cases. In these circumstances it is not necessary to consider the further course of the proceedings (see paragraphs 4 and 35 above).",
