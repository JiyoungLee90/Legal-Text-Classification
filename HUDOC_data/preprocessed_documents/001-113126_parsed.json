The authorities blamed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU) and the Islamist Hizb-ut-Tahrir party, all banned in , for the attacks and killings. Among the scores detained as suspected members or sympathizers of the IMU, the IJU and Hizb-ut-Tahrir in 2009 were people who attended unregistered mosques, studied under independent imams, had travelled abroad, or were suspected of affiliation to banned Islamic groups. Many were believed to have been detained without charge or trial for lengthy periods. There were reports of torture and unfair trials.",

In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d.

So, the extradition proceedings were thereby temporarily suspended pursuant to the request made by the Court and were, nevertheless, in progress (see, for a similar approach, Al Hanchi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51, and Al Husin v. , no. 3727/08, \u00a7\u00a7 67-69, 7 February 2012, both concerning longer periods of detention, albeit, in a deportation context).",

However, the implementation of an interim measure following an indication by the Court to a State Party that it should not, until further notice, return an individual to a particular country does not in itself have any bearing on whether the deprivation of liberty to which that individual may be subjected complies with Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v.

Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 124, 9\u00a0July\u00a02009). Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2005-XII). The requirement of procedural fairness under Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not impose a uniform, unvarying standard to be applied irrespective of the context, facts and circumstances (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7 203, 19 February 2009).

However, the implementation of an interim measure following an indication by the Court to a State Party that it should not, until further notice, return an individual to a particular country does not in itself have any bearing on whether the deprivation of liberty to which that individual may be subjected complies with Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no.\u00a025389/05, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2007II). In other words, the domestic authorities must still act in strict compliance with domestic law (ibid., \u00a7 75).",

Thus, as indicated in the judgment, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention will be acceptable only for as long as extradition proceedings are in progress. It is clear, however, that in the present case those proceedings ended in March 2011 and that the applicant\u2019s subsequent detention for eight months was not required for those purposes. In my opinion, in these circumstances the length of the period under consideration was excessive. I therefore voted for a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of the length of the applicant\u2019s detention with a view to extradition.",
