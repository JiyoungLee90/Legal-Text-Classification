The case originated in an application (no. 16477/13) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Gábor László Nagy (“the applicant”), on 3 March 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Hegedűs, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 9 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Balástya.
On 11 July 2008 the applicant’s divorced wife brought an action against him seeking the termination of his custody rights.
On 29 June 2011 the Pest Central District Court rearranged the applicant’s access rights and dismissed the remainder of the action. The court relied in particular on the opinion of an expert psychologist.
On 4 July 2012 the Budapest High Court upheld this judgment (service: 3 September 2012).
