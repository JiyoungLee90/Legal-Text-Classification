These working groups consisted of experts and \u201cspecialists\u201d of the relevant State authorities, most of whom were employees of the Centre of Forensic Science of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the State Register of Immovable Property and other agencies. Before taking up their duties as working group members, they had been trained by experts with the \u201cappropriate knowledge and experience in the relevant field\u201d. Secondly, the electoral law required that a working group meeting had to be open to the public, that the nominated candidate be given the opportunity to attend if he wished to do so, and that the working group\u2019s documents on the results of examination of signature sheets be made available to the nominated candidate twenty-four hours before the electoral commission met to decide whether to register the candidate. Thirdly, the law required the working group to indicate the basis for invalidating signatures. Fourthly, the nominated candidate had a right to lodge appeals with the CEC and courts against a decision refusing the registration. All of the above combined to form a sufficient body of safeguards preventing arbitrary refusals to register candidates.",

In particular, it was not clear how the commissions and their experts concluded that a number of signatures (201 according to the ConEC, and 233 according to the CEC) had been falsified. There were no specialised handwriting experts among the working-group members and, therefore, their findings that large numbers of signatures were inauthentic were highly subjective and arbitrary. However, the electoral commissions relied on the working-group expert opinions without conducting any further investigation to conclusively establish the authenticity of the impugned signatures. Moreover, a number of signatures were declared invalid on the basis of easily rectifiable errors, without informing the applicant in advance and giving him an opportunity to rectify those errors, as required by the Electoral Code. The invalidation by the ConEC of 33 signatures on \u201cother grounds\u201d, without explaining what those grounds were, was unlawful because the Electoral Code provided for an exhaustive list of grounds for invalidation.",

In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns regarding the impartiality of the electoral commissions, lack of transparency in their activity, and various shortcomings in the procedure (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 60-61), a lack of clear and sufficient information about the professional qualifications and the criteria for appointment of working-group experts charged with the task of examining signature sheets ((ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-64), failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take any further investigative steps to confirm the experts\u2019 opinions on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures ((ibid., \u00a7 65), systematic failure by the electoral commissions to abide by a number of statutory safeguards designed to protect nominated candidates from arbitrary decisions (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-68 and 69), failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take into account the relevant and substantial evidence submitted by the candidate in an attempt to challenge the working-group experts\u2019 findings on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures (ibid., \u00a7 69), and the failure by the domestic courts to deal with the appeals in an appropriate manner (ibid., \u00a7 70).

Russia, no. 46468/06, \u00a7 212, 22 December 2008). To determine whether a search was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court has explored the availability of effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness under domestic law, and checked how those safeguards operated in the specific case under examination. Elements taken into consideration in this regard were the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer, whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion, and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, and, where a lawyer\u2019s office is involved, whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege was not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7 214, with further references). In cases where search warrants at issue were formulated in excessively broad terms, lacking any reservation in respect of privileged documents and giving the prosecution unrestricted discretion in determining which documents to seize, the Court has found that the lawyer\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention had been breached on that ground (see Aleksanyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 216-18; Smirnov v. Russia, no. 71362/01, \u00a7\u00a7 47-49, 7 June 2007; and Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 22 May 2008).",

However, no reservation was put in place in the search warrant with regard to privileged client documents that were kept in his office. In the context of the present complaint, the Court will refrain from drawing a general conclusion as to whether the search warrant issued by the Nasimi District Court on 7 August 2014 was formulated in excessively broad terms. Nevertheless, it notes that the search warrant specified that the documents and other material to be seized were to be related only to the Legal Education Society\u2019s establishment, structure, functioning, membership registration and financial activities. Whereas the documents in the applicant\u2019s case file did not relate to any of the above, it appears that the prosecution authorities overstepped the scope of the search warrant by seizing the applicant\u2019s case file. Moreover, it does not appear that the search was conducted in the presence of an independent observer capable of identifying, independently of the investigation team, which documents were covered by professional privilege. No adequate inventory of the seized privileged documents was made in the search and seizure records of 8 and 9 August 2014.",

It is true that, before the seizure, the application form and the relevant documents had reached the Court and that both the Government and the applicant had made all the required subsequent submissions enabling the Court to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01. However, a failure by the respondent Government to comply with their procedural obligation under Article 34 of the Convention does not necessarily require that the alleged interference should have actually restricted, or had any appreciable impact on, the exercise of the right of individual petition. The Contracting Party\u2019s procedural obligation must be enforced irrespective of the eventual outcome of the proceedings and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential chilling effect on the applicants or their representatives (see Janowiec and Others v.

The very fact that the applicant and his lawyer were deprived of access to their copy of the case file for a lengthy period of time, without any justification and without any compensatory measures, constituted in itself an undue interference with the integrity of the proceedings and a serious hindrance to the effective exercise of the applicant\u2019s right of individual petition.",
