In this connection the Court reiterates that it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility and assessment of evidence, which are primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see, among other authorities, Khan v. the , no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000V). Furthermore, it is not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether a particular piece of evidence is necessary or essential to decide a case (see, for example, Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7 66, ECHR\u00a02000VIII) or, indeed, whether or not the applicant is guilty. The question which must be answered is whether the alleged defects impaired the fairness of the proceedings, taken as a whole. On the basis of the materials submitted by the applicant, the Court notes that he, personally and through his defence counsel, was fully able to present his case and contest the evidence that he considered false. Having regard to the facts as submitted by the applicant, the Court has not found any reason to believe that the proceedings did not comply with the fairness requirement of Article\u00a06 of the Convention.",
