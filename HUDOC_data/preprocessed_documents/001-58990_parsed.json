The District Court observed that the length of the proceedings was mainly due to the complexity of the case, to the number of parties and witnesses as well as to the circumstances preventing the attendance of the accused's lawyers and of the District Court's judges. Furthermore, no significant periods of inactivity seemed to have occurred during the trial, given the fact that at least fifty hearings had taken place from 25\u00a0June until December 1996. However, the court noted that some hearings had been adjourned for reasons which were not imputable to the applicant or to the requirements of the fair administration of justice in criminal cases, such as lawyers' strikes, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s illness and a lack of a proper hearing-room. It consequently considered that a global delay of thirty-one days should be deducted from the maximum period of detention on remand, which had not been overstepped, even taking into account such deduction.
