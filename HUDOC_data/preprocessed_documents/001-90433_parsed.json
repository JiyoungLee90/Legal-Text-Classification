The notion of necessity implies that the interference must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued; in determining whether an interference is \"necessary in a democratic society\", the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States. In this context, the Court also reiterates that a care order should in principle be regarded as a temporary measure, to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permit, and any measures implementing temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the parents and the child (see Olsson, cited above, \u00a7 81). Thus, severe and lasting restrictions on access which are of a long duration are particularly likely to be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see Eriksson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 72).",
