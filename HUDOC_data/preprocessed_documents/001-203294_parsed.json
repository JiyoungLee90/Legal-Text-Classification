Furthermore, it reiterates that it is not its role to substitute itself for the national authorities and to calculate the amount of the pension supplement payable to the applicant in 2006, given the failure of the national authorities to adopt any decision on the matter. Accordingly, it considers that it would be more appropriate for this issue to be addressed at the stage of enforcement of the present judgment (see Sukhanov and Ilchenko, cited above, \u00a7 64, and Filozofenko v. Ukraine [Committee], no. 72954/11, \u00a7 24, 9\u00a0January 2020). On the other hand, it awards the second applicant EUR\u00a0900 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see Sukhanov and Ilchenko, cited above, \u00a7 65). Lastly, the Court rejects the second applicant\u2019s claim for costs relating to the submission of his application as it is unsubstantiated.",
