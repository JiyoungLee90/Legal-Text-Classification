The court received the prosecutor\u2019s appeal in the afternoon of that day and scheduled a hearing for the same day, informing her lawyers about this by telephone at around 5.30 p.m. However, when her detention period expired, the court did not set her free and she was held in the courtroom with the help of national security officers.

Thus, her detention period authorised by the decision of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan of 26 September 2005 was valid until 5.50 p.m. on 23\u00a0November 2005. On 22 November 2005 the District Court refused to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention period. However, the applicant was not released from detention at 5.50 p.m. on the next day. Instead, 20 minutes before the expiry of her detention period she was taken to court to take part in the hearing on the appeal lodged by the prosecutor against the decision of 22 November 2005. Moreover, after this hearing was adjourned at around 8.30 p.m., the applicant was taken back to the detention facility despite the fact that Article 141 of the CCP required the administration of the detention facility immediately to release a detainee when his or her detention period authorised by a court had expired.",

They claimed, however, that the approach adopted in the Giulia Manzoni case, cited above, was to be applied. The Court does not agree with the Government\u2019s claim. In particular, that and other similar cases concerned a situation in which the court ordered the applicant\u2019s release but some time was necessary for the authorities to complete all the relevant administrative formalities in order to execute that order. In the present case, however, the District Court, by its decision of 22\u00a0November\u00a02005, did not order the applicant\u2019s release but simply refused to prolong her detention. Thus, the applicant\u2019s authorised detention period continued to run and was to expire on the next day, a fact of which the authorities were aware and with which they were obliged to comply unless in the meantime the District Court\u2019s decision was overturned. In that sense the present case is more similar to the case of K.-F., cited above, than the case pointed out by the Government.

The Court, however, is not convinced by these arguments. It reiterates that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal system in such a way that their law-enforcement authorities can meet the obligation to avoid unjustified deprivation of liberty (see Shukhardin v. Russia, no. 65734/01, \u00a7 93, 28 June 2007, and Matyush v.\u00a0Russia, no. 14850/03, \u00a7 73, 9 December 2008). The Court observes that Article 139 of the CCP required that a motion seeking the prolongation of a detention period be submitted to the trial court and examined by it not later than ten and five days respectively before the expiry of the detention period. However, both the investigator and the District Court failed to comply with these time-limits, thereby creating undue delays in the examination of the question of prolongation of the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 8 and\u00a09 above). Furthermore, the applicant was brought before the Court of Appeal only 20 minutes before the expiry of her detention period. The Government, however, failed to come up with any explanation for these delays. In such circumstances, the applicant cannot reasonably be blamed for the failure of the Court of Appeal to finish the examination of the question of prolongation of her detention period before its expiry, especially in view of the fact that the entire hearing before that court lasted much longer than 20 minutes, namely about three hours, and was, moreover, eventually adjourned.",

In spite of this, the Court of Appeal continued to treat the applicant as a detainee. Not only did the court not set her free at 5.50 p.m., when her authorised detention period expired, but even after the hearing was adjourned. Furthermore, the applicant alleged, which the Government did not dispute, that her transfer back to the detention facility was effected in full knowledge of the court and even upon its informal instructions. In such circumstances, it appears that the authorities had no intention of setting the applicant free until the appeal against the District Court\u2019s decision of 22 November 2005 received its final determination. No steps were taken to that effect and all the attempts made by the applicant\u2019s lawyers to secure her release were simply ignored. Thus, the present case does not concern a certain delay in complying with the legal rules requiring a detainee\u2019s release, as in the case of K.-F., cited above, but rather the reluctance of the authorities, including the courts, to comply with such rules.",

Furthermore, the Government failed to specify what judicial procedure the applicant had at her disposal that could have provided her with an effective and immediate remedy capable of leading to her release, given the specificities of her case. In this respect, it should firstly be noted that the applicant was taken back to the detention facility at a relatively late hour and, in any event, outside regular working hours. Furthermore, the period of her unauthorised stay at the detention facility was relatively short, about seventeen hours. However, Section 18 of the Law on Conditions for Holding Arrested and Detained Persons did not require any immediacy in such matters and even allowed up to one day for detainees\u2019 complaints to be sent to a judge. The Court reiterates that the only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective and accessible, that is available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, and which are capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offer reasonable prospects of success (see Kalashnikov v.
