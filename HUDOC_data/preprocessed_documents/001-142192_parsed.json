The following day the company wrote to the applicant union, stating that it did not recognise the term \u201cTechnician\u201d (it categorised its workers in a more precise way: fitters, jointers, test-room inspectors, day testers, shift testers, OLBI fitters).

Unite the Union ([2009] EWCA Civ\u00a0829). He also rejected the argument that since the procedure was still at an early stage it would be premature to put a stop to it. Instead he considered the risk of unlawful strike action to be sufficiently imminent to justify the injunction. Given the sector involved, the implications of a shutdown would be substantial, with widespread ramifications elsewhere. Addressing the question whether the applicant union had in fact given sufficient indication of the category of staff that would be balloted, the judge found that it had not, since the union\u2019s members at Tufnell Park included persons working at different trades. The applicant union was not under an absolute duty, but instead a duty to do its reasonable best to provide sufficient information to the company. The fact that it used its own system of job classification was relevant but not decisive. Similarly, the fact that a union might not record or possess such information could be a highly material consideration, but not necessarily a decisive one. The applicant union had accepted that it was practicable for a union to supply the necessary information in the context of a small place of employment \u2013 it was therefore neither onerous nor unreasonable to require it to do so. Finally, the judge observed that while there was as yet no stated intention on the part of the applicant union to call a strike (the ballot not having taken place), there was a clear nexus between the failure to provide the requisite notice and the employer\u2019s ability to respond to the situation either by making preparations for a work stoppage or seeking to persuade employees not to vote for industrial action. The applicant union\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was therefore not a mere technical or immaterial breach.",

At the time, Fastline and Jarvis Rail Limited (\u201cJarvis\u201d) employed approximately 1,200 persons in total, 569 of whom were members of the RMT. In August 2007, Fastline transferred part of its undertaking, comprising twenty employees, to another company known as Hydrex Equipment (UK) Ltd (\u201cHydrex\u201d). These employees\u2019 existing terms and conditions were preserved by Hydrex, as required by law (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006).

This meant a reduction in salary of some 36-40%, according to the applicant union. In the months that followed, the applicant union made representations to Hydrex on behalf of the employees concerned but without achieving any agreement. When the company indicated that it intended to proceed with its plan, the applicant union organised a strike ballot of the workers concerned (seventeen by that stage). They voted in favour of a strike, which took place between 6 November and 9 November 2009. During the strike, the participants organised pickets at a number of the sites where they normally carried out their work. This caused Hydrex to write to the applicant union to remind it that by law picketing could take place only at or near the employer\u2019s premises and to warn that the union was exposing itself to liability for any economic loss incurred by the company due to this unlawful action (see paragraph 19 below).",

Nine votes were cast, all of them rejecting the Hydrex offer. According to the applicant union, its position was extremely weak given the very small number of its members in the Hydrex workforce. These were far too few for their strike action to have any appreciable effect on the company, whose activities had not really been disrupted at all. The applicant union considered that it would have been in a position to defend its members\u2019 interests much more effectively had it been able to mobilise its Jarvis members as well. The simple threat of a strike on this scale, and a fortiori an actual stoppage, would have exerted significantly more pressure on Hydrex to maintain existing terms and conditions. The applicant union stated that Jarvis employees would have been willing to strike in support of their colleagues at Hydrex. Instead, the Hydrex members had had to stand alone, and in the end had no option but to accept the new terms and conditions. They did so under protest.",

The majority of the House held that the test to be applied to determine whether an act enjoyed the protection of section\u00a013(1) was a subjective one, that is to say, it was sufficient that the person honestly believed that the act in question might further the cause of those taking part in the dispute. The genuineness of such belief could be tested by the courts, but the person calling the strike did not need to prove that it was reasonably capable of achieving the objective.

The 1980 Act retained immunity for secondary action provided that three conditions were satisfied: (i) that it was taken against first suppliers or customers of the employer in dispute or against associated employers of the employer which were substituting for it during the dispute; (ii) that its principal purpose was to directly prevent or disrupt the supply of goods or services between the employer in dispute and his supplier or customer during the dispute; and (iii) that it was likely to achieve that purpose.",

The Government pointed out that in that decade, the average number of days lost each year was 12.9 million. This decreased in the 1980s to an average of 7.2 million days. From the early 1990s to the present day, the figure is much lower, standing at 700,000 days lost per year on average. They attributed part of this decline at least to the ban on secondary action. The applicant union disputed that interpretation. It noted that the available statistics did not distinguish between primary and secondary strikes. It was therefore impossible to identify the true extent of secondary action before 1980 and, consequently, impossible to ascertain the impact of the restrictions introduced in 1980 and 1990. In the applicant union\u2019s view, secondary action had been relatively rare, the overwhelming majority of strikes at that time had been primary strikes. It referred to official figures (contained in a Government publication, the \u201cEmployment Gazette\u201d) indicating that, since the 1960s, the United Kingdom was consistently close to the European average for days lost to industrial action. According to this source, the country had been middle-ranking since the end of the 1970s. The only exception was for 1984, on account of the long and widespread strike in the mining industry that year. The Government submitted that the comparative statistics needed to be interpreted with caution, given the profound transformation of Europe over the past twenty years. The fact that the United Kingdom remained close to the European average in this regard indicated that, contrary to the applicant union\u2019s point of view, the rules on industrial action were not so restrictive as to make it excessively difficult to organise strikes.",

The Committee requested the Government to continue to provide information on any developments, as well as any relevant statistics or reports on the practical application and effect of these requirements. The Committee notes the Government\u2019s indication that the Court of Appeal decision in RMT v. Serco and in ASLEF v. London Midland (2011) EWCA 226, overturned injunctions which had been obtained by Serco and London Midland Railway against the two main national transport unions, the RMT and ASLEF. In both cases, the injunctions had been obtained on the basis of the unions\u2019 breaches of statutory balloting and notification procedures. This case was the latest in a series of cases assessing the extent of unions\u2019 technical obligations to ensure that a fair balloting process had taken place. In the RMT v. Serco decision, the Court of Appeal issued some key clarification so that in future it is likely to be more difficult for employers to obtain injunctions to prevent strike action as a result of breaches of the balloting and notice requirements. A Court of Appeal decision is binding on all lower courts. Subsequent to this case, in Balfour Beatty v. Unite (2012) EWHC 267 (QB), the Court found against Balfour Beatty, taking account of the Serco case and the need to strike a balance between striving for democratic legitimacy and imposing unrealistic burdens on unions and their officers. The Committee notes the TUC\u2019s observation that, while it greatly welcomes both decisions, it considers that they do not fully address the problems arising under the legislation that it has identified and that the legislation continues to impose intolerable demands on trade unions. The Committee notes these developments with interest and requests the Government to provide its comments on the concerns raised by the TUC.\u201d",

In its previous comments, the Committee had noted that according to the TUC, due to the decentralized nature of the industrial relations system, it was essential for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, transferring work, or hiving off companies. The Committee generally raised the need to protect the right of workers to take industrial action in relation to matters which affect them even though, in certain cases, the direct employer may not be party to the dispute, and to participate in sympathy strikes provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. The Committee takes note of the Government indication that: (1) its position remains as set out in its report for 200608, that the rationale has not changed and that it therefore has no plans to change the law in this area; and (2) this issue forms part of a matter brought before the ECHR by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and that the Court has yet to consider the case. The Committee recalls the previous concern it raised that the globalization of the economy and the delocalization of work centres may have a severe impact on the right of workers\u2019 organizations to organize their activities in a manner so as to defend effectively their members\u2019 interests should lawful industrial action be too restrictively defined.

In reply to this the applicant union provided to the Court statements from labour-law experts in a number of European countries contradicting the Government\u2019s remarks. The applicant union concluded that the United Kingdom is the most restrictive among the Contracting Parties to the Convention in this respect.

The facts of the practical example provided, as reported by the applicant union, indicate that, while the union experienced some delay in taking action to protect the interests of its members, it succeeded in holding a strike two months later. That action, by the applicant union\u2019s own admission, induced EDF to improve its offer to union members, who accepted it and it took effect as a collective agreement shortly afterwards. That successful outcome cannot be disregarded. It would be artificial for the Court to consider the issuing of the injunction against the RMT in isolation from subsequent events. In sum, there is no basis here for the Court to find that the applicant union\u2019s exercise of its rights under Article 11 of the Convention has been interfered with, over and above being required to comply with the procedural requirements set down in law, which it succeeded in doing. While those requirements have been the subject of criticism by other international bodies (see paragraphs 26-37 above), the Court can only examine complaints in light of their concrete facts. It considers that what the EDF situation discloses in reality is ultimately successful collective action by the applicant union on behalf of its members. This aspect of the application is therefore manifestly illfounded and so must be rejected as inadmissible pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the applicant union has abused the right of application. It did not conceal from the Court at the outset its intention to utilise another international procedure (contrast Cereceda Martin and Others v. Spain, no.\u00a016358/90, Commission decision of 12 October 1992, Decisions and Reports 73, p. 120, at p. 133).

Had it been possible to organise a sympathy strike at Jarvis, it was highly probable that Hydrex would have desisted from changing matters for the worse. With so few members employed by Hydrex, the effect of the strike had been negligible. The very limited possibility of lawful picketing had made no difference. The revised offer made by management, despite being presented in a positive light by the union leadership, had been unanimously rejected by those polled as totally inadequate. The applicant union stated that a strike by its Jarvis members would have been motivated not just by solidarity with fellow union members who had been their former colleagues, but also by concern to preserve their own terms and conditions. Given the highly competitive environment in which they were employed, a decision by one company to reduce its staffing costs could well trigger similar cuts in rival companies. As the Hydrex situation illustrated, it was easy for a company to terminate the employment of workers and then rehire them on less favourable terms. The ban on secondary action had the effect of undermining trade-union action on behalf of all its members in a given sector, to the detriment of all such workers. From 1980 onwards, there had been a significant and steady decline in the role of collective agreements in the British economy, which made it all the more vital to permit trade unions to act effectively on their members\u2019 behalf, protecting those in positions of greater weakness. In the applicant union\u2019s view it was only in the period before 1980 that the right to take secondary strike action had been adequately protected in domestic law. The government of the day had not considered it necessary to restrict it. The clear object of the 1980 and 1992 legislation had been to undermine the role and influence of trade unions, leaving workers in a weakened position. The Government\u2019s claims that strike action had damaged the economy in the 1970s and 1980s lacked substantiation, and were moreover exaggerated and inaccurate. Despite the lack of any real evidence, trade unions had been unjustly blamed for Britain\u2019s economic woes for over thirty years, and were for this reason subject to very restrictive legislation.",

It would only have called out the Jarvis workforce, which would have been sufficient to induce Hydrex to leave existing terms and conditions intact. In any event, the applicant union rejected as generalisations the Government\u2019s arguments regarding the disruptive effects of secondary strikes and the risks these posed to the Convention rights of third parties (interference with businesses, threats to livelihoods, and even \u2013 in extreme situations \u2013 to life and health). Sufficient safeguards existed elsewhere in the law, including the criminal law. There was thus no justification for a complete ban on secondary action. A less restrictive regime could surely be devised, as required by the principle of proportionality. The possibility of organising peaceful pickets made no real difference, as shown by the facts of this case; it did not mitigate the disproportionate effects of the ban on secondary action.",

Alternatively, the Court having identified collective bargaining as an essential element of trade-union rights, it must logically follow that the right to strike was equally essential, since without the threat of industrial action, collective bargaining would be deprived of any effectiveness and be little more than \u201ccollective begging\u201d.

Such an interpretation would impoverish the substance of Article 11. In the many cases it had decided involving strikes, the Court had never attached any significance to what was at stake for the workers in the dispute. It was entirely legitimate for unions to pursue broader, common objectives. Trade unionism was fundamentally about solidarity among union members and among workers more generally, and the wording of Article 11 of the Convention should be construed in keeping with this. Workers should be able to take industrial action to protect those who may be prevented from doing so, or who, on their own, lack the collective strength to defend their interests at work. This broad concept of freedom of association was espoused by the two most eminent international bodies in the field of trade-union rights, the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. Both had repeatedly criticised the United Kingdom for its ban on secondary action, which they deemed to be incompatible with the relevant international legal standards. These had been interpreted to mean that the only acceptable condition that could be attached to secondary action was that the primary dispute itself be lawful. The applicant union urged the Court to adopt the same position. If that were overbroad, a criterion of proximity might be envisaged, that is to say, a requirement of a link of some sort between workers engaged in primary action and those striking in sympathy with them. Such a link was present here, since the group of workers concerned had originally been Jarvis employees and continued to perform the same work at the same sites after the transfer. A\u00a0worsening in their terms and conditions could have had negative consequences for all workers in that sector. In the modern economy, the workforce was becoming increasingly fragmented through the transfer of undertakings or part of them, the creation of complex corporate structures, agency work, privatisation, the contracting-out of services leading to further sub-contracting, non-genuine self-employment, and so forth. This led to a situation in which persons performing the same job at the same place of work could have different employers, meaning that they could not legally support one another in time of industrial conflict.",

Prior to the enactment of the Employment Act 1980, trade unions had enjoyed a very broad power to organise secondary action, with highly detrimental consequences for businesses and their workforces, as well as for the general public. A dispute in one part of the economy could rapidly spill over into others, embroiling third parties in it who had no stake in the conflict and no real means of resolving it. Just how permissive the legislation in force at that time was became fully apparent in the McShane case (see paragraph 22 above). The government of the day had determined that this should be restricted, and the parliamentary debates contained many actual examples of the damage and disruption wrought by unrestricted secondary strikes. Ten years later, the government considered that even in its more restricted form secondary action had the potential to damage the economy, notably by deterring multinational companies from developing their operations in the United Kingdom. Parliament had accordingly introduced the current ban. Although the Labour Party, then in opposition, had opposed the move, it had never sought to reverse it during its thirteen-year tenure in government. Nor was the current coalition government minded to revisit the issue. This indicated the very broad political acceptance in the United Kingdom of the current balance struck regarding the right to strike.",

This was a plea for no restriction at all on secondary action, eliminating any balancing exercise. No such indiscriminate right could be derived from Article 11.

Regarding Article 6 \u00a7 4 of the Social Charter, the Government considered that the ECSR regarded the right to strike as integral to the process of collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in cases of conflicts of interest between them. This corresponded to primary industrial action, where workers\u2019 interests were directly engaged, not to secondary. The Government further observed that the ECSR was not a judicial or quasi-judicial organ, but simply an independent body that submitted its conclusions to the Committee of Ministers annually. It was the latter that had the power to adopt recommendations to States in relation to any instance of non-compliance with the Charter. As far as the ban on secondary action was concerned, the Committee of Ministers had never taken a stance. In any event, the basis for the ECSR\u2019s critique of the United Kingdom in this respect was that the ban could have the effect of preventing workers from striking against the \u201creal\u201d or de facto employer, where this is a distinct entity from the direct employer. This was also the basis for the criticism voiced by the ILO Committee of Experts, but it had no relevance to the Hydrex situation, which formed the factual basis for the Court\u2019s examination of the issue. In any event, that Committee was not a judicial or quasi-judicial body either, and its interpretation of ILO Conventions was not definitive. Rather, its role was to provide impartial and technical evaluation of the state of application of international labour standards. In fact, the question of a right to strike was currently the cause of sharp controversy within the ILO, as part of which the status of the interpretations given by the Committee of Experts had been called into question. In addition, the Government perceived a divergence of view between the Committee of Experts and the Committee on Freedom of Association, the latter regarding the right to strike as applying only to the defence of one\u2019s economic interests. It was noteworthy that the ILO Governing Body had refrained from taking any position on the situation. The Government thus did not accept that the United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under Convention No. 87.",

They referred to a series of international treaties that expressly recognise the right to strike, or have been authoritatively interpreted as protecting that right. In the jurisprudence of the ILO supervisory bodies, the right to strike was widely applied and strongly protected. There could be restrictions, but these must not be such as to result in practice in an excessive limitation of the right to strike. Sympathy strikes had to be permitted. This was also clearly established in the jurisprudence of the ECSR. The complete ban on secondary action meant that workers in dispute could not in any circumstances call on members of their own union for support, or of any other trade union with which their own was associated at a higher level (for example, a federation or confederation). This diminished the very purpose of joining a trade union, and undermined the purpose of this dimension of Article 11 of the Convention, which reflected the principle that workers should be free to combine for mutual support in times of crisis. The ban was a relatively recent innovation, coming in more than eight decades after the foundational statute in British industrial relations, the Trade Disputes Act of 1906. The Government had failed to justify the restriction before the ILO Committee of Experts. In particular, that Committee had not accepted the Government\u2019s argument that the ban was made necessary by the decentralised nature of the British system of industrial relations. On the contrary, the Committee considered that this made it more important for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, by transferring work or by hiving off companies. Workers in the United Kingdom were forbidden to take action in support of colleagues employed by another employer forming part of the same group of companies, even though they stood to be affected by the outcome of the dispute. That could not be right. The two organisations expressed their dismay that the Government was ignoring the need to amend the law and refusing to bring it up to the level of minimum international standards. The centre of gravity among European States appeared to lie somewhere between the total prohibition of such action and no restriction at all. The total ban in force in the United Kingdom was an unjustifiable restraint on the right to freedom of association, which could not be justified in all circumstances to protect the rights and freedoms of others.",

In many situations, workers were not in fact able to exercise their right under Article 11 to take industrial action; for example, those employed in very small establishments, or working for entities where terms and conditions are effectively determined by a third party such as a client, or those with insecure employment status. The traditional set-up in which all the members of the same workforce had the same employer no longer corresponded to the reality of a large and growing category of workers. It had been estimated that over three million jobs were now outsourced in the British economy, a great many of these from the public sector, where union density had traditionally been highest. This fragmentation of the traditional labour market had implications for labour law generally, and made it increasingly difficult for trade unions to continue to defend the interests of their members, who were increasingly dispersed among different economic operators. In this context, the effect of the ban on secondary strikes was to greatly reduce the value of trade-union membership, as it prevented the union from mobilising broadly in solidarity with and so as to protect the interests of members in dispute with their direct employer. The ban made it easy for companies to undercut the influence of trade unions by reconfiguring their organisations. It was clearly established in domestic case-law that the corporate veil could not be lifted in such circumstances. This deprived trade unions of the possibility of taking effective action against those with real decision-making power or control. Before 1980, the scope for secondary strikes was very broad, as illustrated by the House of Lords in N.W.L. Ltd v. Woods ([1979] 1 WLR 1294), which recognised the lawfulness of industrial action by dock workers taken in solidarity with foreign seafarers working for very little pay on flagged-out vessels. The ban denied some workers their only source of effective union support in the form of financial pressure exerted on the employer\u2019s commercial relationships. It also hindered freedom of association in small firms (fewer than twenty-one employees), which were excluded from the statutory procedure for recognising trade unions. If such an employer refused to recognise a trade union on a voluntary basis, the ban on secondary action made it impossible for fellow members in other workplaces to take industrial action so as to induce the employer to accept trade-union representation.",

Practice actually showed that trade unions were capable of acting effectively in such circumstances \u2013 the three examples referred to by Liberty were in fact instances of the successful resolution of an industrial dispute via trade-union involvement (the three examples were: one involving airline catering staff, one concerning bus drivers in London during the 2012 Olympics, and one involving fuel lorry drivers). The charge that workers were prevented from taking action against the party that really determines their terms and conditions was no more than a hypothesis \u2013 no actual examples had been given. Nor had there been any decline in the number of days lost to strike action each year for the past twenty years, which tended to refute Liberty\u2019s view that domestic law had increasingly restricted trade-union freedom. In this respect, the United Kingdom was close to the European Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. As to the assertion that the threshold of twenty-one employees represented a loophole that employers could easily exploit in order to avoid having to recognise a trade union, the Government did not see its relevance to the facts of the case. Even so, there were safeguards in place to prevent employers from circumventing their statutory duty. Only genuine small firms were excluded, and that was for valid policy reasons. Finally, the Government submitted that there was no explicit support in the Court\u2019s case-law for the proposition that the right to take secondary action is an essential element of freedom of association, or that the ban could not be justified under Article 11 \u00a7 2.",

Furthermore, it has often stated that the Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law. Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention of \u201cany relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties\u201d, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see X v.

In this regard, it is clear from the passages set out above (see paragraphs 26-37) that secondary action is recognised and protected as part of trade-union freedom under ILO Convention No. 87 and the European Social Charter. Although the Government have put a narrower construction on the positions adopted by the supervisory bodies that operate under these two instruments, these bodies have criticised the United Kingdom\u2019s ban on secondary action because of a perceived risk of abuse by employers, and have illustrated this with some examples.\u00a0The Government further queried the authority, for the purposes of the Convention, to be attributed to the interpretative pronouncements of the expert bodies tasked with supervising compliance with these specialised international standards.

It clearly did not concern national security or public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, or the protection of health or morals. As for the remaining aim recognised as legitimate, namely the \u201cprotection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d, the applicant union\u2019s argument was that it would be illogical to restrict the right to strike on account of the impact of such action on the employer. The very purpose of strike action is to have a strong impact on the employer\u2019s position, to induce the employer to meet the demands of labour. It would be erroneous to allow this to serve as a justification for curbing the right to strike. The applicant union therefore invited the Court to reconsider the reasoning followed in this regard in UNISON v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no.\u00a053574/99, ECHR 2002I), in which the Court had accepted that the restriction on strike action concerned the \u201crights of others\u201d, referring to the employer. The economic interests of an employer should not be permitted to take precedence over the human rights of employees. Such reasoning contradicted the approach of the ECSR, for example, which did not accept any principle of proportionality between the taking of strike action and the consequences of this on the employer\u2019s interests. The applicant union further argued that the UNISON decision sat ill with the earlier judgment of the Court in Gustafsson v. Sweden (25 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II). There the Court had not entertained the applicant\u2019s complaint that the trade-union boycott of his business was an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Nor had it accepted that the impact on his business, although it caused considerable economic damage, gave rise to any positive obligation on the State to come to his aid. The Court should instead take a stringent approach as it had done in two cases involving sanctions against public-sector employees who participated in a one-day strike (Kara\u00e7ay v. Turkey, no. 6615/03, 27 March 2007 and Kaya and Seyhan v. Turkey, no. 30946/04, 15 September 2009). In each case the Court had not been persuaded that the interferences in question pursued legitimate aims, although it ultimately had left that point open in view of its finding that the interferences complained of were not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

During the domestic proceedings the Court of Appeal held that the impact of such a strike on members of the public was irrelevant to the legal issues arising. This Court took the same view, and for this reason the aim of \u201cprotection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d was taken in the circumstances as referring just to the employer\u2019s rights. The ground for distinguishing the present case is the fact that it concerns secondary action. As the Government have argued, by its nature secondary action may well have much broader ramifications than primary action. It has the potential to impinge upon the rights of persons not party to the industrial dispute, to cause broad disruption within the economy and to affect the delivery of services to the public. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that in banning secondary action, Parliament pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, not limited to the employer side in an industrial dispute.",

It observes that it has already decided a number of cases in which restrictions on industrial action were found to have given rise to violations of Article 11 (see, for example, Kara\u00e7ay, cited above; Dilek and Others v. Turkey, nos.\u00a074611/01, 26876/02 and 27628/02, 17 July 2007; Urcan and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 23018/04 and 10 others, 17 July 2008; and Enerji Yap\u0131-Yol Sen v. Turkey, no.\u00a068959/01, 21 April 2009). The applicant union placed great emphasis on the last of these judgments, in which the term \u201cindispensable corollary\u201d was used in relation to the right to strike, linking it to the right to organise (see Enerji Yap\u0131-Yol Sen, cited above, \u00a7 24). It should, however, be noted that the judgment was here adverting to the position adopted by the supervisory bodies of the ILO rather than evolving the interpretation of Article 11 by conferring a privileged status on the right to strike. More generally, what the above-mentioned cases illustrate is that strike action is clearly protected by Article 11. The Court does not therefore discern any need in the present case to determine whether the taking of industrial action should now be accorded the status of an essential element of the Article\u00a011 guarantee.",

The strike by its Hydrex members was part of that exercise, and while it did not achieve its aim, it was not in vain either since it led the company to revise its offer, which the applicant union then commended to its members. Although the Government criticised the applicant union for supporting the revised offer at the time and then reversing its stance in the present proceedings, the Court recognises that the union was bound to respect its members\u2019 negative vote. Yet the fact that the process of collective bargaining and industrial action, including strike action against the employer of the union members who were the subject of the dispute, did not lead to the outcome desired by the applicant union and its members does not mean that the exercise of their Article 11 rights was illusory. The right to collective bargaining has not been interpreted as including a \u201cright\u201d to a collective agreement (see, in this respect, Demir and Baykara, cited above, \u00a7 158, where the Court observed that the absence of any obligation on the authorities to actually enter into a collective agreement was not part of the case). Nor does the right to strike imply a right to prevail. As the Court has often stated, what the Convention requires is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article\u00a011, to strive for the protection of their members\u2019 interests (ibid., \u00a7 141, and, more recently Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun\u201d v.

Since achieving a proper balance between the interests of labour and management involves sensitive social and political issues, the Contracting States must be afforded a margin of appreciation as to how trade-union freedom and protection of the occupational interests of union members may be secured. In its most recent restatement of this point the Grand Chamber, referring to the high degree of divergence it observed between the domestic systems in this field, considered that the margin should be a wide one (see Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun\u201d, cited above, \u00a7 133). The applicant union relied heavily on Demir and Baykara (cited above, \u00a7 119) in which the Court considered that the respondent State should be allowed only a limited margin. The Court would point out, however, that the passage in question appears in the part of the judgment examining a very far-reaching interference with freedom of association, one that intruded into its inner core, namely the dissolution of a trade union. It is not to be understood as narrowing decisively and definitively the domestic authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation in relation to regulating, through normal democratic processes, the exercise of trade-union freedom within the social and economic framework of the country concerned. The breadth of the margin will still depend on the factors that the Court in its case-law has identified as relevant, including the nature and extent of the restriction on the trade-union right in issue, the object pursued by the contested restriction, and the competing rights and interests of other individuals in society who are liable to suffer as a result of the unrestricted exercise of that right. The degree of common ground between the member States of the Council of Europe in relation to the issue arising in the case may also be relevant, as may any international consensus reflected in the apposite international instruments (see Demir and Baykara, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085).",

It was its wish to escalate the strike, through the threatened or actual involvement of hundreds of its members at Jarvis, another, separate, company not at all involved in the trade dispute in question, that was frustrated. The Court has noted the applicant union\u2019s conviction that secondary action would have won the day. Inevitably, that can only be a matter of speculation \u2013 including as to the result of any ballot on the subject\u00a0\u2013 since that course of action was clearly ruled out.

A decade later, the government of the day considered that even in its more limited form secondary action posed a threat to the economy and to inward investment in the country\u2019s economic activity. As a matter of policy it considered that restricting industrial action to primary strikes would achieve a more acceptable balance within the British economy. The Government have reiterated that position in the present proceedings. That assessment was sharply contested at the time by the opposition in Parliament, and is rejected by the applicant union as grounded in animus towards trade unions rather than any clear evidence of direct damage to the economy. Yet the subject matter in this case is certainly related to the social and economic strategy of the respondent State. In this regard the Court has usually allowed a wide margin of appreciation since, by virtue of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities, and in particular the democratically elected Parliaments, are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds and which legislative measures are best suited for the conditions in their country in order to implement the chosen social, economic or industrial policy (see, among many authorities, Stummer v.

The other States mentioned above (see paragraphs 38-41) are located between these two outer points. The Government played down the significance of the comparative perspective, emphasising the deep structural and cultural differences among European States in the field of industrial relations. The Court acknowledges that diversity, which it has recognised in other cases concerning the rights of trade unions (see, for example, Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun\u201d, cited above, \u00a7 133, and S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v.

It is nevertheless clear that, with its outright ban on secondary action, the respondent State stands at one end of the comparative spectrum, being one of a small group of European States to adopt such a categorical stance on the matter. The varied comparative picture, and the position of the United Kingdom within it, do not in themselves, however, mean that the domestic authorities have overstepped their legitimate margin of appreciation in regulating this aspect of trade-union activity.",

The specialised international monitoring bodies operating under those procedures have a different standpoint, shown in the more general terms used to analyse the ban on secondary action (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above). In contrast, it is not the Court\u2019s task to review the relevant domestic law in the abstract, but to determine whether the manner in which it actually affected the applicant infringed the latter\u2019s rights under Article 11 of the Convention (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2012; see also Kart v. Turkey [GC], no. 8917/05, \u00a7\u00a7 85-87, ECHR\u00a0 2009). The applicant union as well as the third parties dwelt on the possible effect of the ban in various hypothetical scenarios, which could go as far as to exclude any form of industrial action at all if the workers directly concerned were not in a position to take primary action, thereby, unlike in the present case, striking at the very substance of trade-union freedom. They also considered that the ban could make it easy for employers to exploit the law to their advantage through resort to various legal stratagems, such as delocalising work centres, outsourcing work to other companies and adopting complex corporate structures in order to transfer work to separate legal entities or to hive off companies. In short, trade unions could find themselves severely hampered in the performance of their legitimate, normal activities in protecting their members\u2019 interests. These alleged, far-reaching negative effects of the statutory ban do not, however, arise in the situation at Hydrex. The Court\u2019s review is bounded by the facts submitted for examination in the case. This being so, the Court considers that the negative assessments made by the relevant monitoring bodies of the ILO and European Social Charter are not of such persuasive weight for determining whether the operation of the statutory ban on secondary strikes in circumstances such as those complained of in the present case remained within the range of permissible options open to the national authorities under Article 11 of the Convention.",

Iceland, no. 20161/06, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2010). The Government have argued that the \u201cpressing social need\u201d for maintaining the statutory ban on secondary strikes is to shield the domestic economy from the disruptive effects of such industrial action, which, if permitted, would pose a risk to the country\u2019s economic recovery. In the sphere of social and economic policy, which must be taken to include a country\u2019s industrial-relations policy, the Court will generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2010). Moreover, the Court has recognised the \u201cspecial weight\u201d to be accorded to the role of the domestic policy-maker in matters of general policy on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely (see, in the context of Article 10 of the Convention, MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, no. 39401/04, \u00a7 200, 18 January 2011, referring in turn to Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2003VIII, where the Court adverted to the \u201cdirect democratic legitimation\u201d that the legislature enjoys). The ban on secondary action has remained intact for over twenty years, notwithstanding two changes of government during that time. This denotes a democratic consensus in support of it, and an acceptance of the reasons for it, which span a broad spectrum of political opinion in the United Kingdom. These considerations lead the Court to conclude that in their assessment of how the broader public interest is best served in their country in the often charged political, social and economic context of industrial relations, the domestic legislative authorities relied on reasons that were both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 11.",

In this regard it is relevant to note that for a period of ten years, 1980-90, the United Kingdom found it possible to operate with a lighter restriction on secondary action (see paragraphs 23-24 above). The Government have not argued that this legislative regime was attended by the difficulties referred to above, or that this was why the ban was introduced. The applicant union did not comment in detail on the legal position during that period. It took the view that the question of its compatibility with the Convention was \u201cof entirely academic interest\u201d, though added that were the point relevant it would argue such a restriction would not be acceptable. The Court observes that, although the legislative history of the United Kingdom points to the existence of conceivable alternatives to the ban, that is not determinative of the matter. For the question is not whether less restrictive rules should have been adopted or whether the State can establish that, without the prohibition, the legitimate aim would not be achieved. It is rather whether, in adopting the general measure it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it (see Animal Defenders, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110) \u2013 which, for the reasons developed above, the Court has found to be a broad one \u2013 and whether, overall, a fair balance was struck.

However, it should be pointed out that the case raises a very delicate and complex issue as regards the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights today. First of all, the Convention was conceived as a treaty on civil and political rights. However, the division between the so-called three generations of human rights has been rightly abandoned since then (see the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights). At the same time, the States Parties to the Convention have not given the Court the mandate to address the issues concerning their economic and social policies. These are always very difficult. Therefore, the Court has in fact accepted that the States have a wide margin of appreciation for decisions in cases touching upon economic and social policies (see, for example, National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, 23\u00a0October 1997, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08082, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII).",

Turkey ([GC], no. 34503/97, ECHR 2008), the Court does not have a choice but to conclude that secondary strikes form part of Article 11 of the Convention, the Court should be reluctant to render a binding judgment which would require the modification of an important social and economic policy principle with wide implications for the country\u2019s economy. At this juncture we should say, however, that we are not impressed with the argument that, merely because Parliament has adopted a particular general measure, the Court may not overrule it, as it were. The Court has to adjudicate upon the individual facts and those facts may stem from a general measure. The Court may well conclude that the measure is contrary to the Convention in view of its effects on the facts of the case. This is true in particular where such measures affect fundamental civil and political rights, such as freedom of expression, the supervision over the protection of these rights having been the very purpose of the Court\u2019s creation (see the dissenting opinion of Judges Ziemele, Saj\u00f3, Kalaydjieva, Vu\u010dini\u0107 and De Gaetano in Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, ECHR 2013). It is in this respect that we see the case at hand as different, with the margin of appreciation clearly being wider than in freedom of expression cases. For us, the solution that the Court adopts is not so much about the general measure as such, it is about the character of the right concerned or an aspect thereof. The assessment of the general measure depends on the character of the right in issue. Furthermore, it is about the prejudice sustained by the applicant union by virtue of the application of the general measure. The right to strike is not absolute. There are already a number of limitations applicable in view of the general public interest. In the case at hand, we are even further from the core issue in that secondary or sympathy strikes are not necessarily or directly relevant to the rights or interests of those engaged in such strikes.",

A judgment of the European Court of Human Rights finding a violation would have the effect of putting an abrupt end to such a process.

In my view, it is illegitimate to transform treaty rules that bind only some members of the Council of Europe into an element of the Convention, unless unequivocal rules of treaty interpretation require otherwise. In any case, invoking arguments such as a \u201ccontinuous evolution in the norms and principles applied in international law\u201d or a \u201cstrong international trend\u201d usually discloses the fact that there are no strong arguments based on international law to support the chosen interpretation.

In any event, while European Union law should not violate the right to strike in so far as it is protected under the Charter, this instrument does not entitle the European Union to prevent its member States from imposing restrictions on the right to strike.",

Article 8 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(d) of this treaty guarantees \u201c[t]he right to strike provided that it is exercised in conformity with the laws of the particular country\u201d. The wording of this provision stresses the wide margin of appreciation left to national legislatures when regulating the right to strike.",

States have devised specific mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of social rights without having to entrust the adjudication of disputes concerning social rights to international courts. States also make use of optional instruments which leave them some choice as to their undertakings, such as the European Social Charter. Some States have clearly expressed their reluctance to undertake obligations in the field of social rights. An extensive interpretation of existing treaties pertaining to social rights may have a chilling effect on those States when they consider entering into new treaties in this field.",

The interpretation of the scope of freedom of association under Convention No. 87 is not uncontroversial, as employers\u2019 organisations have contested the idea that the freedom to form trade unions encompasses the right to strike. It is important to bear in mind in this context that the right to strike may encroach on the human rights of other persons and have an impact on the national economy. Therefore, the interpretation of international treaty provisions pertaining to the right to strike should take into account the various conflicting rights and the legitimate private and public interests at stake. Similarly, national legislation implementing the right to strike has to achieve a proper balance between different rights and interests. Broadening the scope of protection of the right to strike may entail the narrowing of the protection of other fundamental human rights.",

I am not persuaded by this argument. Firstly, the scope of trade-union freedom may differ from one treaty to another even if the wording of the relevant provisions is similar. Secondly, as pointed out above, the nature and scope of State obligations pertaining to sympathy strikes have not been clearly defined in international law. Thirdly, the different treaty rules protecting the right to strike have not been accepted by all the forty-seven High Contracting Parties to the Convention.",

For my part, I note that some European States take the opposite view. Not only is there no European consensus on this issue but, moreover, one can observe a strong resistance to recognising sympathy strikes. In any event, the fact that a majority of States adopts a higher standard of protection of a right is not a sufficient argument for imposing this standard on a minority of States which rejects it.",
