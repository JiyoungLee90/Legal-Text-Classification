Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The Court particularly notes that, whilst the delay in the payment of the various court expenses might have somewhat prolonged the proceedings, the applicant's conduct alone could not justify their entire length. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court therefore considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
