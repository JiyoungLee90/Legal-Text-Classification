He further presented a number of arguments why the flat in \u201cStrelbishte\u201d was the former matrimonial home and why its use should be given to the applicant. He asserted that this flat had been acquired by the spouses with a view to fulfilling the family\u2019s housing needs, that the applicant had contributed financially to its acquisition and that the only reason why she did not have title to it was her former husband\u2019s protracting the conclusion of the final contract for its acquisition from the builder. The applicant had brought a separate suit, seeking a court order declaring the preliminary contract with the builder final. However, that suit was still pending. The spouses had lived in the flat since 1997, but even assuming that the applicant\u2019s former husband had not done so throughout the entire period, this had been due to his dereliction of the duty to cohabit with his wife. The applicant and her child could not live in the flat in \u201cBorovo\u201d, because this was not the former matrimonial home, and this would mean cohabiting with their former inlaws, with whom they did not have good relations.",

In the beginning of its twoandahalf page opinion it observed that the applicant had not made submissions in the proceedings before it. It found no indication that the spouses had obtained title and thus acquired the flat in \u201cStrelbishte\u201d during the marriage; there was merely a preliminary contract in respect of it. The date of delivery of the flat was irrelevant. Therefore, point 2 (b) of interpretative decision no.\u00a012/1971 (see paragraph 18 below) was not applicable. However, even if the spouses had acquired the flat during the marriage, it would not have become the matrimonial home, because it had not been acquired in order to fulfil the family\u2019s housing needs. Where a home had not been acquired for such purpose, point 2 (b) was inapposite on account of the repeal in 1991 of a communist-era statute restricting the number of properties which an individual was allowed to own. Thereafter, the contribution of funds by both spouses could be of importance solely for the existence or otherwise of a joint title to a home acquired during the marriage, not for its designation as the matrimonial home. The former matrimonial home was the flat in \u201cBorovo\u201d, as the spouses had lived there before their de facto separation in 1995. Since the couple\u2019s child was already an adult and since the applicant shared some of the responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage, the use of the former matrimonial home was to be given to her former husband.",

In this context, the Court has stressed the importance of appearances in the administration of justice, but it has at the same time made clear that the standpoint of the persons concerned is not in itself decisive. The misgivings of the litigants with regard to the fairness of the proceedings must be capable of being found objectively justified (see Kraska v. , 19 April 1993, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 254B).",

On this point, it should be observed that in the beginning of its judgment this court mentioned that the applicant had not made any submissions, thus implying that it had not had regard to the memorial. However, its reasoning makes it clear that it dealt with all substantial issues in the case and addressed the main arguments raised in the memorial filed by the applicant\u2019s counsel, namely, the applicability of interpretative decision no. 12/1971, the question whether or not the spouses had acquired the flat in \u201cStrelbishte\u201d during the marriage, and the question whether or not the applicant\u2019s financial contribution was relevant in this context (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). It is not the Court\u2019s task to verify whether these rulings were correct in terms of Bulgarian law, because, not being a court of appeal from the national courts, it cannot deal with errors of fact or law allegedly made by them (see, among many other authorities, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.  [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I; and Cornelis v. the  (dec.), no. 994/03, ECHR 2004V (extracts)). It is sufficient to note that the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Cassation shows that it was aware of the arguments raised in the memorial. It is moreover clear that the memorial actually featured in the court\u2019s case file (see, as an example to the contrary, Quadrelli, cited above, \u00a7 34) and that the applicant\u2019s counsel was aware of this fact (see paragraph 16 above).",
