Having regard to the sensitive nature of the matter and its importance for the applicant\u2019s enjoyment of his parental rights, the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had proceeded with the matter over a long time (for more than four years) and inefficiently (it had stayed the proceedings, delivered an arbitrary enforcement decision on the first occasion, and had taken lengthy procedural steps). Notably, the Constitutional Court emphasised that it was precisely the passage of time which had led the District Court to dismiss enforcement of the return order. It also reproached the District Court for the inadequate way it had dealt with the mother\u2019s procedural requests. It further stressed the particular nature of the enforcement of such return orders and pointed out that they required prompt and efficient decisionmaking that was in accordance with international standards.",

There, the Court laid out a series of principles which have essentially been reproduced in most of the cases on the non-enforcement of return orders that have followed. First of all, the Court established that Article 8 includes a parent\u2019s right to have measures taken with a view to his or her being reunited with his or her child and an\u00a0obligation on the national authorities to take such action. In implementing such measures the authorities should take into account the best interests of the child, which are considered in terms of the possibility of using coercive measures to enforce return (\u00a7 94). The positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of the Brussels II bis Regulation and the Hague Convention (\u00a7 95). The adequacy of a\u00a0measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation. Proceedings relating to the execution of a decision that has been delivered require urgent handling, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between children and the parent who does not live with them (\u00a7 102). Also, the Court has defined its role in such cases as considering whether the measures taken by the domestic authorities were \u201cadequate and effective\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 108 and 113).",

A more rigid approach is called for, which obliges States to put into place a remedy which is at the same time preventive and compensatory (see Macready v. the Czech Republic, nos. 4824/06 and 15512/08, \u00a7 48, 22 April 2010; Bergmann v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a08857/08, \u00a7 45, 27 October 2011; and Furman v.\u00a0Slovenia and Austria, no. 16608/09, \u00a7 95, last sentence, 5\u00a0February 2015). The Court has observed in that regard that the State\u2019s positive obligation to\u00a0take appropriate measures to ensure an applicant\u2019s right to respect for his or her family life risks becoming illusory if the interested parties only have at their disposal a compensatory remedy which could only lead to an a\u00a0posteriori award of monetary compensation (see Kuppinger v. Germany, no. 62198/11, \u00a7 137, 15 January 2015, and Macready, cited above).",

In the present case the enforcement courts have already found, in a decision that for now remains final and binding (see paragraphs 24-26 above), that the return of the children is not in their best interests.
