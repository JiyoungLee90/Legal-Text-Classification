[GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 1999VII, and Ryabykh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051). In the specific context of supervisory review in criminal cases, the Court has previously held that this requirement is not absolute and that any decision deviating from the principle must be assessed in the light of Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case due to the emergence of new facts, or where a fundamental defect is detected in the previous proceedings which was capable of affecting the outcome of the case (see, for example, Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-57, and Savinskiy v. , no.\u00a06965/02, \u00a7\u00a023, 28 February 2006).",

In particular, the Court has to assess whether, in a given case, the power to launch and conduct a supervisory review was exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of an individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice. In other words, a review of a final and binding judgment should not be granted merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case, but rather to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice.",

The fear of an abuse of process is even more serious in situations where, such as in the case at issue, the prosecution authorities, having been fully aware of the alleged deficiencies in the investigation (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) and free to request the first-instance and appeal courts to remit the case for an additional investigation at earlier stages of proceedings prior to the adoption of a final judgment in the case (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above), choose not to avail themselves of this opportunity and have recourse to an extraordinary remedy instead.",
