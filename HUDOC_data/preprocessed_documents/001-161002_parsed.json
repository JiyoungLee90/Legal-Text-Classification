Moreover, even in doing so, it seemed to have completely ignored the remaining conclusions of the RODK\u2019s experts, namely that the child, who was apparently adaptable, was in good physical and psychological health, was emotionally attached to both parents, and perceived Poland and the United Kingdom as on an equal footing (see paragraph 16 above).",
