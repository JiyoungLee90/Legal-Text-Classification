Moreover, there was a high risk of the applicant attempting to influence the victims, particularly since two other coaccused had been convicted of having threatened the victims. The Government also submitted that the applicant had absconded in the past and that there was a serious risk that he would go into hiding again. They further underlined the complexity of the case which had involved 12 coaccused and concerned multiple offences of rape and false imprisonment of 5\u00a0victims, some of whom were minors.",

Regard being had to the fact that the applicant had been charged with group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment, the particular vulnerability of the victims, some of whom were minors, must be seen as relevant. The Court notes in this connection the Government's assertion that two of the co-accused had been convicted of threatening the victims and their families in order to force them to withdraw the charges. Accordingly, the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or other co-accused can reasonably be considered to have been high, as found by the domestic courts.",
