Thus it was a classic example of organised crime, by definition presenting more difficulties for the investigation authorities and, later, for the courts in determining the facts and the degree of responsibility of each member of the group. It is obvious that in cases of this kind, continuous control and limitation of the defendants' contact among themselves and with other persons may be essential to avoid their absconding, tampering with evidence and, most importantly of all, influencing, or even threatening, witnesses. Accordingly, longer periods of detention than in other cases may be reasonable (see, B\u0105k v. , no.\u00a07870/04, \u00a7\u00a056, 16 January 2007).",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending (see, G\u00f3rski v , no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7 57, 4 October 2005). It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably have considered that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone, or in conjunction with the other grounds relied on by the authorities, cannot constitute a \u201crelevant and sufficient ground\u201d for holding the applicant in detention for a considerably long period.",

The Government failed to provide an explanation for the trial court's inactivity during this period.
