The first applicant, who was also attacked in the incident, was not killed.

It is clear that the first applicant sustained severe injuries to her head, which were regarded as life-threatening (see paragraph 8 above).

On 13 January 2012 the public prosecutor indicted S.G. and F.T. on charges of aggravated robbery. On 7 June 2012 the trial court convicted S.G. and F.T. and sentenced them to a prison term of six and five years, respectively. It considered that the acts committed by S.G. and F.T. were of such a nature that incarceration was necessary on the grounds of the risk they posed to public security. This judgment became final on 26\u00a0November 2012 being confirmed on appeal (see paragraphs 6-12 above), which was a year and one month after the incident. By the judgment of 12\u00a0March 2013, the above judgments were both confirmed by the Supreme Court. The applicants did not criticise either the conduct of those proceedings or the outcome. Nor does the Court, which considers that the imperative of establishing the circumstances of the case and the persons responsible, was satisfied in this case. Accordingly, the Court is of the view that the authorities of the respondent State fulfilled the procedural obligations that arose under Article 2 with respect to the criminal proceedings (see Zoltai v.

The Court cannot discern what was the purpose of that communication and whether it was necessary in the circumstances of the case. However, it observes that three letters of the enforcement judge remained unanswered.

The delays indicated above, which are entirely attributable to the authorities, cannot be regarded as reasonable. The particular circumstances of the case required a swifter response from the authorities. The Court therefore concludes that the system of the respondent State with respect to enforcing custodial sentences (see paragraph 17 above) did not prove efficient in the present case. The unjustified delays in enforcing the judgment were not in conformity with the State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention irrespective of whether F.T. had, after his conviction, demonstrated any hostility against the applicants.",
