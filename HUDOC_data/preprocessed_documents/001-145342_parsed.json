Indeed, his allegations were deemed to be worthy of a full investigation by the Tarsus Assize Court, which quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to investigate and ordered the prosecutor to file criminal charges against the police officer (see paragraph 20 above). Subsequently, on the basis of the applicant\u2019s allegations, the police officer was indicted and put on trial (see paragraph 21 above). In light of the above, the Court considers that the applicant brought to the attention of the national authorities an arguable claim which obliged those authorities to carry out an effective investigation as required by Article 3 of the Convention (see Dursun \u00c7evik v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57406/00, 10 October 2006). The Court will now turn to examine whether or not this was done.",
