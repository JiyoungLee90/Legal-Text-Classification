Her calculation was based on the bailiff\u2019s report valid at the relevant time (paragraph 7). During the court hearing the bailiff called by the applicant appeared with a new report, calculated on the basis of new information submitted by the defendant. There is nothing to suggest that in the course of the proceedings the applicant was unable to challenge the report or to submit any relevant data. The judge heard both parties and bailiff responsible for the calculation, assessed the information at hand and gave his judgment; and as with the majority, we see no reason to blame the first instance court. However, the majority criticised the Court of Appeal for a failure to address, specifically, the applicant\u2019s submission that the bailiff\u2019s report, which served as the basis for the first instance court\u2019s judgment, was challenged by the applicants in separate proceedings. According to the majority, this failure amounts to the breach of the proper administration of justice principles established in the Court\u2019s case-law (paragraph 54). We cannot subscribe to this conclusion. The role of the Court of Appeal is to correct errors that occurred at the first instance court, to check if the latter properly applied law to the facts before it. It can, of course, take into account new facts; but the decision on the applicant\u2019s complaint against the bailiff\u2019s report was taken on 24 May 2006, whereas the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment one day earlier, on 23\u00a0May 2006 (paragraphs 11 and 19). The Court of Appeal thus did not have sufficient grounds (a new fact) at the relevant time to quash the first instance judgment for being erroneous factually or procedurally flawed.",

Criticising the Court of Appeal for a failure to address one of the applicant\u2019s argument, albeit an important one, may be interpreted as going beyond this Court\u2019s competence and acting as a \u201cfourth instance\u201d court, in circumstances where the decision does not appear to be arbitrary in the sense of having a complete lack of reasoning.",
