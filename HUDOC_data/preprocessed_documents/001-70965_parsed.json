The Court has accepted such exceptional circumstances in cases where proceedings concerned exclusively legal or highly technical questions (see \nSchuler-Zgraggen\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series\u00a0A\u00a0no.\u00a0263, p. 19-20, \u00a7 58; Varela Assalino v.

In particular, the Court had regard to the rather technical nature of disputes over benefits under social-security schemes and has repeatedly held that in this sphere the national authorities, having regard to the demands of efficiency and economy, could abstain from holding a hearing if the case could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, amongst others, D\u00f6ry v. Sweden, cited above).",
