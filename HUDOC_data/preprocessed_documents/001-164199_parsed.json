In another civil case (no. 22\u0446- 628) the Chernivtsi Court of Appeal took a similar approach in its decision of 27\u00a0July 2006, holding that the time-limit for lodging a statement of intent to appeal against the first-instance decision of 6 July 2006 had expired on 11\u00a0July 2006. However, in its decision of 14 July 2006, which also concerned a civil case (no. 22-2324), the Lugansk Court of Appeal held that the last day for lodging a statement of intent to appeal against the first-instance court\u2019s decision of 5 June 2006 had been 9 June 2006.",

Thus, it was not unreasonable for the applicant to have expected that the five-day time-limit applicable in his case would start running on 3 June 2006, which was the day after the decision of 2 June 2006, and end on 7 June 2006, which was the fifth full day of the time-limit.

Nor did the decision of the Supreme Court provide an explanation in that regard.

It was not demonstrated that a new claim concerning the same matters as the applicant\u2019s initial civil claim would have been examined by the civil courts, having regard in particular to the general three-year time-limit for lodging civil claims, whereas, as it transpires from the relevant regulations, proceedings resulting in a decision refusing to examine a claim did not stop that time-limit from running (see paragraphs\u00a019-20 above). In any event, in the circumstances it is not justified to require the applicant to launch a new set of civil proceedings in order to remedy the situation created by the courts\u2019 problematic approach to the calculation of time-limits for appeals.
