The present case can thus be contrasted with Association for Solidarity with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and Others v. Turkey, in which the domestic authorities did not only fail to grant a permit but also closed down the applicant\u2019s religious site; with Manoussakis and Others v.

Article 9 would be deprived of its meaning if a religious community were unable to have a place suitable for it to collectively manifest its religion and engage in its religious practices. In finding a violation in the present case, the Court is not deciding that the respondent State must cease to act in a given manner so as to allow the applicant community to enjoy its Article 9 rights \u2013 in fact, the applicant community already enjoys de facto use of the property in question \u2013 but rather the Court is finding that the respondent State ought to act in such a way as to enable and empower the applicant community to fully enjoy its rights under Article\u00a09. To put it differently, the majority should have asked themselves if the absence of any action by the domestic authorities would have resulted in a violation of the Convention. Had the Council omitted to take any decision regarding the request, it would be at fault, because the Regional Court had acknowledged the applicant\u2019s right to be awarded the lease and in consequence imposed on the City Council a legal obligation to accord it. In other words, the applicant\u2019s right to be accorded the lease and the City Council\u2019s positive obligation to accord it are two sides of the same coin, with no margin of appreciation remaining for the respondent State.",

Given that the Regional Court found the Council to have acted unlawfully when refusing to grant the applicant community\u2019s lease request, the City Council should have acted diligently in order to comply with the Regional Court\u2019s decision and award the requested lease as soon as possible. Thus, neither any competing interests of the neighbours nor town planning considerations could be invoked by the City Council to refuse once again to grant the applicant community\u2019s request for a lease.",
