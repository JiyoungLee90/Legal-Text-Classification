In his appeal, he complained that he had been found guilty even though he had not committed the alleged offences. He noted that under Article 39 of the Constitution a demonstration could be held subject to notifying the authorities and any restrictions on holding one could be imposed only by a court; no permission had therefore been required. He also noted that he had notified the City Council twice about the gathering in question and at the time it was held there had been no court decision prohibiting it. Therefore, he considered that he had organised the gathering of 12 October 2010 lawfully and the conclusions of the first-instance court that he had \u201cheld a meeting without permission of the City Council\u201d had not been based on law as no such permission was required by domestic law. He further challenged the conclusion of the police that he had notified the authorities about the event only a few hours in advance, claiming that he had already done so on 17 August 2010. Furthermore, in his opinion, even the requirement of notification two days in advance, which had been established by the procedure for organising and holding meetings, rallies, street marches and demonstrations in the city of Lviv and to which the police referred in their reports on administrative offences, was not based on law, as the Constitutional Court in its decision of 19 April 2001 had decided that the procedure for such notification had to be a matter for legislative regulation.",

The court noted that the findings of the first-instance court as to the applicant\u2019s guilt were well-founded and corresponded to the factual circumstances of the case. Those findings, in the court\u2019s opinion, were confirmed by the police reports and other explanations and evidence.

Armenia, no. 6562/03, \u00a7\u00a043, 11 January 2007). From the materials of the case and the applicant\u2019s submissions it is clear that there is no single view on the applicability of the 1988 Decree and the existence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for organising and holding peaceful demonstrations. The practice of the domestic courts also reveals inconsistencies in this sphere (see paragraph 33 above). It is true that the Constitution of Ukraine provides for some general rules as to the possible restrictions on the freedom of assembly, but those rules require further elaboration in the domestic law. The only existing document establishing such a procedure is the 1988 Decree, whose provisions are not generally accepted as the valid procedure for holding demonstrations and which provides, as is confirmed in the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 34 to 36 above), for a different procedure from the one outlined in the Constitution. Indeed, whilst the Ukrainian Constitution requires advance notification to the authorities of an intention to hold a demonstration and stipulates that any restriction thereon can be imposed only by a court, the 1988 Decree, drafted in accordance with the Constitution of the USSR of 1978, provides that persons wishing to hold a peaceful demonstration have to seek permission from the local administration which is also entitled to ban any such demonstration. From the preamble of the Decree it is clear that it had been intended for a very different purpose, namely for only certain categories of individuals to be provided by the administration with facilities to express their views in favour of a particular ideology, this in itself being incompatible with the very essence of the freedom of assembly guaranteed by the Ukrainian Constitution and the Convention. As found by a domestic court (see paragraph 36 above), demonstrations under the 1988 Decree were considered on the basis of their compatibility with \u201cnon-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects\u201d. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the \u201cprocedure\u201d referred to in Article 185-1 of the Code on Administrative Offences was formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, Mkrtchyan, ibid.). Nor do the procedures introduced by the local authorities to regulate the organisation and holding of demonstrations in their particular regions appear to provide a sufficient legal basis, for the same reason \u2013 there was no general Act of Parliament on which such local documents could be based and the domestic courts moreover doubted the validity of such local decisions (see paragraph 34 above).",

Whilst the Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework during a transitional period, it cannot agree that a delay of more than twenty years is justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake. The Court thus concludes that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not prescribed by law.",

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 335B, and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0335C).

Greece, 25 May 1993, \u00a7 52, Series\u00a0A no. 260A).

Belgium, 18 June 1971, \u00a7 93, Series A no.\u00a012). In sum, the \u201claw\u201d is the provision in force as the competent courts have interpreted it (see Leyla \u015eahin v.  [GC], no.\u00a044774/98, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2005-XI).",

These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty that the offence in question carries (see Achour [GC], cited above, \u00a7 41). An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation thereof, what acts and omissions will render him criminally responsible and what penalty will be imposed for the act and/or omission in question (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, \u00a7 29). Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of \u201cforeseeability\u201d where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, \u00a7 35, and Achour [GC], cited above, \u00a7 54).",

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7 49, and Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7 40).

In the absence of clear and foreseeable legislation laying down the rules for the holding of peaceful demonstrations, his punishment for breaching an inexistent procedure was incompatible with Article 7 of the Convention.

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant\u2019s position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court\u2019s findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028957/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2002-VI; Lukenda v.

This obligation has been consistently emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments (see, for example, ResDH(97)336, IntResDH(99)434, IntResDH(2001)65 and ResDH(2006)1). In theory it is not for the Court to determine what measures of redress may be appropriate for a respondent State to take in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. However, the Court\u2019s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a shortcoming found in the national system of protection of human rights (see Driza v.\u00a0Albania, no. 33771/02, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2007XII (extracts)).",
