In fact, the first-instance court dismissed A.N.\u2019s action against the applicant on precisely that ground (see paragraph 8 above). In spite of that, the Economic Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice remained silent on the applicant\u2019s objection as to the admissibility of the claim. In the absence of a specific and express reply, it is impossible to ascertain whether these courts simply neglected to deal with the submission that the action was out of time or whether they intended to dismiss it and, if that was their intention, what their reasons were for so deciding (see Ruiz Torija, cited above, \u00a7 30; Hiro Balani v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 303B; and Lebedinschi v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 41971/11, \u00a7 35, 16 June 2015).",

Nevertheless, the Court also finds other aspects of the proceedings problematic. In particular, when A.N. presented evidence which, on the face of it, seemed very suspect, both the Economic Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Justice refused without any explanation the applicant\u2019s legitimate request to have an expert authenticate the document in question and confirm or reject his allegation that his signature had been forged. The issue of the authenticity of the minutes dated 20 February 2007 ought to have triggered the judges\u2019 concern merely because they were presented very late in the proceedings (see paragraph 10 above), after A.N.\u2019s representative had stated that to his knowledge no such document existed (see paragraph 9 above) and because the applicant had submitted that the signature on them was not his (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). Nevertheless, the domestic courts seemed to be unperturbed by the applicant\u2019s objections, even after he adduced evidence to prove that on 20 February 2007 he had been out of the country and could not have been present at the company shareholders\u2019 meeting.",
