By the fact that counsel for the applicant was sent a copy of the Ministry\u2019s letter, the applicant had been made aware that the offence could constitute a ground for expulsion. The specific procedural rules concerning expulsion of convicted foreign nationals indicated in principle that a decision to expel should be made as soon as possible after conviction with no further right of appeal or after the serving of a sentence had been commenced (section 126 of the Immigration Regulations of 1990).",

In this connection, it referred to the fact that at the date of the Directorate\u2019s expulsion decision the applicant had resided unlawfully in Norway for over six years and had in addition worked without a work permit for large parts of this period. In addition, since his conviction in 1999, he had on three occasions been fined for violation of the Road Traffic Act (on the latter two occasions for driving without a driving license, see paragraph 13 above). Whilst these offences were regarded individually and on principle as being relatively minor, they ought to be viewed in connection with the applicant\u2019s previous conviction for bodily harm, in addition to his failure to respond to the order to leave the country as well as his prolonged unlawful residence and employment throughout several years. These offences, when considered as a whole, indicated a lack of respect for Norwegian law and for Norwegian authorities\u2019 decisions.",

In such instances, however, the best interests of the child might be decisive if the expulsion would constitute an exceptionally great burden to the child (paragraphs 30 to 38 of the judgment). Thus, it was not necessarily a condition in the proportionality assessment that the child be exposed to an exceptionally great burden. Especially in cases concerning less serious offences of the Immigration Act, which to a lesser extent affected the interests of immigration control protected by the Act, it would be appropriate to give precedence to the interests of the child (paragraph 39).",

It further observed that according to an amendment of 23 August 2010 to section 14-1 of the Immigration Regulation, the interest of the children ought to carry such weight that unlawful stay and work for up to two years should normally not lead to expulsion when the foreign national had children in the country. Such a breach of the immigration rules could hardly be viewed as so gross that the proportionality assessment would only exceptionally operate in favour of the foreign national in question. Nor could it be the position that just any offence transgressing the said Regulation could be regarded as so serious as to make the balancing of interests tip only exceptionally in favour of the foreigner or his or her closest persons (paragraph 51).",

Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State\u2019s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest (see G\u00fcl, cited above, \u00a7 38; and Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, \u00a7 39). Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.; Ajayi and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999; Solomon v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5\u00a0September 2000). Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious (see Jerry Olajide Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43279/98, 26\u00a0January 1999; Andrey\u00a0Sheabashov c. la Lettonie (dec.), no. 50065/99, 22\u00a0May 1999). Where this is the case the removal of the non-national family member would be incompatible with Article 8 only in exceptional circumstances (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, \u00a7 68; Mitchell v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24 November 1998, and Ajayi and Others, cited above; Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.).\u201d",

On 7 April 2008, as a consequence of these residence permits to the remainder of the family, the Board altered its decision of 2 March 2007 prohibiting the first applicant to return to Norway indefinitely so as to limit the duration of the prohibition to five years (see paragraphs 27 to 28 above). The question arises whether the first applicant\u2019s expulsion with a prohibition on re-entry for five years failed to strike a proper balance between the applicants\u2019 right to respect for family life, on the one hand, and the public interest in ensuring efficient immigration control, on the other hand.",
