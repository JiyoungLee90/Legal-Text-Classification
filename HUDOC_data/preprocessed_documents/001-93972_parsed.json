However, the  has on many occasions stated that it was of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended by counsel, in spite of having been properly summoned to appear in person. In its judgments of Lala and Pelladoah v. The Netherlands (application nos. 14861/89 and 16737/90, judgment of 22 September 1994, points 34 and 40) and Van Geyseghem v.

Belgium (application nos. 36449/97, 36467/97 and 34989/97, judgment of 20 March 2001), the European Court stated that an accused does not lose this right to be defended effectively by a lawyer merely on account of not attending a court hearing. It is immaterial whether the absence is due to a valid excuse or whether an appeal is possible. It is also immaterial that the defendant was adequately defended in the lower instance. The judgment in the Van Geyseghem case concerned an action for recovery of a higher court judgment which was given in absentia. The applicant, who was an accused in the criminal proceedings, was represented by her counsel in the recovery proceedings. The higher court \"declared the application void\". The proceedings were thus similar to those in  when an appeal is discontinued. On the other hand, in its judgment of Eliazer v. The  (application no. 38055/97, judgment of 16 October 2001, point 35), the  found no violation when counsel was heard and the case was decided thereafter.

It is also clear that when the applicant exercises his right to question or to give legal statements, he cannot be deprived of his right to use legal assistance and that his presence in person in those situations is not necessary. Therefore, the applicant should not be obliged to appear in person under penalty of a default fine unless the outcome of the case might depend on the reliability of his account or his presence in person is necessary for some other reason.",

According to the provisions concerning the proceedings in appeal courts, an appeal court cannot, without any particular grounds, change the district court\u2019s conclusions concerning the evidence if persons meant to be heard as witnesses are absent from the main hearing. The starting point is that a higher instance should have the same possibility to assess the oral testimony as a district court, the correctness of whose judgment is being assessed by the higher instance. This means, inter alia, that the principle of immediate presentation of evidence must be applied also on appeal. It does not follow from the wording of Chapter 26, section 20, subsection 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, nor did it follow from it at the time when the Appeal Court examined the case, that an appeal should always be entirely discontinued when the applicant is absent from the main hearing, even though summoned to appear in person. The court which has the right and the obligation to conduct the proceedings can and indeed must then decide whether the examination of some parts of the appeal by hearing only counsel is necessary or reasonable. When considering this, the court must take into account the applicant\u2019s justified legal expectations. If it becomes clear that the applicant\u2019s presence in person is, in spite of the given order, not necessary, his appeal should not in this kind of situation be even partly discontinued due to his absence.\u201d",

The legislature must accordingly be able to discourage unjustified absences (see Poitrimol v. , 23 November 1993, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 277A). However, it is also of crucial importance for the fairness of the criminal justice system that the accused be adequately defended, both at first instance and on appeal (see Lala v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 297A; and Pelladoah v. the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 297B). The latter interest prevails and consequently the fact that a defendant, in spite of having been properly summoned, does not appear, cannot \u2013 even in the absence of an excuse \u2013 justify depriving him of his right under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention to be defended by counsel (see Lala v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 33; and Pelladoah v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 40). It is for the courts to ensure that a trial is fair and, accordingly, that counsel who attends trial for the apparent purpose of defending the accused in his absence is given the opportunity to do so (see Lala v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 34; and Pelladoah v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

The legitimate requirement that defendants must attend court hearings can be satisfied by means other than deprivation of the right to be defended (see Van Geyseghem v.

As the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Artico v.
