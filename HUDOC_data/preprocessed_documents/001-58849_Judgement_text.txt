The case originated in an application (no. 35401/97) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mr Wolfgang Mauer (“the applicant”), on 23 April 1990.
The applicant was represented by Mr Helmut Blum, a lawyer practising in Linz (Austria). The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Franz Cede, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that in criminal administrative proceedings against  him he did not have a determination of his case by an independent tribunal.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted in accordance with Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 17 November 1998 the Chamber declared the application admissible.
The Chamber decided, after having consulted the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).
On 23 March 1988, the applicant was instructed to inform the police who had parked a car belonging to the applicant in the Schlossgasse in Vienna on 18 March 1988 at 5.30pm.  He failed to provide the information, and on 11 October 1988 was fined 2,000 Austrian schillings (ATS) for the failure, pursuant to sections 134 (1) and 103 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1967 (Kraftfahrgesetz).  The penal notice (Straferkenntnis) was confirmed by the Vienna Regional Government (Amt der Wiener Landesregierung) on 18 May 1989.  On 24 November 1989 a minor error in the penal order was corrected.
The applicant's administrative complaint to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) was ultimately dismissed on 24 January 1990.  The Administrative Court found that the correct provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act had been applied, and further confirmed that the reasons given by the applicant for not having supplied the required information were inadequate.
Section 103 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1967 entitles the competent authority, inter alia, to require the registered owner of a motor vehicle to communicate the name and address of a person who has used the vehicle at a specific time.
Under section 134 (1) it is an administrative offence (Verwaltungsübertretung) not to comply with the above-mentioned provision, punishable by a fine of up to ATS 30,000 or up to six weeks’ imprisonment in case of default.
