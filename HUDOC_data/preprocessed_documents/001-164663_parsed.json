Its findings of fact can be summarised as follows. The court found that P.\u2019s car had been moving at 30 to 40 km/h. The car had entered the pedestrian zone, which had been marked by a road sign, and had hit the applicant from behind. He had been walking straight and had not contributed in any manner to the accident. P. had been able to avoid collision by manoeuvring or stopping his car, but for whatever reason he had not done so. He had applied the brakes a while after the collision. As a result of the collision, the applicant had received lifethreatening injuries. No mention was made of P. or the applicant being drunk during the accident. The court was also unable to make any conclusive findings as to when the dents on\u00a0P.\u2019s car had been repaired, or whether or not the windscreen had been broken. It concluded that the injuries had been caused to the applicant by P.\u2019s carelessness, but not deliberately. The court sentenced P. to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment, although again he was not required to serve his sentence owing to the expiry of the statutory limitation period for crimes of a less serious nature. The court awarded the applicant RUB 50,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage. As to compensation for pecuniary damage, the court referred the case to a civil court. The Sholokhovskiy District Court specified that although the applicant had produced contracts, receipts and other documents to support his claim for pecuniary damages, he had failed to explain the amounts claimed and the court was therefore unable to make a precise calculation.",

The court\u2019s findings of fact were almost identical to the findings of the criminal court. It concluded that\u00a0P. had been fully responsible for the injuries caused to the applicant. As to the amount of pecuniary damages, the court noted that the applicant had only been on a waiting list for future employment and had not received an actual job offer. At the time of the accident he had been unemployed. Moreover, it could be seen from the material in the case file that he could not have obtained a job as a naval operator mechanic on overseas voyages in 2002 owing to a lack of previous work experience and his poor English. Furthermore, the applicant had a chronic kidney problem, which would have prevented him from going overseas. As a result, the court calculated the applicant\u2019s loss of earnings as five times the minimum wage and took into consideration the \u201cminimum subsistence level\u201d which existed at the relevant time in the area where the applicant lived. The resulting amount for loss of earnings for the period under consideration was RUB 117,645 (approximately EUR 3,415). The court also ordered that the defendant pay him RUB\u00a02,690 (approximately EUR 80) every month until the next expert examination of his health. The court also partially satisfied the applicant\u2019s claims concerning the reimbursement of his medical expenses (RUB\u00a05,321) and his and his father\u2019s travel expenses connected to consultations in Moscow clinics (RUB\u00a04,070) and the cost of those consultations (RUB\u00a023,265). The part of the applicant\u2019s claim related to his special diet, treatments, legal and postal expenses and so forth were dismissed by the court as unnecessary, unsubstantiated, or not actually incurred. In particular, the court held that further treatment in Germany had not been proven necessary by the plaintiff.",

The applicant relied on a letter from the employment assistance agency Panigo, which had offered him employment on a ship with a salary of USD 2,500 per month.

Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 73, 24 May 2011).",
