These working groups consisted of experts and \u201cspecialists\u201d of the relevant State authorities, most of whom were employees of the Centre of Forensic Science of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the State Register of Immovable Property and other agencies. Before taking up their duties as working group members, they had been trained by experts with the \u201cappropriate knowledge and experience in the relevant field\u201d. Secondly, the electoral law required that a working group meeting had to be open to the public, that the nominated candidate be given the opportunity to attend if he or she wished to do so, and that the working group\u2019s documents on the results of examination of signature sheets be made available to the nominated candidate twenty-four hours before the electoral commission met to decide whether to register the candidate. Thirdly, the law required the working group to indicate the basis for invalidating signatures. Fourthly, the nominated candidate had a right to lodge appeals with the CEC and courts against a decision refusing the registration. All of the above combined to form a sufficient body of safeguards preventing arbitrary refusals to register candidates.",

In particular, the Court noted the existence of serious concerns regarding the impartiality of the electoral commissions, a lack of transparency in their actions, and various shortcomings in their procedures (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 60-61); a lack of clear and sufficient information about the professional qualifications and the criteria for the appointment of working-group experts charged with the task of examining signature sheets (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64); failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take any further investigative steps to confirm the experts\u2019 opinions on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures (ibid., \u00a7\u00a065); systematic failure by the electoral commissions to abide by a number of statutory safeguards designed to protect nominated candidates from arbitrary decisions (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 66-68 and 69); failure by the electoral commissions and courts to take into account the relevant and substantial evidence submitted by the candidate in an attempt to challenge the findings of the workinggroup experts on the authenticity or otherwise of signatures (ibid., \u00a7 69); and the failure by the domestic courts to deal with appeals in an appropriate manner (ibid., \u00a7 70).
