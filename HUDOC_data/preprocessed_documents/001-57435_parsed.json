In the applicant\u2019s view, the preparatory work to Section 9 showed that consultation should extend to every representative organisation which protected the occupational interests of staff governed by particular staff regulations.  Claiming that three quarters of the men in the municipal police belonged to it and that the force had its own regulations and constituted a corps within the personnel of the municipalities; the applicant thus maintained that it was representative in a twofold way, the number of its members as compared with the number of municipal policemen and the special character of their functions.

It found \"that in considering the organisations representing the occupational interests of all staff of the provinces and municipalities to be the organisations most representative of such staff, the Decree being challenged is not contrary to the intention of the statute\"; \"that the applicant is in error in still maintaining that the contested provision is contrary to the principle of trade union freedom by making it obligatory for police officers to join political trade unions; that in fact the contested provision does not oblige police officers to join any trade union nor any particular trade union.\"",

Not only is this latter right not mentioned in Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1), but neither can it be said that all the Contracting States in general incorporate it in their national law or practice, or that it is indispensable for the effective enjoyment of trade union freedom.  It is thus not an element necessarily inherent in a right guaranteed by the Convention, which distinguishes it from the \"right to a court\" embodied in Article 6 (art. 6) (Golder judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, para. 36).",

The prudence of the terms used shows that the Charter does not provide for a real right to consultation.  Besides, Article 20 permits a ratifying State not to accept the undertaking in Article 6 para. 1.  Thus it cannot be supposed that such a right derives by implication from Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) of the 1950 Convention, which incidentally would amount to admitting that the 1961 Charter took a retrograde step in this domain.",

In the opinion of the Court, it follows that the members of a trade union have a right, in order to protect their interests, that the trade union should be heard.  Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) certainly leaves each State a free choice of the means to be used towards this end.  While consultation is one of these means, there are others.  What the Convention requires is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11 (art. 11), to strive for the protection of their members\u2019 interests.",

It may be the fact too that this state of affairs is capable of diminishing the usefulness and practical value of belonging to the applicant union.

In particular, there is nothing to show that the authorities intended to confer on the three large trade union organisations, on account of their all being politically committed, an exlusive privilege in the matter; besides, if there existed or were to exist a trade union organisation without political leanings open to all provincial and municipal staff and protecting their occupational interests, the provision at issue would compel the Minister of the Interior to consult that organisation too.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, however, Articles 11 and 14 (art. 11, art. 14) of the Convention do not oblige Belgium to set up for provincial and municipal staff, and for the municipal police in particular, a consultation system analogous to the one in operation for State officials, including members of the criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities and of the gendarmerie.",

These specific matters represent only a part of the matters subject to obligatory consultation.  Moreover, special questions may also arise concerning various other categories of provincial and municipal staff, which, if they were to combine in category based trade unions, would have no right to consultation either.  It is understandable therefore that the Government has not felt bound to make exceptions which might have finished by leaving the rule laid down in Article 2 para. 2 of the Royal Decree of 2 August 1966 devoid of significance.  The Court is of the opinion that the uniform nature of the rule does not justify the conclusion that the Government has exceeded the limits of its freedoms to lay down the measures it deems appropriate in its relations with the trade unions.  The Court considers that it has not been clearly established that the disadvantage suffered by the applicant is excessive in relation to the legitimate aim pursued by the Government.

Non-performance could not, in principle, and special circumstances apart, become excusable merely on the ground of a failure to perform by another party.

The passage quoted in paragraph 3 above contained no answers to them, their essential feature being that they consisted largely of statements of incontrovertible fact, not simply opinion.  The European Convention on Human Rights was a Convention of a highly novel character that had never before been concluded; it did involve the Contracting Parties in obligations of a kind governments had never previously undertaken, and concepts which, only twelve years previously perhaps (before 1940), would have been regarded not only as unthinkable, but as being quite outside the normal framework of international law - particularly as regards the revolutionary notion of the right of the individual to petition in an international forum against his own government; and for these reasons governments, though they caused the Convention to be drawn up, were slow to bind themselves to it as actual parties, and still slower to accept the separately provided for right of individual petition, as to which they have retained the faculty to accept it only temporarily, and to free themselves from it in due course if they so desire.

This is not a tenable view; and with regard to it I believe it is pertinent to remember that the functioning of the European Convention, and of its enforcement and judicial machinery, is watched by non-European Governments who would be even more hesitant to subscribe to the right of individual petition than the European governments were in 1949/50 - as is clearly shown by the continuing lack of any move to introduce a similar concept, or machinery, into the Universal Covenants of Human Rights.  There is a risk in my opinion that such governments would be seriously deterred from ever doing so if it appeared that one of the consequences was liable to be that the limitations which they intended as to the scope of the relevant covenant or convention may not be respected by the organs of enforcement.",

The speaker went on to point out that the article on interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Article 31) made no mention of the intentions of the parties, but rather of the object and purpose of the treaty.  There then followed the passage quoted in paragraph 8 above, preceded by the words, \"therefore, even if it [the European Convention] is regarded as a treaty, one must not be influenced by what governments may have thought\", etc.  This chain of reasoning calls for the following observations:",

Moreover, the Vienna Convention - even if with certain qualifications - indicates, as the primary rule, interpretation \"in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty\"; - and as I have previously had occasion to point out, the real raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the hallowed rule of the textual interpretation of a treaty lies precisely in the fact that the intentions of the parties are supposed to be expressed or embodied in - or derivable from - the text which they finally draw up, and may not therefore legitimately be sought elsewhere save in special circumstances; and a fortiori may certainly not be subsequently imported under the guise of objects and purposes not thought of at the time.

But what I find it impossible to accept is the implied suggestion that because the Convention has a constitutional aspect, the ordinary rules of treaty interpretation can be ignored or brushed aside in the interests of promoting objects or purposes not originally intended by the parties.  Such a view moreover overlooks the patent fact that, even in the case of constitutions proper, and even allowing for certain permissible interpretational differences of treatment between treaties and constitutions as indicated in paragraph 32 of the dissenting part of my opinion in the Golder case, there are rules of interpretation applicable to constitutions, and these rules have in large measure a character closely analogous to those of treaty interpretation.  Thus national courts will interpret their national constitutions - or legislative acts made under them - with reference (inter alia at least) to the intentions of the legislature, or original framers of the constitution, in the sense at any rate that interpretations clearly not contemplated by these, or falling outside the scope of the legislative clause or constitutional provision concerned, will normally be rejected.  Furthermore, at least in all countries in which there is a basic written constitution, it is precisely one of the functions of the courts to characterise, as being \"unconstitutional\", acts, whether of the executive or of the legislature, which are considered to be contrary to or not compatible with the letter or spirit of the constitution, - something which it would be hardly possible to do without taking due account of the factor of \"intentions\".",

But this is a different matter, and quite different from the subservience to policy that seems to have been advocated in recent argument before the Court, in which the speaker terminated his remarks by stating: \"I conclude by saying that law is always the instrument of policy\".  Even allowing for the fact that this remark is here being quoted out of the immediate context, such a conclusion is dangerous unless carefully qualified, - for if taken literally and generally, it would seem to justify the excesses of courts of law in the carrying out of the policies of some of the worst tyrannies in history.

Indeed there is even a certain danger in the express reference in Article 11 (art. 11) to the protection of interests, and to that alone, for it could well suggest that this is the only purpose of a trade union, or at least the only trade union activity that the Convention purports to protect, - which was probably not the intention.  Strictly, the phrase under discussion has a limiting effect and, if interpreted literally, would involve that the Convention conferred a right to form and join a trade union if it was for the protection of the members\u2019 interests, but not otherwise.",

If this is correct the phrase, \"for the protection of his interests\", while it may make certainty more certain, does not strictly add anything of substance that would not already be there.  In thinking this, I do not overlook what was said on behalf of the Commission during the oral hearing in the present case as recorded in the last paragraph on p. 73 of the final record. But persuasive though these considerations may be in themselves, the case of a trade union formed for the protection of its members\u2019 interests seems to me, at least in the present context, to be so very much the usual one as to render other possibilities unreal.",

In considering what the notion of trade union activity comprises for purposes of Article 11 (art. 11), it is perhaps more important, or will at any rate be more fruitful, to enquire what that notion does not include, as much as what it does.  Without going into detail, I believe the distinction to be made, on the basis of a straightforward interpretation of Article 11 (art. 11), is that which can broadly be drawn between, on the one hand, the rights and freedoms of the individual in forming a union and, following on that formation, the activities of the union itself, - and, on the other hand, the obligations of employers, whether in the public or private domain, and of the State in its capacity as such in relation to those individual and union rights, freedoms and activities.  In my opinion, such obligations do not in principle extend beyond the obvious \"counterpart\" obligations to allow or permit and not interfere with, impede or prevent the exercise by individuals and unions of those rights, freedoms and normal activities. (Even here there is an important qualification to be made which I shall mention in a moment.) What the obligations of employers, whether in the public or private sector, or of the State as such, do not, on the basis and wording of Article 11 (art. 11) include, are such things as consultation with unions, negotiation with them, the conclusion of agreements, etc., - still less the granting to the unions or their members of any specific economic or industrial terms.  Whether there is a duty of another kind for the employers to do one or more of these things, is another matter, but it is not a legal duty deriving from either the language of Article 11 (art. 11) or from any reasonable inference to be drawn from that language.",

It follows from this that I must disagree entirely with the view expressed at the end of paragraph 69 of the report of the Commission in the present case, to the effect that the words \"freedom of association\" in Article 11 (art. 11) may legitimately be extended to cover State responsibility in the sphere of labour/management relations - i.e., of relations between labour and management.  This might perhaps be so in certain very limited particular instances; but as a general statement of principle it is far too sweeping.  Even the \"counterpart\" obligation of the employer and of the State, not to prevent or impede normal trade union activity, which I have already mentioned, must be subject to at least one important qualification, - namely that it cannot extend to imposing any duty on the employer or the State to remain passive in the face of strike or other industrial action by the union or any of its members whether acting individually or together.  If there is on the one side a right to engage in strike action and its possible accompaniments, such as picketing etc., (as to which I make no pronouncement), then this must be balanced on the other by a right of lock-out, prevention of \"sit-ins\", withdrawal of certain financial benefits, etc.  The one not only implies, but entails, the other.  This is the principle of \"equality of arms\" which is but another facet of the right of self-defence within the limits of the law - that right which is graphically illustrated through the irony of the saying, \"Cet animal est m\u00e9chant, quand on l\u2019attaque il se d\u00e9fend!\"  Moreover, the principle of action within the law must also operate both ways.  If employers and the State as such, must conform to this, so also must trade unions.  Article 11 (art. 11), whatever it may or may not comprise, cannot validate extra-legal activities, assuming always that the law permits or does not prevent normal trade union activity in the furtherance of industrial interests so long as this is peaceful, non-violent and non-coercitive (apart of course from the natural and inherent pressures resulting or inseparable from the very fact of strike action and its legitimate concomitants).",

In my opinion, so soon as it is established (as the earlier part of the judgment does) that Article 11 (art. 11) does not embody any right for trade unions to be consulted, or any obligation for the authorities to consult them, Article 14 (art. 14) can have no possible sphere of application.  This is because, according to the plain language of that Article (art. 14), it is only the \"enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention\" - [my italics] - that is to be \"secured without discrimination\".  (Here, and before going further, I would interject that, in what follows, I shall, generally speaking, take no separate account of the notion of a \"freedom\" which, in the context, I regard as being merely another way of describing a right, or a way of describing another kind of right - since the notion of freedom to be consulted has no real juridical content - (and see further footnote 15 below)).  To resume, if - as the Court finds \u2013 the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of the members\u2019 interests does not comprise any right for trade unions to be consulted by the authorities, then a right of consultation is not one of \"the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention\", and the issue of discrimination becomes irrelevant.  No question of the discriminatory or non-discriminatory application or enjoyment of a right can arise unless that right itself exists in the first place, to be conceded whether discriminatorily or not.  Otherwise Article 14 (art. 14) has nothing to bite upon.  Where no right at all exists, but only a certain voluntary practice (of consultation), the practice may be exercised discriminatorily, but this cannot be a breach of Article 14 (art. 14), which only enjoins non-discrimination in the enjoyment of \"rights and freedoms\", not of mere voluntary or discretionary, and non-binding practices.",

As indicated in footnote 10 above, the right to consultation as it has arisen in these proceedings, and in the form which it takes in the National Union of Belgian Police complaint, is quite a different thing from a right to be heard - (i.e., if the union asks to be): it is a right to be consulted on the initiative of the employer or the State, even if it has not asked to be heard.  This is a vastly different thing.  The Belgian Government is not refusing to hear the applicant union: it is failing to consult it in the way it does certain other unions.  Whether or not the right to be heard is enshrined by implication in Article 11 (art. 11), the right to be consulted in the above sense of that term is not - as indeed the Court has found.",

Paragraph 44 of the Court\u2019s judgment is evidently founded on, or derived from, the view expressed in the Belgian \"Linguistics\" case, to which it refers, and some of the language of which it recalls. Granted that it may be difficult to depart from conclusions arrived at in a case that has acquired so much prestige as that one. Nevertheless, the Court, like all international tribunals, and unlike some national ones, is not bound by precedent; and if good reasons arise for doubting whether a particular view previously expressed was correct, the Court should not hesitate to review the matter.  In my opinion the view expressed in the \"Linguistics\" case was seriously incorrect; but before commenting upon it; I will set out the essential passage concerned, which is referred to, but not quoted, in paragraph 44 of the Court\u2019s judgment.  In this passage the Court, as it was constituted at the date of the \"Linguistics\" case (merits), and speaking of \"the guarantee laid down in Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention\", said (paragraph 9 on pp. 33 and 34 of the judgment):",

Moreover the view (correct in itself) that Article 14 (art. 14) should be read as integrally incorporated in each Article of the Convention, \"laying down rights and freedoms\" - i.e., in which these are \"set forth\", can only emphasise that they must be set forth there before the non-discrimination obligation can come into play.  Yet in one and the same breath the Court says that there is no obligation for States under Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention to establish such a system - which means that the individual has no right to require it to be established, which in turn means that such right is not, within the terms of Article 14 (art. 14), a right \"set forth in this Convention\" which again means that it is not a right in respect of the enjoyment of which non-discrimination is prescribed by Article 14 (art. 14): there is no right to be enjoyed (as of right) and hence no prohibition of discrimination if it is voluntarily accorded by the State.",

The passage from the \"Linguistic\" case which I have been discussing speaks repeatedly of a violation of some Article of the Convention (Article 6, Article 11, etc.) \"in conjunction\" with Article 14 (art. 14+6, art. 14+11).  If this is so, there must be a link - but what is that link?  If the matter in respect of which discrimination is alleged is not one in regard to which some Article of the Convention provides a right or freedom, there is no basis for any link with Article 14 (art. 14).  There can in such a case be no violation of some other Article \"in conjunction with\" Article 14 (art. 14), for the other Article concerned has been found not to comprise the right or freedom concerned, while, as the Court correctly found in the \"Linguistics\" case, the \"guarantee\" contemplated by Article 14 (art. 14) \"has no independent existence\" inasmuch as \"it relates solely to \u2018rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention\u2019\".  How then could the Court hold that there had been a violation of a given Article \"in conjunction with\" Article 14 (art. 14)?  The addition of two negatives cannot make a positive.  There can be no cumulation where there is nothing under either Article, taken by itself, to cumulate.  One cannot cumulate rights or freedoms which, under Article 6, Article 11 (art. 6, art. 11), etc., are not provided for, and which under Article 14 (art. 14), are not independently provided for, but are such as arise solely in respect of rights or freedoms that some other Article does provide for.  In such a case the necessary link is absent, because there is no fundament in either Article to which it can attach.  It is not sufficient to show that Article 11 (art. 11) is an Article that deals in principle or in a general way with trade union activity, or that the subject-matter of a given dispute lies within the field of trade union rights or interests.  This is what the Court is relying on in the present case: but it is not enough.  To suffice it is necessary to show that the particular right in dispute - in this case the right to consultation - is a right conferred by Article 11 (art. 11) as part of that activity.  That is what the Court has found not to be the case.  Hence consultation is not one of the matters to which Article 14 (art. 14) relates.",

It is really an error to speak of a violation of Article 6, Article 11 (art. 6, art. 11), etc. at all, in the context of Article 14 (art. 14), for the whole point of the latter Article is that it operates even where there is no violation of the other Article concerned, provided that this other Article does confer the right or freedom in the application of which there is discrimination.  That is the real purpose of Article 14 (art. 14).  There would usually be no need to invoke that Article (art. 14) if the other Article concerned was itself being violated, irrespective of any discrimination.  In that event the discrimination would only add to the offence - it would not create it.  Article 14 (art. 14) does not require the violation of a right or freedom for its operation but merely its existence under another Article of the Convention; and what it is intended to catch is the case where a right or freedom required by some other Article is being afforded, but in a discriminatory manner.",

The considerations just mentioned equally supply the answer to those who argue that if the view which I take were correct, Article 14 (art. 14) would serve no useful purpose and would add nothing to such a provision as Article 6 (art. 6) or Article 11 (art. 11).  In fact, it of course adds a great deal.  Supposing, contrary to the view correctly taken by the Court in the present case, Article 11 (art. 11) did create a right for trade unions to be consulted by the Government, then what Article 14 (art. 14) would add to that would be that it would not suffice simply to afford this right and to honour this obligation.  It would also, and additionally, have to be done in a non-discriminatory manner.  Otherwise, although there might be no infringement of Article 11 (art. 11), there would be a breach of Article 14 (art. 14).  That is what Article 14 (art. 14) does, though only if the basic right under Article 11 (art. 11) already exists.  In consequence, given that indispensable condition (but not otherwise), Article 14 (art. 14) has a quite definite and important sphere of application and is not in any way rendered a dead letter by the view I take.  Without it, discrimination would be permissible so long as the right itself was not in principle withheld.",

To conclude - apart from the separate point considered in my final paragraph below - it comes to this, that what the Court is really doing here (and the same is true for the \"Linguistics\" case) is to interpret and apply Article 14 (art. 14) as if the words \"set forth in this Convention\" did not figure in it at all, and as if the opening phrase read \"The enjoyment of [all] rights and freedoms shall be secured ...\" etc.  But this would be (contrary to what was correctly held in the \"Linguistics\" case and to the Court\u2019s own statement in the second sentence of the first paragraph of paragraph 44 of the judgment) to set up that Article (art. 14) as an independent autonomous provision under which all discrimination in the general field of human rights would be prohibited.  Such a process may have its attractions, and it may be tempting to follow it. Yet a natural and creditable distaste for discrimination in any form cannot justify a conclusion for which no sufficient legal warrant exists, or can exist.  The Court is not a court of ethics but a court of law.",

Lest I should overlook it, there is one more category of argument that has been advanced in favour of the view taken in the Judgment of the Court - an argument of a wider order, founded on general principles rather than on the actual language of the Convention. General principles of law, it may be said, can, where relevant, properly be applied in the interpretation and application of a treaty provision, provided that the terms of that provision do not clearly exclude them.  Accordingly, the doctrine suggested was that although there may be no obligation to do a particular thing at all, yet if it is done, it must be done in the same manner, and to the same extent, for all concerned, without penalty or favour.  But whether or not any doctrine of that kind has gained currency in other contexts or for certain purposes, it cannot be regarded as established in such a way as to override the clear language of the Convention, which confines the obligation not to discriminate to cases where the right or freedom concerned is one of those \"set forth in the Convention\".  In short, the Convention does exclude the application of this doctrine. Let us also not forget the relevance of one of the oldest parables of our civilisation - that of the labourers in the vineyard.  When those who had \"borne the heat and burden of the day\" complained of being discriminated against because they were paid no more than was paid to those engaged towards the end of the day, the Lord of the Vineyard replied (St. Matthew, cap. 20, vv. 13-15) \"Friend, I do thee no wrong  ...  Take that thine is, and go thy way ...  Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?\"  Ethically, this might not be the last word; but even ethics - let alone law can be stretched too far. If I choose to help my neighbour tidy up his garden, does this mean that, either in law or ethics, I must do the same for all the other residents of the street?  Voluntary processes, such as trade union consultation, cannot be the subject of valid charges of discrimination contrary to law unless some law makes them so.  In the present case the applicable law is the law of or deriving from the Convention, - and the Convention neither makes consultation obligatory nor non-consultation a breach of any of its Articles.  How then can the consultation of some unions but not others, even if that constituted discrimination, be in any circumstances a breach of a right prescribed by the Convention - since no right of consultation is prescribed by it at all?",
