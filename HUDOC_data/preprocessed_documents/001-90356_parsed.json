However, in the Aliyev era of independence, the agrarian sector, like all other sectors of the economy, has been monopolised to serve the interests of peri-governmental circles. With the exception of grain and livestock farming, other leading branches of agriculture have slumped. The productivity level of poultry farming has decreased from 143,000 tonnes in 1995 to 35,000 tonnes in 2002. Viticulture can be said to have been completely ruined, while cotton growing is in such an acute state of decline that within the last 10 years its share in the total agricultural product has decreased from 12-13% to 2%. As a result of appropriation of the cotton-processing industry by a group of monopolists, cotton planters are being seriously exploited. At the moment fourteen of the twenty-one cotton-ginning plants existing in the country are controlled by a company named MKT. This company\u2019s share of all the cotton processed in the country last year was 85%. [A description is given of various specific monopolistic policies pursued by this company.]",

It is sufficiently clear from the article\u2019s context that the latter phrase also referred to J.A. In view of the fact that J.A. was a prominent politician and scientist, the Court reiterates that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a public figure, such as a politician, than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v.

The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible to proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7 42, and Lingens, cited above, \u00a7 46). However, where allegations are made about the conduct of a third party, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertions of fact and value judgments. Nevertheless, even a value judgment may be excessive if it has no factual basis to support it (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2001-II).",

Thus, without examining the question whether it could be considered to be a value judgment, the courts concluded that it was \u201cdeliberately false information\u201d, within the meaning of Article 147.1 of the Criminal Code, which the applicants had been unable to prove. The Court considers, however, that the expressions \u201cmafia\u201d and \u201cagrarian mafia\u201d do not appear to have been used directly in reference to J.A. In the present case, bearing in mind that journalistic freedom covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, \u00a7 46), these expressions may have amounted to an opinion, albeit expressed provocatively, as they represented the applicants\u2019 subjective assessment of the whole set of the allegedly corrupt government practices in the management of agriculture as described throughout the entire article which, as noted above, discussed a number of current problems in the agricultural sector and was not limited only to discussion of J.A.\u2019s activities. As such, in the context of the newspaper article in question, the word \u201cmafia\u201d could arguably be considered as a value judgment rather than a statement of fact. However, in the circumstances of the present case the Court does not find it necessary to make a definitive assessment in this respect, as the determination of this issue is not decisive in the light of the following.",
