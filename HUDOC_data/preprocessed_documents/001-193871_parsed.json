The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110). The Court concluded in Mozer that the \u201cMRT\u201d\u2018s high level of dependency on Russian support provided a strong indication that the Russian Federation continued to exercise effective control and a decisive influence over the Transdniestrian authorities and that, therefore, the applicant fell within that State\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention (see Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110-11).",

For a measure constituting control of use to be justified, it must be lawful (see Katsaros v.\u00a0Greece, no. 51473/99, \u00a7 43, 6 June 2002; Herrmann v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 9300/07, \u00a7 74, 26 June 2012; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, \u00a7 187, ECHR\u00a02012) and \u201cin accordance with the general interest\u201d. The measure must also be proportionate to the aim pursued; however, it is only necessary to examine the proportionality of an interference once its lawfulness has been established (see Katsaros, cited above, \u00a7 43).",
