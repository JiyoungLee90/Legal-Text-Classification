Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that if applicants make a prima facie case of abduction by servicemen, this is sufficient for them to show that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities. It would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many other examples, Aziyevy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7626/01, \u00a7 74, 20 March 2008; Utsayeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 29133/03, \u00a7 160, 29 May 2008; and Khutsayev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a016622/05, \u00a7 104, 27\u00a0May 2010). If the Government fail to rebut this presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part.

Russia, no.\u00a026974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020303/07, \u00a7\u00a076, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v.

This was confirmed by numerous witness statements obtained by the applicant and by the domestic investigation into her disappearance (see paragraphs 29-31, 34, 39, 43, 60-62, 66 and 71 above).

There is no plausible explanation as to what happened to her after that date.",

Article 2 of the Convention may also imply a positive obligation on the part of the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII, and Makayeva, cited above, \u00a7 95).",

Not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For the Court to find a violation of the positive obligation to protect life, it must be established that the authorities knew, or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual\u2019s life from the criminal acts of a third party, and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 55; Medova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 25385/04, \u00a7 96, 15 January 2009; Rantsev v.

None of the key witnesses, such as Mr R.M., the construction workers or the police officers who had participated in the special operation were asked to provide detailed statements on the circumstances of the events. In fact, it was another fifteen days before a criminal investigation was instituted (see paragraph 27 above). It took the investigators months to confirm that the special operation had taken place, despite its wide publicity (see paragraph\u00a013 above) and the service materials confirming it from the outset (see paragraphs 51 and 69 above).

This is true of any criminal abduction and disappearance, but is especially so in the context of relatively widespread unresolved disappearances such as those in the Chechen Republic. An effective and rapid response by the authorities is vital in such cases, and one could reasonably expect that in view of the number of previous similar crimes in the region an adequate system would have been set up by the time of the events in question. However, it appears that this was not the case. The Court finds regrettable the absence of any operative response in the present case, where the authorities were apprised of relatively precise details of unacknowledged detention. It is difficult to reconcile their more than lenient attitude with the apparent seriousness of the threat to the person\u2019s life and with the obligation to protect it from unlawful threats.",

The Court notes that despite the applicant\u2019s complaint, corroborated by the witness statements, other evidence regarding the special operation and the official press release (see paragraphs 13 and 15-18), the investigation was formally opened on 16 November 2009 (see paragraph 27 above). The State servicemen who had participated in the special operation, despite being known through the official press release and operational report (see paragraphs 13 and 51 above), were not identified and questioned until February 2010 at the earliest (see paragraphs 32 and 56 above). The key witnesses to the abduction, such as Mr A.M.B., who had been present during the special operation in the applicant\u2019s house, were not questioned until more than four months after the opening of the investigation (see paragraph 34 above). Critical evidence, such as verification of Ms Zarema Gaysanova\u2019s possible detention after the abduction at the premises of the Leninskiy ROVD and the video footage of the special operation was not obtained by the investigators until 2011 (see paragraphs 68 and 69 above). This, along with the supervisors\u2019 constant criticism of the investigation (see, for example, paragraphs 62 and 63 above) shows that the authorities did not demonstrate necessary diligence in collecting evidence of the crime. In view of the importance of such evidence in a case concerning a person\u2019s unlawful abduction in life-threatening circumstances and subsequent disappearance, this aspect alone justifies the finding of a violation of a procedural breach of Article 2 of the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the investigation was sufficiently independent.",

Turkey [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 70, ECHR 1999-IV, and Velikova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2000VI). This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a factfinding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the wellfoundedness of the applicants\u2019 allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Medova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a076, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000VI).",
