According to the well-established case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, evidence that had been illegally acquired by a third party could generally be used in criminal proceedings, unless it had been acquired through coercion or force. It also had to be considered that the use of the \u201cstolen\u201d data had not infringed the core of the applicants\u2019 private sphere, but their business affairs. Furthermore, the \u201cdata theft\u201d had not primarily infringed the rights of the applicants, but the data-protection rights of the bank from which it had been \u201cstolen\u201d. Thus, the Liechtenstein data was not excluded as evidence and the search order could be based on it. As to the presumed breach of international law, the court added that such a breach would not lead to the unlawfulness of the search warrant, firstly because international law did not grant the applicants any personal rights and secondly because the use of the evidence did not in itself constitute a breach of international law.",

Generally, the courts have to consider all available evidence in order to ascertain objectively whether a defendant is guilty or not, as a State cannot function if it does not guarantee that perpetrators will be prosecuted and convicted (see Federal Constitutional Court, no. 2 BvL 7/71 of 19 July 1972). The prohibition on the use of evidence therefore has to remain an exception (see Federal Court of Justice, no. 3 StR 181/98 of 11 November 1998). Such a prohibition is, however, imperative in the case of a serious, deliberate or arbitrary breach of procedural rules which has systematically ignored constitutional safeguards. Such a prohibition is also imperative where evidence has been obtained in violation of constitutional rights which affect the core of private life (see, inter alia, Federal Constitutional Court, no. 2 BvR 1027/02 of 12 April 2005). Whether there is a prohibition on the use of evidence cannot be decided in a general way, but has to be determined on a case-by-case basis.",

Secondly, the Court must consider the specific circumstances of each case in order to determine whether, in the particular case, the interference in question was proportionate to the aim pursued. The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue are, inter alia: the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure were effected; the manner and circumstances in which the order was issued, in particular whether any further evidence was available at that time; the content and scope of the order, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the safeguards implemented in order to confine the impact of the measure to reasonable bounds; and the extent of possible repercussions on the reputation of the person affected by the search (see Buck v.

However, whilst a highly relevant consideration, the fact that an application for a warrant has been subject to judicial scrutiny will not in itself necessarily amount to a sufficient safeguard against abuse. Rather, the Court must examine the particular circumstances and evaluate whether the legal framework and the limits on the powers exercised were an adequate protection against arbitrary interference by the authorities (see Cronin v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15848/03, 6 January 2004).",

Furthermore, the person concerned may also challenge the legality of a search warrant in cases where the order has already been executed (compare Buck, cited above, \u00a7 46). The Court notes lastly that, under the settled domestic case-law, even though there is no absolute rule that evidence which has been acquired in violation of procedural rules cannot be used in criminal proceedings, the Federal Constitutional Court held that the use of evidence was prohibited in cases of a serious, deliberate or arbitrary breach of procedural rules which systematically ignored constitutional safeguards (see paragraph 28 above).",

The Court further notes that the Regional Court not only assessed whether the search warrant complied with the domestic provisions, but also whether the taking of the Liechtenstein data as basis for the search warrant complied with the settled case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court with regard to the use of evidence in criminal proceedings. Thus the safeguards provided for by German legislation and jurisprudence against abuse in the sphere of searches in general can be considered both adequate and effective and to have been complied with in the instant case.",

As such, tax evasion constitutes a serious offence; a fact underlined in a case such as this where the suspected tax evasion related to the sum of approximately EUR 100,000 (see, in this regard, the OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, developed in 1988 and amended in 2010, according to which the tackling of tax evasion forms a top priority for all member states). Furthermore, in this field - the prevention of capital outflows and tax evasion - States encounter serious difficulties owing to the scale and complexity of banking systems and financial channels and the immense scope for international investment, made all the easier by the relative porousness of national borders (compare Cremieux v. France, no. 11471/85, \u00a7\u00a039, 25 February 1993; and Funke, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

The search warrant therefore appears to have been the only means of establishing whether the applicants were in fact liable for tax evasion (contrast Buck, cited above, \u00a7 49). It is the gist of the applicants\u2019 complaint, in this context, that the search warrant had been based on evidence which had been obtained by a flagrant breach of international and domestic law and which, therefore, should have been excluded as a basis for the warrant (see paragraphs 37 and 38 above).",

Furthermore, these sets of criminal proceedings had been instigated on the basis of the present data set (see paragraph 14 above). Thus, no material submitted by the parties indicates that, at the relevant time, the domestic tax authorities were purposely acting in the light of any established domestic case-law confirming that unlawfully obtained tax data could be used to justify a search warrant. Neither does the fact alone that, according to the well-established case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 28 above), there is no absolute rule that evidence which has been acquired in violation of the procedural rules cannot be used in criminal proceedings, imply that the authorities purposely obtained the data in breach of international or domestic law.",

Therefore, the German authorities, in issuing the search warrant, did not rely on real evidence obtained as a direct result of a breach of one of the core rights of the Convention. Moreover, the data carrier contained information concerning the financial situation of the applicants, which they were obliged to submit to the domestic tax authorities, but no data closely linked to their identity (compare G.S.B. v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a028601/11, \u00a7 93, 22 December 2015).",

The Court considers therefore that the search warrant was quite specific in its content and scope, containing an explicit and detailed reference to the tax evasion offence being investigated, with an indication of the items sought as evidence (contrast Roemen and Schmit v.

In the case of Goranova-Karaeneva v. Bulgaria (no. 12739/05, \u00a7 46, 8 March 2011), the Court concluded as follows: \u201cIt is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law ... While the Court should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 8, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law, except in cases of flagrant non-observance or arbitrariness\u201d (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no.\u00a0176\u00a0A; Huvig\u00a0v.\u00a0France, 24 April 1990, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 176 B; and, mutatis mutandis, Galovic v. Croatia, no. 54388/09 (dec.), 5 March 2013, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05861). In the present case (as in any other) the Court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the domestic courts\u2019 rulings (see paragraphs 10-23 of the judgment) were or were not arbitrary, as any arbitrariness will render the interference unlawful (see, mutatis mutandis, Slivenko and Others v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7\u00a7 105-06, ECHR 2002-II).",

I have no doubt that the criminal proceedings started from the moment when the relevant authorities took the first steps in the criminal investigation against the applicant. In many European legal systems the admission in criminal proceedings against the applicant of evidence acquired in violation of criminal procedure laws or of human rights would lead to the removal of this evidence from the case file. In Germany, a very small number of legal provisions contain a ban on the use of evidence. Hence, any prohibition on the use of evidence has to be explicitly provided for by law or result from weighing the public interest in prosecuting the perpetrators of criminal acts against the legal interests of the defendant. We, as judges of the European Court, have to be aware of certain limitations even when our own legal background is different, but in these cases the emphasis should be on two core principles of the European Convention, namely subsidiarity and the margin of appreciation.",
