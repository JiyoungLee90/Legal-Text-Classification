Before the police, he further noted that he had reapplied to the UNHCR.

Furthermore, the Government did not reply to the applicant's submissions that he had not been interviewed in relation to his temporary asylum claim before November 2009. Nor did they submit the documents relevant to this examination. They only submitted that the applicant's request for temporary asylum had been rejected since he was a suspected al-Qaeda member and, therefore, his presence in  endangered national security and public order.

Moreover, the Government failed to demonstrate that the applicant had been served with the decision rejecting his temporary asylum claim and the deportation order. The Court cannot attach weight to their submission that the applicant had been informed about the deportation procedure on 25\u00a0January 2008, since they failed to show that there had actually been a written decision served on him. Besides, following the re-initiation of the deportation procedure on 22 January 2009, the authorities once again failed to notify the applicant. Nor was the applicant ever served with the decision apparently refusing his temporary asylum request. In these circumstances, the Court is led to conclude that the applicant was not afforded an effective and accessible remedy in relation to his allegations that he risked ill-treatment and death in . Finally, as regards the Government's submission that the applicant could have applied to the administrative courts, the Court reiterates that the judicial review of deportation cases in Turkey, as currently practised, cannot be regarded as an effective remedy, since an application for the annulment of a deportation order does not have automatic suspensive effect (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116).",
