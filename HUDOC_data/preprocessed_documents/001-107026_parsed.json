This was the case if a decision could no longer be challenged by a legal remedy. They referred to the Court\u2019s established case-law, according to which a complaint to the Administrative Court was an effective remedy which had to be used correctly in order to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It followed that a decision by the Independent Administrative Panel in administrative criminal proceedings was not a final decision. In proceedings under Article 131 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court acted as a court of appeal on points of law: if it considered a complaint to be well-founded, it quashed the decision and referred the case back to the lower authority. Consequently, the proceedings returned to the status they had had before the challenged decision had been issued. The legal effects of an official complaint were the same as those of a complaint brought by a party before the Administrative Court. In the Government\u2019s view administrative criminal proceedings were therefore not adjudicated with final effect, as long as a remedy against the decision of the Independent Administrative Panel could be lodged with the Administrative Court, be it a complaint by a party or an official complaint.",

Admittedly, Article 131 of the Federal Constitution allows complaints to the Administrative Court only once the parties have exhausted appeals. However, the Court reiterates that its own case-law considers a complaint to the Administrative Court an ordinary and effective remedy which has to be exhausted in order to comply with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for instance, Liedermann v.

In the present case the Independent Administrative Panel\u2019s decision was served on the Federal Minister on 7 August 2002 in the first applicant\u2019s case and on 10 May 2002 in the second applicant\u2019s case, that is at a point in time at which the timelimit for the applicants to complain to the Administrative Court had not yet expired.

In proceedings before the Independent Administrative Panel, the authority issuing the penal order assumes that role (see Weh and Weh v.\u00a0Austria (dec.), no. 38544/97, 4 July 2002). However, that authority does not have the right to lodge a complaint with the Administrative Court against the Independent Administrative Panel\u2019s decision under Article 131 of the Federal Constitution. This remedy is only open to the accused. As the Government explained, the official complaint serves to ensure a correct and uniform interpretation of federal laws by the L\u00e4nder. In contrast to the cases of supervisory review to which both parties referred, no situation arises in which the prosecuting authorities may first make use of an ordinary appeal and subsequently submit the same ground for quashing a decision by way of supervisory review (see Radchikov, cited above, \u00a751) or to submit a supervisory review on grounds which could and should already have been raised by way of an ordinary appeal. The applicants argue that the result of the proceedings following the Federal Minister\u2019s official complaint was to their detriment.

Moreover, the Court has already held in a comparable case that the criminal head of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention applied to proceedings relating to an official complaint, raising the question whether the accused had fulfilled the elements of an administrative offence (see Zuckerst\u00e4tter and Reschenhofer (dec.), cited above). In the present case the official complaint concerned the question whether a calibration error margin should be deducted from the results of the breathalyser test, and consequently whether the applicants were guilty of an offence under sections 5(1) and 99(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act rather than of an offence under sections 5(1) and 99(1)(b). The proceedings before the Administrative Court in connection with the official complaint therefore related to the \u201cdetermination of a criminal charge\u201d.

However, they did not argue that the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim. In that connection the Court observes that the Independent Administrative Panel reduced the fine from EUR 872.07 to EUR 872, the minimum fine for the offence at issue. Clearly, this is not a significant reduction capable of compensating the second applicant for the duration of the proceedings. It is true that the Independent Administrative Panel also reduced the term of imprisonment in the event of default from thirteen days to ten days. However, this reduction, though considerable, had no direct practical effect, as a default prison term may only be enforced if the fine is irrecoverable and a number of other conditions are met, and after the conduct of a separate set of proceedings (see L\u00fcckhof and Spanner v.\u00a0Austria, nos. 58452/00 and 61920/00, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 54, 10 January 2008).
