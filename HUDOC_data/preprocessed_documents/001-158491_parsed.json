Nevertheless, the court considers that the information concerning the character of all three defendants was taken into account at the time of their detention pending trial. To date the circumstances justifying their detention have not changed or ceased to exist. Furthermore, all three defendants are charged with particularly serious and numerous offences. Apart from the three defendants, there are a great number of people prosecuted on the same charges, and they are not in detention. The present case concerns several counts [of fraud] and the court therefore accepts the investigator\u2019s argument that, if released, S., [the applicant] and Kar. would have a real opportunity to interfere with the administration of justice ... [and/or] they might continue their criminal activities or abscond. There is no medical proof submitted that the defendants are unfit for detention in remand prisons.\u201d",

It accepts that the text of the judgment was prepared by the domestic court by 20\u00a0March 2009 and contained the court\u2019s authorisation of the applicant\u2019s detention until the judgment in his case became final. The Court does not lose sight, however, that the judge chose to disclose to the applicant the decision concerning his detention only on 10\u00a0April 2009, that is with more than a twenty days\u2019 delay. Given such a lapse of time, the Court cannot accept that the omission on the judge\u2019s part had no bearing on the applicant\u2019s situation. For more than twenty days, the applicant remained in a state of uncertainty as regards the legal basis for his detention. In the Court\u2019s view, such belated communication to the applicant of the information concerning his detention amounts to its ex post facto authorisation which the Court has consistently held to be incompatible with \u201cthe right to security of person\u201d as it is necessarily tainted with arbitrariness. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (compare, among other authorities, Khudoyorov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2005X (extracts); and Vasiliy Vasilyev v.

In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting the argument that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice.
