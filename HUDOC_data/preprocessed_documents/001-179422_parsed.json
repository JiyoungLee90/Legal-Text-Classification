Belgium (no. 140/10, ECHR 2014 (extracts)) and found to be in violation of Article 3 (inter alia). The second s\u00faplica appeal was lodged on 2 March 2015 and included three different requests. First, he requested that the decision on whether the US guarantees were sufficient be addressed and dealt with by the Plenary of the Audiencia Nacional. He also sought the recusal of three judges who were members of the bench which had initially issued the decision of 24 February 2015.

See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a). A timely admission of guilt is a factor which could reduce the sentence the judge decides to impose following a conviction. In the United States, the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by guilty pleas. Lopez Elorza may seek to reach an agreement with the prosecution wherein he would plead guilty in exchange for certain favorable actions, such as an agreement to allow him to plead guilty to fewer than all the charges in the indictment (with the remainder of the charges to be dismissed at sentencing), or even to lesser charges, or in exchange for the government\u2019s promise to affirmatively recommend to the court that a particular lesser sentence be imposed. The agreement may also include the parties\u2019 recommendation as to the appropriate sentence that - depending upon the type of plea agreement that is negotiated - may or may not bind the judge regarding the sentence that will be imposed. Such agreements are within the discretion of the government to enter into, and the judge may also decline to approve an agreement she or he does not believe to be in the interests of justice. The agreement may include, inter alia, an agreement to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Thus, if Lopez Elorza were willing and able to provide substantial assistance to the United States in the investigation or prosecution of another person who had committed a crime, a plea agreement might include a promise by the government attorneys, in exchange for his guilty plea, to file a motion with the court asking that Lopez Elorza\u2019s cooperation be taken into account and permitting the Court to impose a lower sentence that it might otherwise impose.

Later, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense counsel will be able to present to the judge various mitigating factors to consider that may result in the reduction of his sentence.

The applicant, however, could ask for early release if he provided substantial assistance after his conviction and the imposition of his sentence. In addition, US law also allowed for compassionate release under section 3582 of Title 18 of the US Code. The report specifically stressed that the Bureau of Prisons could reduce the applicant\u2019s sentence if it found that there was \u201can extraordinary and compelling reason to do so; for example, if a medical condition arose with L\u00f3pez Elorza that would warrant such a modification\u201d. Finally, the applicant could also seek executive clemency in the form of commutation (reduction) of his sentence. The report noted that in cases similar to the applicant\u2019s, commutation of life sentences was not \u201ca rare occurrence\u201d.

The purpose of the rule requiring domestic remedies to be exhausted is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judiciary) to address an allegation that a Convention right has been violated and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court. In so far as there exists at the national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, any argument as to an alleged violation of a Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used (see Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2004III). Domestic remedies have not been exhausted when an appeal is not accepted for examination because of a procedural mistake by the applicant.

With reference to the principle already set out in the Kafkaris judgment, the Court pointed out that if a life sentence was to be regarded as reducible, it should be subject to a review which allowed the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner were so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation had been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (\u00a7 119). Furthermore, the Court explained for the first time that a whole-life prisoner was entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence would take place or could be sought. Consequently, where domestic law did not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole-life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arose at the moment of the imposition of the whole-life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration (\u00a7 122).",

Such a situation typically arises when, as in the present case, deportation or extradition has been delayed as a result of an indication by the Court of an interim measure under Rule 39 (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069). Accordingly, in determining whether it has been shown that the applicant runs a real risk of suffering treatment proscribed by Article 3 if he is expelled to the United States of America, the Court will assess the issue in the light of all the material placed before it, or, if necessary, based on material obtained proprio motu (see Venkadajalasarma, cited above, \u00a7 63).

In such situations the individual would have served some of his or her life sentence, which would go some way to addressing the legitimate penological requirements of incarceration of a convicted prisoner, such as punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation (see Vinter and others, cited above, \u00a7 111). However, in the extradition context, where a person is extradited or deported from a Convention State to a non-Convention State and alleges that a future conviction in that non-Convention State will amount to treatment in violation of Article 3, the effect of a violation of Article\u00a03 would be to prevent the extradition. The result, save in the case where the person is prosecuted in the requested State, could be that a person against whom serious charges are made is never brought to trial. Such an outcome would be difficult to reconcile with society\u2019s general interest in ensuring that justice is done in criminal cases (compare Soering, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a086 and 89, and Trabelsi, cited above, \u00a7 117).",
