The Court observes that the first period of the applicant's detention ended on 9\u00a0February\u00a02000 and thus more than six months before the date on which the application was submitted to the Court (25 January 2001). The Court further observes that the parties did not suggest that there was an effective remedy available to the applicant in respect of this part of the application. Accordingly, it has been submitted too late and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
