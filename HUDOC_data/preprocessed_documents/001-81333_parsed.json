He was examined by a doctor on duty, M.E. On the basis of a diagnosis of urticaria (a type of allergic reaction), M.E. ordered the administration of intravenous injections of a drug containing glucocorticosteroid (Dexamethason) and an antihistaminic (Synopen). Further to the administration of injections, the applicants\u2019 son\u2019s condition significantly deteriorated. This was probably a result of him being allergic to one or both of the drugs that had been administered to him. His skin became very pale, he began to tremble and to feel cold; M.E. noticed signs of tachycardia. A diagnosis of anaphylactic shock was made. Subsequently, at 1.30 p.m., he was transferred to intensive care. M.E. ordered the administration of, inter alia, adrenaline. By the time the cardiologist arrived, the applicants\u2019 son had stopped breathing and had no pulse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was given. At an undetermined time around 2.15 p.m. the applicants\u2019 son was connected to a respirator and his blood pressure and pulse returned to normal, but he remained in a coma; his brain was severely damaged.",

However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case.
