The case originated in an application (no. 19124/02) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Ms Gisela Kirsten (“the applicant”), on 1 May 2002.
The applicant was represented by Mr K.H. Christoph, a lawyer practising in . The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialrätin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.
On 2 May 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in .
On 2 July 2002 the  delivered a leading decision on the ballet dancers' allowance. It referred to its leading judgment of 28 April 1999, pursuant to which the pension rights acquired in the GDR fell within the scope of Article 14 of the German Basic Law protecting the right to property provided that the German Unification Treaty recognised them as legal claims within the united German legal system. The impugned allowance did accordingly not fall within the scope of Article 14 of the German Basic Law as Article 9 of the German Unification Treaty prescribed that it would not be transferred into the social and labour legislation of the FRG. Furthermore, there had never been a legitimate expectation that the allowance would be transferred into the united German legal system, as in the legal system of the GDR, the allowance had already amounted to a preferential treatment.

II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE
The German reunification
As a result of the German reunification, which became effective on 3 October 1990, the GDR acceded to the FRG. The relevant domestic law concerning the details of this transition and its legal framework, such as the German Unification Treaty and the laws on the transfer of pension rights, are reproduced in the case of Adam and others v. Germany ((dec.) no. 290/03, 1 September 2005).

The other decisions concerned regular constitutional questions such as the surveillance of telecommunications, the protection of private life (see decision of the Federal Constitutional Court no. 1 BvR 653/96; and Von Hannover v. , no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004VI), issues related to the social law and family law as well as the restricted right of audience (Singularzulassung) before German Appeals Courts (see decision of the Federal Constitutional Court no. 1 BvR 335/97; and Wendenburg and Others v.  (dec.), no. 71630/01, ECHR 2003II).

Article 52 § 4 of the Brandenburg Constitution provides:
On 14 July 1994 and on 28 March 2001 respectively, the  examined constitutional complaints about the length of proceedings before civil and administrative courts. It held that the complaints were admissible but reached in both cases the conclusion that the length of the impugned proceedings did not violate Article 52 § 4 of the Brandenburg Constitution.
