The Court notes that, after communication, the applicant made a number of new submissions concerning \u201cfurther new and continuing violations\u201d stemming from the events that occurred during the subsequent criminal trial and the appeals against his criminal conviction. On page 6 of the applicant\u2019s observations he noted that complaints concerning these \u201cnew and continuing violations\u201d would be the subject of a new application which he intended to lodge with the Court. As it has decided in previous cases, the Court does not find it appropriate to examine any new matters raised after the communication of the application to the Government, as long as they do not constitute a mere elaboration upon the applicant\u2019s original complaints to the Court (see Nuray \u015een v.

Turkey, 22 October 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports\u00a0of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI). Neither is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or discontinuing suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300-A). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182).",

In this connection, the Court notes that, while the severity of the sentence faced is one of the relevant elements in the assessment of the risk of absconding, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81). Moreover, the risk of absconding, which may justify detention, cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors, which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7 106, 8\u00a0February\u00a02005, and Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 43). In the present case, however, the judicial decisions did not go any further than listing the above-mentioned grounds, including the risk of absconding, using a stereotyped formula paraphrasing the terms of the CCrP (compare Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no. 37048/04, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 28, 76 and 79, 13 January 2009, and Farhad Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0191). They failed to mention any case-specific facts relevant to those grounds or to substantiate them with relevant and sufficient reasons. The Court also notes that the courts extending the applicant\u2019s detention repeatedly used the same stereotyped formula and their reasoning did not evolve with the passing of time to reflect the developing situation or to verify whether these grounds remained valid at the later stages of the proceedings.",

This means that the competent court has to examine not only compliance with the procedural requirements of domestic law but also the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest, and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see Brogan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65). Although it is not always necessary for the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Assenov and Others\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 162, Reports 1998-VIII). The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v. Greece, 13\u00a0July 1995, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 318-B). Moreover, equality of arms is not ensured where a detainee or his or her counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order to challenge effectively the lawfulness of the detention (see Lamy v. Belgium, 30\u00a0March\u00a01989, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 151).",

The Court considers that, given what was at stake for the applicant \u2013 that is, his liberty \u2013 as well as the lapse of time between the original hearing and the subsequent extension orders, the courts could have taken steps to ensure that the applicant was heard in person and was afforded an opportunity to convey to the courts his personal situation and arguments for his release (compare, mutatis mutandis, Grau\u017einis v. Lithuania, no. 37975/97, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, 10 October 2000; Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 91, 1 June 2006; and Farhad Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 207).

Although the applicant\u2019s lawyers attended the court sessions held in connection with the examination of his appeals, the Court notes, having regard to the material in its possession, that those court sessions were held as a matter of formality and did not take the form of genuinely adversarial hearings. It is true that the applicant\u2019s lawyers could make their submissions in writing by lodging their complaints on appeal, but this fact does not, in itself, mean that equality of arms was ensured. The Court notes that the prosecuting authority\u2019s submissions in support of the applicant\u2019s detention were not made available either to the applicant or his lawyers, depriving them of the opportunity to comment on those submissions, either in writing or orally, in order to effectively contest the reasons invoked by the prosecuting authority to justify his detention.",

Noting that commission of such criminal offences could entail a sanction of confiscation of property under the Criminal Code, the court ordered the attachment of the applicant\u2019s shares, relying on Articles 248-250 of the CCrP as the basis for such decision. At the time of this attachment order, the applicant was not charged with either of the criminal offences mentioned in the order.

However, having examined these statements in the framework of the present case, the Court considers that the parts of those statements referring specifically to the applicant could not be considered incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 2. In respect of the applicant in the present case, the statements merely contained brief information that he had been arrested and that certain items and cash had been seized from his office. They also mentioned that his office had been used for meetings between Farhad Aliyev and Fikret Yusifov. It is true that the statements did not clarify that, at that time, the applicant had been detained on suspicion of an offence unrelated to the offences allegedly committed by other persons mentioned in those statements. Accordingly, the statements might have been misleading as to the real reasons for the applicant\u2019s arrest. Nevertheless, no wording contained in those statements went as far as declaring the applicant guilty of any criminal offence.",
