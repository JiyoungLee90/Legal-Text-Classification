In a reasoned judgment, the court found it established that the applicant had been involved in at least 15 armed attacks committed prior to 1992, among the 59 incidents of which he was accused. It enumerated the acts to which the applicant had confessed while being questioned by the gendarmes and subsequently by the prosecutor, such as setting fire to three\u00a0primary schools, the robbery of several village guards and clashes with security forces. These acts also corresponded chronologically with each other and with the numerous official documents related to these events. The court further held that these acts would suffice to convict the applicant under Article 125 of the former Criminal Code and underlined that only after several hearings had he contested his initial statements, while choosing to accept his involvement in armed attacks in which terrorists had been killed and denying his implication in those in which members of the security forces had been killed. The court pointed out that the applicant\u2019s argument could not be considered credible in view of the chronology of the events. The court further stated that throughout the criminal proceedings the applicant had consistently and proudly stated that he was a member of the illegal organisation to the point of making propaganda for the organisation, and he had shown no remorse which would indicate the likelihood that he would not repeat such crimes. Finally, it indicated that the applicant even refused the possibility of using Law\u00a0no.\u00a04959 for rehabilitation (certain paragraphs of Article 4 of the cited law foresee sentences varying between 12 and 19 years of imprisonment in replacement of an \u201caggravated life sentence\u201d, according to the authenticity of information provided about the structure of a terrorist organisation or its activities) and accordingly sentenced him to \u201caggravated life imprisonment\u201d.",

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12\u00a0July 1988, \u00a7 45, Series A no. 140). The Court also notes that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce (see Barber\u00e0,\u00a0Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, \u00a7\u00a068, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0146). The Court finally reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 3(d) enshrines the principle that before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes a statement or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7\u00a0118, ECHR\u00a02011).",

In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s request for an additional expert report was rejected by the domestic court as it was decided that the outcome of such a report would not be decisive. This was on the basis that the participation of the applicant in armed attacks before November 1992, the date on which his right hand had become partially infirm such as to not allow him to use a gun, had been established.

The Assize Court found, having regard to the applicant\u2019s conduct during the interviews, that there was no doubt as to the voluntariness of his initial admissions. In particular, it was not convinced that the applicant was of such vulnerability or had been subjected to such pressure during his detention that reliance on the admissions would be unfair.

In this respect, the Court would emphasise that no Article\u00a03 issue could arise if, for instance, a life prisoner had the right under domestic law to be considered for release but was refused on the ground that he or she continued to pose a danger to society. This is because States have a duty under the Convention to take measures for the protection of the public from violent crime and the Convention does not prohibit States from subjecting a person convicted of a serious crime to an indeterminate sentence allowing for the offender\u2019s continued detention where necessary for the protection of the public. Indeed, preventing a criminal from re-offending is one of the \u201cessential functions\u201d of a prison sentence. This is particularly so for those convicted of murder or other serious offences against the person. The mere fact that such prisoners may have already served a long period of imprisonment does not weaken the State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the public; States may fulfil that obligation by continuing to detain such life sentenced prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous.",

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.\u201d",
