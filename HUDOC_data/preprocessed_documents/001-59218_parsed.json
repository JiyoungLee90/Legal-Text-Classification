The NSZ had been founded in September 1942 and, originally, formed partisan forces fighting the Germans during the Second World War.  At the end of 1943 the NSZ\u2019s command, considering that the defeat of the Germans was inevitable, decided that the main enemy was the communist Soviet Union and ordered that, from that time on, the NSZ should direct its attacks against the Red Army and the Polish communist partisan forces.  After the liberation of Poland, some of the NSZ members took refuge in the West, while others, after being ordered not to attack the Red Army directly, established an underground resistance movement against the communist government.  On 10\u00a0February 1948 H.K. was convicted by the Warsaw District Military Court (Wojskowy S\u0105d Rejonowy) in connection with, inter alia, his membership of the NSZ, which was considered an \u201cillegal organisation established with the aim of subverting the political and legal system of the State\u201d.  He was sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment and then served his sentence. He was released on an unspecified date.  On 7 August 1956 he was shot dead by a militia officer.",
