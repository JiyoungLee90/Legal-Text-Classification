Here, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge's conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see the Castillo Algar v.  judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3116, \n\u00a7 45). This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see the Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.  judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports \n1996-III, pp. 951-52, \u00a7 58).",
