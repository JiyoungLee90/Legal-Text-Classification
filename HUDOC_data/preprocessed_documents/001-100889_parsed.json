In a further series of decisions the Supreme Court considered that it would be unfair for the legally-aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within a period of thirty days counted from the day of service of the judgment on the party. The parties waiting for legal-aid services cannot be held at fault for shortcomings in the system. A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it. A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the legal-aid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4\u00a0March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27\u00a0June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local Bar Association (11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17\u00a0November 1998, II\u00a0UZ\u00a0122/98; 11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01;",

The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to the Supreme Court for legally-aided parties genuine and effective.

Consequently, parties were deprived of the opportunity of having their cases examined by the highest judicial authority. Difficulties arising in connection with formulation of cassation appeals resulted in discouraging many lawyers from carrying out their obligation to represent legally-aided parties to civil proceedings.

In particular, the criteria of admissibility of appeals to be lodged with the highest courts could be strict and the procedure more formal than that before the lower courts, without the requirements of Article\u00a06 of the Convention being breached thereby. The mere fact that it was necessary for a cassation appeal to be lodged by a qualified representative was not open to criticism.",

That court had held that a lawyer assigned to a case under a legalaid scheme was entitled to refuse to lodge a cassation appeal in civil proceedings, if he or she was of the view that this remedy offered no reasonable prospects of success.\u00a0\u00a0The Government stressed that the notion of legal aid was not to be understood as providing legal representation in proceedings in all cases. It also comprised the provision of legal advice on the prospects of success offered by a given legal remedy in the particular context of each case. The lawyers' tasks could not be perceived as following their clients' instructions and wishes uncritically and lodging remedies against their better judgment. Nor was it the role of the State to compel lawyers to do so. Hence, the lawyer's refusal had served the purpose of securing the proper administration of justice by the Supreme Court, including ensuring that the case load of that court would not be unreasonably increased by unmeritorious cassation appeals.",
