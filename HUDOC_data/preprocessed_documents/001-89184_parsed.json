Finally, on 9 August 2002 the TGNA abolished the death penalty. Accordingly, in the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the risk of enforcement of the death penalty against the applicant was illusory and that therefore he cannot be considered to have suffered ever-present and mounting anguish at the prospect of being executed, exposing him to treatment going beyond the threshold set by Article 3 of the Convention (see Abd\u00fclmenaf Osman v.
