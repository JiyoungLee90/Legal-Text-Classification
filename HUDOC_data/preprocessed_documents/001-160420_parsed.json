In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been pending for a number of years without leading to any significant progress in uncovering the identities of the perpetrators. While the obligation to investigate effectively concerns the means to be employed and not the results to be achieved, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings in the present case have been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in Aslakhanova and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). The investigation contained several periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crime (see paragraphs 23, 26 and 42 above). No meaningful steps have been taken to identify and question the servicemen who could have witnessed, registered or participated in the detention of the applicants\u2019 relative at the roadblock, in spite of the applicants\u2019 consistent statements to that end (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a016, 35 and 37 above). These measures should have been taken immediately or as soon as possible after the investigation had been initiated. From the documents submitted it follows that in spite of direct orders these crucial steps were not taken by the investigators (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above). Such delays, for which there has been no explanation, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.
