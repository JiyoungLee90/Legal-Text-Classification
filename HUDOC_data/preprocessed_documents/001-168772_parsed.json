In this connection, the Court reiterates that, as regards the existence of such risks, they cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the sentence faced. The risks must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm their existence or make them appear so slight that they cannot justify detention pending trial (compare\u00a0Polonskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a030033/05, \u00a7 147, 19 March 2009). In addition to using the seriousness of the charges as a reason for remanding the applicant in custody, the domestic authorities considered that he might abscond because he had no job or known place of permanent residence. Although the Court might accept these grounds as relevant, it cannot find them decisive given that the judicial decisions authorising the applicant\u2019s detention remained silent as to why those risks could not have been avoided by any other means of ensuring his appearance at trial.",

Similarly, the requirement of a fair trial does not impose an obligation on a trial court to question a witness merely because a party has sought it. It remains for the court to judge whether such a measure would serve any useful purpose (see\u00a0H. v. France, 24 October 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61, Series A no. 162-A). Where the defendant wants a witness to be questioned he must support his request by explaining why it was important for the witnesses concerned to be heard (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 91, Series A no.\u00a022). Lastly, the Court reiterates that the scope of the rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention must, in particular, be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

At trial the court heard several eyewitnesses to the incident (see paragraph\u00a029 above). The applicant claimed that the prosecution witnesses had coordinated their statements and asked the trial to question witnesses who could allegedly confirm that. According to the defence, their witnesses could also confirm that the victim had attacked the applicant and that the latter had not had any visible bodily injuries prior to the fight (see paragraph 26 above). The defence were unable to provide information about the whereabouts of their witnesses. The Town Court rejected the requests as unfounded or irrelevant, noting, inter alia, that it had no legal power to locate witnesses (see paragraphs 16 and 26 above).",

Their submissions were consistent and weighty. The applicant\u2019s conviction was mainly based on the testimony of those six prosecution witnesses, including eyewitnesses to the incident, expert reports and the expert\u2019s explanations given at trial (see paragraph 29 above). The Court considers that even if the submissions of the defence witnesses had been relevant, they were not crucial for determining the applicant\u2019s guilt and, accordingly, could not arguably have led to an acquittal or any other favourable outcome. In the circumstances, and considering the inevitable difficulties the trial court would have faced in identifying certain defence witnesses and establishing their whereabouts if it had agreed to summon them, the Court finds that the refusal to find and summon them did not restrict the applicant\u2019s defence rights to an impermissible extent (see Polufakin and Chernyshev v. Russia, no.\u00a030997/02, \u00a7 209, 25\u00a0September 2008, and Dorokhov v. Russia, no.\u00a066802/01, \u00a7 74, 14\u00a0February 2008). It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
