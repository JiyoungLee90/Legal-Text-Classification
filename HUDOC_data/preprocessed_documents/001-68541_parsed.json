It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2000-VI, and \u00dclk\u00fc\u00a0Ekinci, cited above, \u00a7144).",

However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force or a disappearance may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108-15, ECHR 2001III, and Av\u015far v.
