Thereafter, a UBOP investigator had interviewed him and obtained from him a confession of complicity with an illegal armed group hiding in the mountains. On the morning of the following day operational search activities had started. He and a group of about fifty law-enforcement officers had taken Mr Gayev into the mountains in search of the illegal armed group. In the course of the operation, Mr Gayev had on several occasions fallen striking the ground, rocks and trees. At some point, Mr\u00a0 Gayev and another UBOP officer, Mr A.S., had fallen off a ledge and struck a tree. Subsequently, Mr\u00a0Gayev had neither complained nor requested medical assistance. The operation had lasted for several hours and had finished in the afternoon, with no positive results. At about 8 p.m. on the same date he (that is to say Mr A.A.) had taken Mr\u00a0Gayev to the police station, where the investigator had questioned him in the presence of a legal-aid lawyer, Mr\u00a0Zh.M. During the questioning (which had lasted for about an hour) Mr\u00a0 Gayev had not made any complaints. At the end of the questioning, he and the UBOP officer, Mr A.S., had led Mr Gayev out of the investigator\u2019s office into the corridor, prior to taking him to a temporary detention centre. Suddenly, Mr Gayev had broken away, run towards the window shouting All\u0101hu akbar and jumped from the fourth floor. He and Mr\u00a0A.S. had immediately gone downstairs. They had found Zeytun Gayev lying on the ground in the courtyard of the police station. The latter had still been alive and had been able to talk. He (Mr A.A.) had heard him answering questions that Mr A.S. had asked him. After about ten minutes, the ambulance had arrived and taken him to hospital.

He had not noticed any injuries on his body, but had nevertheless asked him whether he had been subject to any physical or psychological pressure. Mr\u00a0Gayev had replied in the negative and had said that he had been neither beaten nor intimidated.
