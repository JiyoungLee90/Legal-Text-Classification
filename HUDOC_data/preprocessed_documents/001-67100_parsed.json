The national authorities refused to register him as a candidate for the election in question on the ground that he had submitted inaccurate information about his habitual residence or stay for the past five years. The applicant argued that he had given the relevant authorities the information relating to his registered place of official residence in  (the \u201cpropiska\u201d, as it was called at the time). The propiska was an integral and fundamental aspect of the Ukrainian administrative system and was widely used for many official purposes. According to the applicant, as long as his propiska indicated that Ukraine had been his registered place of residence for the last five years before the date of submission of his application to be a candidate (12 January 2002), he should not be considered as having provided false information. As a consequence, he should not be excluded as a candidate on the ground that he did not satisfy the relevant residence condition, even though the fact that he was not actually residing in  during the period in question was undisputed.",
