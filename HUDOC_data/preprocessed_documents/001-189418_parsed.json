In asking whether \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation\u201d, this Court has found that removal must be a realistic prospect (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 167, and Amie and Others v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a058149/08, \u00a7 144, 12\u00a0February 2013). While an interim measure indicated under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court might at times be the only actual barrier to an applicant\u2019s expulsion, its indication does not necessarily create a presumption that the expulsion is not possible or that the subsequent detention is arbitrary. A detention period subject to review at regular intervals, as long as expulsion remains a realistic possibility, might be reasonable given the authorities\u2019 decisions to maintain that detention awaiting the outcome of this Court\u2019s judgment (see Ahmed v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 59727/13, \u00a7\u00a7 45-59, 2\u00a0March 2017).",
