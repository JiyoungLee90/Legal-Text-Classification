While the formal conduct of the proceedings thus does not disclose any justification for the delay, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the Social Court of Appeal, prompted by the announcement of the applicant's representative that he was seeking a leading decision from the , awaited a decision of that court before rendering its judgment. In this context the Court observes that up till then the question at issue had \u201conly\u201d been decided by the , making the case formally ready for a decision. However, since that court's decision was unfavourable to the applicant, it can be argued that it was reasonable for the Social Court of Appeal to wait until the issues of the case pertaining to constitutional law were also clarified. Consequently, the inactivity of the Social Court of Appeal can even be considered to have been in the applicant's interest who was aware of the fact that without a positive decision of the  his appeal had no prospects of success and who, moreover, never asked for the proceedings to be expedited during the period at issue.",
