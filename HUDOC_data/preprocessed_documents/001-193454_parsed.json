It was a new rent agreement concerning a larger property and a higher annual rent payable. The intentions of the parties in the original agreement were set aside, and were now regulated by means of a new agreement. The court considered that on 14\u00a0August 1978 Articles 3 and 4 of the Ordinance were already in force. Thus, the parties had willingly entered into the agreement with full knowledge of the consequences it would lead to. Therefore the owners could not allege a violation of their rights. The principle volenti non fit injuria applied. The court concluded that the case of the owners did not concern the renunciation of a human right, but rather the exercise on the part of the owners to dispose of their property as they desired. From the evidence presented before it, the Constitutional Court concluded that the agreement of 14\u00a0August 1978 established clearly that the owners wanted to enter into a rental agreement for a larger property, with a higher rent to be paid by the Band Club, and had done so.

Moreover, the Court observed that when such applicants had inherited the property in question they had been unable to do anything more than attempt to use the available remedies, which had been to no avail in their circumstances. The decisions of the domestic courts regarding their request had thus constituted interference in their respect. Furthermore, those applicants, who had inherited a property that had already been subject to a lease, had not had the possibility to set the rent themselves (or to freely terminate the agreement). It followed that they could not be said to have waived any rights in that respect. Accordingly, the Court found that the rentcontrol regulations and their application in those cases had constituted an interference with the applicants\u2019 right (as landlords) to use their property (see, for example, Zammit and Attard Cassar v. Malta, no. 1046/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05051, 30\u00a0July 2015 and more recently, Bradshaw and Others v. Malta, no. 37121/15, \u00a7\u00a034, 23\u00a0October 2018).

In particular, the use of property for reasons other than to secure the social welfare of tenants and prevent homelessness is a relevant factor in assessing the compensation due to the owner (ibid.).",

As to the rent payable from 1978 to 2013 (prior to the 2014 Regulations) the applicants were being paid EUR\u00a0302 annually, that is a rent of approximately EUR\u00a025 per month for a twostorey property in the primary town centre of Mosta. The Court considers that while this must have been an appropriate rent in the 1978 when the ancestors entered into the agreement voluntarily and possibly also in the 1980s and 90s, it could not be said to be so decades later (compare the analysis in Bradshaw and Others, cited above, \u00a7 59). Thus, the Court considers that, as found by the firstinstance constitutional jurisdiction which examined the proportionality of the measure, the rent received by the applicants could not be considered in any way proportionate (see paragraph 19 above).",

Thus, while the Regulations allowed for a little more than double the rent previously received, it still amounted to around 2% of the rental value estimated by the applicants\u2019 ex parte architect during the domestic proceedings, namely EUR 36,700 yearly. Even assuming the ex\u00a0parte report is inflated, it is evident that the situation following 2014 remained disproportionate, and without any action by the legislature, it is likely to remain so indefinitely (see Bradshaw and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062). These elements must be weighed against the interests at play in the present case, which are not those of avoiding homelessness but of enhancing social and cultural activities, comprising those of a commercial nature (ibid. \u00a7\u00a063). While the Court has accepted above that the overall measure was, in principle, in the general interest, the fact that there also exists an underlying private interest of a commercial nature cannot be disregarded. In such circumstances, both States and the Court in its supervisory role must be vigilant to ensure that measures, such as the one at issue, do not give rise to an imbalance that imposes an excessive burden on landlords while allowing tenants to make inflated profits. It is also in such contexts that effective procedural safeguards become indispensable (ibid. \u00a7\u00a064). From the information available to the Court, there were no avenues  other than constitutional redress proceedings  which the applicants could pursue to ameliorate their situation (if circumstances so required). Consequently, the application of the law itself lacked adequate procedural safeguards aimed at achieving a balance between the interests of the tenants and those of the owners (ibid.).",

On the other hand, the Court considers that, similar to that held by the domestic court in relation to the report submitted by the applicants during those proceedings (see paragraph\u00a021 above), the recent valuation submitted to this Court is of little use in so far as it has taken into account criteria which have frustrated the result, such as its development and commercial potential when in reality it was rented out only as a twostorey building mainly for cultural purposes and its commercial use was only ancillary to its main function. Similarly, its good state is attributable to the maintenance carried out by the band club. More importantly, given the exceptional steep increases in property prices in the immediate past years, as also admitted by the applicants (see paragraph 45 above), it is inappropriate to consider the sale and rental value in 2017 as a starting point to calculate rents dating back decades. Indeed, as pointed out by the Government, such a calculation has brought about the startling result of a rental value of EUR\u00a026,405 for the year 1978, when in that same year the applicants\u2019 ancestors willingly entered into a contract they considered satisfactorily, for an annual rent of EUR\u00a0302. It is surely unlikely that the applicant\u2019s ancestors would have been satisfied with a little more that 1% of the market price at the time. The Court therefore considers that such an estimate has no reasonable foundation in the reality of the time (see, mutatis mutandis, Bradshaw and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a091). Thus, in assessing the pecuniary damage sustained by the applicants, the Court has considered the estimates provided in as far as appropriate and has had regard to the information available to it on rental values on the Maltese property market during the relevant period (ibid.).",
