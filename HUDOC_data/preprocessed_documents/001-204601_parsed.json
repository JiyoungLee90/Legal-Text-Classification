It was also stated that the applicant had entrusted the pre-trial investigation to an unqualified prosecutor, G.R., and had failed to properly supervise her.

The Court is also of the view that those same circumstances justified the wish of high-level State officials to express their reaction to the shortcomings in the work of the law enforcement authorities and to keep the public informed about the individual and general measures taken to address those shortcomings (see the Government\u2019s observations to that effect in paragraph 108 above).

The President issued several public statements criticising the pre-trial investigation as protracted and calling for the identification and personal accountability of all officers who had acted negligently and who had failed to perform their duties diligently (see paragraphs\u00a041 and 42 above). Furthermore, the Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs stated that the pre-trial investigation had been carried out \u201crather dismissively and slowly\u201d and that he had seen \u201cdisplays of procrastination and negligence\u201d in the actions of investigating officers (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above). In addition, a Member of Parliament implied that the deliberate inaction of the authorities might have driven D.K. to commit two murders (see paragraph 39 above).

She expressly claimed that the decision to demote her had been influenced by public statements made by the politicians. She referred to the specific content of those statements and submitted examples. Her submissions were clear enough for both domestic courts to understand the essence of, and the grounds for, her complaint, which in turn put those courts under an obligation to consider it properly. In the light of the majority\u2019s argument outlined above in point (b), it is difficult to discern from their reasoning what more the applicant should have brought before the domestic courts in order to trigger the obligation for those courts to reply. Equally, it should not be overlooked that the applicant repeated her complaint before the Court, which in turn has not found it to be insufficiently substantiated for an examination on the merits. Instead, it has rightly declared the complaint admissible and has explicitly examined it on nine pages. I believe that the same requirement should be found to apply domestically.",

This is all the more true when the complaints and arguments are not directly interconnected. A complaint that public statements by high-ranking politicians were incompatible with the notion of an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is a self-standing complaint (see, for example, Sovtransavto Holding v. Ukraine, no. 48553/99, 25 July 2002, and Kinsk\u00fd v. the Czech Republic, no. 42856/06, 9 February 2012). Even if it appears that procedural steps in a given case were duly taken and that the outcome of the proceedings cannot be reproached as such, public statements may, in view of their content and the manner in which they were made, entail a violation of the above-mentioned Convention provision. For this reason, any such complaint cannot be considered as \u201clateral\u201d (as opposed to \u201cmain complaint\u201d, in the language of the majority) and should properly be addressed by a court before which it is brought.",

What is at stake is not actual proof of pressure or of its influence upon the decision taken, but the appearance of impartiality (see, mutatis mutandis, Kinsk\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098). Thus an outcome may be perfectly correct, but a violation can still be indicated, if the relevant conditions are met. They are of course to be thoroughly examined, an exercise which the Court has performed in this judgment, whilst the domestic courts failed to do the same.",

To hold otherwise would mean that the domestic courts are under an obligation to respond only to those arguments of a party which are well-founded, a position that would be wholly unacceptable from the point of view of protection against arbitrariness, which is at the heart of the concept of fairness, as embodied by Article 6 of the Convention. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the domestic courts are under an obligation to deal with those arguments which, if upheld, would be decisive for the outcome of the case (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303A). As the applicant\u2019s argument, if successful, could have changed the course of the case domestically, I unfortunately cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s argument outlined above under (d).",

Notably, a single failure to comply with the obligation of domestic courts to provide reasons for dismissing a relevant submission of a party has sufficed for the Court to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, in the context of failure to provide reasons for not referring a case to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling, Schipani and Others v. Italy, no. 38369/09, 21 July 2015, and Baltic Master Ltd. v. Lithuania [Committee], no. 55092/16, 16 April 2019).
