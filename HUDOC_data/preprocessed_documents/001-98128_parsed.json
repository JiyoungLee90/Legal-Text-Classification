As regards, in particular, the need for an applicant to be provided with legal-aid counsel on appeal, the Court has already held that the situation in a case involving a heavy penalty where an appellant was left to present his own defence unassisted before the highest instance of appeal, which has wide powers in the assessment of the case, was not in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 (see Shulepov v.

The appeal court was thus called upon to make a full assessment of the applicant's guilt or innocence regarding the charges against him. In the Court's view, the issues raised by the applicant in his appeal statement can reasonably be considered to have presented a certain factual and legal complexity. It also cannot disregard that the prosecutor and the applicants' co-defendants were present at the appeal hearing and made submissions to the appeal court. Taking further into account what was at stake for the applicant, who had been sentenced to thirteen years' imprisonment, the Court does not consider that the  could properly determine the issues before it without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the applicant either in person or through some form of legal representation.",

In the Grigoryevskikh judgment (cited above, \u00a7 90) it was specifically emphasised that the effectiveness of the guarantee of legal representation by default contained in Article 51 of the CCP would be undermined without a corresponding obligation on the part of the court to verify in each individual case whether it is lawful to proceed with the hearing in the absence of legal counsel for the accused. In that case the Court concluded that it had been incumbent on the appeal court to verify whether there had been a valid waiver of legal assistance by the applicant and, if there was none, to appoint a lawyer as required by Article 51 \u00a7\u00a7 1(1) and 3 of the Code (ibid).",
