This finding is not altered by the fact they were to the benefit of company P. alone. The mere fact that a\u00a0measure benefits a private person does not mean that it cannot have pursued a public interest and a legitimate aim (see, mutatis mutandis, Kohlhofer and Minarik v. the Czech Republic, nos. 32921/03, 28464/04 and 5344/05, \u00a7 98, 15 October 2009).",

The domestic courts adopted a series of interim measures resulting in the inability of the applicant company to hold general meetings since November 2005. According to the domestic courts, the interim measures were aimed at preventing the adoption of fundamental decisions concerning the applicant company without the claimant, who alleged to be a majority shareholder, being able to influence those decisions. Bearing in mind that the domestic courts are certainly in a better position than the Court to assess the necessity of imposing such an interim measure, the Court must only ascertain whether the interference complained of is not manifestly unreasonable (see, mutatis mutandis, BENet Praha, spol. s r.o., cited above, \u00a7 105).",

It notes that in the Micallef judgment (\u00a7\u00a7 79-80), the Court held that the exclusion of interim measures from the ambit of Article 6 was no longer justified by the fact that they do not in principle determine civil rights and obligations. However, it considered that not all interim measures determined such rights and obligations and the applicability of Article 6 would depend on whether certain conditions were fulfilled. First, the right at stake in both the main and the injunction proceedings should be \u201ccivil\u201d within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 of the Convention. Second, the nature of the interim measure, its object and purpose as well as its effects on the right in question should be scrutinised. Whenever an interim measure could be considered effectively to determine the civil right or obligation at stake, notwithstanding the length of time it is in force, Article 6 was applicable (\u00a7\u00a7 84-85). The Court found that Article 6 was applicable because the purpose of the injunction was to determine, albeit for a limited period, the same right as the one being contested in the main proceedings, and which was immediately enforceable (\u00a7 87).",

It is true that the present interim measures also had a certain protective aim in the sense of safeguarding rights of the claimant in the main proceedings. However, the effects of the interim measures in the present case are much broader in scope and cannot be considered to have the sole aim of protecting the possible satisfaction of the claim in the main proceedings. Even if the applicant company were allowed to convene a general meeting and adopt decisions in it, it would not have any bearing on the claimant\u2019s chances of having its claim for surrender of the shares satisfied in the main proceedings.

The exact dates are not known to the Court (see paragraph 16: \u201con an unspecified date before 30 January 2009\u201d). On the basis of the ad impossibilia nemo tenetur principle, courts cannot be expected to always be in a position to decide immediately. They must be afforded some discretion in prioritising important issues and postponing less important ones. The applicant company\u2019s appeals did not concern a matter of utmost urgency, as the right to hold a meeting was not lost but could still be exercised at a future point in time.",
