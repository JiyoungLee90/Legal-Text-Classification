It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see B\u00f6hmer v. , no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v. , no.\u00a065559/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088 and 89, 27\u00a0February 2007).",

Their statements were not limited to describing the status of the pending proceedings or a \u201cstate of suspicion\u201d against the applicants but represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, their involvement in the commission of the offences, without even mentioning that they denied it. In addition, the town prosecutor Mr Zinterekov referred to the applicants\u2019 criminal record, portraying them as hardened criminals, and made a claim that the commission of the \u201ccrime\u201d had been the result of their \u201cpersonal qualities\u201d \u2013 \u201ccruelty and meaningless brutality\u201d. In the closing statement he also mentioned that the only choice the trial court would have to make would be that of a sentence of an appropriate length, thus presenting the applicants\u2019 conviction as the only possible outcome of the judicial proceedings (see paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that those statements by the public officials amounted to a declaration of the applicants\u2019 guilt and prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. Given that those officials held high positions in the town and regional prosecuting authorities, they should have exercised particular caution in their choice of words for describing pending criminal proceedings against the applicants. However, having regard to the contents of their statements as outlined above, the Court finds that some of their statements could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicants guilty before they had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the applicants\u2019 presumption of innocence. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine separately the applicants\u2019 grievance that the release of the case file to the journalists was also prejudicial to their presumption of innocence.",

The Court has previously found a violation of the right to a \u201cpublic and fair hearing\u201d in several cases against Russia, in which a party to civil proceedings was deprived of an opportunity to attend the hearing because of the belated or defective service of the summons (see Yakovlev v. Russia, no. 72701/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019 et seq., 15\u00a0March 2005; Groshev v. Russia, no. 69889/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27 et seq., 20\u00a0October 2005; and Mokrushina v. Russia, no. 23377/02, 5 October 2006). It also found a violation of Article 6 in a case where a Russian court refused leave to appear to an imprisoned applicant who had wished to make oral submissions on his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been \u201can important part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings\u201d (see Kovalev v. Russia, no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May 2007).",

However, neither the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Penitentiary Code make special provision for the exercise of that right by individuals who are in custody, whether they are in pre-trial detention or are serving a sentence. In the present case the applicants\u2019 and their representative\u2019s requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one\u2019s case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the , no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, ECHR 2005II).",

Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff\u2019s personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms.",

In the Gurgenidze and Von Hannover cases the State failed to offer adequate protection to the applicants against the publication of their photographs taken by journalists, whereas in the Sciacca case the applicant\u2019s published photograph had been released to the press by the police without her consent (see Sciacca, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 26 and 28).

Even assuming that Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could be a lawful basis for granting the press access to the case file, in the instant case the Court does not see any legitimate aim for the interference with the first applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life. Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun. Accordingly, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the present case the release of the first applicant\u2019s photograph from the criminal file to the press did not pursue any of the legitimate aims enumerated in paragraph 2 of Article 8.",
