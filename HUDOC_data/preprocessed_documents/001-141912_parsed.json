Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the cause of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. , \u00a7 51, ECHR 1999II; Dallos v. Hungary, no. 29082/95, \u00a7 47, 1 March 2001; and Varela Geis v.\u00a0Spain, no. 61005/09, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 42, 5 March 2013).",

As regards the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention, the Court reiterates that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 6 \u00a7 3 are connected and that the right to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation must be considered in the light of the accused\u2019s right to prepare his defence (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-54).",

The same request was reiterated and discussed in public hearings before the domestic courts on several occasions throughout the proceedings. The applicants were present at all those hearings and were represented by lawyers of their own choice.
