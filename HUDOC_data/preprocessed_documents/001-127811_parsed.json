He also testified that at about 5\u00a0a.m. in early March 2000 a group of officers from the special police force (\u201cthe OMON\u201d) on secondment from the Moscow Region, who had guarded the headquarters at hotel \u201cArena\u201d, had brought in a group of ten or twelve men who had been arrested the previous night on the outskirts of Grozny. The detainees displayed signs of beatings. The OMON officers lined up the detained men in the courtyard and called them by their names. They selected several of them, ordered them to climb back into the truck and took them away. The remaining men were left in the courtyard of the VOVD. The OMON officers said that \u201cthey did not need them\u201d. They were immediately escorted to the gates, where they waited until the end of the curfew and then left. Those men were never brought to the premises of the VOVD or detained there. Rashit Ya. explained that subsequently he had been approached on several occasions by a senior officer of the Chechnya Ministry of the Interior who had claimed that his relative had been among those taken to the VOVD that night; however, Rashit Ya. had always denied any knowledge of the missing man. When questioned about the disappearance of a pregnant woman, he submitted that he was aware of the case because a number of inquiries had been made by her relatives and other authorities. He suggested that the disappearance of the woman and of some other persons in the vicinity of Minutka Square in Grozny could have been linked to revenge taken by military servicemen. He stated that during the period in question the mutilated bodies of several servicemen had been found in the area. He denied any knowledge of the missing persons. He further explained that although the VOVD had not employed civilian staff, an elderly woman had lived near the gymnasium on the premises of the VOVD and kept her personal belongings in one of the rooms.",

According to the information summarised above (see paragraph 42), on 18 July 2002 criminal investigation files nos.\u00a012088, 12136 and 12365 were joined under file no.\u00a012088, and thus until 5 May 2007 (see paragraph 50 above) the disappearance of Magomed Dzhabayev was investigated within the same set of proceedings as the disappearance of the three relatives of the applicants in the present case. In the Dzhabayeva v. Russia judgment the Court concluded that there had been a breach of the procedural aspect of Article 2 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 99).",

The applicants\u2019 submissions, as well as a number of documents from the investigation file opened in relation to Murad Gelayev\u2019s suspected murder (criminal investigation file no.\u00a044065) contained sufficient information for the Court to conclude that following his detention he had been detained in the basement of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, where he had been subjected to torture, including severe beatings, and where his ear had been cut off (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 124 and 127). In that case the Court found both substantive and procedural breaches of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention in respect of the missing man. The Court noted, in particular, that the identification and questioning of the personnel of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, including those officers who were on secondment from Khanty-Mansiysk, had been carried out with such long delays, or in such a superficial manner, that it had prevented the investigation from progressing in any meaningful manner (ibid., \u00a7 113).",

The Court had borne in mind the difficulties associated with obtaining the evidence and the fact that, often, little evidence could be submitted by the applicants in support of their applications. Applying the above-mentioned principles, it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing person by servicemen, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred (see, among many examples, Aziyevy v. Russia, no. 7626/01, \u00a7 74, 20 March 2008; Utsayeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a029133/03, \u00a7 160, 29 May 2008; and Khutsayev and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a016622/05, \u00a7 104, 27 May 2010). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. Conversely, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Tovsultanova v. Russia, no. 26974/06, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17 June 2010; Movsayevy v. Russia, no.\u00a020303/07, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011; and Shafiyeva v. Russia, no. 49379/09, \u00a7\u00a071, 3 May 2012).",

Although the applicants themselves were not eyewitnesses to the detention, they found witnesses who testified that their three relatives had been taken to the premises of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD on the day of their \u201cdisappearance\u201d. Some witnesses were identified by the investigation and testified accordingly (see paragraphs 40 and 47 above). Alaudin Sadykov, who had been detained at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at the time, identified Luiza Bopayeva as one of the detainees (see paragraph 37 above). Some other indirect evidence relevant to the possible detention of the three persons at the VOVD in April 2000 and confirming the applicants\u2019 statements was also collected by the investigation (see paragraphs 40, 46 and 47 above). In their submissions to the authorities, the applicants consistently maintained that their relatives had been detained at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. The investigative authorities accepted as fact the version of events as presented by the applicants and took steps to check whether the law-enforcement agencies had been involved in the abductions. As it appears from the documents, the investigation regarded the possibility of abduction by police officers as the only plausible explanation of the event (see paragraph 49 above). Moreover, between July 2002 and March 2007 those events were regarded as one element in a pattern of similar occurrences of unlawful detention, ill-treatment and disappearances, which had occurred during 2000 at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD of Grozny. Only in May 2007 the prosecutor ruled to disjoin the proceedings in the cases concerning the disappearance of the applicant\u2019s relatives, ill-treatment of Mr Sadykov and disappearance of Mr Dzhabayev (see paragraph 48 above).",

It is shocking, as already remarked by the Court in the Sadykov case, that the acts in question appear to be imputable to a group of police officers (\u00a7\u00a0236). The Court\u2019s five judgments cited above (see paragraphs 56-61) provide strong evidence of a pattern of illegal detention, torture and disappearances of persons detained at, or indeed simply entering, the premises of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at the relevant time. The Court reiterates that what is at stake is nothing less than public confidence in the State\u2019s monopoly on the use of force (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007VI; and Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7 300, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The State must therefore ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response \u2013 judicial or otherwise \u2013 so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see Zavoloka v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a058447/00, \u00a7 34, 7 July 2009). It appears that in the present case the respondent State has failed to ensure such an adequate response.",

In the present case, many years passed before the key persons identified by the witnesses were questioned, greatly increasing the risk of such collusion.",

Despite a plausible complaint about the involvement of several police officers, including high-ranking officers, in serious crimes, the documents reviewed by the Court suggest that no steps were taken to remove them from their posts during the investigation and thus to limit their \u2013 at least potential \u2013 ability to put pressure on others involved in the investigation.",

Such acceptance stands in sharp contrast with the duty of vigilance expected from law-enforcement authorities when facing allegations of crimes that encroach on the core values of a democratic society, such as the right to life and the prohibition of torture. The Court observes that the investigation did not come up with any other version of the events and failed to elucidate the fate of the disappeared persons. In this respect, too, failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines the investigation\u2019s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the person responsible (see Kolevi v.

However, this finding appears particularly limited in the context of well-founded allegations of other serious crimes committed at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD of Grozny in 2000. The outcome of that trial highlights the impunity of the perpetrators of other similar acts and, as such, must be particularly frustrating to the relatives of the victims in this case.",
