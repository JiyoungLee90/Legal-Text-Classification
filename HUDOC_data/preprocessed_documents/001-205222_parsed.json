Indeed, the right not to be discriminated against in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the Convention is also violated when States, without an objective and reasonable justification, fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different (see Thlimmenos v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no.\u00a034369/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000-IV;\u00a0Stec and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom\u00a0[GC], nos.\u00a065731/01\u00a0and\u00a065900/01, \u00a7 51, ECHR\u00a02006VI; and Guberina v. Croatia, no. 23682/13, \u00a7 70, 22 March 2016). The prohibition deriving from Article 14 will therefore also give rise to positive obligations for the Contracting States to make necessary distinctions between persons or groups whose circumstances are relevantly and significantly different (see J.D. and A. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a032949/17 and 34614/17, \u00a7 84, 24 October 2019 with further references, notably Thlimmenos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). In this context, relevance is measured in relation to what is at stake, whereas a certain threshold is required in order for the Court to find that the difference in circumstances is significant. For this threshold to be reached, a measure must produce a particularly prejudicial impact on certain persons as a result of a protected ground, attaching to their situation and in light of the ground of discrimination invoked (see J.D. and A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085).",

This means that very weighty reasons would have to be advanced before a difference in treatment on the grounds of sex could be regarded as being compatible with the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 78, Series A no. 94, and Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais v. Portugal, no. 17484/15, \u00a7 46, 25 July 2017). Consequently, where a difference in treatment is based on sex, the margin of appreciation afforded to the State is narrow, and in such situations the principle of proportionality does not merely require that the measure chosen should in general be suited to the fulfilment of the aim pursued, but it must also be shown that it was necessary in the circumstances (see Emel Boyraz v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 61960/08, \u00a7 51, 2 December 2014).",

The Court observes that during the applicant\u2019s absence from the office consular services were suspended and requests for assistance were redirected to neighbouring countries (see paragraphs\u00a011 and 15 above).
