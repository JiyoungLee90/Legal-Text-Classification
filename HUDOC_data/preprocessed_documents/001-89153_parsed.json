Finally, it concluded that the applicant should have deposited the money with the court and that he should have required the court to order the construction company to build the wall.

In particular, the Court notes that the applicant attended all scheduled hearings and made the advance payment of the enforcement costs as required (see paragraph 9 above). As to the Government\u2019s assertion that the proceedings were suspended due to the applicant\u2019s fault, it is true that on 7 December 2001 the first-instance court instructed the applicant that if he did not pay the costs of an on-site examination, the proceedings would be suspended. However, the applicant has submitted a payment slip of 26 December 2001, and the Court\u2019s attention has not been drawn to any court decision by which the proceedings were suspended. Accordingly, there is no indication that the proceedings were suspended, or that the applicant was responsible for any such suspension.",

In addition, it appears that the proceedings lay dormant for nearly two years and seven months after the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 14 December 2004 (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). Three on-site inspections (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 12 above) carried out during the period under consideration also added much to the length of the proceedings.",
