The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") and by the Belgian Government ("the Government") respectively on 9 September and 21 October 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 17849/91) against the  lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by twenty-six applicants on 4 January 1991 (see the principal judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 8, para. 6).
In its aforementioned judgment of 20 November 1995 ("the principal judgment"), the Court found that there had been deprivation of property contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) in that an Act of 30 August 1988 ("the 1988 Act") had retrospectively extinguished without consideration any claims for compensation which the applicants may have had against the Belgian State or against private companies offering pilot services for casualties occurring before 17 September 1988 (Series A no. 332, pp. 24 and 26, para. 44 and point 3 of the operative provisions).
As the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) was not ready for decision, it was reserved in the principal judgment. The Court invited the Government and the applicants to submit, within six months, their observations on the issue and, inter alia, to inform it of any friendly settlement that they might reach (ibid., point 6 of the operative provisions).
On 20 May 1996, the Government lodged a memorial, to which the applicants replied on 3 September 1996. On 30 September 1996 the President gave the Government and the applicants leave to lodge an additional memorial, which they did on 5 November and 10 December 1996 respectively. On 10 February 1997, the Government sent to the registry a court decision in the case of one of the applicants, together with their observations; the applicants replied on 6 March 1997. On 18 April 1997 the applicants sent some other decisions of the Belgian courts to the registry with an up-to-date table of the damages claimed. On 30 April 1997, the Government submitted further observations, but the Chamber decided not to include them in the case file as the time-limit for submitting them had expired. On 21 January 1997, the Registrar had received the observations of the Delegate of the Commission.
Subsequently Mr B. Repik, substitute judge, replaced Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1 of Rules of Court A).
