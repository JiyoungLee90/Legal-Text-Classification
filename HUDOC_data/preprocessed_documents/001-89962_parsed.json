In practice, however, cases exist where disclosure of the identity of a private person making such a notification would be particularly harmful to the child's best interests or the notifier's safety, for example. Authorities need not provide a party with information on identity if the conditions mentioned in section 11 of the Openness of Government Activities Act (laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta; lagen om offentlighet i myndigheternas verksamhet; Act no. 621/1999) are fulfilled: a party shall not have the right of access to a document if such access would be contrary to a very important public interest, the interest of a minor or some other very important private interest. According to the Government Bill (HE 30/1998 vp), the best interests of a child may justify protecting the notifier's identity on the basis of an overall consideration of the circumstances of each individual case. As an example, the Government Bill mentions the situation where the notifier is a person close to the child, for instance a grandparent, and to disclose his or her identity would break the child's relationship with an adult important to his or her welfare. Disclosure of the notifier's identity may, in individual cases, also be in conflict with the public interest if providing the information might defeat the purpose of child welfare measures.",

If there exists doubt as to the origin of a bruise, should it be punishable to engage in a discussion with the doctor about the various possibilities?

A medical doctor was, however, an expert in matters relating to physical abuse.

Furthermore, the parties agreed that the interference pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the reputation or rights of others, within the meaning of Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2. The Court endorses this assessment. The applicant and the Government differed on whether the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d and \u201cnecessary in a democratic society.\u201d As to the former issue, the Court accepts that the applicant's criminal conviction was based on a reasonable interpretation of the Penal Code as in force at the relevant time, and that the order requiring her to pay damages was based on the relevant provision of the Tort Liability Act. The interference was thus \u201cprescribed by law\u201d (see Nikula v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034; Selist\u00f6 v. Finland, no. 56767/00, \u00a7 34, 16 November 2004 and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no.\u00a053678/00, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2004X). It remains to be determined whether the interference in question was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued\u201d and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Nikula v. Finland, \u00a7 44).",

The first of these interests involves protection of children as the victims of crime. The Court has emphasised that children and other vulnerable individuals in particular are entitled to State protection, in the form of effective deterrence, against such serious breaches of personal integrity (see, mutatis mutandis, X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 21\u201327, Series A no. 91; Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062\u201364, Reports 1996-IV; and also the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Articles 19 and 37). The Court would refer, in particular, to the case of A. v. the United Kingdom (23\u00a0September 1998, \u00a7\u00a022, Reports 1998VI) where a stepfather had subjected a child to treatment contrary to Article 3 and was acquitted having argued that the treatment amounted to \u201creasonable chastisement\u201d. The Court held in that case that the obligation under Article\u00a01 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with Article 3, required States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction were not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals.",

Child abuse is indeed a hard form of criminal conduct to combat, because its existence is difficult to uncover. Babies and young children are unable to tell, older children are often too frightened. The question raised by this application is how to strike a proper balance when a parent is wrongly suspected of having abused his or her child, while protecting children at risk of significant harm. In considering these questions, the starting point is to note that the applicant acted properly in considering whether the bruise on the boy's back had been deliberately inflicted. Having become suspicious, she consulted a medical doctor who rightly decided to communicate to the child welfare authorities the suspicion which he personally formed having examined and interviewed the boy. That is the essential next step in child protection. The seriousness of child abuse as a social problem requires that persons who act in good faith (see, mutatis mutandis, Guja v.  [GC], no. 14277/04, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2008...), in what they believe are the best interests of the child, should not be influenced by fear of being prosecuted or sued when deciding whether and when their doubts should be communicated to health care professionals or social services. There is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough. The duty to the child in making these decisions should not be clouded by a risk of exposure to claims by a distressed parent if the suspicion of abuse proves unfounded.",

Nonetheless, the threat of an ex post facto review in criminal proceedings of a concerned grandmother's statement made in good faith to the child's doctor accords ill with every adult's moral duty to defend a child's interests. The Court finds it alarming that the Court of Appeal took the view that the applicant, when there was no doubt that she had seen the boy's bruised back, was not entitled to repeat what the boy had told her, that is, that he had been hit by his father, an assertion he had repeated when interviewed by the doctor. The possibility to voice a suspicion of child abuse, formed in good faith, in the context of an appropriate reporting procedure should be available to any individual without the potential \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a criminal conviction or an obligation to pay compensation for harm suffered or costs incurred.",
