In this connection it finds that there were two specific periods of delay that were attributable to the Supreme Court. In the first place, a period of approximately eleven months elapsed between 19 November 1997, when the applicant lodged his appeal, and 27 October 1998, when the Supreme Court fixed the case for pre-trial directions (see paragraph 17 above). The Government have not provided a satisfactory explanation in this respect whereas the applicant has provided the Court with a copy of this application filed on 24 November 1997 requesting that the appeal be fixed for hearing. Secondly, there was a period of inactivity of nearly three months, between 18 March 1999, when the plaintiffs filed their address, and 14 June 1999, when the parties were notified by the registrar that the appeal had been fixed for hearing for 27 September 1999 (see paragraph 18 above). As a result of the above the hearing of the appeal commenced more than two years after its lodging and more than ten months following the filing of the parties\u2019 addresses. In the Court\u2019s opinion this was an unjustified delay bearing in mind that what was at stake in these proceedings was undoubtedly of considerable importance for the applicant. Finally, the Court observes that the present case concerns the applicant\u2019s professional reputation which would require special diligence to be shown by the domestic courts.",
