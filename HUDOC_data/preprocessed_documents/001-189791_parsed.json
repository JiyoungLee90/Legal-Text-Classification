In the proceedings, lodged by the Competition Authority before the Market Court in the first instance and concluded before the Supreme Administrative Court, on appeals brought by both the Competition Authority and the respondent companies, the existence of a cartel was found established and financial penalties were imposed on the companies involved, including the applicant company. In terms of the scope and effects of the cartel, however, the assessment of the Supreme Administrative Court was more severe than that of the Market Court and, as a result, the Supreme Administrative Court, endorsing the motions put forward by the Competition Authority, increased the amount of the financial penalties imposed on the respondent companies, including the applicant company.",

As direct evidence was not always available, an assessment was to be made of whether indirect evidence was sufficient to prove the existence of a cartel. The court found that, in the present case, the economic evidence alone was not sufficient to prove the existence of a cartel. The court also found that the existence of a cartel could not be proved on the basis of hearsay evidence. In the present case, the Market Court reached its conclusion in respect of the central government asphalt contracts by relying, inter alia, on the testimonies of eight witnesses. However, to the extent that those testimonies contained hearsay evidence, such evidence was not taken into account. As far as local government and private sector contracts were concerned, the Market Court analysed the evidence for restrictions of competition region by region and found it sufficient in respect of certain regions while insufficient in respect of others. As regards the regions where the applicant company was doing business (Northern Finland and North Karelia), the Market Court found that the evidence in support of a cartel was not sufficient. In this context, the Market Court stated, inter alia, that the testimonies of two witnesses who had been heard on this matter had been based solely on what the witnesses had heard from other people, whereas other witnesses had not given evidence that was capable of substantiating the existence of a cartel for local government and private sector contracts in this particular region.",

In its appeal, the Competition Authority contested the interpretation adopted by the Market Court as regards the scope of the cartel, arguing that there was nothing to suggest that the territorial allocation of markets did not encompass contracts in all the above mentioned categories of works and pointing out that the exclusion of supplies of asphalt mass outside the cartel companies affected competition in the entire sector. The Competition Authority maintained that there had been a single, nationwide cartel encompassing the entire market for state, local authority and private sector asphalt contracts. In so far as evidence was concerned, the Competition Authority argued, inter alia, that even hearsay evidence should have been taken into account by the Market Court. The company which had been found to play a leading role in the cartel lodged a partial appeal. In its appeal, the applicant company claimed that the Market Court had drawn the wrong conclusions from the evidence, as the Competition Authority had not been able to show that the company had participated in a cartel. In its response to the appeal brought by the Competition Authority, the applicant company reiterated its submissions already made before the Market Court and argued, inter alia, that reliance on any elements of hearsay in the evidence should remain excluded.",

The court stated that in the light of that case-law, the procedure for imposing a penalty payment under the Restriction of Competition Act had to be considered to fall within the scope of Article 6 (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2006XIV).

The Supreme Administrative Court, citing the case of Jussila, considered that while Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal limb thus applied to proceedings imposing a penalty payment, in such cases the Article 6 requirements were not necessarily identical to the requirements which were applicable in the core areas of criminal procedure.",

In this context, it cited the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The court thus recalled that as the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements and the penalties which offenders may incur are well known, it is normal for the activities relating to restrictive practices and agreements to take place in a clandestine fashion, for meetings to be held in secret, and for the associated documentation to be reduced to a minimum. Evidence of unlawful contact between economic operators will normally be only fragmentary and sparse, so that it is often necessary to reconstitute certain details by deduction. In most cases, the existence of an anti-competitive practice or agreement must be inferred from a number of coincidences and indicia which, taken together and in the absence of another plausible explanation, may constitute evidence of an infringement of the competition rules (see Aalborg Portland and Others v. the Commission, Joined cases\u00a0C204/00 P, C-205/00 P, C-211/00 P, C-213/00 P, C-217/00 P and\u00a0C219/00\u00a0P, ECLI:EU:C:2004:6, \u00a7\u00a7 55-57). Accordingly, the competent court was not precluded from taking into account circumstantial evidence, or from drawing inferences from various elements of proof, including testimony containing references to what the witness has heard from others. Various factual elements attesting to similar events or patterns occurring in a given market, alongside other kinds of circumstantial evidence may, in the absence of any other reasonable explanation, demonstrate the existence of restrictive practices. Furthermore, the court cited case-law of the General Court of the EU emphasising that while the competition authority must produce sufficiently precise and consistent evidence to support the firm conviction that the alleged infringement of competition rules took place, it is not necessary for every item of evidence produced to satisfy those criteria in relation to every aspect of the infringement. It is sufficient if the body of evidence relied on, viewed as a whole, meets that requirement (see JFE Engineering Corp. and Others v.\u00a0the Commission, Joined cases T-67/00, T-68/00, T-71/00 and T-78/00, ECLI:EU:T:2004:221, \u00a7\u00a7 179-180).",

It further cited case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union according to which it is incumbent on the Commission as competition authority to prove the infringements of competition rules and to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating to the requisite legal standard the existence of the circumstances constituting an infringement, and where such evidence had been presented the court was entitled to consider that it was for the defendant to provide another explanation for the incriminating circumstances. This did not unduly reverse the burden of proof or set aside the presumption of innocence (see Montecatini Spa v. the Commission, Case\u00a0C-235/92 P, ECLI:EU:C:1999:362, \u00a7\u00a7 179-181).",

It was essential to take a holistic approach to the evidence presented. When it came to the duration of the infringement of competition law rules, it was sufficient that the presented evidence related to facts sufficiently close in terms of time, in order that it could be established with reasonable certainty that the suspected infringement had continued without interruption between the dates when the alleged cartel had started and ended.",

The court also heard six witnesses in person. The gist of testimonies relied on is cited in the judgment. The court\u2019s findings indicate, inter alia, that independently of each other, a number of witnesses mentioned examples from different geographical regions in different parts of Finland where the companies had agreed about the allocation of markets either by geographical regions or by the volumes of contracts. The witnesses expressed a common understanding that a cartel had dominated the Finnish asphalt markets throughout the country in respect of both local government and private sector contracts and central government contracts. Several witnesses also reported consistently on the practices by which the cartel companies had agreed the price to be offered by each of them in competitive bidding. The witnesses reported that the practices followed in competitive bidding had been intended to ensure that the markets were divided as agreed. The reported tendering practices were confirmed by the recordings of telephone calls presented as evidence, and by the written evidence relating to certain competitive biddings. Furthermore, the witnesses reported consistently on how the cartel had supervised the geographical division of the markets. In addition, three witnesses testified before the court about their experience regarding the alleged division of the markets, the related false invoices and the supply of cost-free asphalt mass, as well as some consistent hearsay. They testified that if the contracted works had not corresponded to the amounts agreed in advance, the company which had been awarded too many contracts would pay compensation to those which had received too few contracts, for example by means of false invoices. These witnesses also testified about the pressure exerted by cartel members on smaller companies to join the cartel and about measures taken to conceal the infringements.",

It found that the Competition Authority had presented extensive evidence of the existence of the cartel, by means of witness statements, documents, telephone recordings and other evidence. Although the evidence provided by the Competition Authority had not covered all incidents in the asphalt markets during the period covered by its application, either geographically or in terms of time, it had nevertheless permitted the court to get an overall picture of the functioning of the asphalt markets during the period in question. The evidence had excluded the possibility that the established facts were a matter of similar practices which had coincided accidentally. Taking into account what is generally known about the functioning of cartels on the basis of earlier experience and research, the most credible explanation for the similarity between the events which had occurred in different regions and the observations made by the witnesses was that the asphalt companies had agreed about the territorial allocation of the asphalt markets in the whole of Finland, as well as about the measures for implementing the agreed allocation in practice. In its final conclusion, the court stated that the Competition Authority had adduced extensive evidence of the existence of a cartel, while the defendants had not been able to refute the credibility or reliability of that evidence, nor the conclusions which the Competition Authority had drawn from it.",

In criminal proceedings the guarantees contained in paragraph 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the general concept of a fair trial set forth in paragraph 1. The various rights, of which a non-exhaustive list appears in paragraph 3, reflect certain of the aspects of the notion of a fair trial in criminal proceedings, exemplifying the requirements of a fair trial in respect of typical procedural situations which arise in criminal cases. They are, however, not aims in themselves: their intrinsic aim is always to contribute to ensuring the fairness of the criminal proceedings as a whole (see, inter alia, Correia de Matos v. Portugal [GC], no. 56402/12, \u00a7\u00a7 119-120, 4\u00a0April 2018; Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7 251).

Croatia, no.\u00a020883/09, \u00a7 32, 13 December 2011).",

Switzerland, no.\u00a027741/95, Commission decision of 17 January 1997). There is also a distinction between the latter, that is, whether the rights of defence have been properly ensured in respect of the evidence taken, and the subsequent assessment of that evidence by the court once the proceedings have been concluded. From the perspective of the rights of defence, issues under Article 6 may therefore arise in terms of whether the evidence produced for or against the defendant was presented in such a way as to ensure a fair trial (see, for instance, Horvati\u0107 v. Croatia, no. , \u00a7 78, 17\u00a0October\u00a02013, and Bar\u0131m v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. , 12\u00a0January\u00a01999).",

The Court is called upon to consider the questions of fairness in view of the domestic proceedings as a whole, bearing in mind that the Supreme Administrative Court was examining those issues as second, final judicial instance following appeals both by the Competition Authority and the applicant company, the latter contesting its involvement in a cartel, and taking into account that the outcome of the case for the applicant was aggravated on appeal in comparison with the judgment of the Market Court in first instance.

The Court is also aware of the strong public interest involved in the effective enforcement of competition law.

By contrast, as regards the market for local government and private sector asphalt works and supplies, the Market Court conducted a separate analysis of the evidence concerning the existence of a cartel in that market segment on a regional basis and found that there was sufficient evidence of a cartel in that segment only in respect of certain regions, none of which were areas where the applicant company was doing business, whereas the evidence was not considered sufficient in respect of a cartel concerning that market segment for other regions of the country. Consequently, while the Market Court did find the applicant company in breach of competition rules for participating in the nationwide cartel for central government contracts, it did not make a similar finding in respect of the alleged cartel for local government and private sector contracts.",

Thus, the main issue raised by the Competition Authority\u2019s appeal in respect of which the applicant company risked a potential aggravation of the outcome of the case for its part was not merely a question of fact, or evidence relating to certain facts, but involved wider questions concerning the relevant market and its functioning as well as the nature and effects of the alleged restrictive practices. In other words, it cannot be said that the key issue before the Supreme Administrative Court from the point of view of the applicant company was limited to an assessment of evidence only. Rather, the issues on appeal concerned a complex set of issues which required an assessment of several elements and involved a range of economic, factual as well as legal considerations.",

That court further addressed the particular evidentiary difficulties arising in the context of practices which are aimed at restricting competition, citing also the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Supreme Administrative Court emphasised that the evidence in a competition case could not be subject to the same requirements as evidence in criminal cases, inter alia, because the domestic competition law was a part of the competition of law of the European Union. Accordingly, circumstantial evidence as well as inferences could also be relied on for establishing prohibited cooperation in the absence of any alternative reasonable explanation. When drawing such inferences, the court was not precluded from taking into account hearsay evidence alongside various other pieces of evidence. It was essential to take a holistic approach to the evidence presented (see paragraphs 20-22 above).

As stated above (see paragraph 88), this issue was not solely one of facts or evidence alone but one which largely required an intricate analysis of market-related economic factors as well as relevant legal considerations.

Since the applicant companies had been unable to refute the evidence provided by the Competition Authority, or prove that the Competition Authority had drawn false conclusions from the evidence, in the light of the evidence provided by the Competition Authority, the Supreme Administrative Court had held that a nationwide cartel had operated in the Finnish asphalt markets in violation of sections 5 and 6 of the Restraint of Competition Act.",

Under this principle, the criminal court has the power to determine which evidence is necessary to establish the facts, to assess the credibility of each piece of evidence and to determine the weight attributed to each of them.",

In my view, this approach departs to a certain extent from the general principles set out in point 3 above.

Thus, those cases did not raise an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 3(d).

Primarily, this provision is applicable in respect of persons giving evidence in the course of the proceedings.

Germany (dec.), no.\u00a073047/01, 17 November 2005; Dzelili v. Germany (dec.), no.\u00a015065/05, 29 September 2009; H\u00fcmmer v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a026171/07, 19\u00a0July 2012; and Scholer v.

Donahoe, cited above, \u00a7 78). Within the framework of a \u201cdifferentiated approach\u201d, this is essentially what the present judgment is about. In my view, it would have been desirable and helpful to explain this more clearly.",

This is so not least because of the significant role played in this field by leniency policies, as a result of which those choosing to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d may have important financial and other incentives for doing so, namely for alerting the competent authorities and for supplying key evidence to assist them in the enforcement process. In such circumstances, the manner in which incriminating evidence from sources inside a cartel is introduced in the proceedings, and the manner in which the rights of the defence are secured in this context, will accordingly be important matters for consideration in the assessment of the overall fairness of the proceedings. While there is a strong public interest in the effective enforcement of competition law, there is also a strong interest in not getting it wrong.",
