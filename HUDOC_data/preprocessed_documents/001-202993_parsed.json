The decision on forcible expulsion is taken by an administrative court, and the individual is detained pending his/her expulsion.].

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law.
