It established that Ib.O. had eight children from his two marriages; they included the three claimants, but also the father of the second and third defendants (I.O. and B.O.) in the proceedings, and four other heirs who were not among the claimants. Since the civil action lodged by the applicant and her two sisters had only three of Ib.O.\u2019s legal heirs (\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438) on the side of the claimants, the court considered that the applicant and her sisters did not have full legal standing in the proceedings (\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430) to claim recognition of title to the entire plot of land, and that they consequently had no legal interest (\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441) to seek that the impugned sale contract be declared null and void. The court did not take into consideration the arguments raised by the applicant\u2019s lawyer at the hearing to the effect that the other heirs, although aware of the proceedings, had expressed no intention to join the proceedings. That was also corroborated by B.O., Ib.O.\u2019s son, who gave an oral statement on that account before the first-instance court.",
