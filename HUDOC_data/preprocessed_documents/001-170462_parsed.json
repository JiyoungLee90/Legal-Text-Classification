This card had contained a reference to Article\u00a05b of the Diseases and Handicaps Schedule issued in 1973, on the basis of which in 1981 the applicant had been declared unfit for military service in peacetime. No text from this Article had appeared on the above document. Tavrida had acted unlawfully in 1997 in obtaining the wording of this Article, which contained sensitive medical data, from the military enlistment office without the applicant\u2019s knowledge or consent. It had also acted unlawfully in including this information in the applicant\u2019s personnel file in spite of its retention patently having been excessive for the purposes for which it had been kept. Next, Tavrida had acted unlawfully in using this information for a new purpose, that is to say for assessing and turning down the applicant\u2019s applications for promotion in 1997 and 2000, in spite of the fact that this information had been very old and of inadequate detail for determining the applicant\u2019s fitness for the position he sought. Above all, Article\u00a05b of the Diseases and Handicaps Schedule was insufficiently specific. It applied equally to persons suffering from very serious psychotic disorders and to those suffering from mild temporary conditions. In fact, the applicant had never been in a psychotic state. Making any conclusions concerning his mental health on the basis of the information contained in this Article had created a false appearance that he might have suffered from a very serious disorder. Should the applicant\u2019s employer have been concerned about his mental health in terms of his promotion, it could have solicited more recent and specific information, in particular by referring the applicant to a medical commission for the assessment of his fitness for promotion. Having obtained such a referral in 2002, the applicant had duly passed the necessary assessment and had eventually been placed on the reserve list and then promoted to an engineering position.",

The fact that the information entered initially had not used the exact wording of Article\u00a05b was immaterial in this context, as the Diseases and Handicaps Schedules had been accessible by the public. By contacting the military enlistment office in 1997, Tavrida had simply confirmed the information which had already been provided by the applicant himself, rather than actually obtaining additional information. In the Government\u2019s view, this situation was factually comparable to that examined by the Court in the case of N.F. v. Italy (no. 37119/97, ECHR\u00a02001IX). In particular, in that case the Court had found that the applicant\u2019s complaint about disclosure by the press of his membership of a registered Freemason\u2019s lodge had not affected his rights under Article 8, as that lodge\u2019s members\u2019 register had in any event been publicly consultable.",

These principles were formulated in a number of treaties and other legal instruments, including the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention no.\u00a0108 and other documents (see paragraphs\u00a053-60 above). The Court has previously referred to the relevant international instruments, most notably the Data Protection Convention, in assessing data processing and protection practices in individual cases brought under Article\u00a08 of the Convention. In particular, drawing from that Convention, the Court has stated that the domestic law of the member States should notably ensure that personal data in issue are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are being collected or stored; that they are preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored and that the retained data are efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see, among other authorities, Gardel v. France, no.\u00a016428/05, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR\u00a02009). In line with internationally recognised data protection principles, the Court has also stated that it was essential for the applicable law to provide clear, detailed rules governing the scope and application of the relevant measures; as well as minimum safeguards concerning, inter alia, duration, storage, usage, access of third parties, procedures for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of data and procedures for their destruction, thus providing sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness at each stage of its processing (see, in particular, S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099 and the references therein, and M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0195). There are various crucial stages at which data protection issues under Article\u00a08 of the Convention may arise, including during collection, storage, use and communication of data. At each stage, appropriate and adequate safeguards which reflect the principles elaborated in applicable data protection instruments must be put in place in order to justify the necessity of interference under Article\u00a08 (see M.M. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, ibid).",

It is therefore as such outside of the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. At the same time, as the applicant\u2019s complaint concerns, in essence, not only this initial act, but more broadly the fact that the relevant information was included in and retained on his file, the Court considers itself competent to address the issue of retention (see Rotaru, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046).",

A reference to this Article had already been entered in the applicant\u2019s file earlier, because this provision indicated the grounds for his dispensation from military service in peacetime. A reference to the grounds for dispensation from military service was a standard and mandatory entry in the military duty register as kept by every employer pursuant to Instruction no.\u00a0165. As the Court has been informed, the foregoing Schedule was a published document. Accordingly, the text of the aforementioned Schedule being publicly consultable at any point of time, the fact that the applicant\u2019s employer obtained it from the military enlistment office in summer\u00a01997 was of secondary importance. It follows that the applicant\u2019s employer was in possession of the information concerning the grounds for the applicant\u2019s dispensation from military service as a result of the general set-up of the applicable legislative framework, rather than the employer\u2019s individual conduct, contrary to what the applicant suggests.",

However, the Court reiterates that core principles of data protection require the retention of data to be proportionate in relation to the purpose of collection and envisage limited periods of storage (see S.\u00a0and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 107). In line with this, the Court considers that delegating to every employer a public function involving retention of sensitive health-related data concerning their employees can only be justified under Article\u00a08 if such retention is accompanied by particularly strong procedural guarantees for ensuring, notably, that such data would be kept strictly confidential, would not be used for any other purpose except that for which it was collected, and would be kept uptodate (see, mutatis mutandis, I. v.

In addition to that, as it did not indicate the specific nature of the applicant\u2019s medical condition diagnosed at that time, it was also incomplete for the purposes of deciding whether or not he could be entrusted with the requested position.

Having obtained a positive conclusion, he was placed on a reserve list and subsequently promoted to his satisfaction (see paragraphs\u00a017-18 above).

At least from the information available in the case file, it is difficult if not impossible to see how the various general and specific provisions touching on data protection interacted with one another, with the Information Act providing numerous exceptions to its protective rules \u201cin cases envisaged by law\u201d.",

As indicated previously, section 34 of the Military Act and Instruction no. 165 oblige employers, both public and private, to keep a standardised reference of the military duty register with respect to each employee\u2019s eligibility for military duty. The purpose is thus to ensure employees\u2019 compliance with their military duty as stated in section 10 of Instruction no. 165, not to attest to their subsequent fitness for promotion in non-military employment for an undisclosed and/or unlimited period of time. However, as the Chamber judgment recognises in its subsequent examination of the necessity of the interference, the loosely regulated access to and use of the sensitive data in the instant case was the result of the general set-up of the legislation and led to a quasi-automatic entitlement of employers, whether public or private, to obtain and subsequently store sensitive health-related data (see \u00a7\u00a7 85 \u2013 86 of the judgment).",

Articles 2 and 153 of the Labour Code afforded the employer great discretion with regard to the use and disclosure of health-related data on the basis that employees shall be entitled to and employers shall create a healthy and safe working environment. The broad discretion thereby conferred on employers was not capable, without appropriate safeguards, of protecting sensitive data from being disseminated to and ultimately by third parties, such as the applicant\u2019s colleagues.",

Neither did those rules describe and circumscribe with sufficient clarity the scope of the discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner in which that discretion had to be exercised. This centrality of (un)lawfulness to the Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 8 is evident in the content and construction of the judgment itself, with \u00a7\u00a7 84 to 89 and \u00a7 91 referring repeatedly and clearly to issues which go to an absence of quality and a lack of foreseeability in the domestic legal framework.",

This is something which the Court has done on other occasions in Article 8 cases. In addition, since Ukrainian data protection law has since been amended, the passage of time since the lodging of the applicant\u2019s case meant that concentrating on lawfulness would have led to the declaration of a purely historical violation of Article 8 without any guidance to national authorities and courts regarding how to comply in future with the principle of proportionality in similar cases which might arise under the new, amended legislation.",

In addition, the subsequent amendment of Ukrainian data protection rules constituted further proof, if indeed that was required, of a lawfulness problem at the material time. The Court has frequently recognised, as indicated previously, that domestic law may be couched in vague terms and that the interpretation and application of such terms are questions of practice. It is precisely the role of domestic courts to dissipate interpretational doubts and it is precisely that which the domestic courts had difficulty doing in the instant case, as is clear from the toing and froing between the Central District Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. Those courts themselves highlighted the shortcomings in the applicable domestic legislative framework, as did the Constitutional Court in the Ustymenko case referred to above.",

It has practised such restraint on other occasions when it has held that once it has examined the main legal questions raised in an application, there may be no need in the circumstances of a particular case to give a separate ruling on any remaining complaints. With 75,250 applications pending before the Court, greater recourse to the \u201cC\u00e2mpeanu technique\u201d, where possible, is likely to be of considerable benefit to applicants in the medium and long-term. In the instant case, not only did the Chamber, unnecessarily in our view, not concentrate on the central problem of lawfulness under Article 8 of the Convention, but it also proceeded to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention due to the inadequacy of the response of the domestic courts to the applicants\u2019 complaints (see \u00a7\u00a7 96-103 and 93 of the Chamber judgment). One of the factors examined in the context of necessity under Article 8 thus became the central and only plank of the examination under Article 6, despite the fact that the inadequacy of the domestic courts\u2019 response was, in any event, linked to the inadequacy of the domestic legal framework on which the Court should have concentrated in the first place. The identification of two separate violations which stemmed from the same problem was not, in our view, necessary.",
