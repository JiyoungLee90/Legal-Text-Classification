However, the personal attendance of the defendant does not necessarily take on the same significance for an appeal hearing. Indeed, even where an appellate court has full jurisdiction to review the case on questions both of fact and law, Article\u00a06 does not always entail rights to a public hearing and to be present in person. Regard must be had in assessing this question to, inter alia, the special features of the proceedings involved and the manner in which the defence\u2019s interests are presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the issues to be decided by it and their importance for the appellant (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Ekbatani judgment, p. 12, \u00a7\u00a025; the Helmers v. Sweden judgment of 29\u00a0October\u00a01991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0212-A, p.\u00a015, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031\u201332; and the Kremzow\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria judgment of 21\u00a0September\u00a01993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0268B, p.\u00a043, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058\u201359).",

The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may secure that this requirement is met. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party is aware that observations have been filed and gets a real opportunity to comment thereon (see, inter alia, the Brandstetter v. Austria judgment of 28\u00a0August\u00a01991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0211, p.\u00a027,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a066\u201367 and the Lobo\u00a0Machado v.

The applicant, who was not allowed to be present at the hearing on his appeal, intended to contest his conviction and to adduce evidence in support thereof (see paragraphs\u00a010\u00a0and\u00a011\u00a0above). Taking into account what was at stake for Mr Belziuk, who had been sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment, the Court does not consider that the issues to be determined by the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court when adjudicating on the appeal could, as a matter of fair trial, properly have been examined without a direct assessment of the evidence given by the applicant in person (see, mutatis mutandis, \nthe\u00a0Botten\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway judgment of 19\u00a0February\u00a01996, Reports 1996-I, p.\u00a0145, \u00a7\u00a052). Had he been present at the appeal hearing, he would have had an opportunity to challenge his conviction and the submissions of the public prosecutor and to present evidence in support of his appeal. It is also to be noted that the applicant\u2019s interests were not in fact represented at the appeal since there was no counsel present on his behalf. It is immaterial that he chose not to be legally represented, as the Government have maintained (see paragraph 8 above). Under Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3\u00a0(c) of the Convention taken together he had the right in the circumstances to be present at his appeal and to defend himself in person. It follows that the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing in his presence has been violated.",

However, the prosecutor\u2019s submissions before the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court were directed at having the applicant\u2019s appeal dismissed and his conviction upheld. In so doing his role was that of a prosecuting authority in the traditional sense (see the Van\u00a0Orshoven v. Belgium judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports 1997-III, pp. 1050\u201351, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037\u201338). Respect for the principle of equality of arms and the right to adversarial proceedings therefore required that the applicant be allowed to attend the hearing and to contest the submissions of the public prosecutor. Nor can it be maintained in the circumstances that the resulting inequality could have been redressed had the applicant availed himself of the opportunity to forward written submissions to the Regional Court (see paragraph 35 above), having regard both to the presence of the public prosecutor in the courtroom and to the forcefulness of his oral statements (see, mutatis mutandis, the Bulut v. Austria judgment of 22\u00a0February\u00a01996, Reports 1996-II, pp. 359\u201360, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04749).",
