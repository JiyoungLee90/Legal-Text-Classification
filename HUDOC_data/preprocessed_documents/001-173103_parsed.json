He had four children, born in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2006 respectively. His parents, his three siblings and their spouses and children all lived in the same city as him. His parents and his older brother were recognised refugees. He and his parents lived in the same house. He was working as a maintenance man and translator for Albanian and German, and his wife was also working. Both had a regular income. His father still owned some land and three shops in Kosovo, which were run by relatives at that time. The applicant stated that if he had to return to Kosovo he would not know what to do there or where to go. He had a \u201cbad feeling\u201d about returning, but did not fear any repression. The security situation was bad, and the views of society were primitive. His wife and children would not have to fear any problems upon returning to Kosovo, and would probably join him if he were expelled.

The Federal Asylum Office specifically mentioned the two convictions for drug offences in 2007 and 2010, which it considered particularly serious. Further, it held that the applicant still had ties with Kosovo, because he had grown up there, spoke Albanian, and was physically capable of working in order to earn a living. According to the applicant\u2019s own statements, his father still owned some land and three shops in Kosovo, so it could be assumed that he could find work. Given that the applicant\u2019s wife had her own income, the Federal Asylum Office further assumed that she would be able to take care of the needs of the family, and that the applicant could send her financial maintenance from Kosovo.",

The actual prison sentences he had received amounted to twenty-two months in total, which was considerable. The Asylum Court concluded that, even though the applicant had strong private and family ties in Austria, the public interest in his expulsion in order to prevent crime outweighed his personal interest in continuing his family life in Austria. He had reoffended even after he had been issued with the ban prohibiting his return to Austria, a fact which did not speak in his favour. Also, he could reapply for a residence permit in 2017 when the ban expired.",

He could continue to pay financial maintenance from Kosovo for his daughter. The Asylum Court expressed the view that the decision to declare the applicant\u2019s expulsion admissible was nonetheless proportionate to the aims pursued, as his family life with his illegitimate daughter was in any event much less established than that with his other family members.",

However, this interference had been based on the law and had pursued a legitimate aim. The Government submitted that it had also been proportionate to the aims pursued, as the applicant\u2019s long stay in Austria had been considerably impaired by the fact that he had been repeatedly convicted of criminal offences. At the time of the final domestic decision on his expulsion, he had, among other things, already been convicted of large-scale drug trafficking, burglary and six other violent crimes. Even after his expulsion order had become final by the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment, he had been convicted of a further violent crime. The applicant had committed all of his criminal offences as an adult, which added to their severity (see Miah v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53080/07, \u00a7 24, 27\u00a0April 2010, and Balogun v. the United Kingdom, no. 60286/09, \u00a7 49, 10\u00a0April 2012). Moreover, even after the decision to expel the applicant had become final, he had been convicted of further violent crimes. Imprisoning the applicant for several months had not prevented him from committing further criminal offences, nor had issuing him with a ban prohibiting his return in 2007 or withdrawing his subsidiary protection status in 2011. It must have been clear to him at that point that his residence status was extremely insecure (see A.H. Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 6222/10, \u00a7\u00a041, 20 December 2011) and that further criminal convictions could result in a termination of his stay in Austria at any time, and thus separation from his family. Given that he had been convicted of two further offences while the proceedings for the withdrawal of his subsidiary protection status were still ongoing, it had been evident to the authorities that the applicant was completely indifferent to the social values protected by Austrian criminal law provisions. Their prognosis that the applicant would reoffend had ultimately been confirmed by his committing the offence of aggravated threat after the expulsion order had become final.",

The Court has consistently held that its task consists in ascertaining whether the impugned measures struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely the individual\u2019s rights protected by the Convention on the one hand and the community\u2019s interests on the other (see, among many other authorities, Boultif v. Switzerland, no.\u00a04273/00, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001IX). Thus, the State\u2019s margin of appreciation goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8 (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 76).",

He was sentenced to prison terms in relation to the remaining offences, namely burglary in 2003, drug offences in 2007 and aggravated threat in 2012, adding up to twenty-nine months\u2019 imprisonment in total. The Court considers that at least the two latter convictions were particularly serious, as they were directed against the physical integrity of others (compare, for example, Bajsultanov v. Austria, no. 54131/10, \u00a7 84, 12 June 2012; compare and contrast Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 100).

His last criminal conviction was after the withdrawal of his subsidiary protection and only approximately five months before his expulsion (see paragraphs 19 and 29 above). There was therefore no significant period after his last criminal conviction when he did not reoffend. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicant\u2019s persistent offending demonstrated his indifferent attitude towards the Austrian legal order (see paragraph 42 above).",

He was well integrated and spoke German very well. Apart from the time he was imprisoned, the applicant was regularly employed and had an income to support his family. He also paid maintenance for his daughter born out of wedlock. When it comes to the applicant\u2019s assertion that he would not be able to stay in contact with the latter, the Court notes that the applicant only informed the domestic authorities that she was not living with him at a very late stage in the proceedings, namely in his complaint to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, the applicant failed to substantiate how established his relationship with his daughter born out of wedlock was. It is not clear from his submissions \u2013 either before the domestic authorities or before the Court \u2013 whether he was in contact with her regularly, whether he had visiting rights, or whether there are any other factors which would enable the Court to examine the extent of their family life.

From that time until his expulsion he spent some fourteen and a half years in Austria. The applicant\u2019s wife is of Montenegrin origin but was born in Kosovo. Both speak Albanian and the applicant\u2019s father owns some land and three shops in Kosovo, which are run by relatives.

The Court considers that the authorities could therefore reasonably assume that the family would be able to stay together. The fact that the applicant\u2019s wife and children ultimately decided to remain in Austria does not change this ex\u00a0ante assessment. The applicant has not put forward any reasons why his family would not be able to visit him there, or why they would not be able to stay in contact over the phone and via the internet. Lastly, the Court agrees with the Government that the applicant himself has caused a certain disruption of his family life by being repeatedly convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment (see, mutatis mutandis, Sark\u00f6zi and Mahran v.\u00a0Austria, no. 27945/10, \u00a7 73, 2\u00a0April 2015).",
