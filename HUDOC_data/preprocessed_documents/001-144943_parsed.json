It refers in this connection to the domestic courts\u2019 findings that the applicant\u2019s claims rather concerned her disagreement with the calculations made by the Sovestkiy District Court.

However, neither the former nor the latter issue are directly relevant to the payment of the salary arrears awarded in the main judgment, which were paid in February 1994 at the latest (see paragraph 55 above). Consequently, the Court assumes, in the absence of any clear indication to the contrary in the materials of the case file, that the sum awarded to the applicant by the judgment of 21 September 1993 was paid to her in full by that time (see, mutatis mutandis, Bogatyrev v.

Thus, the aggregate length of the proceedings within the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis amounts to almost six years, during which the applicant\u2019s case was considered seventeen times by the first-instance and the appeal courts, and three times by the supervisory review court (see paragraphs 16-45 above).

The Court considers that the task of the courts was rendered more difficult by those factors, although it cannot accept that the complexity of the case, taken on its own, was such as to justify the overall length of the proceedings (see, among others, Malinin v.

First, the first-instance judgments in the applicant\u2019s case were set aside eight times during the period falling under the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, either by the appellate courts or by the supervisory\u00a0review courts, for erroneous application of the substantive law. On at least two occasions, the higher courts clearly indicated that their decision to quash was due to the first-instance court\u2019s failure to comply with their previous instructions (see paragraphs 20-21 and paragraph 40 above). The Court attaches particular weight to the fact that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan explicitly acknowledged the fact of the delay and even made an attempt to examine the case as a first-instance court in order to accelerate its final resolution. However, this eventually resulted in further prolongation of the proceedings (see paragraphs 33-37 above).",

As a result, they relinquished jurisdiction one to another, thus compelling the applicant to restart the same proceedings time and again with different courts (see, in particular, paragraphs 15-19, 22-25 and 39-40 above). The Court reiterates that the authorities are responsible for the delays stemming from the courts\u2019 mistakes concerning jurisdiction. It was incumbent upon the domestic authorities to ensure that the national law provided clear guidance on the application of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction (see Salikova v.
