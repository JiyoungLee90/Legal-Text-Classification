If the applicant had missed the time-limit to submit her appeal on points of law, she should have asked the Supreme Court to renew it (see paragraph 17 above). The Government also explained that the selection panels for criminal cases were formed in advance by decisions of the Chair of the Criminal Cases Division of the Supreme Court. However, the panels were computer generated, and thus the composition was a merely technical act. While there was no obligation under domestic law to inform an appellant of the composition of the selection panel, this information was published every month on the website of the Supreme Court.

Firstly, the domestic law did not provide that the partiality of judges of the selection panel of the Supreme Court was one of the grounds for an appeal on points of law. Secondly, it was the applicant\u2019s view that a request to renew the time-limit to submit an appeal on points of law would not have had reasonable prospects of success. Thirdly, the applicant submitted that it was impossible to find examples in the domestic case-law regarding a person\u2019s right to apply for the removal of a judge on a selection panel of the Supreme Court. Lastly, the applicant claimed that the appeal on points of law had been lodged on 7 January 2014. At that time, no information as to the composition of the selection panel of the Supreme Court had been available. According to the applicant, the selection panel for the period 2 January 2014-31 January 2014 had been formed by a decision of 2 January 2014. The selection panel for the period 3 February 2014-28 February 2014 had been formed by a decision of 3 February 2014, when her appeal on points of law had already been submitted. The applicant argued that when she had submitted her appeal on points of law, she had not been in a position to seek the removal of Judge V.G., as the composition of the selection panel of the Supreme Court had changed every month, and she could not reasonably have known that the judge was going to be on the panel.

However, it can be observed that Judge V.G. presided over the three-judge selection panel of the Supreme Court, that the applicant therefore had grounds to believe that he had an important role in delivering the decision dismissing her appeal on points of law, and that the impartiality of the Supreme Court could have been open to genuine doubt (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramljak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a039, and Morice, cited above, \u00a7 89). The Court also notes that the Supreme Court has sixteen judges in its Criminal Division (see paragraph 11 above), and therefore there is no indication that there would have been any practical difficulties in finding a substitute for Judge V.G. among the other judges (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramljak, cited above, \u00a7 39).",

There was no higher court to appeal to, the Supreme Court being the court of last resort (compare and contrast Ramljak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033). In that connection, the Court reiterates that, in its case-law, it has emphasised the crucial role of cassation proceedings, which form a special stage of the criminal proceedings with potentially decisive consequences for the accused (see paragraph 16 above), as in the present case. Had the case been quashed, it could have been remitted to a lower court for a fresh examination of both the facts and the law (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 88).",
