Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR 1999-V).

Furthermore, the Court considers that it is the State\u2019s positive obligation to organise a system of enforcement of judgments in such a way as to ensure that there is no undue delay and that the system is effective both in law and in practice. It considers therefore that the Government\u2019s submission as to the failure of the applicant to re-introduce the execution writ is unsubstantiated, as proved by the fact that the bailiffs instituted the enforcement proceedings independently from the applicant on 23 June 2003 and the payment to the applicant was made on 14\u00a0August 2003.
