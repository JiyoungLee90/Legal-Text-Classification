In this respect, it referred, inter alia, to the fact that 7\u00a0hearings had been cancelled since the police had failed to bring the accused from prison.

In the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, the laconic statement of the District Court that the trial had not been concluded for reasons which could not be attributed to it, was not sufficient. The Court of Appeal also criticised the fact that between June 2002 and 30\u00a0December 2002 the District Court had listed only two hearings. A hearing scheduled for 17 July 2002 was cancelled because not all of the victims had been properly summoned, while the hearing listed for 27 September 2002 was cancelled due to the holiday of one of the counsel. The Court of Appeal further noted that on 6 November 2002 a new judge had been assigned to the case. However, it noted that the District Court had not taken any significant measures aimed at concluding the proceedings, as had been indicated in the earlier decisions of the  and the Court of Appeal. It lastly stressed that the case was not particularly complex and suggested that the District Court should properly organise the trial and terminate it by the end of March 2003.",

The Court agrees that the applicant\u2019s attempt to abscond justified keeping him in custody at the initial stages of the proceedings. However, the Court considers that that ground gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed. In particular, given the absence of any further attempt on the part of the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, it is difficult to accept that the single fact that he had attempted to leave Poland shortly before his arrest, could justify the conclusion that the risk of his tampering with evidence or going into hiding persisted during the entire period that he spent in custody.",

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that, in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could initially justifiably have considered that such a risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). In the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the severity of the anticipated penalty alone, or in conjunction with the other grounds relied on by the authorities, cannot constitute a \u201crelevant and sufficient ground\u201d for holding the applicant in detention for a period of over 2 years and 8\u00a0months.",

In this context the Court would emphasise that under Article 5 \u00a7 3 the authorities, when deciding whether a person should be released or detained, are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial. Indeed, that provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Neumeister v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 27\u00a0June 1968, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a08, p.\u00a03, \u00a7 3; and Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v.

In addition, the Court notes that the Katowice Court of Appeal in its decision of 27\u00a0November 2002 criticised the District Court for the slow progress of the trial (see paragraph 17 above). The Court finds that the delay of nearly two years in opening the trial should be considered significant and it cannot therefore be said that the authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.",
