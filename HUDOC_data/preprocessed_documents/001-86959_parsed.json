The domestic courts had taken into account the gravity of the charge, the applicant\u2019s frequent absences from his registered place of residence and his record of administrative offences. The Government produced the applicant\u2019s record of administrative offences, which included such offences as a violation of the procedure for organising public assemblies and refusing to comply with a lawful order of the police. The domestic courts had also considered that his accomplices whose identity had not been established were at large. Moreover, the applicant had not attended his classes at the university. It followed from the above facts that the applicant was not a law-abiding citizen and that there was a risk of his absconding or reoffending. The applicant\u2019s positive references, his willingness to post bail and the personal surety of a member of Parliament had been insufficient to warrant release.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a054071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001).

The courts assumed that the gravity of the charge carried such a preponderant weight that no other circumstances could have obtained the applicant\u2019s release. The Court has repeatedly held that, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of an accused absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the seriousness of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51; see also Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081). This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Govorushko v. , no.\u00a042940/06, \u00a7\u00a048, 25\u00a0October 2007). The domestic courts explicitly refused to consider the state of evidence against the applicant or verify the persistence of reasonable suspicion of his involvement in the commission of the imputed offence (see paragraph 26 above).",

The Court notes that whatever the District Court\u2019s finding about the applicant\u2019s residence situation was, the court invariably concluded that he should remain in custody. It shows that the applicant\u2019s residence situation was not a decisive factor in the assessment of the risk of absconding, which was primarily assessed by reference to the gravity of the charge. In any event, the mere absence of a fixed residence does not give rise to a danger of absconding (see Pshevecherskiy\u00a0v. , no. 28957/02, \u00a7\u00a068, 24\u00a0May 2007, and Sulaoja v.

The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, in such cases the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings is often particularly high. All these factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure (see Osuch v. Poland, no.\u00a031246/02, \u00a7\u00a026, 14 November 2006; and Celejewski v. , no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4 May 2006). The fact that a person is charged with acting in criminal conspiracy is not in itself sufficient to justify long periods of detention, his personal circumstances and behaviour must always be taken into account. There is no indication in the present case that before his arrest the applicant had made any attempts to intimidate witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way. In such circumstances the Court has difficulty accepting that there was a risk of interference with the administration of justice at the later stages of the proceedings. Such risk was bound to gradually decrease as the trial proceeded and the witnesses were interviewed (compare Miszkurka v. , no.\u00a039437/03, \u00a7\u00a051, 4 May 2006) The Court is not therefore persuaded that, throughout the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, compelling reasons existed for a fear that he would interfere with witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation of the case, and certainly not such as to outweigh the applicant\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

The Court accepts that that factor was relevant in assessing the danger of reoffending. Such a danger, if convincingly established, may lead the judicial authorities to place and leave a suspect in detention in order to prevent any attempts to commit further offences. It is however necessary, among other conditions, that the danger be a plausible one and the measure appropriate, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in particular the past history and the personality of the person concerned (see Clooth v. Belgium, judgment of 12\u00a0December 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0225, \u00a7\u00a040). In the cases of Clooth v. Belgium and Kolev v. Bulgaria (see below) the Court found that the previous criminal record did not justify the applicant\u2019s detention because the offences which had given rise to the applicant\u2019s previous convictions were non-violent and were not comparable, either in nature or degree of seriousness, to the charges preferred against him in the contested proceedings (see Clooth, cited above, \u00a7 40, and Kolev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050326/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-61, 28 April 2005). In the present case the applicant\u2019s record included only minor non-violent administrative offences and he had no criminal record. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s record of administrative offences did not justify his continued detention.",

That circumstance was referred to for the first time in the proceedings before the Court and the domestic courts never mentioned it in their decisions.
