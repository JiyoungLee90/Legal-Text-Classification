It noted that, under Article 73 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, preventive custody could be applied in order to prevent a defendant at trial from evading the criminal proceedings or committing a new crime. It held that the County Court had had good grounds to believe that the applicant was evading the criminal proceedings and that he was in breach of a signed undertaking not to leave his place of residence. He had not reacted to summonses sent to his place of residence and had not answered phone calls. The fact that the applicant had been taken into custody had made it possible, on 17 October 2002, to conduct a hearing, after which the applicant had been released. In respect of the applicant\u2019s allegation that he had never signed an undertaking not to leave his place of residence, the Court of Appeal established, based on the case file, that the applicant had been presented with a decision according to which a prohibition to leave his place of residence had been applied as a preventive measure. The fact that the applicant had refused to sign it could not be interpreted to mean that the measure had not been applied. The preventive measure in the form of a signed undertaking not to leave one\u2019s place of residence was not meant to restrict one\u2019s freedom of movement; its purpose was rather to keep the court informed of the person\u2019s whereabouts so that the criminal proceedings could be conducted without delays. However, in the particular instance, the criminal case could not be conducted without delays, as the applicant had failed to comply with the preventive measure applied under Article 69 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court of Appeal noted that it was not possible in those proceedings concerning the appeal against the County Court\u2019s ruling to decide on the compensation claim for damage.",

They emphasised that the defendant\u2019s attendance at the court hearings was compulsory. In case of the defendant\u2019s failure to attend, there were three possibilities: first, the defendant could be sent a summons and would voluntarily attend a hearing; second, the defendant could be compelled by the police to attend the hearing; third, it was possible to take the defendant into custody. In the present case the court had used the first two possibilities with no success. Thus, the applicant\u2019s detention \u2013 authorised under Article\u00a073 of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 had been the only remaining possibility to secure his attendance at the court\u2019s hearing. The Government pointed out that the court was obliged to hear the criminal case within a reasonable time and, in case the defendant absconded from the proceedings, the court had to take measures to ensure the judicial hearing of the case and secure the defendant\u2019s presence. Otherwise, an issue of compliance with Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention could arise.",

The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness. Moreover, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, pp. 752-53, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-41).",

This fact in itself does not give rise to an issue under Article 5 \u00a7 3, as a requirement cannot be derived from the Convention to the effect that a person who is evading court proceedings should be present at the court hearing where authorisation for his or her arrest is dealt with (see Harkmann v. Estonia (dec.), no. 2192/03, 1 March 2005). However, the Court observes that the applicant had no chance to present the court with possible personal reasons militating against his detention after his actual arrest on 2 October 2002, despite the authorities\u2019 obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 3 to give him a possibility to be heard.",
