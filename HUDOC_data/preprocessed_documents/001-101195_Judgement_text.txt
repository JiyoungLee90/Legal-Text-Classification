Article 409 provides that judgments of foreign courts concerning civil matters are recognized and enforced in  pursuant to a pertinent international treaty. It further stipulates that such judgments can be submitted for enforcement within three years after their adoption.
Article 410 provides that a request for enforcement of a foreign judgment should be filed with a regional court or other court of equal standing at the place of the debtor's residence or location.
Article 411 sets out the rules of procedure applying to the requests for enforcement of foreign judgments.
The court ruled that lack of a pertinent international treaty cannot be cited as grounds for refusal of a request for enforcement of a foreign judgment. It further stated that such a request can be granted in the event that the courts of the relevant foreign State recognize the judgments of the Russian courts on the basis of reciprocity. It ordered that the lower court verify whether such reciprocity existed in the case at hand and inquire into the existence of other international treaties concerning the two relevant States that might concern co-operation in the legal and judicial domain.
The Convention requires that that all members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, including Russia, Ukraine and  grant the citizens of the other member States the national legal regime in all legal matters. Section III determines the reciprocal order of recognition and enforcement of the decisions taken by legal bodies in civil, family and criminal cases.
