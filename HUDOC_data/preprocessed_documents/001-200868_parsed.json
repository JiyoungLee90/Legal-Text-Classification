The Supreme Court firstly noted that the restriction set out in Article 668 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure aimed to safeguard the interests of the debtor so that, when the recovery process was started, the debtor would have a sufficient sum at his disposal to satisfy his basic needs and the minimum amount required for subsistence.

Such money would then be placed in the prisoner\u2019s account at the correctional institution and was his property, which the prisoner could then use to satisfy his basic needs.

The applicant also admitted that in that area the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation, especially in the absence of a consensus among the Member States as concerns the income or level of income from which there can be no recovery of damages. That being so, she also pleaded that, even in the absence of such a consensus, recovery of a debt could not be taken from the minimum funds required for the applicant\u2019s survival, which in this particular case were equal to the minimum monthly salary, as stated in Article 668 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph\u00a011 above).

In that regard the applicant disagreed with the Government\u2019s interpretation of that legal provision (see paragraph\u00a023 below). Namely, the applicant insisted that the aforementioned legal provision imposed a permanent restriction on any recovery being made at any given time from a balance of money, both in cash and funds kept in bank accounts, which did not exceed the minimum monthly salary. This meant that each time, that is every month, before commencing the execution procedure, the bailiff had to estimate the amount of all the assets possessed by the debtor at that particular moment of recovery, and only take steps for recovery against such funds as exceeded the minimum monthly salary at that particular point in time.",

Thus, the measures taken to ensure the implementation of a court order requiring the payment of compensation for damage could not be considered as aiming to protect the individual interests of the victim, or the broader general interests of society.",

Moreover, the possibility of recovering the debt from income that was lower than the minimum monthly salary could not be justified by the fact that the State provided other social assistance to persons in need in various forms \u2013 such as housing, various allowances, social benefits and maintenance. The applicant considered that all such social assistance was directed at ensuring the recipient\u2019s basic survival, and could not be viewed as being granted to a person in order to cover any additional burden imposed by the recovery of debt. This would also be applicable to other benefits, such as transport costs or compensation for medication costs, guaranteed in the form of discounts or exemptions which could be enjoyed by people who had reached retirement age. In other words, the purpose of the entire social welfare package awarded to the applicant under the given circumstances was to ensure the person\u2019s survival, and it could not be employed as a source to recover debts.",

Furthermore, the possibility of recovering debts from income which was lower than the minimum salary could be supported by the fact that the State provided social assistance to persons in need in a variety of forms \u2013 such as granting them social housing or various allowances and social benefits. That had been precisely the applicant\u2019s situation.

It reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful: the second sentence of the first paragraph authorises a deprivation of possessions only \u201csubject to the conditions provided for by law\u201d and the second paragraph recognises that States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing \u201claws\u201d. Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a094). Furthermore, any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions can only be justified if it serves a legitimate general interest (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0105). Finally, there must exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos.\u00a01828/06 and 2\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a0293, 28\u00a0June 2018). The requisite fair balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see F\u00e1bi\u00e1n v. Hungary [GC], no.\u00a078117/13, \u00a7\u00a029, 5\u00a0September 2017, with further references).",

It refers to the consistent practice of the Supreme Court, which was also relied on by the Government, to the effect that whilst Article 668 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure restricts the recovery of debt from such part of a person\u2019s income that falls below the minimum monthly salary, this is a one-time restriction (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). On the facts of this case, the Court observes that whilst the writ of execution was issued by the court on 24\u00a0November 2016 and the bailiff submitted it to the SODRA and served it on the applicant on 22\u00a0December 2016, the first deduction from the applicant\u2019s old-age pension, according to the information furnished to the Court by the parties, did not take place until 20\u00a0January 2017 (see paragraphs 5 and 6 above). Furthermore, that and subsequent deductions were also in compliance with Article\u00a0736 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which stipulated that in the case of compensation for damage to health, as was the situation in the applicant\u2019s case, between twenty and fifty per cent of a pension could be deducted (see paragraph 11 above). That being so, the Court finds that the interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention was in accordance with the law.",

At the outset, and by a way of general observation, the Court refers to its earlier case-law to the effect that, in principle, it cannot substitute itself for the national authorities in assessing or reviewing the level of financial benefits available under a social assistance scheme (see Larioshina v. Russia ((dec.), no.\u00a056869/00, 23\u00a0April 2002). Although the applicant\u2019s situation differs from that examined in that case, as in the instant case the applicant complained that her hardship had been aggravated by the fact that twenty per cent of her already low pension was being deducted by the State, the Court does not overlook the fact that, unlike in the case of Larioshina, the present applicant brought this situation on herself by \u201cterrorising\u201d her neighbours and causing them psychological injury (see paragraph 4 above). Moreover, the case at hand does not concern either the permanent, complete loss of the applicant\u2019s pension entitlement or the reduction thereof but rather deduction of part of her monthly pension payment until she repays her debt (see F\u00e1bi\u00e1n, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a074 and 76).",

However, the applicant has failed to substantiate her allegation that the lack of funds translated itself into actual suffering (see, mutatis mutandis, Budina v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a045603/05, 18\u00a0June 2009). Furthermore, the Court cannot but note that, besides her old-age pension, the applicant was in receipt of a number of other social allowances, including for housing (as of 1993), for water, and, at least on occasion, for food (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). It has not been alleged that there were any delays in the payment of those benefits or that there had been any other interference with the applicant\u2019s \u201cpossessions\u201d in this respect, within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see Larioshina, cited above). Likewise, as of 2019 the applicant has been receiving a monthly allowance of EUR\u00a060.47, which is almost three times more than the sum being deducted from her old-age pension (see paragraph 8 above). That being so, the Court cannot find that the deduction from the applicant\u2019s pension left her devoid of all means of subsistence (see F\u00e1bi\u00e1n, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078). In this context the Court also notes that by March 2019 more than one third of the debt had already been repaid.",

Without it being necessary for the Court to speculate as to the likely value of that plot, the Court considers that the applicant, if she was indeed suffering an unsurmountable hardship due to the deductions being made from her old-age pension, retained the right to sell that plot in order to clear her debt to the victims of her crime. However, the applicant did not take any such steps in order to alleviate her financial situation (see also, mutatis mutandis, F\u00e1bi\u00e1n, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076 and 77).",
