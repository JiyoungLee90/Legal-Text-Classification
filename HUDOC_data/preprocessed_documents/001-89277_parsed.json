The victim \u2013 according to the certificates issued by psychologists (Polish and German) \u2013 as a consequence of her brutal rape by two perpetrators, remained, one year after the events, under intensive psychological and medical care and suffered from depression and anxiety. A limitless effort to fulfil the principle of directness, within legal boundaries, would be in striking collision with the legitimate interest of M.H. [...]. It would strengthen a false conviction within society that the victim of a crime is placed on the margin of the criminal procedure and is interesting to the relevant authorities only in so far as he or she is necessary to convict an accused or acquit him or her. The interpretation of the term \u2018obstacles which could not be removed\u2019, as the genuine possibility of a deterioration of the victim\u2019s mental health as a result of having to appear before a court, has already been set out in the jurisprudence under the 1969 Code of Criminal Procedure.",

In spite of this, the authorities did not make any effort to determine the actual address of M.H. which was a precondition for serving a summons on a witness residing abroad (see, a conrario, Gossa v. , no.\u00a047986/99, \u00a7\u00a058, 9 January 2007).

The Court acknowledges that the special features of criminal proceedings concerning rape might require balancing the needs of the defence against those of witnesses or victims called upon to testify. Such proceedings are often conceived of as an ordeal by the victim, in particular as they entail being confronted again with the defendant. However, in the light of the findings above, in the present case it cannot be said that the witness\u2019s whereabouts were unknown or that she sought ways to avoid a confrontation with the defendants (see Scheper v the Netherlands (dec), 39209/02, 5 April 2005). Had the domestic court made more effort to summon the witness to the proceedings and had she demonstrated that her participation would have had an adverse effect on her mental state, the applicant\u2019s complaint that his defence rights had not been respected would have been put in a different perspective. The Court further observes that arrangements could in any event have been made to allow M.H. to give evidence in a manner which spared her the ordeal of an adversarial procedure while respecting the rights of the defence (see W.S. v. , no.\u00a021508/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 19\u00a0June 2007 and S.N., cited above, \u00a7\u00a047).",
