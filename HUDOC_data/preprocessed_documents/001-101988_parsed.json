The latter listed funeral and cemetery services among the mandatory public utilities and stipulated that with respect to the cemeteries provided under special decree these services should be provided by a public-law enterprise.

It also listed cemetery and funeral services as mandatory public utilities and stated that a special municipal decree should determine the exact structure by means of which each of the listed public utilities should be provided. On 31\u00a0January\u00a02002 the 2001 Decree was amended (\u201cthe 2002 Amendment\u201d, Official Gazette 11/02), to include a provision stating that \u201cpublic utilities .... funeral and cemetery services, which should be carried out by a public-law enterprise according to specific decrees, shall be provided by KNM\u201d.

This Act did not distinguish between funerals and cemetery services. Consequently, funerals and cemetery services were automatically considered public utilities on the basis of section 68 of the 1993 Public Utilities Act.

However, in view of the clear provisions of the 1993 Public Utilities Act and the 1984 Cemetery and Funeral Act and in the absence of any further implementing local legislation this could not be understood as eliminating the funeral services from the public realm. In any event, this Decree was amended by the 1998 Amendment, which listed funeral services as mandatory public utilities, as did all the subsequent decrees (see paragraphs 23-25 above).
