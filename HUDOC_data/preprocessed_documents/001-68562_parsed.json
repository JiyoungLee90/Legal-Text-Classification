The Court recalls in this respect that the \u201cright to a court\u201d, derived from Article\u00a06, comprises a duty of the State to implement final judicial decisions (see Hornsby v.\u00a0Greece, judgment of 19\u00a0March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, \u00a7\u00a040).

When considering the applicants' grievances in this way, the Court accepts that the applicants may still claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention and, thus, the Court has to examine whether the late execution of the judgments in the applicants' favour constituted a breach of their \u201cright to a court\u201d implied by Article 6 of the Convention.",

It is true that the enforcement proceedings were initiated by the applicants with a certain delay (see \u00a7 12). However, as transpires from the materials of the case, the only apparent reason for the non-enforcement of the judgments was the authorities' reluctance to make adequate budgetary appropriations (see\u00a0\u00a7 13). Therefore, whether the bailiffs were involved in the enforcement proceedings or not did not change the situation. Moreover, a person who has obtained an enforceable judgment against the State as a result of successful litigation cannot be required to resort to enforcement proceedings in order to have it executed (see Metaxas v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27\u00a0May 2004). The Government present no evidence that the applicants somehow contributed to the overall length of the enforcement proceedings. The Court therefore concludes that the whole period between the appeal court's decisions upholding the judgments in the applicants' favour (18\u00a0April and 28\u00a0November 2001 respectively) and the date of receipt by the applicants of the amounts due to them under these judgment (5\u00a0November 2002) should be considered as a delay in execution imputable to the State authorities.",
