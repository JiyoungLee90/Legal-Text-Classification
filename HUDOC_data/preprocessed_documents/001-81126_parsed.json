The Government claimed that the bailiffs were not competent to enforce the judgment against the military unit and that the applicant should have submitted the writ of execution to the Federal Treasury. Even assuming that the documents were submitted incorrectly through the applicant's fault, the Court notes that the bailiffs did not inform the applicant about his mistake and did not return the writ of execution to him so that he could resubmit it to the competent agency. Instead, they sent the writ to the debtor which resulted in its being lost. It was only ten months later that the court issued a duplicate writ. No justification was offered for that delay.",
