The Court observes that the final decision in this case was given by the review bench of the Supreme Court on 29 January 2003. However, the application was only introduced on 1 May 2004, i.e. more than six months later (cf. Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention).",

However, he only complained that the length of the proceedings infringed his right to an effective remedy rather than about the absence of a remedy to speed up the proceedings. Since he did not rely on any substantive Article of the Convention to be examined in conjunction with the Article 13 complaint, this aspect of the case is incompatible ratione materiae, with the provisions of the Convention (cf. Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4).",
