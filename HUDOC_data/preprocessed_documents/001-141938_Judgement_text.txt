The case originated in an application (no. 54289/09) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Mariann Lakat (“the applicant”), on 7 October 2009.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 5 May 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Dabas.
In 1985 the applicant’s father brought an action in compensation and including other claims before the Pest Central District Court. In 1986 the applicant joined the litigation.
Between June 1995 and January 1998 as well as between March 2000 and December 2004 the case was interrupted on account of the deaths of several of the altogether 37 respondents.
In 2007 the applicant’s father died. The court again interrupted the proceedings pending the entry into litigation of the successor. However, it appears that this successor was the applicant herself, who had been party to the case since 1986.
The case is still pending before the Pest Central District Court.
