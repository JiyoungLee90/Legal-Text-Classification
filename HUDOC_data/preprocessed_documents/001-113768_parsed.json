The Court has already welcomed the new developments in domestic jurisprudence in the field of protection of personal rights in the prison context (see Kaprykowski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a023052/05, \u00a7\u00a055, 3 February 2009 where the Government relied on a successful civil action for the protection of personal rights in the context of an inmate complaining about exposure to passive smoking). It is not persuaded, however, that the relevant judgments can have any parallel effect in the area of claims arising from inadequate medical care in detention as of today and even less in 2007, at the time when the applicant introduced his application with the Court. The Government referred to only one judicial decision where a claimant was successful in respect of a compensation claim arising out of inadequate medical care in prison. It must be noted that the applicant lodged his application with the Court on 4\u00a0April 2007. By that time he had already spent seven years in continuous detention (see paragraph 7 above).",

The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a058749/00, \u00a7\u00a076, 15\u00a0January 2004, and Sakkopoulos v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a061828/00, \u00a7\u00a038, 15\u00a0January 2004). In exceptional circumstances, Article 3 may go as far as requiring the conditional liberation of a prisoner who is seriously ill or disabled. In applying these principles, the Court has already held that the detention of an elderly sick person over a lengthy period may fall within the scope of Article 3 (see Papon v.\u00a0France (no.\u00a01) (dec.), no.\u00a064666/01, ECHR\u00a02001-VI; Sawoniuk v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a063716/00, ECHR 2001-VI; and Priebke v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no. 48799/99, 5\u00a0April 2001).",

The present case differs from these cases in that insulin-dependent diabetes does not affect the person\u2019s everyday functioning in the same way as many serious illnesses do. However, the Court observes that this is a condition which necessitates injections of insulin several times per day and, also, regular control of the blood sugar levels of the person affected with it with a view to maintaining them within the physiological range. It also requires a special diet. Hence, the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes poses special problems within the prison context as round-the-clock monitoring of the person is necessary. The Court acknowledges that the applicant must have been aware of the strict requirements that insulin treatment must meet in order to control diabetes and that he could have experienced considerable anxiety as to whether these requirements could be successfully complied with in the prison setting.",

In the applicant\u2019s case, the medical certificate issued at the time of the applicant\u2019s discharge from the hospital, already after his release from prison, stated that the applicant had not received sufficient training and, as a result, was unable to monitor the treatment and administer injections correctly (see paragraph 35 above). It has not been shown that throughout the eight years of the applicant\u2019s detention the prison medical services made adequate and constant efforts to educate the applicant as to how to deal with his diabetes. It is a matter of regret that apparently the applicant was not provided with such training during his detention as it is of primordial importance in the treatment and control of insulin-dependent diabetes.",
