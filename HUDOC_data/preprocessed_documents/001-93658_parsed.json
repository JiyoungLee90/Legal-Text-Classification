They argued that this provision should be read together with section 394 of the Civil Procedure Act providing for the possibility of requesting the reopening of finally concluded civil proceedings, which would normally mean first-instance or second-instance proceedings (see paragraph 27 above). The Court notes, however, that unlike the Government, the  has not adopted such an interpretation. In none of the four decisions, which concerned proceedings on a constitutional appeal, did the panel of three judges of the  decide in favour of the claimant seeking reopening.

The Court, however, notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he or she would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded. This would in the present case be best achieved, if the domestic legislation provided for a possibility to reopen the proceedings and reexamine the case in keeping with all the requirements of a fair hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Yanakiev v. Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, \u00a7\u00a7 89- 90, 10 August 2006).\u00a0Whatever the case may be, the Court considers that the lack of Article 6 guarantees in the proceedings at issue caused the applicant distress which cannot be made good by the mere finding of a violation (see, for example, H.A.L., cited above, \u00a756 and K.S., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 29). Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court therefore awards her EUR 4,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
