He pointed out that, contrary to what the Ministry had stated, his ownership rights had been significantly limited, as his freedom to deal with the property as he wished had been restricted.

In particular, those effects included restrictions with regard to the use of objects, and obligations on the part of owners to seek prior permission for any change in the nature of use of objects. There were also restrictions with regard to the transfer of property where the State had a right of pre-emption. Moreover, under the Cultural Heritage Act, an object of cultural heritage could be expropriated in the interests of the State (see paragraph 22 above). The Court observes that, during the proceedings before the domestic authorities, the applicant referred to the adverse effect of these restrictions on his commercial projects concerning the building, which is consonant with his arguments and evidence put before the Court (see paragraph 14 above, and compare, by contrast, Valette and Doherier, cited above, \u00a7 20).",

As indicated above, we consider that the applicant did not make use of the possibility to claim compensation for any disproportionate burden he might have had to bear in the general interest. In our opinion, he did not provide the competent authorities with an opportunity to assess any burden alleged by him and, if it was found to be disproportionate, to compensate him for it. We therefore disagree with the majority that the applicant exhausted domestic remedies (see paragraph 28 of the judgment).

One should also bear in mind that the protective measure was not in place continuously for six years, as a period of nine months passed between the end of the validity of the first measure and the adoption of the second measure, during which the applicant could freely dispose of his property.",

The only concrete effect mentioned by the majority is the effect on the applicant\u2019s commercial projects concerning his building. We have already indicated that we do not consider that this adverse effect was substantiated. In our opinion, there is nothing in the file that suggests that the Split Department would have acted in an irresponsible way if it had been asked to authorise any change to the applicant\u2019s property. Moreover, it appears that the applicant only became aware on 16 October 2007 of the existence of the second measure (see paragraph 11 of the judgment), having up to then, for nine months, been not in the least affected in practical terms by its existence.",

To our regret, we find this a somewhat unfair way of treating the authorities. The applicant himself did not raise the issue of the public availability of the information in his submissions to the Court, and that issue was therefore not commented upon by the Government either. Moreover, the majority\u2019s reasoning on this point is based entirely on a statement made by the Split Department when it had to refer the file to the Ministry of Culture (see paragraph 12 of the judgment). The Ministry did not rely on the excuse of the local authority in the further domestic proceedings. What is more, in their submissions before our Court the Government described in detail the complex nature of the process of determining cultural objects, and mentioned the specific obstacles encountered during the large-scale operation carried out in respect of the industrial heritage in Split. While that explanation seems plausible to us, the majority does not consider it worth even mentioning it when seeking to ascertain whether there was any justification for the application of the measure of preventive protection for six years.",

We therefore do not think that this issue should be raised by the Court of its own motion. Moreover, in our opinion due attention should be paid to the fact that the measures of protection were of a provisional nature. The harm done, if any, was of a temporary nature. It is precisely in the proceedings that followed the second provisional measure that the applicant could make his views known. No attention is paid to the fact that the outcome was favourable to him since the authorities eventually abandoned the idea of protecting his property.",

It is therefore questionable whether the Administrative Court can be blamed for any shortcoming in this respect.
