The president of that giant college of most reverend judges has had little power; [however,] ... N.N. presented himself to the voters \u2013 that is to say, to his peers, and those whom he helped to promote to a position from which one day they would be able to elect him \u2013 under the kind of manifesto which makes the hair of the most peaceful citizen stand on end. The man didn\u2019t do this out of the goodness of his own heart: at the same time that he was acting as a trade unionist (he asked for an increase in his salary and that less work be given to judges ...) he acted as someone who wanted to overthrow the regime (by wanting to sit on the Council of State [Conselho de Estado]) and added the glittering (due to the amount of accumulated tallow) hat of \u201cresister\u201d of reforms in the judicial sector. If it was advisable for a President of the Supreme Court to pay greater attention to Montesquieu and the principle of the separation of powers than to the playbook of the CGTP [General Confederation of Portuguese Workers], N.N. did exactly the opposite. He laid out his demands in the grandiose manner of a steelworker in a futuristic \u201csocialist realism\u201d painting, forgetting that he is a judge and the highest representative of the third [branch of government], the judiciary, and claimed a place at the table of the \u201cfirst [branch]\u201d, the executive. It is true that the power of the Council of State is as innocuous as the plume of being president of the Supreme Court, but the claim has in itself two perversities. Firstly, it is a sign that N.N. cares more about his public prominence than the problems of justice. Secondly, and much more serious, the man is volunteering himself to be the face of a group of judges [that is] against the reforming decisions of those holding political power which are currently the subject of a broad consensus between the government party and the main opposition force.",

However, where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the impugned statement: if there does not, that value judgment may prove excessive (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2007IV; Brasilier v.\u00a0France, no. 71343/01, \u00a7 36, 11 April 2006; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), 1\u00a0July 1997, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV). In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks (see Brasilier, cited above, \u00a7 37), bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of facts (see Paturel v. France, no.\u00a054968/00, \u00a7 37, 22\u00a0December 2005). The Court further reiterates that the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Bozhkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a03316/04, \u00a7 46, 19 April 2011). In situations where on the one hand a statement of fact is made and insufficient evidence is adduced to prove it, and on the other hand the journalist is discussing an issue of genuine public interest, verifying whether the journalist has acted professionally and in good faith becomes paramount (see Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, \u00a7\u00a063, 19 April 2011, and Flux v. Moldova (no. 7), no. 25367/05, \u00a7 41, 24\u00a0November 2009).",

In two fairly recent cases, the Court defined its own role in balancing these two conflicting interests and went on to identify a number of relevant criteria to be considered when the right to freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-95, 7 February 2012, and Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos.\u00a040660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7\u00a7 101-113, ECHR 2012).",

France, no. 20893/03, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2008 (extracts)). At the same time, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a State governed by the rule of law, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Mustafa Erdo\u011fan and Others v. Turkey, nos. 346/04 and 39779/04, \u00a7 42, 27 May 2014). The Court notes, however, that the instant case is distinguishable from the latter in so far as the President of the Supreme Court of Justice cannot be considered to be in the same position as any other judge: on the one hand, he is also the President of the HCJ; on the other hand, as the President of the Supreme Court of Justice he is the fourth-highest-ranking figure of State with a sit on the Council of State. The exercise of these roles is not part of adjudication. Thus, his ability to defend himself in public is wider than those of judges who exercise purely judicial acts.",
