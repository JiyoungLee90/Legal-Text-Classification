Also, as regards in particular prisoners serving life sentences, their automatic segregation from the rest of the prison population and from each other, in particular where no comprehensive out-of-cell activities or in-cell stimuli are available, may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Savi\u010ds v. Latvia, no. 17892/03, \u00a7 139, 27 November 2012). Similarly, the Court has found that isolation should be justified by particular security reasons (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 204, with further references to soft-law instruments; see also Radev v.

All four applicants were segregated from other categories of prisoners; in particular, the second, third and fourth applicants \u2013 pursuant to application of the relevant rules applicable to life prisoners, and the first applicant \u2013 on the basis of an order by the prison governor (see paragraph 5 above).

As regards the situation specifically of the third applicant, the Court reiterates its earlier findings that, in order for a toilet which is not separated from the rest of the applicant\u2019s prison cell to be usable, the authorities had to provide basic hygiene products, including toilet paper (see Radev, cited above, \u00a7 55).",
