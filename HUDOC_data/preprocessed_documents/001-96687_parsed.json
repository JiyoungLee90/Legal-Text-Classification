Dimitrios Zelilof, an acquaintance of the passengers who was passing by, proceeded to ask one of them, Mr\u00a0Giorgos Kalaitsidis, what was going on. A police officer, who was subsequently identified as Police Sergeant Apostolos Apostolidis, flashed his torch on him and asked him to identify himself. Mr Zelilof replied that he wanted to know whether his friend had a problem. The latter was then asked by another police officer, later identified as Police Constable Zaharias Tsiorakis, to produce his identity card. Mr\u00a0Zelilof replied that he did not have his identity card with him and suggested that they all go to the nearby police station for an identity check, as his identity card had been issued there. Then, allegedly, one of the police officers asked him whether he was \u201cbeing the tough guy\u201d. Seconds later, Police Officer Tsiorakis wrapped handcuffs around Dimitrios Zelilof\u2019s fist and then punched him in the mouth. This made him feel dizzy and, as he was falling down, Police Officer Tsiorakis kicked him twice in the chest and abdomen.",

However, the Court considers that a verbal dispute between the applicant and the police officers could not, in any case, justify the infliction of serious injuries on him, seeing that, as judgment no. 683/2005 stated, he had never threatened their physical integrity. In this connection, the Court considers that, when maintaining and enforcing the law, it is the duty of police officers to act with professionalism and due respect to the dignity of the person in their charge. Arrests should always be conducted in a cautious and consistent way and the use of force may be justified only in the event of forcible resistance to submit to the officers\u2019 orders. Nonetheless, even in this case, the use of force must always respect the principles of adequacy and proportionality (see also in this connection, the Code of Greek Police Ethics, cited in paragraph 27 above).",

It is also apparent from the relevant report that the agent based his conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. He thus observed, initially, that the violent behaviour of the police officers transpired from the testimonies of the persons who had caused the illegal acts. However, he did not consider these testimonies to be credible for two reasons: firstly, because they undoubtedly reflected personal opinions and assessments that would be of assistance to the accused during the trial; and secondly, because they could be regarded as constituting defence tactics by the applicant\u2019s acquaintances, who were already facing grave criminal charges and whose depositions aimed to damage the credibility of the police officers (see Zelilof, cited above, \u00a7 60).",

The latter insisted in their testimonies that there had been no violence in the police station and that all the injuries sustained by the civilians had been caused before their transfer to the police station.\u201d In the Court\u2019s view, the administrative inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies, since those given by the civilians involved in the events were recognised as subjective but not those given by the police officers. However, the credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned as the administrative proceedings had also sought to establish whether they were liable on disciplinary grounds (see Zelilof, loc. cit., and Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006).",

Secondly, the Court points out that on 15 September 2005 the Indictment Division of the Salonika Criminal Court committed Officer Apostolidis for trial on charges, among others, of causing severe bodily injuries to the applicant only in respect of the time during which he was detained in the police station. However, the Indictment Division accepted in the same decision that the applicant had plausibly been injured during and after his arrest. It also accepted that Officer Apostolidis had testified before the Criminal Court that the applicant had been hit in the course of his arrest. Under these circumstances, the Court considers that the committal for trial of the defendant police officer solely for the events that had taken place after the applicant had been taken to the police station deprived the Salonika Court of Appeal of the possibility of exploring the issue of criminal responsibility for the bodily injuries allegedly inflicted at the time of the applicant\u2019s arrest. The Indictment Division\u2019s standpoint is all the more difficult to comprehend as it did not elaborate on the particular grounds on which the defendant\u2019s criminal liability was excluded in respect of the time frame prior to the applicant\u2019s detention in the police station, taking into account the fact that the same authority had explicitly accepted in the body of the same decision that the latter had been injured during his arrest.",

In particular, a certain number of witnesses, among them police officers, stated, directly or implicitly, that the applicant had already been injured by the time he had been brought to the police station. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal acquitted Officer Apostolidis on the charge of grievous bodily harm by identifying some discrepancies in the applicant\u2019s testimonies as to the person responsible for his injuries and the place where he had been beaten. It was specifically concluded that the applicant had stated before the court that his injuries had been caused by Officer Apostolidis, who had ill-treated him inside the police station, whereas the eyewitness Mr Mousailidis and Officers Kaloudis and Nounis had stated that he had already been injured by the time he had been brought to the police station. Apart from the fact that the applicant in reality argued before the Salonika Court of Appeal that his injuries were the result of ill-treatment inflicted before and after his transfer to the police station, the fact remains that the Court of Appeal based its reasoning on testimonies establishing that he had indeed been injured during his arrest. In the Court\u2019s view, the use of evidence capable of demonstrating the criminal responsibility of the defendant police officer at an early stage of the events as a means of sparing him from charges with regard to his subsequent conduct amounts to a logical contradiction that falls foul of the procedural obligation on the domestic authorities to make a serious attempt to find out what happened in the course of the impugned events taken as a whole.",
