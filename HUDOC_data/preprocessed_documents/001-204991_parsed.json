They noted that they had not been informed of any decision to release the property or of any announcement in the Government Gazette, and that as at the date of submissions (6 November 2019) the land was still sealed off and the boundary walls erected by the authorities had not been dismantled, thus the applicants still did not have access to it.

The Court notes that the Constitutional Court awarded the applicants EUR 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (from which they had to pay part judicial costs which in the present case were reasonably justified). Moreover, the Constitutional Court ordered the release of the property, namely Land A and the most part of Land B (excluding the properties measuring 509\u00a0sq.m. and 139 sq.m.) as requested by the applicants. In the present circumstances and in the light of the documents in the Court\u2019s possession, the Court shares the interpretation of the constitutional jurisdictions that the applicants\u2019 request to release the property was their main request and only alternatively would compensation be required for the use of such land. Indeed, no conditions had been put in relation to this latter alternative. It follows that on the basis of their request, the Constitutional Court awarded adequate redress for the upheld violation and the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment offered sufficient relief to the applicants.",

Lastly, in so far as the applicants argue that access is still sealed off as the boundary walls are still in place, the Court observes that, as noted by the applicants, these are only boundary walls and no other installations remain. Moreover, from the aerial photographs submitted by the applicants the boundary walls are in place in only limited parts of the property subject to the return order. Lastly, the applicants being the owners in law, there seems to be no obstacle in them taking any measures necessary to access the land including availing themselves of any ordinary remedies in this respect.",

Indeed, the applicable principles are similar for both types of interferences: in addition to being lawful, a deprivation of possessions or an interference such as the control of use of property must also satisfy the requirement of proportionality (see, with respect to a deprivation of possessions, Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081 and 93; Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v.

In any event, the Government noted that the Constitutional Court had held that such a public interest did exist.

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount proportionate to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, whilst a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 only in exceptional circumstances. However, Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095; Kozac\u0131o\u011flu cited above, \u00a7\u00a064; and Visti\u0146\u0161 and Perepjolkins, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110).

Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96 \u00a7 32, ECHR 2000-XI, and Guiso-Gallisay v. Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 58858/00, \u00a7 90, 22 December 2009). The Contracting States that are parties to a case are in principle free to choose the means whereby they will comply with a judgment in which the Court has found a breach. This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflects the freedom of choice attached to the primary obligation of the Contracting States under the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed (Article 1). If the nature of the violation allows for restitutio in integrum it is the duty of the State held liable to effect it, the Court having neither the power nor the practical possibility of doing so itself. If, however, national law does not allow  or allows only partial  reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article\u00a041 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (ibid.).",

Thus, the sum to be awarded to the applicants should be calculated on the basis of the value of the land at the time of the taking, and be converted to the current value to offset the effects of inflation, plus simple statutory interest applied to the capital progressively adjusted (see, for example, Curmi v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 2243/10, \u00a7 16, 9 July 2013). Since in the present case the applicants have not yet received any payment at the national level, no such deduction is necessary.",

The Court notes that, on the one hand, despite the odd terminology used by the applicants\u2019 architect, the plans attached to his evaluation appear to show that (unlike Land\u00a0A) the land measuring 139 sq.m. is in an Outside Development Zone (ODZ). On the other hand, the valuation of the Government\u2019s architect refers to the confines of the development zone without specifying whether the land was within it or not. Be that as it may, bearing in mind the undisputed fact that even before 2012 a building was and remains erected on such land, which hosts the sub-station, and bearing in mind the definition of agricultural land (see Relevant domestic law above), the Court cannot but consider that the land was in fact a building site in 2012 and compensation should be calculated accordingly for the purposes of the expropriation. However, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of \u201cpublic interest\u201d may call for reimbursement of less than the full market value (ibid. \u00a7 15).",
