In the court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings could be found to be unreasonable if undue delays caused by inactivity or improper actions on the part of the court had occurred. The court did not establish any such circumstances in the case at issue and pointed to its extreme complexity, with the large number of plots and individuals involved, as the main cause of the length of the proceedings.

Thirdly, the detention was aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the proceedings and was justified by the risk of the applicant\u2019s obstructing the proceedings and tampering with the evidence. This risk stemmed from the fact that the proceedings concerned an organised criminal gang and that the applicant was a persistent offender. On the date of the preventive measure the investigation had still been in progress and its personal scope could still have been extended, as indeed it had been at a later stage. There existed a serious threat that the accused might attempt to influence some of the other defendants and the witnesses.

At the same time the Government submitted that in the period from 2000 to 2003 the number of persons sentenced for involvement in organised criminal activities had remained relatively unchanged in Poland, representing on average only 0.016% of all those sentenced at that time. Since 2004, there had been a significant increase in the number of sentences relating to organised criminal activities. In the period up to 2000 the total number of those sentenced for organised criminal activities had been significantly smaller. For example, in 1998 and 1999 there had been only seven and eighteen persons respectively sentenced for such crimes. According to the Government\u2019s submissions, there were several procedural problems that tended to arise in cases relating to organised criminal activities. Such cases were complex by their nature, as typically they involved the investigation of an activity carried out by a group, and that in turn involved the examination of offences committed by several persons. Usually all the trial and pre-trial material was voluminous and the legal and factual assessment required considerable time and effort. In many such cases evidence had to be taken from anonymous witnesses. The trial court had to guarantee both the anonymity of such witnesses and the rights of the accused. There were often problems with the presence at the hearings of the accused or their legal representatives, including defence counsel and witnesses, as they were often interested in slowing down the process and as a consequence the trial court could not carry out the appropriate measures as planned. There were also many logistical problems as the witnesses and accused, mostly belonging to the same or competing groups of organised criminals in detention, required isolation both within the relevant detention facility and while being transported. Their relatively large number, coupled with the need to provide appropriate security, dictated that they had to be placed in different detention centres. Even persons detained in the same facility had to be transported and brought to the courtroom separately, requiring additional manpower and equipment. In addition, not all courts had at their disposal appropriate facilities both to ensure the isolation of those being brought to court and to allow the police to guarantee the security of all the parties involved. This was particularly true of many district courts.",

It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably have considered that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v.

The subsequent decisions to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial underlined the fact that these fears were well-founded, since one of the accused significantly changed his statements during the hearings (see paragraph 19\u00a0above).

The courts also took proper measures to ensure the speedy progress of the proceedings (see paragraphs 18, 21, 32 and 33 above). The Court therefore concludes that the national authorities displayed special diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. The length of the investigation and of the trial was justified by the exceptional complexity of the case. It should not be overlooked that, while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the judges to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide both the defence and the prosecution with all necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed.",
