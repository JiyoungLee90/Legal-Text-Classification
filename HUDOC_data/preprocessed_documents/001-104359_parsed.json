At the time, the building consisted of a large eighteenth century town house including a few rooms on the ground floor which were rented out as shops. Between 1945 and 1950 the War Damage Commission had paid out a sum corresponding to EUR 1,307, for the premises excluding the shops in respect of which no amount had been paid as a consequence of undefined claims. According to the applicant the sums awarded covered expenses for required temporary works to secure the premises, as had originally been claimed, and not the entire works to repair the whole of the property.

It considered that the period to be taken into account started running on 25 February 1958, the date when the applicant's right to compensation arose, and had not yet ended forty years later. It noted that it had taken the Government eighteen years to issue a \u201cnotice to treat\u201d without which compensation proceedings could not be initiated. This, together with the lack of initiative of the Commissioner of Lands to pursue those proceedings, was enough to allow it to conclude that the applicant had suffered a serious prejudice, incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention, over the forty years during which she had been left without compensation.

It held that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention, in that a proper balance had not been preserved between the private interest and the public need. While it was true that the commercial purposes of the taking appeared to have superseded the original purpose, it was in the light of the compensation offered to the applicant (EUR 490 yearly rent for a property valued at approximately EUR 1,863,500) and the fact that she had been deprived of her property for nearly fifty years, that she had been made to bear a disproportionate burden. The fact that the property had been refurbished by the State had little bearing on this conclusion, although it could be relevant in determining the compensation terms. It declared the Governor's declaration of 1958 null and void and ordered the Government to release the property. The , however, found that there had not been a violation of Article 6 in respect of the length of the proceedings. It was true that the proceedings had been lengthy, the \u201cnotice to treat\u201d having been issued only eighteen years after the taking of the property and the proceedings before the LAB having not yet been concluded. However, the court noted that the time to be considered started running after the Convention took effect in respect of Malta, namely on 30 April 1987 (when  introduced the right of individual petition) and the applicant had failed to submit evidence of what had caused the delay after 1987. As to the Article 14 complaint, the court held that it had been misconceived, since the first-instance court had not examined it. As to the adequacy of compensation, it confirmed that the release of the property was an adequate remedy for the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention, and the reservation of the issue of compensation by the first court was related to the Article 6 complaint, which had not been upheld on appeal. However, it reserved any rights the applicant might wish to assert in respect of compensation for the \u201cpossession and use\u201d of the premises during the relevant period.",

She also claimed that the inadequate compensation offered by the Government was arbitrary and not in accordance with the law. Compensation for the taking of a property under public tenure had to be calculated on the basis of section 27 (13) of the Ordinance and not section 22 (11) (c), which applied where property taken under \u201cpublic tenure\u201d was converted by absolute purchase (see the Relevant Domestic Law below). Although it could be supposed that the Government's offer amounted to more than what was applicable by law, it did not reflect the real current market value, since the calculations had been based on rental values applicable in 1939. Even assuming that the offer comprised compensation for Palazzo Bonici alone and not the adjacent properties, it still represented a fifth of its real value on the market; therefore, it did not constitute adequate compensation and the applicant was being made to bear an excessive burden. She further claimed that the decision to take her property under public tenure had been arbitrary and discriminatory. At the time only four other properties had been taken under this title, as opposed to outright purchase. All the properties had already been in the possession of the Government under a different title and were all related to slum clearance and housing projects, unlike the applicant's. Finally, she complained that the taking was in breach of Article 6, in that she was not given a fair hearing within a reasonable time, as she had no real and effective possibility of having the value of her property determined by a court. Notwithstanding the  judgment in her favour, in these circumstances the applicant remained without an effective remedy.",

The present complaint is directed against the Maltese Government. Thus, the Court can only take into consideration the period which has elapsed since the Convention entered into force in respect of Malta (1967), although it will have regard to the stage reached in the proceedings by that date (see, for example, Humen v. Poland [GC], no. 26614/95, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59, 15\u00a0October 1999). Moreover, since the applicant has continued the proceedings as heir, she can complain of the entire length of the proceedings (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a064886/01, \u00a7 113, ECHR\u00a02006-; and Bezzina Wettinger, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067).",

However, the latter decision did not release the domestic authorities from their obligation to examine the case within a reasonable time. The LAB remained responsible for the conduct of the proceedings before it and ought therefore to have weighed the advantages of the continued adjournments pending the outcome of other cases against the requirement of promptness (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0160ilih v.

Moreover, the Court notes that, apart from the adjournments pending the outcome of other cases, the LAB adjourned the case repeatedly, and on at least sixteen occasions the case was adjourned either because members of the LAB were unable or failed to attend, or because the Board was not appointed, or because no chambers were available. Meanwhile the applicant's legal counsel failed to appear three times and requested four adjournments (see Annex A).",
