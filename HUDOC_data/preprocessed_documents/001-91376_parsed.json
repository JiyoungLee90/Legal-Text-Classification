One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brum\u0103rescu v.

This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. , no.\u00a052854/99, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2003IX). The Court therefore has to assess whether, in a given case, the power to launch and conduct an extraordinary review was exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Nikitin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a050178/99, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR 2004VIII, and Savinskiy v. , no.\u00a06965/02, \u00a7\u00a023, 28 February 2006).",
