Moreover, the ineffective nature of the constitutional complaint was shown by the fact that, in order for the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision to bear weight, the criminal case must be reopened and a trial held by an ordinary court, which further extended the length of the proceedings and denied the applicant direct and easy access to a domestic remedy.",
