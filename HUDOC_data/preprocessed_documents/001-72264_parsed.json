Austria, judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A, p.\u00a040 \u00a7 14). As the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by Article 5 of the Convention is at stake, the authorities must take as much care in fixing appropriate bail as in deciding whether or not continued detention is indispensable (Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland, no. 25196/94, 15 November 2001, \u00a7\u00a066). Consequently, where the accused person remains in detention despite a decision ordering his release on bail, the question whether or not its amount is justified is an issue of lawfulness of the continuing detention and must be subject to judicial control, in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Cassation recognised that in its interpretative decision of June 2002 (see paragraph 57 above). However, the Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Court in the applicant\u2019s case refused to deal with his appeal related to the amount of the bail.",

In the absence of a convincing explanation by the respondent Government, it is difficult to accept that remedying such a procedural deficiency justified setting at naught the entire trial that took place in 1995 and 1996 and recommencing the examination of the case from the investigation stage. The Government have not provided such an explanation. The Court has already noted in previous cases against Bulgaria that inordinate delays in criminal proceedings were brought about by the unjustified remittal of cases to the investigation stage of the proceedings (see Kitov v. , no. 37104/97, \u00a7 73, 3 April 2003).",
