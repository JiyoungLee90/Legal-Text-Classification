The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the CPT noted in the report on its visit to the  in 2001 that it was normal practice for the Russian authorities to interrupt treatment of detainees for tuberculosis for the duration of their transfer between penitentiary establishments (see paragraph 37 above). The Court also notes that the Government did not submit in their observations that this practice had not been followed in the applicant\u2019s case and that the applicant had continued to receive treatment for tuberculosis. Accordingly, the Court accepts the applicant\u2019s argument that he was deprived of any medical assistance for the twenty-four days he spent being transported from  to medical correctional colony no.\u00a0LIU-10 in the  Region. Even though, as the Government argued, the conditions of his transport were satisfactory, the fact that the applicant was detained in a railway carriage which was not overcrowded and was provided with food and water is of little significance in such circumstances.",

They asserted that the treatment in question had been in compliance with applicable statutory standards. According to the excerpts from the medical file, it appears that during the three months the applicant spent at the correctional colony he saw the doctor twice. The doctor confined himself to a visual check-up of the applicant and prescribed out-patient treatment for him. The medical records furnish no explanation as to why the earlier recommendations to proceed with in-patient treatment were disregarded. The records also remain silent as to whether the X-ray examination scheduled to be conducted in August 2002 was actually carried out. Nor do the medical records indicate that any tests were administered to follow up on the applicant\u2019s condition and effectiveness of the treatment.",

Even though, as the Government pointed out, the conditions of the applicant\u2019s transport were satisfactory, in the Court\u2019s opinion the lack of medical assistance and supervision for such an extended period of time caused the applicant, who was suffering from tuberculosis, distress and suffering and posed a certain risk to his health.
