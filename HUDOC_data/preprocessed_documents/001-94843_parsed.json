At the time the Mass-Media Act was enacted in 1991, Russian constitutional and administrative law classified municipal employees as State officials. Even though the 1993 Constitution drew a distinction between State bodies and bodies of local self-government, there was no evidence that the status of municipal employees had undergone any changes or that the Mass-Media Act needed to be amended in the light of the new legal status of municipal employees. In any event, the open letter had been signed not just by municipal employees, but also by public officials of the tax inspectorate, Federal Security Service and the police. Furthermore, municipal bodies and commercial companies were covered by the notion of \u201corganisation\u201d in paragraph 3 of section 57.

The disputed statement had been part of an open letter which had not been an attack against the courts' management department or its officials but rather an appeal for a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the activities of companies that cut down timber. Referring to the Court's case-law, the applicants insisted that the press should be able to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Colombani and Others v.\u00a0France, no. 51279/99, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2002V). In the context of the letter as a whole, the expression \u201cirregularities have clearly been on the rise\u201d should be regarded as a value judgment, not as an asserted fact. The domestic courts had failed to weigh the rights and interests of the courts' management department and of its head Mr Shulga in relation to the public interest in receiving information of public concern. Moreover, the protection afforded by Article 10 would be undermined if public officials responsible for the operation of a State body were allowed to substitute themselves for that body, as had happened with Mr Shulga's filing of a defamation claim in his personal capacity. Finally, the applicants pointed out that the amounts awarded against them had been so excessive compared to their income \u2013 approximately one third of their annual income \u2013 that the proceedings had definitely had the aim of preventing future critical coverage.",

If public authorities were to be included within the meaning of \u201cothers\u201d whose reputation or rights Article 10 \u00a7 2 was designed to protect, it would subject journalists to a constant risk of harassment through lawsuits and frustrate the media's ability to act as a watchdog of public administration. Mindful of that danger, courts of many jurisdictions barred public authorities from suing in defamation because of the public interest that such authorities must be open to uninhibited public criticism (United Kingdom: Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd [1993] AC 534; India: Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu (1994) 6 SCC 632; United States: City of Chicago v. Tribune Co., 307 Ill. 595 (1923); South Africa: Die Spoorbond v.

The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Grinberg v.

It was stated that the inclusion of the regional police department and the courts' management department in the number of timber purchasers had resulted in an increase in irregularities in the sale of timber. As the Court has held on many occasions, reporting on matters relating to management of public resources lies at the core of the media's responsibility and the right of the public to receive information (see Busuioc v. Moldova, no. 61513/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063-64 and 84, 21 December 2004; and Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95, ECHR 2004XI). However, there is no evidence in the domestic judgments that the courts performed a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiffs' reputation and the right of the members of the press to impart information on issues of general interest. They confined their analysis to the discussion of the damage to the plaintiffs' reputation without giving any consideration to the Convention standard which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest (see Godlevskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a014888/03, \u00a7 41, 23 October 2008, and Krasulya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038).

That exemption clause is perfectly consonant with the Court's own approach to the effect that the press should normally be entitled, when contributing to public debate on matters of legitimate concern, to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Colombani and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065). The list of protected sources of information in section 57 of the Mass-Media Act is broad and it does not appear plausible that bodies of local self-government and their officials should be excluded from the scope of the fair-reporting exception. Thus, the distinction between State bodies and municipal bodies, drawn by the domestic courts in order to overrule the applicants' reliance on that exception, was rather formalistic and artificial. In any event, the letter had been signed, among others, by the local police chief and an official of the tax inspectorate, both of whom obviously fall within the ranks of officials explicitly listed in section 57.",

Firstly, under Russian law, a \u201cpublic association\u201d is a generic term covering all types of non-governmental associations, including \u201cautonomous non-commercial organisations\u201d. Secondly, as the applicants correctly pointed out, it was of little relevance on whose premises the press-conference had been organised, the important fact being that the document had originated from public officials. The Court notes that it was not alleged that the applicants had distorted or otherwise modified the text of the original open letter. Accordingly, it finds that, in reprinting an official non-confidential document, the applicants acted in good faith and were mindful of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d of the members of the press referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.",

The Court reiterates that in the context of the balancing exercise\u00a0under Article 10, in particular where the reporting\u00a0by a journalist of statements made by third parties is concerned, the relevant test is\u00a0not whether the journalist can prove the veracity of the statements but whether a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of the allegation can be established (see Dyundin, cited above, \u00a7 35, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78). The fact that the regional police and the regional courts' management department had obtained unusually high timber purchasing quotas was not disputed in the domestic proceedings. Likewise, the fact was not contested that wholesale companies purchasing timber without appropriate licences had been allowed to operate without hindrance in the region. The Court stresses that where the impugned statement was made in the course of a lively debate at local level, elected officials and journalists should enjoy a wide freedom to criticise the actions of a local authority, even where the statement may lack a clear basis in fact (see Lombardo and Others v. Malta, no.\u00a07333/06, \u00a7 60, 24 April 2007). In sum, the Court finds that the contested statement, albeit expressed provocatively, did not overstep the bounds of journalistic freedom, bearing in mind that State bodies and civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals.",

The Court leaves this question open, saying that \u201cit is not its task to examine the domestic legislation in the abstract but rather to consider the manner in which that legislation was applied to, or affected, the applicant in a particular case\u201d, and deciding that \u201cthis issue will also be examined in the analysis of the proportionality of the interference\u201d (paragraph 39 in fine).",

Indeed, the structure of Article 10 suggests a triangular relationship involving the State - author of an interference -, the applicant - victim of an interference - and \u201cothers\u201d, whose reputation and rights may or may not be protected. The only \u201cpublic body\u201d covered by one of the exceptions laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 10 is the \u201cjudiciary\u201d, whose authority and impartiality may be protected through an interference, provided that such interference is necessary in a democratic society and is proportionate to the aim pursued.",
