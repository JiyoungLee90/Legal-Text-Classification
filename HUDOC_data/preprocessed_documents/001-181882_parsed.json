The administration of the prison had issued order no.\u00a032/2008 concerning prisoners having access to the toilet facilities whenever necessary. The order had also directed prison staff to check and ensure that the call panel in the warden\u2019s room was active at all times, especially during the evening, so that prisoners could be assisted and emergencies prevented. A violation of the order constituted a disciplinary offence. According to a letter by the prison director dated 27\u00a0February 2014, records were not kept of when cells were opened for toilet visits during the night, that is between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. However, a detainee could leave his cell for up to three toilet visits during that period.",

The Supreme Court thus confirmed the existence of an obligation to award general damages for breaches of the fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, even when the violation did not constitute a tort in civil law. It pointed out that the provisions of Article 13 of the Convention formed part of the domestic law and safeguarded the right to an effective remedy for a violation of rights guaranteed by the Convention.",

However, apart from Block 5A, serious overcrowding was evident throughout the prison. It was particularly evident in Blocks 1 and 2, where all the cells designed for single occupancy (some 6m\u00b2) were accommodating two persons. Cells of this size are hardly suitable for accommodating one person, never mind two. Further, in Block 1, the two association/television rooms had been converted into multi-occupancy dormitories with prisoners sleeping on bunk-beds. As a result, Block 1B which had an official capacity for 35 persons was accommodating 90 prisoners. The communal sanitary facilities were in an acceptable state of repair although greater efforts should be made to repair promptly the non-functioning urinals and toilets. Many complaints were also received of difficulties in accessing the toilet at night, including in Block 2 where an electronic recording system was in place which could note the time taken for a cell to be unlocked following a request to access the toilet. ...",

As an example of a successful civil claim by prisoners concerning conditions of detention on the basis of the judgment in Takis Yiallouros, and one in which damages had been awarded, the Government relied on the Nicosia District Court\u2019s judgment in Evripidis Evripidou v. the Attorney General and Petros Patsalidis v. the Attorney General (see paragraph 24 above).

If an applicant has been held in conditions in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is of the greatest value.

Russia, no.\u00a015217/07, \u00a7\u00a083, 12 March 2009). For a remedy to be considered effective it should be capable of providing redress for the complainant. Despite the powers granted to the Ombudsman under Law no. 2(III)/2009 (see paragraphs 21-22 above), that official can only make recommendations to the authorities and lacks the power to issue a legally binding decision that would be capable of bringing about an improvement in a complainant\u2019s situation or serve as a basis for obtaining compensation. While the Ombudsman\u2019s activities may usefully contribute to a general improvement in conditions of detention, he or she remains unable, in view of the specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 106).

Furthermore, although the Government mentioned the power of the domestic courts to grant injunctions in their civil jurisdiction and indicated that the applicant could have applied for an interim order in the context of civil proceedings, they did not provide any further explanation; their submission in that respect therefore remained vague.

For example, when the applicant was held in the dormitory his personal space could have been as low as 1.8 sq. m. This is clearly below the acceptable minimum standard. Taking into account the relevant principles enunciated in its case-law (see paragraph 55 above), the Court finds that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises in the case at issue. Turning to whether there are factors capable of rebutting that presumption, the Court notes that although the authorities did not keep records in relation to the occupancy of cells and the dormitory, they submitted that the applicant would have been held in those conditions for about one month and a half, a period which cannot be considered as a short, occasional and minor reduction in the required personal space (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0151153). The presumption of a violation of Article 3 therefore applies in this respect.",

Cases concerning allegations of inadequate conditions of detention do not lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle that he who alleges something must prove that allegation because in such instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. Accordingly, the Court is mindful of the fact that applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection.

With regard to the applicant\u2019s submission that there was no access to the toilets after the cells were locked, it should be noted that the findings of the CPT in its 2012 report concerned its visit in May 2008, more than two years before the applicant was detained. The Government submitted that the practice of switching off the bells at night, which had resulted in a lack of access to toilets during those hours, had been discontinued in accordance with an order issued in 2008. That information was also provided to the CPT in the Government\u2019s response to the report. The CPT observed in general in its 2014 report on its visit in 2013 that it had received complaints of difficulties in accessing the toilets at night. It did not, however, go further, nor did it repeat its findings in its previous report that there was no access to the toilets by the vast majority of inmates and that they were still forced to defecate and urinate in makeshift receptacles in their cells. Therefore it cannot be concluded that the situation was the same in 2013 as in 2008 and that this problem persisted throughout these years with no improvement. Furthermore, in view of the lack of specific information and evidence from the applicant, that observation does not provide a sufficient basis for drawing a factual inference that during his detention the applicant had no access to the toilet in Block 2A after the cells were locked. Similarly, the Ombudsman\u2019s comments on the matter in her report of September 2011 concern a complaint filed with her office and are very general, with no reference to dates.",

In such a situation, it is irrelevant, if, for example, a detainee was transferred between cells or wings within the same remand prison (ibid, \u00a7\u00a077). Furthermore, short periods of absence from a facility for interviews or other procedural acts would not break the chain of continuity (ibid. \u00a7\u00a078).

The two CPT reports are based on visits which were made, respectively, more than 2 years before the applicant\u2019s detention and about eighteen months after his release. Hence, the \u201cbefore and after\u201d argument should not be applied in the present case: this argument could only be valid or give rise to strong presumption if the same thing happened immediately or at least within a reasonable time before, as well as immediately or within a reasonable time after, an event and not when a significant period of time has elapsed since the relevant event. Furthermore, the Ombudsman merely reiterated what was stated in the first CPT report, and her report was published before the applicant was transferred to the renovated cell. In any event, the applicant\u2019s case should be judged in the light of the facts of his case and not on the basis of the assumptions contained in the CPT\u2019s reports, which are not even chronologically relevant to the applicant\u2019s situation. In addition, as is rightly emphasised in paragraph 51 of the judgment, the CPT has a preventive role, whereas the Court has to adjudicate on the basis of the particular facts before it. It is important to underline that the applicant did not make any submissions in reply to the Government. Instead, he decided to send a copy of the CPT\u2019s 2014 report to the Court on the assumption that the report would substantiate his case (see paragraph 53 of the judgment). However, this report (see paragraph 29 of the judgment) supports the Government\u2019s allegation that Block 2A, which was earmarked for convicted prisoners, had been completely renovated. In this connection, it is important to note that the safeguarding and effective protection of a right under the Convention, in the present case of the applicant\u2019s right under Article 3, does not depend only on the practical and effective interpretation and application of the relevant Convention provision by the Court, but also on the proper handling of the case by an applicant. In other words, the Convention mechanism for the effective protection of a right in line with the principle of effectiveness, which is inherent in the Convention, cannot be triggered unless a case is properly handled by the applicant. In the present case, however, we are unable to conclude that the applicant presented and proved his case sufficiently.",

Further, the lack of details given by the applicant on the subject-matter does not provide a sufficient basis to lead to a finding of a violation of Article 3, in view of the fact that there were no substantiated problems in his detention once he had been moved from an overcrowded cell.",

With regard to the applicant\u2019s submission that there was no access to the toilets after the cells were locked, it should be observed that the CPT\u2019s findings in its 2012 report concerned its visit in May 2008 (see paragraph 25 of the judgment), thus dating back to more than two years before the applicant was detained.

That information was also included in the Government\u2019s response to the CPT\u2019s report (ibid.). The Court notes that the CPT generally observed in its 2014 report, which refers to its 2013 visit, that it had received complaints of difficulties in accessing the toilets at night (see paragraph 22 above). It did not, however, go further, nor did it repeat its findings in its previous report that there was no access to the toilets by the vast majority of inmates and that they were still forced to defecate and urinate in makeshift receptacles in their cells. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the situation in 2013 was the same as in 2008 and that this problem persisted throughout these years with no improvement. Furthermore, in view of the lack of a sufficient explanation and evidence from the applicant, that observation does not provide a sufficient basis for drawing a factual inference that during his detention the applicant had no access to the toilet in Block 2A after the cells were locked. Similarly, the Ombudsman\u2019s comments on the matter in her report of September 2011 concern a complaint filed with her office and are therefore not directly relevant to the case at hand.
