Moreover, at the beginning of June 2007 her mother had received a threatening phone call from someone who had wanted to contact the applicant, presumably to forcibly remarry her with another man.

Mandaeans, being the smallest and most vulnerable minority in Iraq, were subjected to extortion, kidnappings and murder. Mandaean women and children had been forced to convert to Islam, often after having been assaulted and raped. The Mandaeans were not a large enough community to be able to protect and support each other and there was no particular region where they could settle safely. This was enough to show that she was in need of protection. The applicant asserted that the threat against her had to be seen against this background. Her whole existence had been marked by the threatening atmosphere and demands directed at non-Muslim women and in particular the Mandaeans. Her situation had been further aggravated by the fact that she is a single woman without a social network in Iraq. Her mother had had the intention of leaving the country as well, but the applicant had no information on her whereabouts. Furthermore, in Sweden the applicant had met a Muslim man from  together with whom she now lived. This situation would never be accepted in Iraq.

The court acknowledged the difficult situation for Mandaeans in Iraq and stated that, consequently, a lower threshold was applied in assessing the individual risks than in Iraqi cases in general. The general situation for Mandaeans did not suffice of itself to be granted protection, however; an assessment of the applicant\u2019s individual circumstances was necessary. In the absence of written evidence, the court went on to examine the statements made by the applicant. It considered that the threat received concerning forced marriage was primarily related to the general security situation in Iraq at the time. In the two years since the applicant had left the country, the security situation had improved. While the Mandaeans remained disadvantaged, there was no sign that she was still being searched for in Iraq. Nor was there anything to indicate that her mother\u2019s possible exile had been caused by continued threats. The court further found that the negative reaction of the applicant\u2019s family to her new relationship did not imply a need of protection. In that connection, it further noted that the asylum appeal lodged by her brother, who had not turned his back on her, had been rejected on the same day. Thus, she could return to Iraq with him and thereby have a social network in the country.",

Following her divorce in 1999, she went to live with her parents and her brother. Her father, under whose protection she was living, died in 2005. Her grandmother, with whom she had briefly lived after the threatening telephone call, died in 2008. To her knowledge, she has no relatives left in Iraq, cousins or others. Several relatives are living abroad, in Sweden, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Canada. Her sister is living in Denmark. After the applicant and her brother had left Iraq, their mother went to live with a Christian family in Baghdad, from whom she rented a room. In the beginning of 2010, the applicant and her brother received information about their mother\u2019s disappearance. The family with whom the mother had lived called the applicant\u2019s uncle in Sweden and said that they did not think that she had left voluntarily. A police report, sent to the uncle only in 2012, states that the report was filed on 7 June 2011 by the mother\u2019s landlord, who had told the police that the mother had been missing since 5 December 2010. The applicant does not know why the landlord did not file a report earlier or why he did not state that her mother had been missing for several months before December 2010. The applicant is still unaware of what has happened to her mother following her disappearance. However, given the time that has passed without any contact with her, she assumes that she is dead. The applicant is still in a relationship with the man she met in Sweden, although he is now living in Syria. The people who disowned her because of that relationship were her relatives in Sweden, with the exception of her brother. The brother married a relative, who is a Swedish citizen, on 27 May 2012. He left Sweden and applied at the Embassy in Tehran for a Swedish residence permit based on his marriage. By a decision of 5 November 2013 the Migration Board granted him a residence permit until 5 November 2015.",

Its adherents cannot marry outside the faith and they do not accept converts. Before 2003, there were an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Mandaeans living in Iraq many of whom were well educated and worked as doctors, engineers, dentists and jewelers. After the fall of the former regime, Sunni and Shi\u2019ite armed groups, as well as criminals, have singled out Sabaean-Mandaeans on the basis of their religion, profession and (perceived) wealth. Some Sabaean-Mandaeans elders, who traditionally wear long beards, have reportedly been attacked by Shi\u2019ite militants who have mistaken them for strictly observant Sunni Arabs or Wahhabists. Sabaean-Mandaeans are particularly vulnerable to attacks for several reasons. Unlike other groups in Iraq, the pacifist Mandaeans did not form militias to defend themselves. Further, the already small community lives mainly in scattered groups. Their disputed status as \u201cpeople of the book\u201d, which under the Qur\u2019an would provide them with a level of protection, failed to dissuade extremist groups from targeting them. As a result of general violence and targeted attacks, large numbers of Mandaeans fled Iraq, mainly to Syria and Jordan. Currently, an estimated 3,500 to 7,000 Mandaeans remain in Iraq. Most of them live in Baghdad and southern Iraq, including in Amara, Basrah and Nassiriyah. According to a spokesman for the Mandaean community, there are currently about 500 Mandaean families in southern Iraq, mostly in the Governorate of Basrah.",

For this reason, a lower standard of proof than generally applied must be used in evaluating the risks facing her individually in the future. While the Government had pointed out that the threat in question had been uttered only once and argued that nothing indicated that it had been connected to her being a Mandaean, the applicant feared that she had indeed been targeted because of her religious beliefs and asserted that that fear was objectively supported by unanimous reports that Mandaean were being subjected to kidnappings, rape, forced conversion and forced marriages during the time when she had received the threat. She argued that religiously motivated violence aimed at women, in particular those belonging to minority groups, was still ongoing in Iraq and claimed that the security situation in Iraq had not improved significantly in a lasting manner. Furthermore, the risks facing her personally were exacerbated by her lack of support and protection, not only because she had no male network or any relatives in Iraq, but also because the Mandaean community as a whole would consider that she had converted through her relationship with a non-Mandaean man.",

Thereafter, the situation had improved significantly and sectarian violence had diminshed markedly. According to information from the British Home Office from March 2011, the main source of violence against Mandaeans was criminal gangs who assumed that the Mandaeans were wealthy because of their traditional occupation as jewellers. The improved security situation had also contributed to a safer environment for Iraqi women. However, single women could not expect help or protection from the authorities, at least not from family-related or gender-based violence, as they were still influenced by the patriarchal society.

The Government further submitted, inter alia, the following. The threat suggesting a forced marriage had been received in June 2007, at a time of widespread criminality and violence in Iraq, and the security situation had improved since then. Moreover, only one threat had been received, from an unknown private individual, and there was nothing to suggest that this person would have an interest in contacting the applicant again more than six years later. Nor was there any indication that the threat had anything to do with the applicant being a Mandaean. Furthermore, the applicant originated from Baghdad, where most Mandaeans still residing in Iraq lived, and should therefore be able to return to a familiar place and reintegrate into the community without too much effort. In regard to the applicant being a woman, the Government noted that she had not received any threats on this ground or for being a divorcee. While women were a vulnerable group unless they had support from a male relative, they further asserted that male protection in Iraq could be given by someone not closely related to the woman. Also, considering the substantial improvements in the functioning of the Iraqi police and other authorities since 2008, the applicant should be able to turn to the authorities for protection.",

The Government further claimed that, when the applicant had stated that her family had disowned her as a consequence of her new relationship, she had referred to family in Iraq, and asserted that such a statement about her Swedish relatives would have lacked relevance for the assessment of her risk of ill-treatment upon return to Iraq.

In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials.

The Mandaean community is much smaller than the Christian group and, consequently, the recorded attacks and the number of reports concerning Mandaeans are naturally less frequent. It appears, however, that the Mandaeans are in much the same situation as the Christians in the southern and central parts of Iraq, being attacked because of their faith, their profession and their perceived wealth (see, for instance, the UNHCR Guidelines, at p. 29; \u00a7 33 above). Obviously, the low number of remaining Mandaeans in the country and the fact that the community is not uniformly organised \u2013 the members living mainly in scattered groups \u2013 further contribute to their vulnerability.",

Nevertheless, in the Court\u2019s view, the general risks attached to the status of being a single woman in Iraq cannot be considered of themselves to reach the threshold of ill-treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention (cf. M.Y.H. and Others v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 71). However, in addition to being a single woman, the applicant is also a member of a small religious minority.

While the country information documents available to the Court do not mention any specific entry procedures for Mandaeans, the fact that many members of that community have taken refuge in the KRI and are living there alongside other minorities give the impression that they benefit from a similar preferential treatment as the Christians (see \u00a7 70 above).",
