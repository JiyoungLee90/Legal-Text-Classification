The case originated in an application (no. 4551/10) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Sylwia Jarczyńska, on behalf of her minor daughter, a Polish national Ms Julia Postek (“the applicant”), on 12 January 2010.
The applicant was represented by Ms J. Budzowska, a lawyer practising in Kraków. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings in her case had exceeded a reasonable time, in breach of Article 6 of the Convention.
On 11 October 2010 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
The applicant was born in 2001 and lives in Warszawa.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.
On 23 October 2002 the applicant, represented by her mother, instituted civil proceedings against a hospital before the  (Sąd Okręgowy), seeking compensation and a disability pension due to medical negligence and inadequate medical care during her birth.
In the first hearing on 28 April 2003 the  ordered the defendant hospital to pay to the applicant PLN 250 (approx. EUR 60) per month by way of a provisional disability pension.
On the applicant’s request, filed on 19 January 2005, the  issued a writ of execution in respect of its 2003 decision. On 5 August 2005 the applicant began receiving the provisional disability pension.
On 17 February 2011 the  gave a judgment which granted the applicant’s claims. It appears that this judgment has become final.
On 27 May 2009 the applicant filed a complaint with the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 Act”). She sought a finding that the length of the proceedings had been excessive and claimed compensation in the amount of PLN 20,000.
On 9 July 2009 the Warsaw Court of Appeal acknowledged that the proceedings in the applicant’s case had been excessive and awarded her PLN 5,000 (approx. EUR 1,200) by way of just satisfaction. The court held that certain delays in the case had resulted from the erroneous transfer of the case file to the wrong medical court experts. It further observed that in 2006 and 2007 there had been a one-year-long period of unjustifiable inactivity on the part of the . In the view of the Court of Appeal, some other delays could be explained by the need to obtain various medical expert opinions, often prompted by the applicant’s numerous requests to that effect.
The Court of Appeal explained that the award of PLN 5,000 was justified by the overall length and the level of complexity of the proceedings. It dismissed the applicant’s claim for a higher award, taking note of the fact that her main claims had been properly secured by the payment of the provisional disability pension.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are presented in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005V and Ratajczyk v. Poland (dec.), no. 11215/02, ECHR 2005VIII, and its judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.
