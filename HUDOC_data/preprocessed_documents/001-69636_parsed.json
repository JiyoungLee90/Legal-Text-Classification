The judgment did not require the authorities to grant him ownership of a particular flat, but rather to issue him with an occupancy voucher in respect of any flat satisfying the criteria laid down by the court. On the basis of the voucher, a so-called \u201csocial tenancy agreement\u201d would have been signed between the competent authority and the applicant, acting as the principal tenant on behalf of himself and the members of his family (see paragraph 21 above). Under the terms of a \u201csocial tenancy agreement\u201d, as established in the RSFSR Housing Code and the applicable regulations, the applicant would have had a right to possess and make use of the flat and to privatise it in accordance with the Privatisation of State Housing Act.",
