However, the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue, provided a hearing has been held at first instance (see Helmers v.\u00a0Sweden, judgment of 29\u00a0October\u00a01991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, \u00a7 36).

This does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no.\u00a055853/00, \u00a7\u00a029, 8 February 2005). Thus, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social-security schemes are generally rather technical and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v.\u00a0, cited above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7\u00a058).",
