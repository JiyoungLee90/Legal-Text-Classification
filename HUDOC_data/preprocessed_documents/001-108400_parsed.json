Despite pain in the stomach area and nausea, he had not been examined by a gastroenterologist and had not been given any treatment for these symptoms. The referral for an endoscopy had only been acted upon in 2008. It had failed to be acted upon on three previous occasions. As to his heart pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) had only been carried out in January 2007. No previous or subsequent tests or medication had been provided, despite his acute and persistent heart pains. He had not been examined by a cardiologist. Despite his liver pains, he had not been examined by a hepatologist; nor had he been given any medication. Such medication had been particularly important given that he had received chemotherapy for his tuberculosis. No medical assistance had been provided in relation to the deterioration in his eyesight or his dental problems. All mentions in his medical records of refusals to receive treatment had been forged. None of the refusals had been recorded on a special form and none of them bore his signature, despite the requirements of national legislation. Lastly, the applicant alleged that no medical care had been provided to him between late December 2008 and June 2009 in relation to the aforementioned medical conditions.",

France [GC], no.\u00a053924/00, \u00a7\u00a090, ECHR 2004VIII; see also, in the context of Article 3 of the Convention, Yazg\u00fcl Y\u0131lmaz v. Turkey, no.\u00a036369/06, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 57, 1\u00a0February 2011). For example, in the sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability on the part of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress to be obtained (ibid.).",

The Court has held in various contexts that where domestic proceedings have taken place, as in the present case, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see, among others, Giuliani and Gaggio v.
