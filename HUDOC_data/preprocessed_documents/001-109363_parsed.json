At that time the judgment in their favour remained unexecuted for three years and for one year and nine months respectively. Both widows legitimately considered that the money due under the judgment would be paid to them in their quality of heirs. In these circumstances, the subsequent quashing of the judgment on supervisory review personally affected the two applicants, frustrating their reliance on that binding and enforceable judgment (compare Streltsov and other \u201cNovocherkassk military pensioners\u201d cases v. , nos. 8549/06 et al., \u00a7 40, 29 July 2010).

The crux of the grievance under Article 6 was, in fact, frustration of the applicant\u2019s reliance on the binding judicial decision. Given that quashing of a final judgment is an instantaneous act and does not create a continuing situation, the Court may have difficulties in finding that the applicant\u2019s relatives were also affected by the quashing. As a result, the complaint under Article 6 in the context of the supervisory-review proceedings, if raised separately, might not be automatically considered transferable to the applicant\u2019s relatives (see Streltsov and other \u201cNovocherkassk military pensioners\u201d cases, cited above, \u00a7 40).",

It recalls that the principles insisting that a final judicial decision must not be called into question and should be enforced represent two aspects of the same general concept, namely the \u201cright to a court\u201d (see, for instance, Sobelin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 67). The Court has consistently recognised the standing of close relatives of diseased applicants in respect of non-enforcement complaints (see, among others, Shiryayeva v. Russia, no. 21417/04, \u00a7 9, 13 July 2006). Given that the supervisory-review complaints under Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 are closely interrelated, the Court has also been prepared to accept the relatives\u2019 standing under both those provisions. In view of the above, the Court does not consider it necessary to draw a distinction between two aspects of the applicant\u2019s complaint for the purpose of determination of the standing issue. It therefore finds that Ms\u00a0Margarita Igorevna Khatkevich has standing to pursue her late husband complaints under both Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Streltsov and other \u201cNovocherkassk military pensioners\u201d cases, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

The Court also bears in mind that the principles insisting that a final judicial decision must not be called into question and should be enforced represent two aspects of the same general concept, namely the right to a court (see Sobelin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067, and Kulkov and Others v. Russia, nos. 25114/03 et al., \u00a7\u00a035, 8\u00a0January 2009) and that the applicants had complained at the outset of the violation of that right by the authorities. Finally, the parties have used the opportunity to submit their observations on both the non-enforcement and quashing of the judgments. The Government\u2019s objection must therefore be dismissed.",

The Court therefore decides to grant the applicants claims in full (see details in the table appended). At the same time the Court does not find it appropriate to grant the six applicants\u2019 additional claims for exhaustive compensation of inflation losses due to the depreciation of the Russian currency since their first claims were submitted (see paragraph 40 above). The Court reiterates that its role, as an international judicial authority, is not to compensate applicants\u2019 losses minutely and exhaustively (Ryabov and 151\u00a0other \u201cPrivileged pensioners\u201d cases v. , nos. 4563/07 et al., \u00a7\u00a021, 17\u00a0December 2009).
