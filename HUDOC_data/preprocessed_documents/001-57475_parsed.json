This is why in its own judgment of 19 February 1976 the Federal Court examined the reasoning of the Trier Regional Court regarding the level of the sentence imposed; amongst other things, it re-affirmed the reliance placed on the case-law holding that excessive length of criminal proceedings may constitute a special mitigating circumstance (see the above-mentioned Eckle judgment, p. 17, \u00a7 33; see also the admissibility decision of 10 May 1979, appendix II to the Commission\u2019s report).",

As was rightly pointed out by the Government, the contribution of Mr. von Stackelberg was in essence limited to forwarding, together with a covering letter, the claims and documents of his clients. His memorandum of 13 January 1983 constitutes an exception, in that he furnished replies to the Government\u2019s observations. Consequently, the Court concurs with the Delegate\u2019s proposal on this item and awards DM 1,000 to each applicant.",
