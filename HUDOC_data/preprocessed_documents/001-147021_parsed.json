Relying on these documents, they maintained that the cells had not been overcrowded specifying in this respect that during the period from May 2002 and December 2003 the capacity of the detention facility was 1260 detainees and that at the relevant time, there were between 1178 and\u00a01260 detainees. The facility contained 270 cells and 13 cells of common detention where persons arriving at the detention facility are temporarily placed until their registration is finished. The Government further stated that during the relevant period, the number of sleeping places in the cells had corresponded to the number of detainees and that the applicant had been provided with an individual sleeping place. The sanitary conditions had been sound and the applicant could use the toilet in private as it had been separated from the living area of the cells by a 1 metre-high door (the English version of the Government\u2019s observations indicates the height of 0.7 metre). The cells had been equipped with a ventilation system and had been ventilated naturally through the windows. Moreover, the applicant had been allowed at least one hour outdoor exercise a day in one of 55 walking yards which were equipped by benches, 13 walking yards were adapted for sports activities. The Government joined to their written observations two pictures of the sanitary equipment in a cell in building no. 2 and two pictures of the walking yards.",

It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents.

They fell rather into the category of corroborative evidence, as the guilty verdict on the theft charges was reached on the basis of testimony taken during the trial and of other evidence (see paragraphs 13-20 above).
