It has also asserted the importance of respect for the presumption of innocence during press conferences by state officials (see Butkevi\u010dius v.

Nevertheless, whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see, inter alia, Adolf v.
