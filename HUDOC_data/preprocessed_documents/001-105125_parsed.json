On 24 February 1998, in his testimony, the prosecutor in the bigamy case explained that Dr A. had not appeared at the hearing. The prosecutor related that he had tried to keep the magistrate calm and was nearly found guilty of contempt himself because he was playing defence lawyer. The prosecutor stated that, at that moment, the magistrate dictated a minute, which he thought was directed towards him, that if he opened his mouth he would himself be found in contempt of court. He had also understood, at that moment, that the magistrate found Dr A. to be in contempt of court because he did not appear. The prosecutor reiterated that, at that moment, the magistrate was very angry and that he understood that he had found Dr A. guilty of contempt. When asked whether the impugned article reflected what really went on in the court room, the prosecutor replied \u201ceffectively it reflects what happened in court in short\u201d. He continued to say that while much more was said in the court room, at that time, the phrase in the article \u201cthe magistrate found Dr A. to be in contempt of court\u201d reflected the impression he had\u00a0had as to what effectively happened at that moment in time.",

In its presentation of the facts the court recalled the above mentioned evidence. It, however, found that the article did not coincide properly with what had happened, in particular in its heading, since, as appeared clearly from the minutes of the hearing, it was not true that the plaintiff was found guilty of contempt of court. Thus, the publication was not a fair report of the proceedings. Consequently, it could not be considered privileged. The court went on to note that the defendants tried to diminish their blame for their incorrect reporting by proving that the hearing had been chaotic. It was for this reason that the journalist misunderstood what had happened. The defendants had further shown that the prosecutor too had misunderstood what had happened, as he had also understood that the plaintiff had been found guilty of contempt. In the court\u2019s view, however, this merely highlighted the need for the reporter to verify her information. The reporter\u2019s interest in publishing information was legitimate. However, it could not be more important than someone\u2019s reputation. The statement that Dr A. had been found to be in contempt of court surely harmed his reputation as it incited the supposition that he had not fulfilled his duties as a lawyer. Thus, it found the statement in question to be defamatory and taking account of the fact that they had published an apology and that the printer had not read the report at issue, it ordered the applicants to pay, in solidum, 300 Maltese liras (MTL \u2013 approximately 720 euros (EUR)) in damages with interest and costs, but limiting the third applicant\u2019s responsibility to MTL 150 (approximately EUR 360) plus interest.",

Since, in reality, Dr A. had never been found to be in contempt of court, her publication, amounting to a statement of fact and not a value judgment, proved to be false. The Government clarified that any pronouncement that Mr X. had been found guilty of contempt of court would have been mentioned in the records of the case, which is the best method of verification. Moreover, the applicants had access to the records (Article 518 of the Criminal Code). Indeed, the second applicant obtained these records the following day. The applicants consequently published an apology acknowledging that the statement was not true. Its falsity was further confirmed by the domestic courts. Thus, it was pointless to continue alleging that the initial statement was true.

However, the domestic courts considered that Dr A. had not in fact been found guilty of contempt of court. The Court notes that the second applicant drew her conclusion from what she had seen and heard, namely the statements of the magistrate during the court proceedings, which it has not been disputed were chaotic. It observes that the presiding magistrate had at least stated that the circumstances verged on contempt of court. Finding a lawyer in contempt of court was an action within his power in such circumstances and was not an unreasonable response in view of defence counsel\u2019s failure to appear on the appointed day and without having informed the court that he would not attend the hearing. Moreover, two individuals present in the court room heard, independently of each other, the magistrate find Dr A. to be in contempt of court. Indeed, the prosecutor present in the same courtroom confirmed the second applicant\u2019s version on oath during the defamation proceedings. More importantly, during the defamation proceedings not a single witness was produced to assert that the magistrate had not found Dr A. to be in contempt of court. Dr A. himself had not presented any such evidence and since he was not present at the hearing, he was in no position to contradict that statement. Indeed, all the evidence heard, apart from the court record, clearly suggested that Dr A. had been found to be in contempt of court.",

Records of proceedings are usually brief minutes of the res gestae, and as acknowledged by the domestic courts (see paragraph 12 above) they do not contain a detailed record of all that takes place during proceedings. Thus, while such record is certainly important for the purposes of a court case, it cannot be considered the sole source of truth for other purposes, including court reporting. To limit court reporting to facts reproduced in the records of proceedings, and to bar reports based on what a journalist has heard and seen with his or her own eyes and ears, as corroborated by others, would be an unacceptable restriction of freedom of expression and the free flow of information. While there may be a presumption that the official record of court proceedings is complete and accurate, such a presumption may be rebutted by other evidence of what occurred during the course of the proceedings. It follows that in a conflict between the records of the case and the sworn evidence of witnesses who have no personal interest in the case, a court should not discard the sworn evidence a priori. This is even more true where, as here, there is no apparent conflict since the record of the proceedings is silent on the matter in issue.",

The Court is struck by the fact that, although this evidence was plainly relevant and came from an independent eye-witness to the events in question, little or no attention appears to have been paid to it by the Civil Court in the defamation proceedings. In particular, there is no indication in the judgment of the  as to whether the prosecutor was found by the court to be an unreliable or unconvincing witness. The Court considers that to require the applicants to prove the truth of the statements made in the article, while at the same time disregarding, or giving no reasons for rejecting, the evidence called by the applicants to establish their truth, is not consistent with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Flux and Samson v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 28700/03, \u00a7 25, 23 October 2007, and Jerusalem v. , no. 26958/95, \u00a7\u00a045-46, ECHR 2001II).",

For the Court,\u00a0such a course of action would be\u00a0entirely in line with best journalistic practices. In the circumstances of the present case, the second applicant could not reasonably have been expected to take any further steps, especially since news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see, for example, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, \u00a7\u00a060, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0216; and Association Ekin v.
