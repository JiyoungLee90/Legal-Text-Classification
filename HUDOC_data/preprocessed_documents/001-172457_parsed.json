The court further found that awards made on 28 October 1999, 3 April 2001 and 24 April 2002 in the amount of EUR 1,966 should be paid to the applicant by the Ministry of Energy, since the latter had been designated by the Government to finance the debts of the coal mine, in so far as the salary arrears and related social payments prior to the decision to wind up the company were concerned.

In contrast to the obligation of a High Contracting Party to comply expediently with the judgments against it, within the domain of enforcement of a final and binding judicial decision against a private party a State\u2019s obligations are limited to providing a creditor with the necessary legal assistance and ensuring the effective operation of the procedure (see Fuklev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a071186/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 7\u00a0June 2005; Anokhin v.
