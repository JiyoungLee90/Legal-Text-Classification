It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and certainly as soon as the investigation had commenced. The Court reiterates that it is crucial in cases of deaths in contentious situations for the investigation to be prompt. The passage of time will inevitably erode the amount and quality of the evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence will cast doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts, as well as drag out the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002II).

In this regard, the Court\u00a0refers to its practice by which the application of Article 3 is usually not extended to the relatives of persons who have been killed by the authorities in violation of Article 2 (see Yasin Ate\u015f v. Turkey, no. 30949/96, \u00a7\u00a0135, 31 May 2005) or to cases of unjustified use of lethal force by State agents (see Isayeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 57947/00, 57948/00 and 57949/00, \u00a7 229, 24 February 2005), as opposed to the relatives of the victims of enforced disappearances. The latter approach is exercised by the Court in view of the continuous nature of the psychological suffering of the applicants whose relatives disappeared and the applicants\u2019 inability for a prolonged period of time to find out what happened to them (see, among many other authorities, Bazorkina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0141; Imakayeva v. Russia, no. 7615/02, \u00a7 166, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts); and Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a069480/01, \u00a7\u00a0115, ECHR\u00a02006XIII (extracts)). As for the present case, even though the Court does not doubt that the tragic death of her sisters caused the applicant profound suffering, it nonetheless, owing to the instantaneous nature of the incident, does not find that it amounts to a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see, for a similar situation, Udayeva and Yusupova v.
