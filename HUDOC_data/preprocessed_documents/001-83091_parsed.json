There was nothing in the courts' judgments or other authorities' decisions regarding the fate of V.'s assets apart from the court order of 24 April 2002 to return the assets to where they were on 3\u00a0July 1996 (see paragraph 16 above). This order can only be interpreted as the transfer of V.'s assets back to the State company which existed before it was transformed into V.

What matters is that V. ceased to exist and its entire property was alienated without the payment of its debts. The Court considers that it is contrary to basic principles of fairness for the authorities to allow the liquidation of a company, by whatever means, and the transfer of its property to any third party, without having paid its debts, within the limits of any assets it may have at the time of liquidation. However, this is what, in essence, resulted from the various judgments adopted in the present case.\u00a0As a result, V. no longer exists, nor does it have any assets and the judgment in favour of the applicant cannot be enforced.
