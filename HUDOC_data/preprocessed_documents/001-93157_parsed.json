Romania, no. 33348/96, 17 December 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 111-124; Soko\u0142owski v. , no. 75955/01, \u00a7 51, 29 March 2005). In this connection, the Court points out that recourse to criminal prosecution against journalists for purported insults raising issues of public debate, such as those in the present case, should be considered proportionate only in very exceptional circumstances involving a most serious attack on an individual\u2019s rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Azevedo v. Portugal, no. 20620/04, \u00a7 33, 27 March 2008). To hold otherwise would deter journalists from contributing to the public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community and, more generally, hamper the press in carrying out its important role of a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d.",
