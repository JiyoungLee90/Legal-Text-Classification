It has held on many occasions that, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused. The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of a detained individual is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (see, among other authorities, Orhan v. , no.\u00a025656/94, \u00a7\u00a0326, 18 June 2002). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death of such persons.

In that respect it is significant for the Court that the applicants\u2019 submissions concerning the circumstances of their relative\u2019s entering the grounds remained consistent both throughout the domestic proceedings and the proceedings before it (see paragraphs 14-17 and 31-34 above) and that that fact is further confirmed by those materials from criminal case no.\u00a053092 that were made available to the Court by the Government (see paragraph\u00a031 above).

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
