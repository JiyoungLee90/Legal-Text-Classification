The court noted, in particular, that the medical information concerning the illness which had served as the ground for the exemption from military service was given in coded form in the exemption certificate by means of reference to sections of the Medical Standards, so as to avoid divulging such information to third parties. However, since the Medical Standards as well as the relevant Defence Ministry order had been published in the Official Gazette and were identified by date and number in the exemption certificate, the public could have access to this information and thus the coding did not ensure its confidentiality. At the same time, the legislation made it a requirement to produce military registration documents when applying for identity documents or signing a work contract and in other cases provided for by law, including to private companies which so requested.

There was no material difference between his situation and that of B.; in particular, there had been a disclosure of confidential information to third parties in the present case when his exemption certificate had had to be submitted to the authorities in order to renew his national identity card. More importantly, any differences between the two cases were not important given the type of reasoning of the Supreme Court of Justice in its judgment in B.\u2019s case. Lastly, he argued that since B.\u2019s full name had been mentioned in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice despite a request to grant him anonymity, the applicant was at risk of the same further disclosure of very sensitive medical information. He was therefore dissuaded from lodging a court action as this could result in the very type of publicity which he sought to avoid when asking for a change in his exemption certificate.",
