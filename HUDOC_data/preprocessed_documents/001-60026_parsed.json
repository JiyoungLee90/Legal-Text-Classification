The Indictment Division had held that, contrary to Article\u00a013 of the Convention, the authorities had deprived the alien of an effective remedy in law by interpreting the fact that appeals to the Conseil d'Etat had no suspensive effect as meaning that it was lawful for illegal immigrants to be forcibly expelled. The Court of Cassation held that, on the contrary, the issue whether an alien who had applied for refugee status had an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 had to be examined in the light of the procedure as a whole. After observing that appeals to the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons under the urgent procedure were of suspensive effect and that aliens were entitled, when lodging applications with the Conseil d'Etat for judicial review, to apply at the same time for a stay of execution under the ordinary or extremely urgent procedure, it concluded that those remedies taken as a whole satisfied the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention.

Police methods and tactics may only be regarded as proper and fair if they are proportionate to the aims which the authorities seek to achieve, for the principle of proportionality is a general principle of the Convention. It is applied in a wide range of cases by the Court in its case-law (particularly in its case-law on paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11, and Article 14) and may be regarded as part of the Article 5 requirement that persons are only to be deprived of their liberty \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d. The method used by the  police \u2013 ruse \u2013 is to my mind inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. The persons who were to be deprived of their liberty were not criminals. They were illegal immigrants whose request for asylum had been turned down. While the Court rightly refused to exclude the possibility of the police being allowed to use ruses to make the fight against crime more effective (see paragraph 41 of the judgment), in the instant case, the  police were not concerned with a criminal investigation but with an administrative procedure of forcible expulsion. Although States are entitled to expel illegal immigrants in an effective manner and while there may not be many suitable alternatives and those there are in some cases have equally damaging consequences for the immigrants and their children, using a ruse such as that used by the Ghent police creates a danger that the public authorities will generally be perceived as not being credible in their administrative dealings with aliens illegally present on the national territory.

In addition, the Court rightly refers to its judgment in Fox, Campbell and Hartley (see paragraph 55 of the judgment). In that case, the applicants had been held for approximately thirty and forty-four hours. On the day following their arrest the applicants instituted habeas corpus proceedings, but they were released before the applications came for hearing before a judge. The Court held that it was unnecessary to examine the merits of the applicants' complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4, as they had each been speedily released before any judicial review of their detention had taken place.

In my opinion, the personal circumstances of the applicants were also examined briefly a third time. On the day they were arrested, the  police contacted the Aliens Office to check whether any of those arrested had leave to remain in . The fact that some of them were allowed to return home after their individual circumstances had been checked and their immigration status found to be in order shows that, even at that late stage in the deportation process, a final individual examination was carried out.",

To my mind, the measures taken on 29 September 1999 cannot be isolated from the earlier decisions regarding the asylum procedure. The applicants' individual circumstances had been examined on two or even three occasions and that had provided sufficient justification for the expulsions. By attaching importance to the fact that the final order to leave the territory made no reference to the applicants' request for asylum, or to the decisions of 3 March and 18 June 1999, the majority appear to have introduced a purely formal element into the definition of the concept of \u201ccollective expulsion\u201d. In that connection, the majority should have followed the decision in Andric, in which the Court held: \u201cthe fact that a number of aliens receive similar decisions does not lead to the conclusion that there is a collective expulsion when each person has been given the opportunity to put arguments against his expulsion to the competent authorities on an individual basis.\u201d",

In my opinion, those factors could not in any way have influenced the decisions that were taken in the applicants' cases after the examination of their individual circumstances and did not, therefore, justify those doubts. Thus, the fact that on 24 August 1999 the Director-General of the Aliens Office wrote to the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons informing him of his intention to deal with the Slovakian nationals' requests for asylum rapidly in order to send a signal to discourage further applicants obviously could not have influenced decisions taken previously, in tempore non suspecto, against the applicants by the Aliens Office (on 3\u00a0March 1999) and the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (on 18 June 1999). Indeed, the Commissioner-General is \u201ca national authority, whose independence is guaranteed by law and who affords procedural guarantees to the alien\u201d (Belgian Court of Cassation, 23\u00a0January 2001). The other factors referred to by the majority relate to the effective repatriation of the group. They relate to events at the end of September and cannot therefore justify the majority's doubts concerning the decisions taken against the aliens on 3 March 1999 and 18 June 1999. Indeed, the majority themselves acknowledge that the repatriation of the group does not contravene Article 4 of Protocol No 4 if there has been a reasonable and objective examination of the aliens' personal circumstances.

Indeed, an application for a stay of execution under the ordinary procedure \u2013 the procedure used by the applicants \u2013 does not entail, either in law or in practice, any suspensive effect.

The Government not only demonstrated, by numerous examples, that the procedure may be implemented extremely quickly, it also produced a large number of judgments in which the Conseil d'Etat had effectively suspended expulsion orders under the extremely urgent procedure. As to the success rate for applications under that procedure, the parties produced widely divergent statistics to the Court: the applicants set the rate at 1.36% while the Government produced a document delivered by the Head Registrar of the Conseil d'Etat, which indicates a rate of 25.22%. The Court, unfamiliar with the methods of calculation used, rightly did not seek to resolve that difference between the parties. However, in any event, it should be recalled that the effectiveness of a remedy does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant; it suffices that there be real prospects of success. In view of the direct effect of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in Belgian law, it is clear that the Belgian Conseil d'Etat is empowered to stay the execution of any collective expulsion measure prohibited by that provision.",

In that connection it should first be pointed out that, under the Court's case-law, the effectiveness of a remedy depends on its suspensive effect when the complaints concern a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. Noting the \u201cthe irreversible nature of the damage which may result if the risk of torture or degrading treatment materialises\u201d, the Court requires that the measures in respect of which the remedy is sought cannot be executed before they have been examined by the national authorities. In the instant case, however, the Court held that the complaint of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention was manifestly ill-founded (see the admissibility decision of 13 March 2001) and, consequently, not arguable for the purposes of Article 13 (see paragraph 76 of the judgment).

Nor have they produced any concrete example to show that the powers of the Conseil d'Etat in such proceedings are ineffective. In the absence of any such evidence, it is reasonable to suppose that in practice an application under the extremely urgent procedure has suspensive effect. Indeed, in paragraph 66 of the judgment, the majority summarise the applicants' argument as follows: \u201cIn particular, as regards remedies in the Conseil d'Etat under the extremely urgent procedure, the applicants accepted that in practice the judgment of the Conseil d'Etat was delivered before execution of the deportation order, but they argued that the law afforded no guarantee of that and the administrative authority was perfectly entitled to execute the deportation order without waiting for the judgment.\u201d That argument, which is correct in law, amounts to saying that the application has no automatic suspensive effect, but does have such effect in practice.",
