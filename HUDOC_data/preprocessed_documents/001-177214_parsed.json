He pointed out, more specifically, that during the trial Ms T. had refused, in reply to his questions, to give definitions to the notions of \u201crace\u201d, \u201cethnic origin\u201d and \u201csocial group\u201d, stating that it was outside of her competence as a linguist and rather fell within the competence of a sociologist or historian. However, according to the official trial record, Ms T. had defined the aforementioned notions. The applicant also asked the court to include in the case file a copy and transcript of the audio recording of the first-instance hearings, made by the defence, indicating the discrepancies between the actual statements made by Ms T. and those reflected in the trial record.",

It is true that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, for instance, Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2004I, and Altu\u011f Taner Ak\u00e7am v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, \u00a7 87, 25\u00a0October 2011). The scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, for instance, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). It may be assumed therefore that, even if generally formulated, the provision in question may be regarded as compatible with the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement, if interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in a rigorous and consistent manner. The Court is furthermore mindful that its task is not to review domestic law in the abstract but to determine whether the way in which it was applied to the applicant gave rise to a breach of the Convention (see Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 136).",

The Court recognises that in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with absolute precision and that a certain degree of flexibility may be called for to enable the Russian courts to assess whether a particular action can be considered as capable of stirring up hatred and enmity on the grounds listed in that Article (see Ba\u015fkaya and Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999IV; \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055; and Karademirci and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 37096/97 and 37101/97, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2005I). It has consistently held that in any system of law, including criminal law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there will inevitably be a need for interpretation by the courts, whose judicial function is precisely to elucidate obscure points and dispel any doubts which may remain regarding the interpretation of legislation (see, for instance, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, cited above, \u00a7 55, and, mutatis mutandis, Jorgic v.\u00a0Germany, no. 74613/01, \u00a7 101, ECHR\u00a02007III).",

It has previously stressed that the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d which accompany the exercise of the right to freedom of expression by media professionals assume special significance in situations of conflict and tension. Particular caution is called for when consideration is being given to the publication of views of representatives of organisations which resort to violence against the State lest the media become a vehicle for the dissemination of \u201chate speech\u201d and the promotion of violence. At the same time, where such views cannot be categorised as such, Contracting States cannot with reference to the protection of national security or the prevention of crime or disorder restrict the right of the public to be informed of them by bringing the weight of the criminal law to bear on the media (see S\u00fcrek (no. 4), cited above, \u00a7\u00a060, and Erdo\u011fdu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071). In the Court\u2019s opinion, it is not so much the severity of the applicant\u2019s sentence but the very fact that he was criminally convicted that is striking in the present case (cf. Perin\u00e7ek, cited above, \u00a7 273). The Court considers that both the applicant\u2019s conviction and the severe sanction imposed were capable of producing a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression in Russia and dissuading the press from openly discussing matters of public concern, in particular, those relating to the conflict in the Chechen Republic (cf. Fatullayev, cited above, \u00a7 128).",

In the applicant\u2019s view, Ms T.\u2019s reports had been unreliable as she, being only a linguist, had not possessed any other specific knowledge, and therefore had not been sufficiently competent to draw such conclusions. The applicant also claimed that the trial record had been incorrect since the testimony of the key witness, Ms T., had been falsified. He furthermore complained that Judge B. had disallowed his applications to have the transcript amended in line with the audio recording of the hearings submitted by him on the sole ground that the recording had not been authorised, and had refused to accept his supplementary appeal pleadings of 17\u00a0February 2006. In this connection, the applicant claimed that Judge B. had been biased and hostile throughout the trial. He also alleged that although his appeal pleadings of 17 February 2006 had eventually been included in the case file, the appellate court had not given due consideration to his arguments concerning the incorrect trial record. Lastly, the applicant complained under Article 13 of the Convention that there had been no effective remedies in respect of his complaints concerning Judge B.\u2019s alleged misconduct.",

During the trial Ms T. had confirmed her conclusions and provided reasons for them. The domestic courts, according to the Government, had had no reason to doubt her reports, given, in particular, her professional competencies and skills and past experience. The Government also argued that the courts had provided valid reasons for rejecting Ms V.\u2019s report as inadmissible evidence. Lastly, they pointed out that a prosecutor\u2019s office had carried out checks in that connection regarding the applicant\u2019s complaint against Judge B.; however, no evidence had been found that the judge had exceeded his powers, or taken any action with a view to falsifying the transcript.",
