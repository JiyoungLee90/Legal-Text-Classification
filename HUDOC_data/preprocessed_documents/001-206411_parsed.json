The magistrate considered, firstly, that there were strong suspicions that the applicant had committed the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of two terrorist organisations, the PKK/KCK and FET\u00d6/PDY. He noted in that regard that the applicant had expressed views similar to those voiced by the members of terrorist organisations, describing those organisations\u2019 terrorist activities as a \u201cwar\u201d or \u201cstruggle\u201d; that he had presented those organisations as legitimate entities while seeking to portray Turkey as a State that supported terrorist organisations; that he had described the security forces\u2019 efforts to combat the terrorist organisations as illegal and even as terrorism, referring to the State agents as \u201cmurderers, mafiosi, violent [individuals]\u201d while terrorist activities were continuing in south-east Turkey, with armed attacks being carried out targeting State officials, trenches being dug, barricades being erected and bombs being planted; and that the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of terrorist organisations by stating in his posts that the security forces were setting off bombs and inciting others to war while the terrorist organisations took responsibility for the attacks. In the magistrate\u2019s view, there was no contradiction in the claims that the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of two very different, even rival, terrorist organisations, namely the PKK and FET\u00d6/PDY, since the investigations carried out following the attempted military coup and the information in the public domain showed that the two organisations, with the support of external forces, had acted in coordinated fashion during and after the attempted coup. He further noted that the applicant, in his defence submissions, had continued to make accusations against the State and its leaders. As justification for the applicant\u2019s placement in pre-trial detention the magistrate then referred to the nature of the alleged offence, the severity of the penalty laid down by law, the fact that the offence had been committed through the press, and the fact that protective measures other than pre-trial detention would clearly be inadequate since the applicant showed no remorse for his remarks and had continued throughout his questioning to employ the same rhetoric as the members of the abovementioned terrorist organisations.",

The magistrate considered that the applicant\u2019s posts on his Twitter account and his articles in Cumhuriyet were apt to amount to propaganda in favour of the armed terrorist organisations the PKK/KCK and FET\u00d6/PDY and that there were therefore strong suspicions that the applicant had committed the alleged criminal offences. The magistrate also took into account the fact that the evidence had not yet all been gathered and that there was no fresh evidence favourable to the applicant that would justify ending his pre-trial detention, given the length of the sentence liable to be imposed if the offence was established and the period already spent in detention. Lastly, the magistrate considered that the applicant\u2019s release pending trial would be insufficient. On 9 February 2017 the applicant lodged an objection against the order of 30 January 2017, arguing that there was no evidence grounding a suspicion that he had disseminated propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, and maintaining that the articles and posts in question had formed part of his journalistic activities protected by freedom of expression. On 14 February 2017 the Istanbul 10th Magistrate\u2019s Court dismissed the objection, finding that the impugned order had complied with the law and the proper procedure and that there was no fresh evidence favourable to the applicant that would require his pre-trial detention to be ended.",

The judges concerned noted that the offence of which the applicant was accused was among the offences listed in Article 100 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d) \u2013 the so-called \u201ccatalogue offences\u201d. They took the view that if the applicant were released pending trial he was liable to abscond. They observed in that connection that in the previous investigations concerning Cumhuriyet journalists the suspects had fled, by lawful or unlawful means, as soon as an opportunity had arisen.

It noted the magistrate\u2019s findings to the effect that the applicant had depicted the security forces\u2019 efforts to combat terrorist organisations as terrorism, that he had manipulated the facts in order to present the State as an entity that cooperated with certain terrorist organisations and supplied weapons to them, that he had written articles and posts supporting the actions carried out by the PKK, the DHKP/C and FET\u00d6/PDY, and that he had thus sought to legitimise those actions, had gone beyond the aim of informing the public and had ensured that the points of view of the terrorist organisations were disseminated widely among the public.",

The Constitutional Court held that it had been neither arbitrary nor unfounded for the investigating authorities to consider, taking into account the content of the interview and the manner in which it had been presented, that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant was guilty, given that he had interviewed the perpetrators of the action while they were actually committing it and had relayed their message to the public although it was clear that the organisation to which the perpetrators belonged had carried out the action in order to have its voice heard and to remain in the headlines.",

With regard to the applicant\u2019s interview with one of the perpetrators of the hostage-taking and killing of a public prosecutor, published on 31\u00a0March and 1 April 2015, he considered that, although interviewing terrorists while their action was in progress undeniably resulted in their message being conveyed to the public, a distinction had to be made between the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and journalism which disregarded professional ethics in search of a scoop. In the view of the Vice-President, the applicant could have been more sensitive in his presentation of the information in terms of the language, style and imagery used. However, conveying information on terrorist acts to the public inevitably involved informing society about the terrorists\u2019 aims. In covering this particular event, virtually all the media outlets concerned had provided the public with information on the terrorists\u2019 aims and the reasons behind their action; this was quite natural in the context of journalistic activity. Were it otherwise, any information concerning terrorist actions was liable to be regarded as propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation. That would prevent the flow of information and the creation of a climate of healthy discussion in a democratic society on the subject of terrorism.",

However, the terminology used in an interview was simply a matter of the editorial choices of the journalist or his or her newspaper. Poor choices were not the result of the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of terrorism but were simply poor journalism.

It carried out a detailed examination, from a constitutional perspective, of the facts leading to the declaration of the state of emergency. As a result of this examination, it found that the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016 had been a clear and serious attack both on the constitutional principles that sovereignty was unconditionally and unreservedly vested in the people, who exercised it through authorised organs, and that no individual or body could exercise any State authority not emanating from the Constitution, and also on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. According to the Constitutional Court, the attempted military coup had been a practical illustration of the severity of the threats posed to the democratic constitutional order and human rights. After summarising the attacks carried out during the night of 15 to 16 July 2016, it emphasised that in order to assess the severity of the threat posed by a military coup, it was also necessary to consider the risks that might have arisen had the coup attempt not been thwarted. It found that the fact that the attempted coup had taken place at a time when Turkey had been under violent attack from numerous terrorist organisations had made the country even more vulnerable and considerably increased the severity of the threat to the life and existence of the nation. The Constitutional Court noted that in some cases it might not be possible for a State to eliminate threats to its democratic constitutional order, fundamental rights and national security through ordinary administrative procedures. It might therefore be necessary to impose extraordinary administrative procedures, such as a state of emergency, until such threats were eliminated. Bearing in mind the threats resulting from the attempted military coup of 15 July 2016, the Constitutional Court accepted the power of the Council of Ministers, chaired by the President, to issue legislative decrees on matters necessitating the state of emergency. In that context, it also emphasised that the state of emergency was a temporary legal regime, in which any interference with fundamental rights had to be foreseeable and the aim of which was to restore the normal regime in order to safeguard fundamental rights.",

That aim was to establish an independent State of Kurdistan based on Marxist-Leninist principles and covering east and south-east Turkey and parts of Syria, Iran and Iraq. The KCK was a political model for reconstructing Kurdish society through administrative and judicial structures, in accordance with the PKK\u2019s ultimate goal. According to the Government, the PKK and its sub-groups had carried out terrorist activities that had infringed the right to life (several thousand people had been killed and wounded, including civilians and members of the security forces, in the period preceding the attempted coup), the right to liberty and security, the right to respect for one\u2019s home and the right to property, in several regions of Turkey. In particular, these organisations had stepped up the number of terrorist attacks in a bid to declare the supposed autonomy of certain provinces in south-east Turkey and to bring pressure to bear on the population of that region by preventing free movement (digging trenches, installing barricades and planting bombs at the exit and entry points of the towns and cities), and by using military weapons.",

One of the underlying reasons for the high numbers of journalists being detained was the practice of judges, who often tended to disregard the exceptional nature of detention as a measure of last resort that should only be applied when all other options were deemed insufficient. In the majority of cases where journalists had been placed in pre-trial detention, they had been charged with terrorismrelated offences without any evidence corroborating their involvement in terrorist activities. The Commissioner for Human Rights was struck by the weakness of the accusations and the political nature of the decisions ordering and extending pre-trial detention in such cases.",

These articles were not referred to expressly by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 2 May 2019 dismissing the complaint that there had been no strong suspicion of the applicant\u2019s guilt. The Constitutional Court referred implicitly to these articles by noting the magistrate\u2019s findings to the effect that the applicant had manipulated the facts in order to portray the State as cooperating with certain terrorist organisations and supplying weapons to them; that he had written articles in support of the actions carried out by, among others, FET\u00d6/PDY; and that he had ensured that the points of view of the terrorist organisations were disseminated widely among the public.",

It observes that the three articles in question contained material which made a significant contribution to the public debate on current affairs in Turkey at the relevant time. The article of 13 February 2015 concerning the possible destination of a consignment of weapons sent by Turkey to Syria contained a record of the telephone calls between certain leaders of the Turkmen forces in Syria to whom the Turkish authorities claimed to have sent the weapons. The other two articles, concerning the bomb attack in Reyhanli, referred to an interview with the public prosecutor investigating the incident, in which he made comments and criticisms regarding the level of cooperation between the intelligence services in that affair.",

The Court considers that the requirement of speediness of the review is therefore relevant while that person\u2019s detention lasts. While the guarantee of speediness is no longer relevant for the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 4 after the person\u2019s release, the guarantee of efficiency of the review should continue to apply even thereafter, since a former detainee may well have a legitimate interest in the determination of his or her detention even after being released (see \u017d\u00fabor, cited above, \u00a7 83).",

Turkey ((dec.), no.\u00a019699/18, \u00a7\u00a7 35-44, 2 April 2019). In those cases it noted that in the Turkish legal system, anyone in pre-trial detention could apply for release at any stage of the proceedings and could lodge an objection if the application was rejected. It also observed that the question of detainees\u2019 continued detention was automatically reviewed at regular intervals of no more than thirty days. Accordingly, it held that it could tolerate longer periods of review by the Constitutional Court.\u00a0However, in the case of Mehmet Hasan Altan, cited above, the period before the Constitutional Court to be taken into consideration was fourteen months and three days, and in the case of \u015eahin Alpay, cited above, it was sixteen months and three days; and in the case of Akg\u00fcn, cited above, it was twelve months and sixteen days. Bearing in mind the complexity of the applications and the Constitutional Court\u2019s caseload following the declaration of a state of emergency, the Court considered that this was an exceptional situation. Consequently, although periods of twelve months and sixteen days, fourteen months and three days and sixteen months and three days before the Constitutional Court could not be described as \u201cspeedy\u201d in an ordinary context, in the specific circumstances of those cases the Court held that there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

It considers that the fact that the Constitutional Court did not deliver its judgment dismissing the applicant\u2019s application until 2\u00a0May 2019, some two years and three months later, is not relevant in calculating the period of time to be taken into consideration from the standpoint of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, since the applicant had already been released by that date. The Court therefore considers that its findings in the cases of Akg\u00fcn, Mehmet Hasan Altan and \u015eahin Alpay, cited above, are also applicable in the context of the present application. It emphasises in that connection that the applicant\u2019s application to the Constitutional Court was complex, because this was one of a number of cases raising complicated issues concerning the pre-trial detention of a journalist on account of published material relating to organisations considered to be terrorist organisations, and because the applicant, like other journalists writing for Cumhuriyet, had pleaded his case extensively before the Constitutional Court, arguing not only that his detention had not been based on any valid grounds, but also that the accusations against him were unconstitutional. Moreover, the Court considers that account must also be taken of the exceptional caseload of the Constitutional Court following the declaration of the state of emergency in July 2016 during the state of emergency in force from July 2016 to July 2018, and of the measures taken by the national authorities to tackle the problem of that court\u2019s backlog (see Mehmet Hasan Altan, cited above, \u00a7 165, \u015eahin Alpay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0137 and Akg\u00fcn, cited above, \u00a7 41). In that connection the Court stresses the distinction to be made between the present case and the case of Kavala v.\u00a0Turkey in which the applicant had remained in pre-trial detention for the eleven months elapsing between the lifting of the state of emergency on 18\u00a0July 2018 and the delivery of the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment on 28\u00a0June 2019 (see Kavala v.

The Court further reiterates that sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 of the Convention contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty and that no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds (see Khlaifia and Others v.

The facts referred to in the orders for his detention, and that of his fellow journalists from Cumhuriyet, as the basis for the suspicions had provoked an immediate and vehement response from the members of the government. For instance, when Cumhuriyet had brought to light the affair concerning the lorries belonging to the intelligence services alleged to have transported weapons to armed Islamist groups in Syria (a process to which he had contributed through an article containing an interview with the public prosecutor O.G.), the President of the Republic had accused the newspaper of espionage and had stated: \u201cWhoever wrote that article will pay dearly, I will not let the matter rest there\u201d.

Some of the criminal-law provisions concerning State security and terrorism were open to arbitrary application owing to their vague wording and the overly broad interpretation of the concepts of terrorist propaganda and support for a terrorist organisation, with those concepts encompassing statements and articles that clearly did not incite violence. In the aftermath of the attempted coup many journalists had faced unsubstantiated terrorism-related charges under such provisions, in connection with the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression. The detention and prosecution of journalists under such grave charges resulted in a strong chilling effect on wholly legitimate journalistic activities and contributed to self-censorship among those who wished to participate in public debate. In the Commissioner\u2019s view, numerous instances of judicial actions targeting not only journalists but also human rights defenders, academics and members of parliament exercising their right to freedom of expression indicated that criminal laws and procedures were currently being used by the judiciary to silence dissenting voices.",

Indeed, as the Court pointed out in Merabishvili (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0291), the mere fact that a restriction of a Convention right or freedom does not meet all the requirements of the clause that permits it does not necessarily raise an issue under Article 18.

Moreover, it should be noted that the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of C.D. and another of Cumhuriyet\u2019s managers at the time, finding that the suspicions against them were unconstitutional. It is true that the statement by the President of the Republic to the effect that he would not abide by the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling, was not bound by it and would not comply with it was clearly in contradiction with the basic tenets of the rule of law.

Subsequently, his continued pre-trial detention was ordered on suspicion of disseminating propaganda in favour of terrorist organisations or assisting those organisations. I must express my concerns about this new classification of the criminal charges, namely as regards the charge of assisting terrorist organisations. In this connection I simply refer to the judgment of the Court of Cassation concerning the present case (see paragraphs 47-50 of the judgment). Indeed, from the outset the charges against the applicant were poorly classified, particularly in relation to the offence of assisting a terrorist organisation. Taking into account the applicant\u2019s relevant activities, I can accept that there was reasonable suspicion in relation to the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of terrorist organisations. However, because the present judgment addresses the issue of the existence of reasonable suspicion in relation to both charges \u2013 disseminating propaganda in favour of terrorist organisations and assisting terrorist organisations \u2013 together, without making a distinction (in the light of paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article\u00a05 taken together), and because I have serious doubts as to the presence of reasonable suspicion in relation to the offence of assisting terrorist organisations, I voted with the majority in favour of finding a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. Thus, I believe that there was a failure of classification on the part of the domestic courts, and share the view of the majority that the suspicion against the applicant did not reach the required minimum level of reasonableness in relation to the offence of assisting terrorist organisations.",

In reaching this conclusion, the majority merely relied on the finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, without carrying out a further examination under Article\u00a010 (see paragraphs 187-88 of the judgment).

But this freedom is also accompanied by duties and responsibilities, resulting in particular from the principle of responsible journalism, which is one of the principles developed in our Court\u2019s established case-law.

I do not wish to prejudice the outcome of the criminal proceedings pending before the domestic courts. Thus, in my opinion, it is premature to rule on those charges and there was no need to examine separately the interference with Article 10; accordingly, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion as to the violation of Article 10 of the Convention. In the light of the above, I consider that it was unnecessary to examine this complaint separately.",
