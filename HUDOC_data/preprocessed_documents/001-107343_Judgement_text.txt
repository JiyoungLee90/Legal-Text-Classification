On 12 July 2010 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Dnipropetrovsk.
On 6 June 2005 he lodged a civil claim with the AmurNyzhnyodniprovskyy District Court of Dnipropetrovsk (“the District Court”) against three companies, by which he sought the cancellation of the car purchase contract and claimed damages.
On 30 June 2010 the court partly allowed the claim.
On 8 November 2010 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the above judgment. On 16 March 2011 the Higher Specialized Civil and Criminal Court quashed the above decisions and remitted the case to the District Court for fresh examination, before which the proceedings are still pending.
According to the Government, in the course of the proceedings the applicant specified his claim on eight occasions. Nine hearings in the District Court were adjourned, mainly due to the respondents’ absence or upon their requests or due to the electricity blackouts in the court premises. Following the respondents’ requests, the District Court ordered five expert examinations, which lasted in total for about three years and four months. The applicant additionally informed that on 1 June 2011 the District Court ordered yet another expert examination.
