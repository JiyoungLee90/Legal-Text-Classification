However, already during the applicant\u2019s trial, M.\u2019s prosecution for the murder of K. was suspended. This was a preliminary step towards the ultimate termination of that prosecution. Moreover, the Court notes that the advantages M. obtained were extended to him under the authority of the prosecution service and that the prosecution service is organised in Slovakia as a single hierarchy (see paragraph 28 above). This presupposes a degree of coordination, which in the present case is further suggested by a certain personal overlap in the form of the involvement of \u0160., the prosecutor in the various proceedings (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 24 above).
