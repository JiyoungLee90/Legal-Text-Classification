Noting that the Ministry's letter of 20 April 2000 had been proof of the fact that he and his family had settled there as IDPs from Abkhazia on the basis of a ministerial ordinance, the court found that his possession of the cottage had been legitimate. The court further reasoned that section 7 \u00a7 3 of the Act of 28\u00a0June 1996 on Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees (\u201cthe IDPs Act\u201d) prohibited eviction of IDPs already in accommodation, unless (a) an agreement had been reached with them, (b) alternative accommodation had been offered, (c) the eviction had been made necessary by acts of nature and adequate compensation had been provided for, or (d) the IDPs had occupied the disputed premises vexatiously, without any lawful basis. In so far as none of the above-mentioned conditions had been met in the first applicant's case, the court reasoned that the eviction of 1 November 2004 had been unlawful. The District Court also criticised the respondent Ministry for taking the cottage without any legal decision, on the sole basis of the Minister's oral instruction. It pointed out that, pursuant to Article\u00a051 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 2 of the General Administrative Code, an administrative act such as a ministerial order could be issued orally only in urgent situations and should be followed by a written copy within three days; this had not occurred in the present case.

Legitimacy meant that possession had to have been exercised on a lawful basis. However, since the first applicant had failed to produce a legal decision of the relevant authority authorising his occupation of the cottage in 1994, his ensuing possession could not be considered to have been exercised in good faith. As to the respondent Ministry's letter of 20 April 2000, the Supreme Court refused to accept it as a valid document, reasoning that, by virtue of Decree no. 487 issued by the President of Georgia on 8 September 1997, only the Ministry of State Property Management had been competent to enter into such transactions with private individuals. The Supreme Court further stated that only the Ministry of Resettlement of Refugees and IDPs (\u201cthe Ministry of IDPs\u201d) was competent to accommodate IDPs under section\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the IDPs Act.

Acknowledging that the cottage had been transferred to the first applicant's possession in 1994 by a decision of the then Minister of the Interior, the letter stated that the possession in question had \u201crecently become unlawful\u201d. Consequently, the Ministry had decided to reclaim possession of its cottage, but the first applicant had refused to cooperate. Eventually, after several unsuccessful attempts, the Ministry, acting through the police, had persuaded the second applicant and the Saghinadze family's relatives to vacate the cottage, in the absence of the first applicant. The letter emphasised that the eviction had not been forcible but, on the contrary, had been voluntary and peaceful, and that the second applicant had been able to take her personal belongings with her on eviction. As to the remaining movables in the cottage, including poultry and small livestock, the Ministry's letter stated that the applicants had been invited to retrieve them on more than one occasion and could still do so. The letter noted that, subsequent to the eviction of 1 November 2004, the cottage had been sealed in order to prevent its being looted. It was also noted that the actual value of the cottage was GEL 45,541.69\u00a0(EUR\u00a019,630).",

A legitimate result of this was, for instance, that the domestic courts limited the scope of their judgment in the proceedings for recovery of possession to the first applicant's legal situation, without pronouncing on the rights of the remaining five applicants (see paragraph 23 above and, conversely, Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28, 48-50 and 125, ECHR\u00a02007XII, and P., C. and S., cited above).",

Thus, for example, only the second applicant was the direct victim of the alleged ill-treatment during the eviction on\u00a01\u00a0November 2004 (see paragraph 86 below). Furthermore, it is not entirely clear whether the cottage could be said to have constituted a home, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, for all the applicants, as not all of them had retained equally strong links with the place prior to its loss (see paragraphs 13 and 30 above and compare with Zehentner v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a020082/02, \u00a7 52 and 53, ECHR 2009...). The Court is also unsure as to the sixth applicant's standing in the present case. It is unclear whether she also claims to have had possession rights over the cottage and its premises, or whether her complaint is limited to the unlawful occupation of her registered land by the Ministry of the Interior between 1\u00a0November 2004 and 14 March 2005. In any event, she never voiced the latter grievance before the domestic courts. All in all, the Court considers that the participation of each of the applicants in the domestic proceedings would have promoted the interests of further factual clarity and legal certainty before both the domestic authorities and the Court (compare Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39, ECHR 2004III, and \u00c7elikbilek v. Turkey (dec.), no. 27693/95, 22 June 1999).",

If they had really wished to designate the first applicant as their representative, a more appropriate course of action would have been to provide him with an authority rather than relying informally on his status as head of the family. That simple formality would have made it clear to both the domestic authorities and the Court that the complaints about the taking of the cottage were being raised by the first applicant on behalf of the remaining five applicants also (see Khamidov, the paragraphs cited above). It should be reiterated, in that connection, that Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention has to operate with a degree of deference to domestic formalities, in particular when, as in the case at hand, considerations of legal certainty are at stake (see, for example, \u0130lhan v.

The Court observes the existence of the ministerial order of 29 October 1993, which explicitly stated that the Ministry was authorised to use the cottage for the purpose of housing staff members displaced from Abkhazia; this corresponded exactly to the first applicant's situation (see paragraphs 9 and 38 above). However, even assuming that there existed a more appropriate formal procedure for the transfer of the cottage to the first applicant, which was an ordinary private-law transaction and did not concern matters of vital public interest, this omission on the part of the Ministry cannot be attributed to the first applicant or allow a conclusion that he settled in the cottage vexatiously (see Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 39 and 40, 24 June 2003). Of further importance in that regard is the historical context in which the relevant facts of the case took place. Hence, the Court shares the first applicant's opinion that, in view of the humanitarian crisis prevailing in Georgia in 1993-1994, when around 300,000 displaced persons from Abkhazia needed to be urgently accommodated by central Government, it would have been hardly realistic to expect the authorities to meticulously follow the administrative formalities in all such housing transactions.",

Of paramount importance in that regard, according to the Court's relevant case-law, was the authorities' own manifest tolerance of the first applicant's exclusive, uninterrupted and open use of the cottage and the adjacent premises for more than ten years. Thus, during that period, the first applicant installed and planted various fixtures, fruit trees and vegetables, and started keeping poultry and small livestock; he was also able to accommodate eight of his displaced relatives, without applying for additional permission from the State; the State never objected to the socio-economic and family environment established by the first applicant (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z\u00a0v.

The most conspicuous and authoritative amongst these was the IDPs Act, which recognised that an IDP's possession of a dwelling in good faith constituted a right of a pecuniary nature. Thus, it was not possible to evict an IDP against his or her will from an occupied dwelling without offering in exchange either similar accommodation or appropriate monetary compensation. The Supreme Court of Georgia, in its judgment of 28 November 2001 in the case of Khintibidze and Others, confirmed that an IDP's temporary dwelling, even where the person concerned had no registered property title to it, represented an asset protected under the rules of possession contained in the Civil Code (see paragraph 69 above).",

The Court cannot understand why, after he had lived there peacefully with his family for more than ten years, the first applicant's occupation of the cottage should suddenly have become such a burning issue. Moreover, the Minister should have re-issued his order in written form within three days, pursuant to Article 51 \u00a7 3 of the General Administrative Code; he did not do so in the present case. Be that as it may, considerations as to the form of the ministerial order are merely incidental. What really matters for the Court is that the Ministry took the cottage from the first applicant without a court authorisation obtained through fair and adversarial proceedings.",

The courts further overlooked the fact that the applicant's dispossession and eviction had been carried out contrary to the relevant domestic law (see the findings above, paragraphs 111-112). Yet, as noted by the firstinstance court and the dissenting judges at both the appeal and cassation instances, such a finding was apparently indispensable for the recognition of the first applicant's right to regain his possession under Article 160 in fine of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 26, 37 and 44 above).",

In particular, the Supreme Court of Georgia stated, in its final decision of 27\u00a0September 2006, that the first applicant could not rely on the relevant housing guarantee contained in the IDPs Act, in so far as he had not been settled in the cottage by the Ministry of IDPs, the agency directly in charge of such matters (see paragraph 43 above). The Court regrets this formalistic interpretation of the IDPs Act, the very spirit of which was, on the contrary, to confirm IDPs' rights, including the right to accommodation, vis-\u00e0-vis the State as a whole rather than any of its executive agencies in particular. It is evident that, by adopting the IDPs Act, the Georgian State aimed to alleviate, in so far as possible, the plight of homeless and destitute IDPs. This laudable undertaking was, incidentally, in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (see paragraphs 67 and 70 above; see also Do\u011fan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0154). The Court points out in this connection that it is not uncommon for other member States who have experienced massive migrations of population due to military conflicts to pass legislation aimed at the creation of similar housing guarantees for IDPs and refugees being accommodated on a temporary basis (see Radanovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 9056/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 29, 4546 and 49, 21 December 2006, and Akimova v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a019853/03, \u00a7\u00a7 21-25 and 47-48, 27\u00a0September 2007).",

However, even assuming that there exist grounds for questioning that evidence, the Court notes that the first applicant was not arrested on that basis alone (see paragraph\u00a054 above). Rather, his arrest and custody pending trial were based mostly on the second episode, which related to the fabrication of evidence, ill-treatment of a person and other abuses of power committed in public office. The second episode was based on the victim's incriminating statements as well as on other relevant information collected by the PGO in the course of its investigation into the Kaladze case (see paragraphs 56-57 above). Having due regard to the relevant case materials, the Court considers that, at least as far as the second episode was concerned, there existed relevant information which would satisfy an objective observer that the impugned offences in public office had been committed when the first applicant was remanded in custody (compare Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.

I wish to draw attention to the fact that the first applicant was granted the disputed cottage for the purposes of his service as a high-ranking official of the Abkhazian Ministry of the Interior (see paragraphs 8 and 104). This fact, in normal circumstances, should have meant that the applicant could use the cottage while discharging his official functions in the abovementioned Ministry.

I accept the arguments developed by the Chamber in paragraph 105 and I further note that there was a clear legal obligation on the State to accommodate and protect internally displaced persons in view of the humanitarian crisis prevailing in  in 1993 to 1994. Taking into account the Chamber's arguments set out in paragraph 107 that the State, by passing various legal acts, confirmed IDPs' rights in the housing sector and established solid guarantees for their protection, I consider that such a clearly established legal obligation on the State to protect IDPs' rights, including the right to accommodation, creates for them a clear pecuniary dimension protected under Article\u00a01 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01.",

Switzerland, 25 March 1998, \u00a7\u00a059, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II).
