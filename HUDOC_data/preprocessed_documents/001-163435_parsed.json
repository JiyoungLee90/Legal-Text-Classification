He alleged that at the trial he had initially denied his guilt and pointed out what he believed to be gaps and inconsistencies in the prosecution\u2019s case. However, he had then pleaded guilty because of pressure from the trial judge and because he had wished to be released sooner and had no funds to pay for a lawyer. No prosecutor had been present at his trial and in these circumstances he had not been convinced of the judge\u2019s impartiality or that there had been a fair examination of evidence. When the judge had assured him that he would receive a lenient sentence if he pleaded guilty, he had followed the judge\u2019s instructions.

The Court has recognised that an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, and in most cases this can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure that an accused\u2019s right not to incriminate himself is respected. The Court emphasises that the fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance (see Dvorski v.

Furthermore, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2006II). In particular, for a waiver to be effective it must be shown that the applicant could reasonably have foreseen the consequences of his conduct (see, mutatis mutandis, Idalov v. Russia [GC], no.\u00a05826/03, \u00a7 173, 22 May 2012). The right to counsel, being a fundamental right among those which constitute the notion of a fair trial and ensuring the effectiveness of the rest of the guarantees set forth in Article 6 of the Convention, is a prime example of those rights which require the special protection of the \u201cknowing and intelligent waiver\u201d standard established in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Dvorski, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

As far as I know the opposite situation might be problematic from an Article 6 perspective, if the applicant were absent from the hearing while the prosecutor was present. The Chamber found in the situation complained of a crucial contradiction that led it to find a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 3 (c).",
