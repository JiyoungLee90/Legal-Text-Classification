There is no evidence, apart from the parties\u2019 conflicting statements, as to the origin and scope of the incident. It is noteworthy, however, that M. admitted that it was him who had approached the second applicant (see paragraph 10 above). Furthermore, it is confirmed by medical documents that shortly after that incident the second applicant was diagnosed with hematomata on her neck, concussion and situational neurosis. Moreover, forensic medical experts stated that those injuries could have been inflicted on her at the time and in the circumstances she alleged (see paragraphs\u00a021 and 25 above). The Court therefore considers that the circumstances of the present case disclose sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences in support of the\u00a0second applicant\u2019s allegation of her ill-treatment by the police officer M.
