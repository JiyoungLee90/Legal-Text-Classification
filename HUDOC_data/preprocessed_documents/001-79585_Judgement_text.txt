The case originated in an application (no. 6690/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Hungarian nationals, Mr Bálint Minda, Mr Lajos Nagy, Mr István Keller, Mr Zoltán Minda and Mr László Minda. They introduced the application in the name of the applicant company as its managers and/or shareholders, on 15 June 2001.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement. The applicant company was represented by Mr G. Havas and Mr I. Barbalics, lawyers practising in  and Nagyatád, respectively.
On 13 September 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible, with the complaints of the five individual applicants being rejected. The application was retained in respect of the applicant company, whose complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, the Court decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the remaining application at the same time.
The individual applicants have since requested the Court to accept the cession of that part of the application involving the applicant company to them personally. However, the Court rejected this demand on 6 February 2007.
The applicant is a limited liability company, founded in 1989, with its seat in . It is currently in the process of being wound up.
In 1991 an action was brought against the applicant company by an entity called Pesterzsébeti Papírgyár Leányvállalat which claimed to be the successor of PV Pesterzsébeti Papírgyár, one of the applicant company’s shareholders. The plaintiff sought inter alia the invalidation of the registration of the applicant company, claiming that the Articles of Association were against the law.
In its final decision of 28 May 1993, the Supreme Court held that the Articles of Association had been in force until the day of its decision, but were void thereafter. It ordered the winding-up of the applicant company.
Consequently, on 7 September 1993 the Court of Registration ordered the representative of the applicant company to submit the name, address and authorisation of a liquidation manager (végelszámoló). Despite the representative’s failure to comply with this order, on 30 November 1993 the Court of Registration declared the applicant company’s dissolution as of 28 May 1993, and registered the fact that it was in the process of winding-up.
On appeal, on 6 June 1995 the Supreme Court, sitting as a second-instance court, quashed this decision and remitted the case to the Court of Registration, holding that it had delivered its decision despite the representative’s failure to provide the requisite information.
In the resumed proceedings, on 12 December 1995 the Court of Registration appointed a liquidation manager and declared the retroactive dissolution of the applicant company, as of 28 May 1993. On 6 February 1996 it ordered that corresponding entries be made in the companies register. On 29 October 1996 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of 12 December 1995. A further appeal was dismissed on 7 February 1997.
On 15 June 1998, 14 June 1999 and 19 December 2005, the respective liquidation managers were consecutively replaced.
Meanwhile, in reaction to various appeals and requests for supplementation or rectification, amendments were made to the order of 28 May 1993 on 16 July, and 1 and 17 September 1999. On 26 January 2000 the judges of the Budapest Court of Registration declared themselves biased. Subsequently, the Pest County Court of Registration was appointed to deal with the case. On 17 April and 30 May 2000 respectively, this court ordered that the decisions of 12 December 1995 and 6 February 1996 be amended. On 21 September 2001 the Supreme Court, sitting as a second-instance court, dismissed the applicant company’s appeal filed against a procedural order of 12 July 1999.
On 11 May 2005 the Pest County Directorate of the Tax Authority initiated execution proceedings against the applicant company.

The  held hearings on 28 November 1995, 24 January, 21 May, 16 October and 27 November 1996. On 13 October 1997 it requested a further supplementation of the applicant company’s claims. The latter complied with the order on 3 November 1997. On 25 November 1997 an expert engineer was appointed.
On 25 March 1998 the court, upon the parties’ request, stayed the proceedings. On 2 November 1998 the proceedings resumed. Further hearings took place on 11 December 1998, 21 April and 30 June 1999, 22 March 2000 and 17 January 2001.
On 15 September 2001 the applicant company submitted a motion for bias against the . The Supreme Court rejected the motion on 11 January 2002. On 28 January 2003 the winding-up manager submitted a motion for bias against the presiding judge which was rejected on 11 February 2003.

Meanwhile, in February 1995 the applicant company instituted another set of proceedings against the Pesterzsébeti Papírgyár Kft., the successor of the respondent in the 1992 proceedings (“the 1995 proceedings”).
On 20 March 1995 and 28 November 1995, the court held hearings. At the latter date, it invited the parties to submit preparatory documents. They complied with the order on 16 January and 23 January 1996, respectively. On 21 May 1996, and 19 June and September 1997, the court held further hearings.
On 25 November 1997 and 22 March 2000, the court appointed technical experts who submitted their opinions on 23 April 1998 and 8 September 2000, respectively.
Meanwhile, on 11 December 1998 another hearing took place and the proceedings were suspended. On 31 August 1999 the applicant company requested the court to continue the proceedings. On 17 January 2001 the court held a hearing and again suspended the proceedings.
On 27 August 2001 the applicant company lodged a motion for bias against the court which was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 11 January 2002. In November 2003 these proceedings were joined to the 1991 and 1992 proceedings.

In 1995 Pesterzsébeti Papírgyár Kft. filed a motion for the protection of possessions with the . On 8 November 1995 the motion was rejected. Subsequently, on 23 August 1995 the complainant brought an action in trespass against Castell Ltd., which claimed to be the successor of the applicant company, and other defendants, including the applicant company itself.
In its order of 26 February 1996, the Budapest XX/XXI/XXIII District Court stated that the applicant company had been dissolved and had therefore no capacity to conduct legal proceedings. It requested the plaintiff to provide the court with the name of the applicant company’s liquidation manager.
On 29 October 1996 the Court of Registration informed the District Court that Castell Ltd. was not a registered company.

On 1 March 1999 the District Court ordered the defendants to clarify the relation between the applicant company and Castell Ltd. In reply, the court was informed that the applicant company “had changed its name to Castell Ltd.” on 29 August 1992; however, the changes had not been registered by the Court of Registration.
On 25 May 1999 the District Court discontinued the proceedings against Castell Ltd., but not against the applicant company, whose winding-up was in progress. Subsequently, extensive correspondence developed between the parties and the court concerning the service of this decision and the capacity of the applicant company and Castell Ltd. to conduct legal proceedings. In the course of these events, the applicant company repeatedly submitted to the court that the two entities were one and the same, but in vain.
Subsequently, the District Court suspended the proceedings until the termination of the proceedings described in chapter “A” above. On 16 July 2003 the defendants complained of this decision.

On 28 May 2003 the applicant company complained of this decision. On 10 July 2003 the District Court dismissed the complaint. On 16 July 2003 the applicant company appealed.

Subsequently, a manager employed by the plaintiff withdrew the action, and the proceedings were discontinued on 22 May 1991. This decision was not served on the applicant company.
On 9 March 2004 the applicant company requested proper service of the decision. On 10 September 2004 the Szeged Court of Appeal observed that the manager in question had not been entitled to act on behalf of the plaintiff, which in any case had ceased to exist in 1997. Consequently, the proceedings had to be declared as having been interrupted (félbeszakadt) as of 10 December 1997.
On 28 September 2004 the applicant company requested the  to proceed with the case, in order to obtain a proper order to discontinue and finally terminate the interrupted proceedings. On 30 May 2005 the  dismissed the request. The applicant company’s appeal was to no avail.
