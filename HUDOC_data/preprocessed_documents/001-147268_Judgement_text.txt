The case originated in an application (no. 72262/12) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Gábor Nagy (“the applicant”), on 5 November 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr T. Borsos, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 31 January 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Budapest.
On 17 April 2007 the applicant was questioned as suspect on charges of theft.
On 25 June 2008 the Budapest XIV/XVI District Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant for theft.
On 14 October 2011 the Pest Central District Court acquitted the applicant.
The first-instance judgment was upheld on appeal by the Budapest High Court on 8 October 2012. This judgment was served on the applicant on 19 October 2012.
