Since there is no causal link between the violation found and the damage alleged, the Court rejects these claims. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damage as a result of emotional suffering due to \u201clack of subsistence funds\u201d is sufficiently linked to the lengthy duration of the proceedings at issue. Therefore, the Court awards him EUR 3,200 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

As to the costs and expenses claimed in respect of the domestic proceedings, the Court notes that such costs were not incurred in order to seek through the domestic legal order prevention and redress of the alleged violation complained of before the Court (see Milo\u0161evi\u0107 v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a015056/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 20 April 2006).
