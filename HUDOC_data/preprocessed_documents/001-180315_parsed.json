As regards the first half of the fee paid to the applicant, in particular, the court observed that the Ministry had not claimed that the contract it had concluded with the applicant had been cancelled and found that the first half of the fee paid could not be considered as damages. The court held, however, that the applicant owed the Ministry the amount of BGN 4,648 (about EUR 2,300) by way of penalty because during the arbitration proceedings he had omitted to transmit to the Ministry a request by the arbitrator that the original of a document be submitted to the latter. The penalty agreed in the contract between the Ministry and the applicant was payable in the event of the failure of the applicant to comply with his obligations and the Ministry did not need to prove that it had incurred any loss as a result of the applicant\u2019s conduct. The court therefore allowed the Ministry\u2019s claim for the amount of BGN 5,102.88, which corresponded to BGN 4,648 by way of penalty and BGN 418.88 for case-related costs. Since the Ministry\u2019s claim did not mention the balance of the fee due to the applicant, at no point did the court examine in that judgment whether the second half of the payment of the legal fee agreed in the contract was due to him following its conclusion.",

The contract was a non-judicial title which gave him the right under domestic law to seek payment of the sum indicated therein when contractual conditions were fulfilled (see paragraphs 18-19 above). In accordance with the relevant procedure, the applicant submitted the writ to the Ministry and asked to be paid (see paragraph 9 above). Significantly, the Ministry did not challenge the writ, although it could have done so under Article 244 of the 1952 Code had it considered that payment of the balance was not due at that point in time (see paragraph 21 above). Moreover, the Ministry did not bring a claim under Article 97 \u00a7 1 of the same Code, despite this possibility having been open to it if it was of the view that it did not owe the money claimed by the applicant (see paragraph 23 above).",

As is evident from the facts, in those proceedings the Ministry did not challenge the validity of the contract as a whole or of any of its provisions, nor did they contest the balance of the fee which the applicant had already claimed was due to him and which is the subject of the present case (see paragraph 11 above).

In all other respects, the Sofia City Court found that the applicant had complied with his contractual obligations, refused the Ministry repayment of the first half of his fee and made no reference to the balance. In order to collect payment of that balance the applicant had needed to be issued with a writ of enforcement and to submit it to the Ministry; both of which he had done. Since the writ had not been invalidated and the applicant had complied with the relevant domestic procedure to seek the payment due (see paragraph 9 above), the Court has no choice other than to find that payment became due on 24 February 2006 when the writ of enforcement was served to the Ministry. It appears from the documents in the file that he has never been paid for the balance of his legal fee.",
