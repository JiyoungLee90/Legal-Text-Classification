It concluded that there was not a sufficiently established link between the accident and most of the damage alleged. In assessing non-pecuniary damage, the court had regard to the circumstances of the accident, the subsequent conduct of the parties and the relevant case-law of the Celle Court of Appeal. It pointed out that the length of the proceedings could be taken into account only in small measure because the defendant could not be held responsible for the fact that the applicant had not brought his claim until seven years after the accident, making it more difficult to adduce evidence, that he had refused to allow the file from the proceedings in the Social Court of Appeal to be used in evidence, and that he had objected on several occasions to the choice of experts appointed.",

The Federal Court of Justice, for its part, has to date left open the question whether, in exceptional cases and with due regard to constitutional law, a special complaint may be allowed in respect of arbitrary inaction that could be construed as a denial of justice on the part of a lower court (see the decisions of 21 November 1994 (no.

More recent decisions have clarified the consequences of a complaint alleging inaction. For example, in two decisions of 24 July 2003 (nos. 16 WF 50/03 and 51/03) the Karlsruhe Court of Appeal allowed such a remedy not only where there had been unjustifiable inactivity amounting to a denial of justice, but also where the delay complained of was likely to be prejudicial to a parent claiming parental responsibility, or to the child\u2019s well-being. It observed that it could not take the place of the family court, even if this was the most efficient manner of proceeding. Nor could it impose a procedural timetable on the lower court, since unforeseen circumstances might arise. The action it could take was limited to calling on the court to expedite the proceedings as much as possible. However, to give more substance to its order, it set the court deadlines for dealing with an objection to an expert, for giving the expert six weeks in which to produce his report or, otherwise, appointing a new one, for interviewing the parents and child and for arranging a hearing. The Naumburg Court of Appeal delivered a similar decision on the same subject on 20 December 2004 (no.\u00a014 WF 234/04). In other cases courts of appeal have given decisions in place of the lower courts on account of the delays observed and in so far as the case was ready for decision (decisions of the Zweibr\u00fccken Court of Appeal (10 September 2002, no. 4 W 65/02), the Naumburg Court of Appeal (19 July 2004, no. 14 WF 38/04) and the Cologne Labour Court of Appeal (9 June 2004, no. 3 Ta 185/04)).",

Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 183 and 186, and Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 77).",

In another case dealt with by the Court, in which the Federal Constitutional Court had ordered the proceedings to be expedited while not finding their length to be unconstitutional, the lower court took a further period of more than ten months to complete its examination, and the proceedings as a whole ended two and a half years after the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s order (see Herbolzheimer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 38). In that case, concerning proceedings that had lasted nine years and eight months, the Court, moreover, found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, whereas the Federal Constitutional Court had declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, finding that the length of the proceedings (almost nine years by that stage) had not yet reached an intolerable level (see paragraph 67 above).",

The Federal Court of Justice has yet to give a ruling on the admissibility of such a remedy. As regards the consequences where such a complaint has been declared admissible, the Court notes that the Government have merely stated, citing four cases in support of their position, that the appellate court may order the continuation of the proceedings before the lower court, without giving any further details about the content of such orders or their effect on the proceedings in issue. As regards the fact that certain courts of appeal have chosen to give detailed indications of ways of speeding up the proceedings or have themselves given a decision in place of the lower court (see paragraph 72 above), the Court observes that only four such courts have delivered decisions to that effect, none of them before the application in the present case was lodged in November 1999, whereas the effectiveness of a particular remedy is normally assessed with reference to the date of the application (see, for example, Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, 22 May 2001; Nogolica v. Croatia (dec.), no. 77784/01, ECHR 2002-VIII; and Mari\u00ebn v. Belgium (dec.), no. 46046/99, 24 June 2004). Moreover, the somewhat general nature of the findings reached by the full  (see paragraph 70 above) tends to suggest, although the decision in question solely concerned the right to be heard by a court, that an unwritten remedy with variable admissibility criteria is likely to be problematic in terms of constitutional law.",

However, a single final judicial decision \u2013 given, moreover, at first instance \u2013 is not sufficient to satisfy the Court that there was an effective remedy available in theory and in practice (see Rezette v. Luxembourg, no.\u00a073983/01, \u00a7 27, 13 July 2004; Mari\u00ebn, cited above; and Gama da Costa v. Portugal, no. 12659/87, Commission decision of 5 March 1990, DR 65, p. 136). Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s application to the civil courts for legal aid in order to bring an action for damages was refused on the ground, inter alia, that there had not been any unjustified delays in the proceedings. In any event, even if the relevant courts were to conclude that there had been a breach of judicial duties on account of delays rendering proceedings excessively long, they would not be able to make any award in respect of non-pecuniary damage, whereas, as the Court has previously observed, in cases concerning the length of civil proceedings the applicants above all sustain damage under that head (see Hartman, cited above, \u00a7 68, and Lukenda, cited above, \u00a7 59; see also Scordino, cited above, \u00a7 204, and Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7 95). The decision of the Munich I Regional Court (see paragraph 74 above) is a telling example of this shortcoming, since the applicant in that case obtained only partial reimbursement of the legal costs he had necessarily incurred in lodging the complaint alleging inaction.",
