In those circumstances, any subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against him would not have affected the core of the matter underlying his complaint under the Convention because he had already spent a significant period of time in detention. Accordingly, the Court is unable to find that a lack of information about further extensions to the applicant\u2019s detention and his conviction would have had a decisive influence on its judgment, or have prevented it from ruling on the case (see Kalinin v. Russia [Committee], no.\u00a054749/12, \u00a7\u00a7 18-21, 19 February 2015). It finds the Government\u2019s argument without merit and of no legal consequence to the proceedings.",
