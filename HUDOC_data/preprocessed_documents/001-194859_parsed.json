The letter asked the applicants\u2019 representative to check the application form and either send a revised version or make corrections to the one already sent to the Court. Subsequently, on 30 October 2013 the applicants\u2019 lawyer sent a new application form which was corrected according to the rules. The facts submitted by the applicants and the allegations of breaches of the Convention made in the application form of 18 September 2012 remained unchanged in the one sent on 30 October 2013. In those circumstances, the Court does not find any reason to accept the Government\u2019s objection and considers that 18 September 2012, the date of submission of the first application form, authorisation forms and supporting documents, should be taken as the date the present application was lodged.",

In that connection, the Court reiterates that the notion of a \u201cwitness\u201d is an autonomous concept in the Convention system, irrespective of the classifications in domestic legal systems. As such, the guarantees provided by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply to a deposition which may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction (see Luc\u00e0 v.\u00a0Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2001II). As the Court held in Butkevich v.\u00a0Russia (no. 5865/07, \u00a7 98, 13 February 2018) there is no material difference between a deposition given by a \u201cwitness\u201d, for instance, and a report issued by a police officer for the attention of his superior. In view of the above case-law, the Court considers that the police officers in the instant case should be considered as \u201cwitnesses\u201d, particular regard being had to the fact that it was the trial court which summoned them to give evidence in their capacity as witnesses to the offences with which the applicants were charged in view of the conflicting accounts of the factual circumstances of the case (see Mesesnel v. Slovenia, no. 22163/08, \u00a7 37, 28 February 2013).",

They stated that they had been notified that the date of the hearing was 1 June 2010 and that they would not be able to attend the hearing on 24 June 2010 given that they were stationed at \u015e\u0131rnak, which was far away, and would be on duty on that date.

In that connection, the Court observes that all the evidence used by the Assize Court for concluding that the applicants had chanted slogans and thrown stones at the police came from police officers who had been on duty during the riots of 5 December 2009 and who had arrested the applicants (see Butkevich, cited above, \u00a7 94). More importantly, there is no tangible or corroborative evidence, beyond that of the police officers, capable of proving that the applicants had chanted slogans or thrown stones at the police (see Butkevich, cited above, \u00a7 99, and Da\u015ftan v. Turkey, no.\u00a037272/08, \u00a7\u00a027, 10\u00a0October 2017). This is because the remaining evidence in the case file, that is to say the statements of O.E. and Y.T., the photographs of the second applicant and the banners found in the shed where the applicants were arrested, are not sufficient to conclude that the applicants had chanted slogans or been involved in throwing stones. In particular, it appears that the only proof supporting the contention that the applicants had chanted slogans and threw stones at the police was the statements made by police officers A.A.K. and G.\u0130. Moreover, the second applicant is not shown throwing stones in any of the four photographs (see paragraph 9 above), and there is no photograph of the first applicant at all.",

Spain, 6\u00a0December 1988, \u00a7 78, Series A no. 146). Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (Sadak and\u00a0Others v. Turkey (no. 1), nos. 29900/96 and 3 others, ECHR\u00a02001VIII). This is so because Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument, which is a clear indication of the principle of immediacy in the criminal proceedings (see Pereira Cruz and Others v.\u00a0Portugal, nos.\u00a056396/12 and 3 others, \u00a7 177, 26 June 2018).",

Nevertheless, the trial court did not summon the applicants or their lawyer with a view to providing them with an opportunity to exercise their defence rights, although it did inform the public prosecutor, thereby securing his appearance (compare Papadakis v.\u00a0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 50254/07, \u00a7\u00a091, 26\u00a0February 2013). The Court observes that such a practice is contrary to the clear wording of Article 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which stipulates that, inter alios, the accused and his or her lawyer must be notified of the date on which a witness is to be examined. The Government did not comment on this point. In the Court\u2019s view, the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court\u2019s approach raises a conspicuous procedural shortcoming in relation to the principle of equality of arms as it prevented one of the parties to a criminal case, the applicants who were facing heavy prison sentences, from being present to effectively challenge the decisive evidence given by the police officers in their capacity as witnesses.",

It is true that according to the transcript of the hearing held on 24 June 2010, the police officers\u2019 statements were read out and the applicants had the opportunity to question their veracity. However, on that day the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court took no decision on the request of the applicants and their coaccused to reissue a summons for the police officers to give evidence in their presence (see paragraph 19 above).
