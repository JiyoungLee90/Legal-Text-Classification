According to the Government, the manner in which the Supreme Court had determined the value of the dispute was regulated under the rules of the Civil Procedure Act, which provided that if a civil action against the same defendant entailed several claims (\u201cobjective cumulation of claims\u201d), the domestic court assessed whether the claims arose from the same or different facts and legal bases. If the claims arose from the same facts and legal basis (\u201cqualified objective cumulation\u201d), the value of the dispute was determined by the court adding up all the amounts in controversy and determining a unique amount that became the correct value of the dispute in respect of the admissibility of an appeal on points of law on ratione valoris grounds. If the claims arose from different facts and legal bases (\u201cregular objective cumulation\u201d), the value of the dispute was set so that each claim had its own value within the dispute and the admissibility of the appeal on points of law was assessed for each claim individually. Therefore, in the applicant\u2019s case, the Supreme Court\u2019s task had been to establish whether the civil action at issue represented a regular or qualified objective cumulation of claims and, in accordance with unwavering and established case-law, the Supreme Court had found that section 37 (2) of the Civil Procedure Act had to be applied. The Government stressed that it was not the Court\u2019s task to interpret and apply the relevant rules of procedural or substantive domestic law, namely to act as a court of fourth instance.",

It means that the machinery for the protection of fundamental rights established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos.\u00a017153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7 69, 25 March 2014, and Gherghina v.\u00a0Romania [GC] (dec.), no. 42219/07, \u00a7 83, 9 July 2015). In accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted. The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Gherghina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a084; Hentrich v. France, 22\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 296-A; Remli v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II; and Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], no.\u00a037685/10, \u00a7 117, 20 March 2018). Thus, a complaint submitted to the Court should first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 72). To hold otherwise would not be compatible with the subsidiary character of the Convention system (see\u00a0Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 42, 6 November 2008).",

Malta (dec.), no.\u00a027023/03, 28 June 2005). To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs and must offer reasonable prospects of success (see Balogh, cited above, \u00a7 30, and Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.56581/00, \u00a7 46, 1 March 2006). If there exists at the national level a remedy enabling the domestic courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of a violation of a given Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. It is not sufficient for the applicant to have unsuccessfully exercised another remedy which could have overturned the impugned measure on other grounds not connected with the complaint of a violation of a Convention right. It is the Convention complaint which must have been aired at the national level for there to have been exhaustion of \u201ceffective remedies\u201d. It would be contrary to the subsidiary character of the Convention machinery if an applicant, ignoring a possible Convention argument, could rely on some other ground before the national authorities for challenging an impugned measure, but then lodge an application before the Court on the basis of the Convention argument (see Van Oosterwijck v.\u00a0Belgium, no. 7654/76, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, 6 November 1980).",

Furthermore, the Court notes that even the amount initially indicated by the claimant was above the threshold (see paragraphs 8 and 17 above), so that the withdrawal of the objection did not have any effect on whether the stated value was above the threshold. The Court also observes that the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision with the Constitutional Court. She complained, inter alia, under Article 29 of the Constitution that the claimant\u2019s civil action had two aspects which could not be separated from one another and that therefore the Supreme Court\u2019s decision finding that the case concerned two separate claims had been manifestly unreasonable and had deprived her of access to court. Moreover, Article 29 of the Constitution corresponds to Article 6 of the Convention, which is directly applicable in Croatia.

The right of access, namely the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect of this \u201cright to court\u201d (see, notably, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 28-36, Series A no. 18; and Zubac v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no.\u00a040160/12, \u00a7 76, 5 April 2018). However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations. These are permitted by implication, since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce the access which remains to an individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought (see, for example, Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a093; Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, \u00a7\u00a050, Reports 1996IV; and Zubac, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

He indicated the value of the dispute as HRK\u00a0110,000 (see\u00a0paragraphs 7 and 8 above). After the first and second-instance courts ruled in favour of the claimant, on 24 November 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (see paragraph\u00a013 above). On 27 May 2010 the Supreme Court declared the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris. It interpreted M.J.\u2019s civil action as two separate claims: one for the recognition of ownership, and the other for obtaining an order allowing him to record his ownership in the land register, namely the issuance of a clausula intabulandi (see paragraph\u00a014 above). The Supreme Court thus divided the value of the dispute in half, and held that the amounts thus did not reach the necessary ratione valoris threshold of HRK\u00a0100,001 for an appeal on points of law to be admissible, as provided for under section 382 of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph\u00a017 above).",

However, at some point, notably from 1\u00a0February 2010 onwards, the Supreme Court started to change its interpretation of section 37(2) of the Civil Procedure Act in cases similar to that of the applicant, considering claims for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi as two claims. This interpretation appears to have remained the practice after 10 May 2010 (see paragraph 19 above).",

However, until 1\u00a0February 2010 the Supreme Court, in cases similar to that of the applicant, relying on section 37(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, considered civil actions for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi as a single claim (see paragraphs 19 and 43 of the judgment). In decision no.\u00a0807/08-2 of 1 February 2010, the Supreme Court departed \u2013 apparently for the first time \u2013 from its previous case-law, considering claims for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi as two separate claims (see paragraph 20 of the judgment). Less than three months later, in decision no. 339/08-2 of 29 April 2010, the Supreme Court again considered claims for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi as one claim (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). Then, on 10 May 2010, in decision no. Rev-1021/08-2, the Supreme Court reverted to holding that claims for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi were to be dealt with as two separate claims (see paragraph 20 of the judgment). After that decision, according to the case-law submitted by the Government, the Supreme Court continued to follow this approach (see paragraph 43 of the judgment). However, in none of these judgments did the Supreme Court announce and/or substantiate and provide reasons for the changes in its approach.",

However, it must not be overlooked that this jurisprudential development was not clear-cut and took place over a certain period (at least three and a half months), during which time the applicant\u2019s case was pending before the Supreme Court. During that time, only two decisions in line with the outcome of the applicant\u2019s case were apparently taken, and between them a conflicting decision had also been adopted. This reveals a chaotic approach by the Supreme Court in interpreting the requirements, laid down by law, for establishing the value of a dispute and, accordingly, the admissibility of an appeal on points of law. Consequently, it is not possible to suggest, as Government have, that the case-law applied in the present case was long-established at the relevant time (see paragraph\u00a039 of the judgment).

Malta (no. 37537/13, \u00a7\u00a0111, 12\u00a0January 2016) and Petro-M SRL and Rinax-TVR SRL v. Moldova ((dec.), no. 44787/05, \u00a7\u00a7 15- 21, 28 February 2017). The majority completely disregarded the fact that neither of these two cases dealt with possible undermining of the principle of legal certainty in the context of the right of effective access to a court. Borg (cited above) dealt with the Constitutional Court\u2019s reversal of its interpretation of the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 case-law, which, according to Dimech v. Malta (no. 34373/13, \u00a7\u00a068, 3\u00a0April 2015), relied upon by Borg, cannot by itself raise an issue of legal certainty at the domestic level. Petro-M SRL and Rinax-TVR SRL (cited above) dealt with the issue of lawfulness under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention, relying on Borg. However, the Moldovan case should be contrasted with Brezovec v. Croatia (no.\u00a013488/07, \u00a7\u00a7 59-68, 29\u00a0March 2011) and Saghinadze and Others v.

There, the Court found that rulings in which no reasonable explanation is given for the divergence from the existing caselaw are unforeseeable and smack of arbitrariness, and are accordingly unlawful. Thus, the jurisprudential value of the above two cases, relied upon by the majority as two exclusive authorities for resolution of the present case, is, as a minimum, doubtful.",

In fact, a failure to maintain a dynamic and evaluative approach would risk hindering reform or improvement which would be contrary to the proper administration of justice (see\u00a0Atanasovski v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 38, 14 January 2010). The Court has pointed out that there is no acquired right to consistency of case-law (see\u00a0Un\u00e9dic v. France, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a074, 18\u00a0December 2008). However, when departing from established case-law, in order to respect the principle of legal certainty as required by the rule of law (see\u00a0Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 61, ECHR 1999VII), courts must clearly reason their decisions to the extent to allow future claimants to reasonably foresee how the new legal developments may affect their case (see Tripcovici v. Montenegro, no. 80104/13, \u00a7 42, 7\u00a0November 2017; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a020190/92, \u00a7 34, 22\u00a0November 1995; Gorou v.

In this connection, one must note that in none of the decisions listed in paragraph 20 of the judgment did the Supreme Court give any explanation of the basis on which it had reached the conclusion that claims for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi stemmed from either different or identical legal and factual grounds. More specifically, it did not provide reasons for the departure from its earlier case-law (compare with Hoare, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056, and Atanasovski, cited above, \u00a7 38). The Supreme Court even failed to declare openly that it was departing from its established case-law. In this sense, the present case must be differentiated from the Hoare v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, specifically because in those cases the legal development which affected the claimants \u201chad reached a stage where judicial recognition of that development was reasonably foreseeable\u201d (see Hoare, cited above, \u00a7 54). Additionally, such foreseeability stemmed from clear judicial reasoning, since \u201c... courts may depart from their well-established case-law provided they give good and cogent reasons for doing so\u201d (ibid.).

Croatia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 66, 1 April 2010). This means, in particular, that the Court had to satisfy itself that the application of such a limitation could be regarded as foreseeable for the applicant, having regard to the relevant legislation and case-law and the particular circumstances of the case (see\u00a0Osu v. Italy, no. , \u00a7 35, 11 July 2002; Vrbica, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072; and Majski v. Croatia (no. 2), no. , \u00a7 69, 19 July 2011). In a recent Grand Chamber judgment, the Court emphasised that it attaches particular weight to whether the procedure to be followed for an appeal on points of law could be regarded as foreseeable from the point of view of the litigant. In order to satisfy foreseeability criterion with regard to a restriction on access to a superior court, a coherent domestic judicial practice and consistent application of that practice are important (see Zubac, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085, 87-89). As we have demonstrated in \u00a7\u00a05 above, the law was not being applied at the material time in a manner that could ensure foreseeability for the applicant. The chaotic approach taken by the Supreme Court, without any reasonable explanation as described above, prevented the applicant from foreseeing whether or not she fulfilled the statutory requirements for lodging an appeal on points of law. The restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to the Supreme Court thus fell short of the requirements set out by the Grand Chamber in its recent case-law.",
