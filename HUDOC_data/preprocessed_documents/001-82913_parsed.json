Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4 October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent extensions of the detention (see Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present one concerning organised crime groups, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other coaccused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is in the nature of things often particularly high. Indeed, in this context the Court notes that some members of the organised crime group have not yet been captured.",
