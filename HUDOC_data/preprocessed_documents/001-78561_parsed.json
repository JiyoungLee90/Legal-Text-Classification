In this regard, the court found that the reporting style used was typical for News, namely the use of special layout, highlighting certain words in bold or italics and adding pictures etc., which aimed at influencing the reader unconsciously. The first part of the article, including the passage at issue, might still be regarded as objective reporting when being assessed isolated. Furthermore, however, the subtitle of the subsequent passage, namely the word \u201cdastardly\u201d written in bold, caught the reader's eye and focused his mind in an unambiguous direction, incriminating the plaintiff. Even though the subsequent passage merely dealt with the contents of the law-suits, it conveyed to the reader that the plaintiff was in fact dastardly as some words were emphasised in italics and thereby attained independent significance. The court concluded that the article had not limited itself in objective citation. The first instance court had falsely classified the article as reporting on court proceedings as such reporting presumed the existence of court trials whereas in the present case there had only been a private prosecutors' action. When balancing the interests involved, i.e., the right to freedom of expression of the applicant company on the one hand, and the interest of the plaintiff not to be defamed, on the other, the court found in favour of the latter. It noted that even accepting that there was a public interest in the subject matter at issue, the allegation against the plaintiff, namely that he had a dastardly character without having provided any factual basis for this assertion, defamed him within the meaning of Article 111 of the Criminal Code and was worthless information for public debate. Therefore, it exceeded the limits of lawful criticism under Article 10 of the Convention. Thus, the interference with the applicant company's right to freedom of expression, namely the forfeiture of the above issue, was necessary and also proportionate to the aim pursued. This all the more as forfeiture concerned in general only older issues with no relation to the present actuality and with merely historical interest.",

Consequently, the quotation of parts of this letter also enjoyed the protection of Article 10. In addition, the applicant company did not make the objectionable statements itself but restricted itself to a careful quotation. As criminal proceedings against Mr Heller were at that time pending, this information was of public interest. The structure and wording of the article at issue were neutral. Reporting about pending court proceedings could only be informative if also the subject of these proceedings was mentioned. The domestic courts had interpreted the article at issue and the applicant company's possibility of justifying the quotation of the impugned statements narrowly and in breach with Article 10 of the Convention. The mere fact that a statement had to be considered as an offence within the meaning of the relevant legislation did not imply that a report about such a statement amounted ipso iure to an offence against a person's honour. The wording of section 33 of the Media Act was not in conformity with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention as it did not provide for protection of a correct quotation. The measure at issue constituted a punishment which nature remained unchanged irrespective of the severity of its consequences. It had suffered material damage from the order of forfeiture.",

In the present case, having carefully weighed the freedom of expression against the protection of the reputation of others, the second instance court set out comprehensively the arguments in favour of the application of section 33 of the Media Act. It rightly considered that the statement \u201cspiritually depraved\u201d amounted to an offence and violated the concerned person's right to reputation. Referring to case-law of the Court of Appeal, the Government asserted that the correct quotation of an insult of one person by another person was protected by Article\u00a010 of the Convention and did not justify forfeiture. In the present case, however, the applicant company had not reported about the pending defamation proceedings in a neutral way but had identified itself with the content of the quoted statements. The Government referred in this regard to the Court of Appeal's findings as regards the structure and style of the article and, furthermore, to the article's subtitle which wording between the lines in their opinion called the rejection of the reproach of being \u201cspiritually depraved\u201d into question. A victim's right would be almost completely void without an adequate protection against abuse of quotations, if a medium was free to publish and add to defamation by third persons. The applicant company had not been deprived of the possibility to inform the public about the fact that criminal proceedings against Mr Heller were pending. Finally, the forfeiture was principally a safeguarding measure containing elements of minor punishment.

The Court finds, however, that it is of particular relevance in the present case that the article did not make the objectionable statements itself but assisted in their further dissemination by quoting them. At this time the impugned statements had in fact already been widely disseminated as another newspaper had published Mr Heller's open letter some months ago. The applicant company quoted this letter in the context of its reportage about the then pending defamation proceedings against Mr Heller which, involving several FP\u00d6 politicians on the one hand and a well-known artist criticising them publicly on the other hand, was certainly a subject of public interest. The Court further recalls that the press' duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest extends to the reporting and commenting on court proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, News Verlags GmbH & Co.KG v. , no. 31457/96, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2000I, with further references). Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public has a right to receive them. This is all the more so where, like in the present case, the persons involved i.e. well-known politicians, have laid themselves open to public scrutiny (see mutatis mutandis Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. , no. 39394/98, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2003XI). The Court endorses the applicant company's and the first instance court's argument, that comprehensive reporting about the defamation proceedings at issue would have been considerably restricted without the possibility to inform the readers about the very subject of these proceedings .",

This is so, because it transpires from the Court's case law that the privileged position of newspapers is based on \u201cthe contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest\u201c (Jersild\u00a0v. Denmark, judgment of 23 September 1994, A 298, \u00a7\u00a035). Therefore, if the objectionable statements in the article in the newspaper Kurier were not in themselves protected by Article 10, neither the fact that the magazine had not made them, but \u201cassisted in their further dissemination by quoting them\u201d nor the fact that the statements had \u201calready been widely disseminated\u201d, as argued by the majority in para 30, is in my opinion relevant with regard to Article 10.

However, regard must in this respect be had to the nature of the statements. When evaluating the News' coverage of the defamation proceedings against Mr\u00a0Heller, it is in my opinion relevant that the statements which were quoted in the article were negative value judgments, not false factual allegations. This is so, because it must be assumed that the newspaper's rather critical approach to the defamation proceedings did not create additional damage to the persons described, as opposite to the situation if the quoted statements had contained factual allegations.

The phraseology used by the author was apparently and primarily meant to insult those persons, and as such \u2013 as a personal insult couched in demeaning words like \u201cseelenhygienisch heruntergekommen\u201d (spiritually depraved) and \u201cniedertr\u00e4chtig\u201d (dastardly) \u2013 should not enjoy the protection of Article\u00a010 of the Convention. As judges Matscher and Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson stated in their dissenting opinion in the Oberschlick (no. 2) case, \u201can insult can never be a value judgment\u201d (Oberschlick v.

Furthermore, in the latter case the Court was careful in tying its opinion on the proportionality (or rather the disproportionality) of the reaction to the insulting word \u201cTrottel\u201d (idiot) to the indignation knowingly aroused by the speech of a polititcian (loc. cit. para. 34). Would the Court have said the same if, as in the present case, the insulting words had been contained in an \u201copen letter\u201d congratulating the competent authority for having allowed the performance of somewhat spectacular actions which met with severe criticism by the public? (see para. 8 above).",
