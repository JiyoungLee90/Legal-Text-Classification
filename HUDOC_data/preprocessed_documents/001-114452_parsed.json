Since the third applicant had refused to give it back and the first applicant had threatened them with a gun, R. and O. had gone to the police station and lodged a complaint. According to O., the police officers showed the first applicant their identity documents but the latter refused to let them in, tried to grab G.\u2019s gun and started a fight. The second applicant arrived and started shouting. Following the noise, the neighbours came and the police officers asked them to call for reinforcements.

The second applicant further noted that in order to assert that her case was a matter for a private prosecution, the authorities had had to establish that the attack on her had not been carried out during a police operation, that it had not been organised by police officers or encouraged by them, and had had to establish the roles of all participants and the aim of the attack.

However, she has lodged her complaint before this Court only four years later. In this respect the Court reiterates that even in continuing situations there might arise a time, having regard to the purpose of legal certainty enshrined in the six-month rule and considerations of the practical and effective functioning of the Convention mechanism, when it could reasonably be expected that an applicant should not wait any longer in bringing an application to Strasbourg (see, mutatis mutandis, Varnava and Others v.  [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7 161, ECHR 2009). However, in the circumstances of the present case the Court considers that the second applicant cannot be reproached for waiting too long before lodging her complaint before this Court since it appears that her complaint was closely intertwined with complaints of the other applicants and all complaints were investigated by the national bodies together (see paragraphs 23 and 28).",

I agree with that finding, and would add that since there is no evidence of any interference, this part of the complaint is inadmissible.",

It is on this point that I disagree. The police officers came to \u201cseize\u201d the drill and the gas gun, but they did not search the apartment. It is true that they threatened to search the apartment if the first applicant did not hand over the two items, but in my opinion this in itself is not sufficient to conclude that there was actual interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their home. I do not find any sufficiently convincing elements to conclude that the police officers entered the applicants\u2019 apartment or that they interfered in any other way with the inviolability of their home. Since there is in my opinion not sufficient evidence to conclude that there was any interference, I would declare this part of the complaint inadmissible too, and a fortiori conclude that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",
