It was estimated that approximately 30% of all viewers above the age of 12 saw the programmes. The programmes, described as documentaries, were called \u201cConvicted of Murder\u201d (D\u00f8mt for mord) and \u201cThe Blind Eye of the Police\u201d (Politiets blinde \u00f8je) respectively and dealt with a murder trial in which on 12 November 1982 the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) had convicted a person, hereafter called X, of murdering his wife on 12 December 1981 between approximately 11.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. X was sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) upheld the sentence in 1983.

The inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, according to which the police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section 751(2) of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven). This provision, introduced on 1 October 1978, provides that a witness must be given the opportunity to read through his or her statement. The non-compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X\u2019s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In this connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the failure to comply with section\u00a0751(2) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the Frederikshavn district police were apparently not the only district police failing to comply with the said provision. The Regional State Prosecutor considered it unjustified to maintain that the taxi driver, when interviewed in December 1981, had stated that she had seen X on the day of the murder. During the inquiry this had been contradicted by the two police officers who had interviewed her in 1981. Moreover, the inquiry did not indicate that anyone within the Frederikshavn police had suppressed any evidence in X\u2019s case, or in any other criminal case for that matter.",

This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions: \u2018... why did the vital part of the taxi driver\u2019s explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor\u2019s office, should bear the responsibility for this?\u2019. In connection with the scenes about the two police officers [the applicants] include two questions in the commentator\u2019s narrative, to which the indictment relates; irrespective of the fact that they were phrased as questions, viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver\u2019s statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on 12 December 1981; that this report had subsequently been suppressed; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named chief superintendent alone or by him and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. The subsequent questions in the commentator\u2019s narrative do not weaken this impression, and neither does the question whether the Chief Constable or the public prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver\u2019s statement. On this basis we find that in the programme \u2018The Blind Eye of the Police\u2019 [the applicants] made allegations against the named superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers, within the meaning of Article 267 \u00a7 1 of the Penal Code [Straffeloven]. We find further that it must have been clear to [the applicants] that they were, by way of their presentation, making such allegations.",

The questions left it to the viewers to decide, between various logical explanations, who was responsible for the failures in the handling of the murder case.

The applicants regretted the Chamber\u2019s assessment and the method used in this respect with regard to review of facts in a case under the European Convention. In addition, although regretting that they had failed to verify the time of the funeral, the applicants contended that the taxi driver\u2019s explanation had appeared highly plausible and credible and that she had had no reason not to tell the truth about what she had observed on 12 December 1981. Furthermore, her testimony had been a crucial element in the reopening of the case by the Special Court of Revision and the later acquittal of X. Moreover, the applicants had reason to believe that a significant statement such as the one the taxi driver had allegedly made to the police would be the subject of a police report. Accordingly, and taking into consideration the fact that the Frederikshavn police had failed to comply with section 751 of the Administration of Justice Act at the material time, it seemed likely that someone within that police district had either misplaced or concealed part of the taxi driver\u2019s statement.",

As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23-24, \u00a7 31; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, \u00a7 30, ECHR 1999-I; and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

Moreover, a constant thread running through the Court\u2019s case-law is the insistence on the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to the administration of justice (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, pp. 233-34, \u00a7 37).

Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.

In either case, it followed that the named chief superintendent had taken part in the suppression and thus committed a serious criminal offence.

The applicants drew their own conclusions from the statements of the witnesses, in particular the taxi driver, in the form of an accusation of deliberate interference with evidence, directed against the chief superintendent.",

Under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, freedom of expression carries with it \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern. Moreover, these \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the \u201crights of others\u201d. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, among other authorities, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2002-III, and Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7 66). Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see, among other authorities, Worm v. Austria, judgment of 29\u00a0August 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1551-52, \u00a7 50, and Du Roy and Malaurie v. France, no. 34000/96, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000-X).",

The offence alleged was punishable with up to nine years\u2019 imprisonment under Articles 154 and 164 of the Penal Code (see paragraph 39 above). It is true that civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no.\u00a02), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, pp. 1274-75, \u00a7 29; Janowski, cited above, \u00a7 33; and Thoma, cited above, \u00a7 47). Thus, although the chief superintendent was subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than a private individual, being a public official, a senior police officer and leader of the police team which had carried out an admittedly controversial criminal investigation, he could not be treated on an equal footing with politicians when it came to public discussion of his actions. All the less so, as the allegation exceeded the notion of \u201ccriticism of the chief superintendent\u2019s performance as head of the investigation in the specific case\u201d (see paragraph 56 above) and amounted to an accusation that he had committed a serious criminal act. Thus, it inevitably not only prejudiced public confidence in him, but also disregarded his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.",

Despite the fact that this witness appeared over nine years after the events took place, the applicants did not check whether there was an objective basis for her timing of events. This could easily have been done, as shown by the check carried out by the police on 11 March 1991, which revealed that the funeral of the taxi driver\u2019s grandmother had taken place, not at 1 p.m., but at 2 p.m. on 12\u00a0December 1981 (see paragraph 22 above). This fact was indeed important, not only in relation to the murder case, in which the crucial time was between 11.30 a.m. and 1 p.m., but also as regards the reliability of the taxi driver who, calculating backwards from the time when the funeral took place, claimed to be completely accurate in her observations of the whereabouts of X. The Court also notes that the applicant journalists themselves found their failure to verify the time of the funeral \u201cregrettable\u201d.",

This being so, taking into account the nature and the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s allegation against the named chief superintendent, the applicants\u2019 reliance on the taxi driver\u2019s statement alone could not justify their three-fold speculation that the taxi driver had made her crucial statement to the police in 1981, that a report on it had been written, and that the chief superintendent had intentionally suppressed that report.",

The non-compliance was confirmed by the inquiry into the specific police investigation of X\u2019s case following the broadcast of the applicants\u2019 television programmes (see paragraph 25 above). That inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, stating, inter alia, that the police in Frederikshavn had not, in the course of their routine procedure, implemented the relevant provision. This non-compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X\u2019s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In that connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the non-compliance with section 751(2) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the thirty witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the police district of Frederikshavn was apparently not the only police district which had failed to comply with the said provision. Consequently, on 20 December 1991 the Prosecutor General found the non-compliance unfortunate and open to criticism, and he informed the Ministry of Justice that he would produce a wider set of guidelines to be integrated into the Police Academy\u2019s educational material.",

The Court also notes that the Special Court of Revision was divided when the retrial was granted on 29 November 1991, in that only two judges out of five found that new testimonial evidence, including the taxi driver\u2019s statement, had been produced on which X might have been acquitted had it been available at the trial. The retrial was granted nevertheless because the presiding judge found that in other respects special circumstances existed which made it overwhelmingly likely that the available evidence had not been assessed correctly in 1982 (see paragraph\u00a024 above). Finally, although X was acquitted by the High Court sitting with a jury on 13 April 1992, the judgment did not contain any specific reasoning with regard to the jury\u2019s answers to the particular questions put by the prosecution (see paragraph 26 above).

The subsequent discovery that the funeral of the taxi driver\u2019s grandmother had actually taken place one hour later than the taxi driver had remembered does not detract from the fact that at the relevant time the applicants could reasonably assume that the funeral actually had taken place at 1 p.m. and that the taxi driver\u2019s statement could thus be considered of crucial importance.
