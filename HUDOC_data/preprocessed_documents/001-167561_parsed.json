Detention was one of five preventive measures available under the domestic law and was considered an exceptional one. A written undertaking not to leave his place of residence had already been applied to him as a preventive measure on the ground that there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond, obstruct the investigation or commit an offence. He had not violated the conditions of that preventive measure, always appeared upon the investigator\u2019s summons and assisted the investigation by participating in various investigative measures. The courts had no grounds to conclude that he might abscond or obstruct the proceedings, other than the fact that the charge against him had been modified to a more severe one. However, the severity of the sentence was not sufficient to justify detention and the courts were under an obligation to consider his personality and character. The courts failed nevertheless to carry out a proper examination and simply copied the text of Articles 134 and 135 of the CCP into their decisions without providing any concrete facts or evidence and limiting themselves to identical, abstract and stereotyped wording.",

The severity of the sentence was a relevant factor to be taken into account. Therefore, the modification of the charge against the applicant to a more severe one had been regarded as a factor which might influence his behaviour, increasing the risk of his avoiding liability and sentence. This was also demonstrated by the fact that the applicant had not objected to the initial charge but later, when a more severe charge was brought, started to claim that he had acted in selfdefence. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s confession could not serve as an example of his willingness to cooperate, since he had turned himself in only after the police had visited his place of residence, where they had been told that the applicant had gone out the day before and had not yet returned. The extension of the applicant\u2019s detention had been justified by the necessity to complete the investigation and the fact that the grounds for his detention persisted. Those same grounds also justified the refusal of the applicant\u2019s release on bail.",

Thus, his claim in respect of legal costs incurred before the Court was not substantiated with any proof.

In the present case, the applicant\u2019s claim for costs and expenses incurred before the Court is indeed not supported by any evidence. As regards his claim for costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts, it is true that the applicant did not submit an itemised bill. Nevertheless, it is evident from the circumstances of the case that a certain amount of work was performed by the applicant\u2019s lawyer in relation to his detention, as stipulated by the contract concluded between them. Since this contract was not limited exclusively to questions of detention, the Court cannot award this claim in full. However, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the circumstances of the case, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 300 for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings.",
