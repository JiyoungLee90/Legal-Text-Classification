In particular, they submitted that it had been open to the applicant to bring his grievances to the attention of the prosecutor. They cited the following examples from the domestic practice in support of their position: in response to a complaint by a Mr N, the  prosecutor's office had conducted an inquiry which confirmed his allegations that the food ration was insufficient and the water supply was irregular. As a result, the prison administration had renovated the prison and purchased medical supplies; in the Vladimir Region, a special section for the detention of inmates diagnosed with tuberculosis had been set up following an NGO's complaint in respect of a Mr\u00a0B; in the Khabarovsk Region the administration of the prison where a Mr\u00a0Sh. and a Mr Z. were detained had renovated the shower and laundry rooms, upgraded the ventilation system in the disciplinary block and set up an area for medical consultations. Alternatively, the applicant could have brought a civil action for damages resulting from the conditions of his detention.

The Court has consistently stressed that in order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, under Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

However, the Court notes that the information submitted by the Government is rather scarce. The Government submitted excerpts from the remand prison population register in respect of five days only. No explanation as to how the samples had been chosen was provided. While the Court accepts that on those five days the number of inmates in the cell where the applicant was detained was indeed below the capacity it was designed for and that the cell was not overcrowded, it cannot accept that the Government's contention that there was no overcrowding is sufficiently substantiated in respect of the remaining almost thirteen months the applicant spent in detention.

At times, as the applicant submitted, the space the cells afforded did not exceed 1 sq.\u00a0m per person.

Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. , no. 67175/01, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2005XII, with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Trzaska v. Poland, no. 25792/94, \u00a7\u00a074, 11 July 2000). The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v. Greece, 13 July 1995, \u00a7\u00a047, Series A no. 318-B).",

The prosecutor attended the hearing and made submissions to the court on the extension of the applicant's pre-trial detention. In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was incumbent on the domestic judicial authorities to adhere to the principle of equality of arms and to give the applicant the opportunity to appear, either in person or through some form of representation, at the same time as the prosecutor, so that he could reply to the latter's arguments. However, the appeal court failed to do this. As can be seen from the text of the court's decision of 3\u00a0November 2003, the appeal court proceeded with the hearing in the absence of the applicant and his counsel. It did not even verify whether the applicant and/or his counsel had been notified of the date and time of the hearing and, if they had not been, consider whether the appeal hearing should be adjourned to provide the applicant with an opportunity to be heard by the court.",

As regards his pre-trial detention, the applicant complained that his counsel had not attended the hearing concerning the extension of his detention on 8\u00a0October 2003 and that he had been unable to appeal against the detention order of 14\u00a0August 2003. He further alleged that the investigator had presumed him guilty and had refused to examine certain witnesses for his defence, and that the criminal proceedings against him had been unfair and unreasonably long. He complained that his numerous complaints had received no response from the authorities; that the administration of remand prison no.\u00a077/1 had destroyed some of his written complaints, and that an officer at remand prison no.\u00a077/6 had forced him to stop complaining about the conditions of his detention.
