The right is not however absolute. It may be subject to legitimate restrictions, for example, statutory limitation periods, security for costs orders, regulations concerning minors and persons of unsound mind (see Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, pp.\u00a01502-3, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; and Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp.\u00a080-81, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-67). Where the individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and in particular whether it pursued a legitimate aim and there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, \u00a7 57).",

It further held that such restriction was proportionate in the light of the circumstances of that case (see Ernst and Others v. Belgium, no.\u00a033400/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-57, 15 July 2003).",

In particular, the Court is preoccupied by the fact that the applicants\u2019 claim was lodged not only against the District Court, which indeed had immunity against civil suit, but also against the Tax Office, which did not enjoy any such immunity. The Court notes that the applicants explicitly indicated the Tax Office as another defendant in their suit and alleged (i) that they had been unable to recover the lorry and the wheat load from the Tax Office after the adjudication of the administrative case by the court when there was no longer any legal ground to detain the applicants\u2019 property; and (ii) that their property had deteriorated while in the charge of the Tax Office. Those grievances had nothing to do with the District Court and were clearly addressed to the Tax Office. However, the domestic courts were silent as to this part of the claim and did not give any reasons why it could not be considered in the course of adversarial proceedings. In particular, the Supreme Court rejected the applicants\u2019 cassation appeal without giving any explanations on that account.",

The violation complained of stems from the domestic courts\u2019 failure to determine judicially the claim that the applicants had already introduced, rather than from the absence of the general possibility of suing the Tax Office. The Court further notes that the domestic courts, when dealing with the applicants\u2019 claim, did not inform them that such a possibility was open to them. Indeed, it may well be that their decisions suggested to the applicants the opposite conclusion, namely that they had no prospect of having any part of their claim considered by a court. In any event, the Court considers that it would place an excessive and unreasonable burden on the applicants to require them to submit another separate claim against the Tax Office after they had validly introduced on in the initial proceedings. It therefore rejects the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and holds that the failure of the domestic authorities to determine the applicants\u2019 claim against the Tax Office deprived them of their right of access to a court.

Indeed, it was rather for the authorities to take the necessary steps to return the objects they had seized, but not for the applicants to make regular visits to those authorities with the relevant requests. To the extent that the Government contended that the applicants should have brought the proceedings for compensation in this regard, the Court notes that in the proceedings which the applicants brought against the Tax Office (and which were subsequently not dealt with) the applicants made this claim.",
