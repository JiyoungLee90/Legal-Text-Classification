In a subsequent decision of 26 September 2014 accompanied by a cadastral plan the Agricultural Department also ordered restitution in kind, and in 2016 the applicants obtained a notarial deed, recognising them as owners. However, they could not enter into possession of the land, since it was being held by the Forestry University.

No land was thus allotted to them under the 1999 land redistribution plan of the area, which they failed to challenge as well. While the land commission\u2019s decision of 1995 was eventually found to be null and void, this was done in 2007 and by that time, namely after the adoption and entry into force of a land redistribution plan for the area, the applicants\u2019 initial entitlement to restitution in kind had already, in accordance with domestic law (see paragraph 50 above), been transformed into a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to receive compensation in lieu of restitution.

In respect of the complaints under examination here, namely about the impossibility to obtain restitution in kind, they thus had no \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which is inapplicable. Additional facts such as the Agricultural Department\u2019s instructions to the applicants in 2017 to submit requests for restitution in kind (see paragraph 15 above), or earlier actions of the Ministry of Agriculture which seemed to consider that restitution in kind was, in principle, feasible (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above), cannot lead the Court to a different conclusion. These circumstances, which do not involve binding decisions by the relevant authorities, may have given rise to hopes for the applicants that they may eventually obtain the restitution in kind they sought, but such hopes are insufficient to amount to a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d and thus a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 88 above).",

In all three cases restitution in kind had been ordered with finality, which gave rise to a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d for the applicants in that regard (see, for example, the Court\u2019s express finding on that question in Hadzhigeorgievi, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

In one of the cases, namely that of applicants nos. 88-89, that uncertainty continues despite the applicants having obtained final judicial and administrative decisions on restitution, because of the need for them to bring additional proceedings to have the scope of their entitlement to restitution determined with finality (see paragraphs 33 and 104-106 above).

It sees no justification for making an award to applicants nos. 26-31 in respect of whom the application was struck out of the list, as per Rule 43 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court. The global award thus made is EUR 8,820 (18 groups of applicants). The Court awards in addition the EUR 926.66 paid for postage and translation, to be transferred, as requested by the applicants, directly to their legal representatives. Lastly, the Court rejects the claims for other costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings, as it has not been shown that these costs and expenses were necessary for the prevention of the violation of the applicants\u2019 rights or related to any compensation on that account.",
