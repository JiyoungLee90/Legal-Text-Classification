This right was subsequently confirmed several times by official letters from the administrative authorities. It follows that the prolonged impossibility for\u00a0the applicants to obtain payment of the compensation constituted an\u00a0interference with their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, as set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov v. , no. 59498/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR\u00a02002III).",

This was confirmed in the letter of 11 August 1999 which the applicants had received from the District Roads Authority (see paragraph 11 above).",

The compensation was paid to the applicants on 13\u00a0September 2007. Thus the delay in\u00a0payment lasted at least eight years and nine months. By failing to comply during that period with the statutory obligation to pay the compensation, the\u00a0national authorities prevented the applicants from receiving the money they were entitled to receive. The Government have not advanced any justification for this interference. Moreover, the Court recalls that a lack of\u00a0funds cannot justify such an omission (see, mutatis mutandis, Ambruosi\u00a0v. Italy, no. 31227/96, \u00a7\u00a7 28-34, 19 October 2000).
