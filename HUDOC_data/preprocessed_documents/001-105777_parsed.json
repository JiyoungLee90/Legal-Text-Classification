It found that the applicant had frivolously based the criminal complaint on facts that she could not prove in the course of the proceedings since, in particular, merely referring to the shortage of staff was not sufficient to enable her to allege fraud, and since she had failed to further specify the alleged instruction to falsify records, which was also evidenced by the fact that the public prosecutor had not opened an investigation. The\u00a0Labour Court of Appeal further held that the criminal complaint amounted to a disproportionate reaction to the denial by Vivantes of any staff shortages, since the applicant had never attempted to have her allegation of fraud examined internally and since, moreover, she had intended to put undue pressure on her employer by provoking a public discussion of the issue. It also pointed out that the nursing home was under the supervision of the MDK, which had carried out a further inspection there on 18 November 2004, shortly before the applicant had lodged her complaint. She could have awaited the outcome of that visit and therefore her criminal complaint had been unnecessary.

It reiterated that in reporting a criminal offence an employee had recourse to a means of implementing the law that was not only sanctioned by the legal order but also called for under the Constitution. An employee who exercised that right in good faith could not therefore incur a disadvantage in the event that the underlying allegations proved wrong or could not be clarified in the course of the ensuing proceedings. It held, however, that, taking into consideration the employee\u2019s duty of loyalty, a [criminal] complaint lodged by an employee must not constitute a disproportionate reaction in response to the employer\u2019s conduct. Indications of a disproportionate reaction by the complainant employee could be the justification of the complaint, the motivation of the person lodging the complaint or the failure to have previously drawn attention to the impugned deficiencies internally within the enterprise. In this context the employee\u2019s motives for lodging the complaint were of particular significance. A complaint that was lodged solely to cause damage to the employer or to \u201cwear him or her down\u201d could constitute a disproportionate reaction depending on the charges underlying the complaint. As regards the possibility of previous internal clarification of the allegations, the court stated that it had to be determined in each individual case whether such an approach could reasonably have been expected of the employee. It would not be expected if the latter had obtained knowledge of an offence which, if he or she failed to report it, would render him or her liable to criminal prosecution or in the event of a serious criminal offence or an offence committed by the employer himself. In\u00a0addition, previous internal clarification of the matter was not required if redress could not legitimately be expected. If the employer failed to remedy an unlawful practice even though the employee had previously drawn his attention to that practice, the latter was no longer bound by a duty of loyalty towards his employer.",

The related decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court of 2 July 2001 and the Federal Labour Court of 3 July 2003 (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d above) did not amount to comprehensive and established case-law in this regard.

It further observes that, according to the decision of the domestic courts in the present case as well as the aforementioned leading decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Labour Code referred to by the parties, a criminal complaint against an employer may justify a dismissal under the said provision where it amounts to a \u201csignificant breach\u201d of the employee\u2019s duty of loyalty.\u00a0While the domestic courts have to assess whether such a significant breach of an employee\u2019s duty has occurred in the light of the circumstances of each particular case, the Court considers that it is nevertheless foreseeable for an employee that a criminal complaint against his or her employer may in principle constitute a compelling ground for dismissal without notice under the said provision.\u00a0The Court reiterates in this context that domestic legislation cannot be expected in any case to provide for every eventuality and the mere fact that a legal provision is capable of more than one construction does not mean that it does not meet the requirement implied in the notion \u201cprescribed by law\u201d (see Vogt v.\u00a0Germany, 26 September 1995, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 323).",

The motives behind her actions were also illustrated by the polemical way in which her criminal complaint had been phrased and the fact that following her dismissal she had disseminated flyers in which she complained of the alleged avarice of her employer.

The allegations made by the applicant were therefore not devoid of factual background and there is nothing to establish that she had knowingly or frivolously reported incorrect information.

The Court notes in this respect that in the applicant\u2019s experience previous complaints by the MDK about the conditions in the nursing home had not brought about any change and she was therefore of the opinion that a further visit by the MDK could not be considered as an effective alternative by which to remedy the shortcomings and avoid her own criminal liability. Following her numerous previous internal complaints with Vivantes, which had been to no avail, she apparently considered the criminal complaint to be a last resort by which to remedy the deficiencies in the care provided. The Court notes in this context that a report of a subsequent check carried out by the MDK in 2006 points out that deficiencies in care that had already been the subject of its reports in 2002, 2003 and 2004 persisted and required urgent action.",

Moreover, in view of the media coverage of the applicant\u2019s case, the sanction could have a chilling effect not only on employees of Vivantes but also on other employees in the nursing service sector. This chilling effect works to the detriment of society as a whole and also has to be taken into consideration when assessing the proportionality of, and thus the justification for, the sanctions imposed on the applicant, who, as the Court has held above, was entitled to bring the matter at issue to the public\u2019s attention (see Kudeshkina v. , no. 29492/05, \u00a7 99, 26 February 2009). This is particularly true in the area of care for the elderly, where the patients are frequently not capable of defending their own rights and where members of the nursing staff will be the first to become aware of unsatisfactory conditions in the care provided and are thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large.",

As regards pecuniary damage already incurred, the amount of EUR 33,730.12 represented the loss of salary following her dismissal without notice on 9 February 2005. Furthermore, since contributions to the supplementary company pension scheme for incapacity to work (Betriebsrente f\u00fcr eine volle Erwerbsminderung) had been discontinued following her dismissal in February 2005, the applicant argued that she had lost a monthly supplementary company pension in the amount of EUR 194.63 to which she would have been entitled as of 1 June 2008. Consequently, at the time of submission of her just satisfaction claims in mid-June 2010, the accrued damage resulting from the loss of such monthly benefits since 1 June 2008 amounted to EUR 4,768.44. She further claimed that she would have been entitled to such monthly benefits until payment of her regular old-age pension as of 30 September 2028, resulting in future pecuniary damage in the amount of EUR 47,861.27 until that date. She argued, lastly, that her monthly old-age pension entitlement as of July 2028 would have amounted to EUR 334,76. Assuming an average life expectancy of 83 years, the loss of her pension entitlement for a period of 16 years (2028 until 2044) thus represented future pecuniary damage in the amount of EUR\u00a064,273.92.",

As regards the applicant\u2019s claims in respect of pecuniary damage, the Government argued that there was nothing to establish that this damage had been caused by the alleged breach of the Convention which originated in the applicant\u2019s dismissal without notice of 9 February 2005. The Government pointed out that by a letter dated 19 January 2005, that is, prior to the applicant\u2019s dismissal without notice on 9 February 2005, she had already been given notice on account of her repeated illness, with effect from 31 March 2005. For this reason, a loss of income resulting from the dismissal without notice could only be claimed for the period from 9\u00a0February until 31 March 2005, the date on which her ordinary dismissal had become effective. However, during that period the applicant had received sickness benefits (Krankengeld) followed by a transitional allowance (\u00dcbergangsgeld) and had not actually suffered any pecuniary damage. The Government further submitted that the applicant\u2019s calculation with respect to her claim for loss of company pension benefits did not demonstrate how that claim could have its origin in an event which post-dated the termination of her employment relationship by ordinary dismissal with effect from 31 March 2005.",

The Court therefore finds that it has not been established that the applicant suffered pecuniary damage during the period from 9 February to 31 March 2005.
