Such compulsory affiliation is accepted in the legal systems of many European countries, where it is considered necessary to guarantee the independence of the legal profession. The importance of the independence of lawyers is expressed in Recommendation Rec(2000)21 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe as follows: \u201c(1) Lawyers should be allowed and encouraged to form and join professional local, national and international associations which, either alone or with other bodies, have the task of strengthening professional standards and safeguarding the independence and interests of lawyers.

When striking a fair balance between these interests, the Court cannot overlook the major importance of not discouraging members of the public from voicing their opinions on issues of public concern for fear of criminal or other sanctions (see Barfod v. Denmark, judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 149, p.12, \u00a7 29).",

In certain situations, the fine can even reach 3,000 times the minimum salary. Bearing in mind that under domestic law the Chairman of the Bar is a public official, in principle, he could in certain situations be sanctioned by a fine of up to 300 or even 3,000 times the minimum salary, depending on the nature of the contravention. In this context, therefore, I consider that the sanction in the present case was, if not symbolic, at least not excessive.",

Under the Code of Constitutional Procedure, similar acts committed against the Constitutional Court are punishable by a fine only. So, comparing the general provisions with the sanction in the present case, the latter can in no way be considered to have been a \u201cdiscouraging\u201d penalty.",

For this reason, I would have solicited additional information concerning the applicant\u2019s income. As the Chamber does not possess this information, I can only compare the level of the present fine with the general figure concerning the general standard of living in Moldova, namely MDL 1,000 per month. It seems unlikely to me that the Chairman of the Bar would be below this level. So, if one compares the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant with the average monthly salary, one can see that the amount of the fine is two-and-a-half times less. This demonstrates once again that the penalty in the present case was not excessive and can be considered to have been proportionate.",
