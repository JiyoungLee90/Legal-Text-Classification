As to the alleged loss of client\u00e8le resulting from the measures complained of, \"goodwill\" may indeed for certain purposes be an element of the economic value of a person\u2019s business and thus an integral part of his property. However, we do not consider that the professional expectations allegedly lost by the applicants should be regarded as part of their \"possessions\", or that the measures taken should be regarded as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of their \"possessions\", within the meaning of Article 1 (P1-1). A wide variety of legislative and other measures can affect incidentally the scope, profitability and therefore the \"goodwill\" value of a business. We take the view that the Contracting States are entitled to adopt measures of the kind in question in the present case without being bound by the restrictions embodied in Article 1 (P1-1). To regard such measures as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions requiring justification within the terms of that Article (P1-1) gives it, in our opinion, an interpretation going beyond its object and purpose.
