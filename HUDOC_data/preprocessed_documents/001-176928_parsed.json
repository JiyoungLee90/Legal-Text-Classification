The Expert Committee also heard the applicant. In its decision given on 25 March 2010, it found no medical malpractice in O.\u2019s treatment. According to the report of the Expert Committee\u2019s meeting of 25 March 2010 at which the applicant was also present, the Expert Committee gave oral answers to the applicant\u2019s questions regarding the possible radiation of O. during his previous treatment; the decision not to offer chemotherapy to O.; and the alleged late detection of pneumonia. In addition, the Expert Committee\u2019s decision contained written answers to the applicant, stating that O. had not suffered from a stroke; that the deterioration in his health had not been caused by the administration of specific medication or the withdrawal thereof, but rather by the metastatic developments in his brain; and that based on the medical records, O. had not been starved, nor had his mechanical ventilation been stopped before his death. The applicant was also notified of the possibility to request an alternative medical expert opinion and was informed that tissue samples gathered while the patient was alive as well as after his death, would be maintained for thirty years at the NEMC pathology centre and were available on demand. The applicant considered that the Expert Committee had not been impartial, that it had lacked a quorum at its meeting of 25 March 2010 and that the decision it had adopted contained false statements.

Under the conditions provided for in section 166(1) of that Act, such claims could be transferred or bequeathed, that is the successors of the deceased person could also lodge such a claim. In that case, the plaintiff had not acted as a successor in claiming compensation for the possible non-pecuniary damage caused to her spouse. The Supreme Court further noted that under section\u00a0134(3) of the Obligations Act, the next-of-kin of a person who had died or sustained a serious injury or damage to health could also claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage if payment of such compensation was justified by exceptional circumstances. Analysing the notion of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, the Supreme Court found that they did not comprise the causing of death or serious damage to health as such, and noted that grief inevitably accompanied the death of a close person. Rather, a compensation claim on the part of the victim\u2019s next-of-kin was justified in cases where the next-of-kin had been in physical proximity to the victim at the time the damage was caused, or had been a direct witness to an accident or its consequences, as well as where he or she had suffered subsequent distress caused by seeing the injuries or suffering of the victim.",

Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 25 March 2014, and Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7\u00a015, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies therefore requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of his or her Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs and must offer reasonable prospects of success (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 74, and Balogh v.

No independent autopsy had been performed and the results of the tests performed in the hospital had not been independently verified. The applicant put into question the official explanation for the cause of her son\u2019s death and considered that the medical staff had failed to carry out a sufficiently profound medical examination of her son and to give due consideration to other possible reasons for the deterioration of his health, besides the cancer. For example, they had failed to diagnose pneumonia in due time and to assess whether the deterioration of O.\u2019s condition could have been attributed to a tick-borne disease. Other possible causes of death had also been overlooked by the investigative authorities. The applicant further argued that the experts and authorities had failed to duly consider whether the administration of certain medicines, including sedatives, penicillin and medicines lowering the blood pressure, had been justified and in accordance with clinical safety guidelines. Nor had they considered whether such treatment had in fact had negative effects on O.\u2019s condition, including causing his breathing to stop on 12 October 2013. Not all of the medical staff concerned had been questioned in the course of the investigation, and many of those who had been questioned had lied under oath.

The procedure for determining brain death had not been followed and O. had been deprived of any treatment or food on 13 October 2009 without the brain-death procedure even having been commenced as required, let alone having been completed.",

In such instances, the investigative bodies and ultimately the courts, tasked with the responsibility of giving ex post legal qualification to previous medical decisions and courses of treatment, cannot assume the position of first-hand medical experts. This is why the medical expert opinions are very likely to carry a crucial weight in the courts\u2019 assessment of highly complex issues of medical negligence (see Sara Lind Eggertsd\u00f3ttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, \u00a7\u00a047, 5 July 2007). Consequently, given the importance of the medical expert opinions, the procedural aspects of obtaining such opinions are essential. Those aspects concern, inter alia, the competence and independence of the experts, ensuring that the questions posed to the experts cover all the medically relevant aspects of the case, and that the expert opinions themselves are sufficiently reasoned.",
