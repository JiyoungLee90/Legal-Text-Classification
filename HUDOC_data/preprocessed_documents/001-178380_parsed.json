The requirements of an investigation to be effective under Article 3 are the same as those under Article 2 of the Convention (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 324, ECHR 2007 II, and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7 172, 14 April 2015). General principles as to the requirements for an investigation to be effective are most recently set out in the case of Armani da Silva v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 5878/08, ECHR 2016) as follows:",

This is not an obligation of result, but of means (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2005 VII); Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 47708/08, \u00a7 186, ECHR 2014; and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 173). The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of the clinical findings, including the cause of death (as regards autopsies, see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 106, ECHR 2000-VII; on the subject of witnesses, see, for example, Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a0109, ECHR 1999-IV; as regards forensic examinations, see, for example, G\u00fcl v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a022676/93, \u00a7 89, 14 December 2000). Moreover, where there has been a use of force by State agents, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a087, Reports 1998-I). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Av\u015far v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, \u00a7\u00a7 393-395, ECHR 2001 VII (extracts); Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 301; and Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 174).",

They immediately reported to their superiors that the applicant had sustained injuries as a result of force used against him. However, the incident is described differently by the applicant and by the Government. The Court notes that the medical documentation shows that the applicant\u2019s right shoulder and arm were broken in four places and as a result he had an artificial shoulder implanted. After having being brought to the police station the applicant complained to Officer S.P. that he had been injured by two police officers during his arrest. The internal police investigation immediately ensued (see paragraph 12 above). A year and a half after the internal police investigation, which held that the use of force had had a basis in law and had been justified, had been concluded (see paragraph 19 above), the applicant lodged a criminal complaint before the ZMSAO. He claimed that the force used against him in applying the armlock technique had been excessive (see paragraph 21 above). He further alleged for the first time that he had been beaten by the police while he was lying on the ground. In view of the requirement that any use of physical force by State officials during an arrest must never be excessive and must be indispensable in the particular circumstances (see paragraph 54 above), the Court considers that the above facts called for an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment in order to establish all relevant circumstances of the use of physical force against him.",

The internal police investigation assessed that the force used by two police officers against the applicant had had a \u201cbasis in law and [had been] justified\u201d. A.L. concluded that the applicant had actively resisted the police officers since some money had fallen out of his clothes. That fact and the statements of the police officers were seen as sufficient to conclude that the force used by the officers had been justified without considering whether the force employed had been proportionate to the circumstances of the case, specifically whether it had been indispensable and/or excessive. No expert forensic medical opinion in that connection was sought and statements from eyewitnesses were not taken by A.L. Further to this, the report of the internal police investigation was classified and was not served on the applicant. Only after the applicant\u2019s lawyer had expressly asked for it had she been served with the conclusion of the police that the force used against the applicant had had a basis in law and had been justified without any further reasoning. Therefore, it cannot be said that the internal police investigation satisfied the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention.",
