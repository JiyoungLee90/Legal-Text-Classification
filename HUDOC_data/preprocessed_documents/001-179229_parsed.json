It appears that no other procedural steps were taken by the first-instance court during this time, and the Government have not provided any explanation to justify such a long period of inactivity.

Two more hearings were adjourned entirely on account of D.E.\u2019s poor state of health (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). A hearing was also adjourned owing to the recusal of one of the judges of the Riga Regional Court, as under the new Criminal Procedure Law she was unable to further participate in the proceedings (see paragraph 10 above).

Thus, although the applicant was kept in pre-trial detention for only three months and was subsequently released, police supervision was nevertheless imposed on him afterwards, which restricted his freedom of movement. Furthermore, the Court is mindful of the serious nature of the charges brought against the applicant, which ultimately resulted in a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a substantial interest at stake for the applicant to have his trial conducted speedily (see, mutatis mutandis, Ivanov v.
