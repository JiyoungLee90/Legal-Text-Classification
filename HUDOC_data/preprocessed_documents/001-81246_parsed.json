Such rights are implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure (see Stanford v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 282A, \u00a7 26). It further recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory, but rights that are practical and effective (see Multiplex v. Croatia, no. 58112/00, \u00a7 44, 10 July 2003). The right to a public hearing would be devoid of substance if a party to the case was not apprised of the hearing in such a way so as to have an opportunity to attend it, should he or she decide to exercise the right to appear established in the domestic law (see Yakovlev v. , no. 72701/01, \u00a7\u00a021, 15 March 2005).",

The announcement of the court at the hearing on 22 November 2001 unambiguously indicated that the decisive hearing would be held on-site and that that announcement should be regarded as the equivalent of service of a court summons. Under such circumstances, the Court considers unreasonable to expect the applicant to appear in the court room at the scheduled time and not on-site. Even if a certain \u201ccommon practice\u201d had developed at that court, it could not justify changing the venue of the hearing without further notice and thereby depriving the applicant of the opportunity to be present and to effectively participate at the hearing on 29\u00a0November 2001.

Greece, no.\u00a041354/98, \u00a7\u00a034, 12\u00a0April\u00a02001; and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a031195/96, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 1999-II). Having regard to the fee note submitted by the applicant, the Court finds that approximately EUR 127 related to the lawyer's fees for the hearings preceding the decisive hearing of 29 November 2001. As the applicant could have not prevented nor rectified the violation found at those hearings, the Court considers that those costs were not necessarily incurred: it therefore rejects the applicant's claim in that respect. The remaining EUR\u00a058 concerned the legal and court fees in relation to the appeal proceedings which, in turn, sought to rectify the violation found. The Court therefore awards that sum.",
