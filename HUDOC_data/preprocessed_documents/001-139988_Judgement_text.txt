The case originated in an application (no. 32042/11) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Adnan Muslija (“the applicant”), on 14 April 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr K. Kolić, a lawyer practising in Sarajevo. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms Z. Ibrahimović.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been tried and punished twice for the same offence in respect of the same incident.
On 21 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Sarajevo.
On 13 February 2003 the Kakanj police lodged a request for minor-offences proceedings to be instituted against the applicant in the Kakanj Minor Offences Court (“the Minor Offences Court”).
In a decision of 16 August 2004 the Minor Offences Court found that, at about 6.40 p.m. on 12 February 2003, the applicant had physically attacked his former wife, M.P., at her flat in Kakanj. The applicant hit M.P. in the head several times and proceeded to punch her about the body in the presence of their minor children. He was found guilty of a minor offence against public order (affray) under section 3(1)(2) of the Public Order Act 2000, for which he was fined 150 convertible marks (BAM). The relevant part of the decision reads:
“Defendant Muslija Adnan ... is guilty in that at about 6.40 p.m. on 12 February 2003, in Rudi Čajevac street in Kakanj, entering uninvited the hallway of the flat [of his former wife] ... he grabbed M. by the throat ... and then, in the presence of their minor children ... slapped M.’s face several times and continued to punch her about the body while threatening to take the children away from her.”
On 19 October 2004 the Zenica Cantonal Minor Offences Court upheld that decision and it became final.
On 3 August 2006 the applicant paid the fine.
On 18 September 2003 the Cantonal Prosecutor lodged an indictment against the applicant with the Kakanj Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) for causing grievous bodily harm to M.P.
On 9 January 2008 the Municipal Court found the applicant guilty of the criminal offence of grievous bodily harm under Article 177 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code 1998, and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. In passing the sentence, the court took into account various mitigating circumstances, such as the lapse of time and the fact that the applicant had not reoffended, that he was the father of three minor children, had no previous convictions, and was unemployed. The court regarded the fact that the incident took place in the presence of the applicant’s and M.P.’s minor children as an aggravating circumstance. The relevant part of the decision reads:
“Defendant Muslija Adnan...is guilty because
at about 7 p.m. on 12 February 2003 in Rudi Čajevac street, Kakanj, he entered the flat of his former wife, M.P. ... and grabbed her by the throat, hit her with his fist several times in the head, stomach and face, thereby causing her grievous bodily harm: a fractured lower jaw ... and a number of lighter injuries ...”
On 7 April 2008 the Zenica Cantonal Court upheld that judgment.
At the applicant’s request, the prison sentence was subsequently converted to a fine in the amount of BAM 9,000. On 22 March 2011 the applicant paid the fine.
On 4 June 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal complaining that the ne bis in idem principle had been breached.
On 11 January 2011 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina rejected his appeal. It held that the applicant had been found guilty of a minor offence against public order (affray) in the minor-offences proceedings, whereas he had been convicted of the criminal offence of grievous bodily harm in the criminal proceedings. Although both decisions were based on the same incident, the offences were different in nature and purpose.
Section 3(1)(2) of the Public Order Act 2000 (Zakon o javnom redu i miru Zeničko-dobojskog kantona, Official Gazette of the Zenica-Doboj Canton nos. 8/00, 15/03, 11/07 and 8/08) provides that anyone who disturbs the peace in a public place by participating in a fight, or by verbally or physically attacking another person, is committing a minor offence against public order (affray). Under section 6(1) affray attracted a fine of BAM 200 - 500 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding sixty days. As of 15 July 2007, affray attracts a fine only of BAM 200 - 500.
Article 48 § 2 of the Criminal Code 1998 (Krivični zakon Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 43/98, 2/99, 15/99, 29/00 and 59/02), which was in force until 1 August 2003, provided, inter alia, that a fine imposed for a minor offence would be deducted from a sentence imposed in the criminal proceedings (BAM 50 equals 1 day in prison) if the criminal offence contained the same elements as the minor offence.
Article 177 § 1 of the Code provided that anyone who inflicted grievous bodily harm on another or impaired another’s health would be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of no less than six months and not exceeding five years. If that act was committed against a parent of a common child, it was punishable by a term of imprisonment of no less than one year and not exceeding five years (Article 177 § 2). The competent court could impose a sanction below the prescribed minimum in the event that there were mitigating circumstances (Article 41 § 2).
On 30 March 2012, the Constitutional Court, sitting in a plenary session, found a violation of the ne bis in idem principle in a case almost identical to the present one (see decisions no. AP 133/09). In its reasoning the court directly relied on this Court’s case-law established in Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia ([GC], no. 14939/03, ECHR 2009) and Maresti v. Croatia (no. 55759/07, 25 June 2009).
