Firstly, there must be a natural or a legal person having gratuitously increased his or her wealth by proceeds flowing from a crime. Secondly, the beneficiary of those proceeds must have been unaware of the fact that they derived from a crime, because otherwise Article 116 of the Criminal Code would apply. Thirdly, the obligation to restore the assets or to compensate the victims of the crime was to be established in compliance with the civil legislation, compensation being limited to the actual participation in the proceeds of the person sued under Article 122. The Audiencia Nacional further noted that, according to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law, Article 122 regulated a \u201ccivil obligation\u201d the basis of which was not to be found in the commission of a crime but in the obtaining of gratuitous financial gain.",

It found that there was no evidence for a conclusion that the applicant had managed the funds invested in GESCARTERA, and that therefore it was doubtful that he had taken part in the misappropriation activities with which he had been charged. It also found that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant had taken part in the preparation of the documents containing false information with a view to attracting more investors. The Supreme Court quashed the Audiencia Nacional\u2019s statement of facts in so far as it implied that the applicant had taken an active part in any criminal activity, and acquitted the applicant. However, it endorsed untouched the Audiencia Nacional\u2019s statement as to applicant\u2019s status as an investor in GESCARTERA and the amount he owed to it in that capacity; accordingly, it ordered the applicant to reimburse the above-mentioned amount of EUR\u00a088,671.78 in application of Article 122 of the Criminal Code.",

Rather, he had been accused of misappropriation and the prosecutor had requested that he be found civilly liable under Article 116 of the Criminal Code. The Supreme Court noted that M.A.V. had not limited himself to denying the criminal character of his activities but that, on the contrary, he had argued in favour of the lawfulness of his gain as an investor in GESCARTERA; the court concluded that this defence strategy had served M.A.V. in defending him not only from the accusation of misappropriation but also from the civil liability which was ultimately found against him under Article 122 of the Criminal Code.

The Supreme Court had suddenly and surprisingly raised this issue in its examination of his appeal on points of law, in the absence of any accusation by the other parties to the proceedings or any hearing on the matter. According to the applicant, the legal requirements for finding civil liability on the part of a principal actor in a crime were quite different from those which required an economic beneficiary to refund all benefits gained as a result of criminal activity he had been unaware of.

In this connection, the Government contended that the aim of Article 122 was not punitive but strictly compensatory. It was aimed at restoring the victims of a crime to the economic situation they had enjoyed before its commission and preventing the unjust enrichment of any person having gratuitously benefited from its proceeds while unaware of their criminal origin. The Government referred to the Court\u2019s reasoning in the above-mentioned case (\u00a7 40) to the effect that even if the victim of a crime had opted for the joining of the compensation claim to the criminal trial, as had happened in the instant case, the first claim would still be considered a \u201ccivil\u201d one, except if otherwise established in domestic law, which was not the case in the Spanish legal system. In this connection, they also stated that it could be concluded from that case (\u00a7 41) that a civil obligation to compensate did not amount to a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d even if the coexistence of the objective constitutive elements of a criminal offence was critical for a determination as to civil liability and the person found civilly liable was acquitted of the criminal charges in the same criminal proceedings.",

It is clear from the Spanish criminal legislation that under Article 116 of the Criminal Code a civil action might be jointly exercised with a criminal action against those criminally responsible for the offence (see paragraph 23 above), in which case they would be eventually held civilly liable under that provision. It is also clear that under Article 122 of the Criminal Code a civil action may be brought on its own within the framework of criminal proceedings against those who, although free from any criminal liability, have nonetheless benefited from the proceeds of the alleged crime, in which case they can be held civilly liable under that provision.",

It is clear from the domestic case-law that the finding of an offence is critical for the application of Article 122 of the Criminal Code. It is also critical for its application that the person in respect of whom civil liability is sought under that provision should not have been involved in the commission of that offence, and even more importantly, that he or she should have been unaware of the criminal nature of the circumstances (see paragraph 13 above). Accordingly, in order for someone to be found civilly liable under Article 122 of the Criminal Code he or she must not have been charged with a criminal offence, or if that has been the case, he or she must have been discharged or acquitted, as in fact was the applicant on appeal. The Court notes in this regard that the persons allegedly liable under Article 122 of the Criminal Code were not summoned by the Audiencia Nacional as accused parties but in a totally different capacity as potential beneficiaries of the proceeds flowing from the allegedly criminal activities of the former. This distinction between criminal responsibility and civil liability under Article 122 of the Criminal Code was later maintained by the Supreme Court. In fact, the court found that the applicant had not committed any offence. However, it concluded that he had obtained considerable gain as a result of the criminal activity of third persons and that he should reimburse it.",

The Court observes that Article 122 limits that civil liability to the amount actually gained and that in application of that requirement the Supreme Court requested the applicant to reimburse only the difference between the sums he had put into the investment company and those he had taken out of it (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above). This reimbursement unquestionably amounted to a hefty sum, but the amount of money involved is not in itself determinative of the criminal nature of a legal action (see Porter v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15814/02, 8 April 2003, and Walsh v.
