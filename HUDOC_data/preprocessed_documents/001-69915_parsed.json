Many shops and vehicles were set on fire. Some masked men in the crowd threw fire bombs towards the police officers. In order to prevent the crowd from going further, the police officers built barricades. Security forces verbally warned people to stop. They then used pressurised water and batons to disperse the crowd. When they were not able to disperse them, they fired warning shots in the air. However, the crowd continued to walk towards the security forces and attacked the panzers with fire bombs. The riot in the Gazi neighbourhood lasted for two days.

In his indictment, the prosecutor relied on witness statements, medical reports, police reports, autopsy reports, video footage and newspaper clippings. He stated that, following the attack on the caf\u00e9s located in the Gazi district and upon provocation from an illegal organisation, the residents of the neighbourhood had started protesting against the police. The crowd marched towards the local police station, chanting slogans, and throwing stones and fire bombs. Some people among the group fired at the police officers. The crowd was shouting slogans to incite hatred between the Alevis and Sunnis. The prosecutor further maintained that the police panzers had opened fire at the crowd to disperse the demonstrators and, as a result, Mehmet G\u00fcnd\u00fcz was shot and killed. A police officer, identified as Adem Albayrak, had further shot and killed Ali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, Dilek \u015eim\u015fek Sevin\u00e7 and Fadime Bing\u00f6l. Another police officer, whose identity could not be established, shot and killed Reis Kopal. Adem Albayrak, together with Officer Mehmet G\u00fcndo\u011fan, killed Zeynep Poyraz. The prosecutor alleged that the officers in the panzer, together with Officer G\u00fcndo\u011fan, had shot and killed Fevzi Tun\u00e7. The prosecutor therefore requested the court to prosecute these officers for intentional homicide under Article 448 of the Criminal Code.",

Eight bullets which had been removed from the bodies of the deceased and the injured persons had been compared with those obtained from the weapons of the 238 defendants.

In the latter connection, police officers should not be left in a vacuum when exercising their duties, whether in the context of a prepared operation or a spontaneous pursuit of a person perceived to be dangerous.
