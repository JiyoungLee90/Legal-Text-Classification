Even though the applicant had an opportunity to challenge the Social Security Board\u2019s decision of 30\u00a0July\u00a02002 in judicial review proceedings, her right to the pension was eventually determined by the courts almost two and a half years later (see paragraphs 17-21 above).",

It requires that where an issue pertaining to the general interest is at stake, especially when it affects fundamental human rights, including property rights, the public authorities must act promptly and in an appropriate and above all consistent manner (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000 I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a0128, ECHR 2004 XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v.

It is desirable that public authorities act with the utmost care, in particular when dealing with matters of vital importance to individuals, such as welfare benefits and other such rights. In the present case, the Court considers that having discovered their mistake, the authorities failed in their duty to act speedily and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Moskal, cited above, \u00a7 72).",

The right was granted to her by means of a final administrative decision (see paragraph 9 above) and she had the reasonable basis to expect when consenting to the expiration of her employment contract that once the contract expired, the payment of the pension would start. Moreover, the payment was confirmed by the Social Security Board\u2019s decision of 29\u00a0July\u00a02002 issued immediately after the expiry of the applicant\u2019s employment (see paragraph 12 above). As a result of the impugned measure, the applicant was faced, without any transitional period enabling her to adjust to the new situation, with the total loss of her right to early retirement pension, which \u2013 if not revoked - would constitute her only source of income after the expiry of her employment. The Court notes that following the revocation of the pension, the applicant did not work for two and a half years (see paragraphs 15 and 23 above). Subsequently, between 16\u00a0December\u00a02004 and 31\u00a0May\u00a02005 she worked on the basis of a civil law contract and only after 31\u00a0May\u00a02005 did she manage to find a permanent job. The Government admitted in their observations that the applicant had had no income at all in 2003 and that her income in 2004 had amounted to EUR\u00a025 (see paragraph 24 above). The applicant\u2019s difficult financial situation is also confirmed by the fact that in 2004 she was granted a social care benefit for persons whose family income was below the established statutory level (see paragraph 26 above).",
