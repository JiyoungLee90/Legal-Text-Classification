In order for the Security Police to be able to prevent and uncover crimes against national security, it was necessary to survey and identify potential threats and recruitment attempts. It should also be possible for the Security Police to identify links between persons who move to  after participating in oppositional activities in their home countries. Moreover, it should be possible for the Security Police to register information about persons who have been smuggled into  on assignment from foreign non-democratic regimes with the task of collecting information concerning fellow countrymen.

Since the implementation in practice of measures of secret surveillance is not open to scrutiny by the individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68, Series A no. 82, reiterated in Amann, cited above, \u00a7 56, and in Rotaru, cited above, \u00a7 55).",

The Government stated that a person may be registered without his or her being incriminated in any way. Here the preparatory work gives some specific and clear examples: in particular, a person who is connected with another person who has been registered, a person who may be the target of a threat and a person who may be the object of recruitment by a foreign intelligence service (ibid.). The Government have also given examples of wider categories, for instance \u201ca person in contact with someone suspected of a crime\u201d (ibid.). It is clear that the Security Police enjoys a certain discretion in assessing who and what information should be registered and also if there are \u201cspecial reasons\u201d other than those mentioned in sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 33 (a person suspected of a crime threatening national security or a terrorist offence, or undergoing a security check).",
