Austria, 40016/98, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2003IX). Although in Karner\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria the Court held that a case could be continued after the death of an applicant, and even in the absence of heirs wishing to continue, where the issues transcended the interests of the applicant and raised an important question of public interest relevant to human rights standards in Contracting States, the applicant in that case had died after the introduction of the application before the Convention organs. While it is also true that individuals, who are the next-of-kin of persons who have died in circumstances giving rise to issues under Article 2 of the Convention, may apply as applicants in their own right, this is a particular situation governed by the nature of the violation alleged and considerations of the effective implementation of one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention system (Fairfield v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a024790/04; see also Georgia Makri and others v. Greece (dec.), no. 5977/03, 24 March 2005).",

Alekseyev were not parties to any proceedings before the national courts, and the respective judgments creditors died at least two years before the relevant applications were lodged with the Court. Although the applicants were involved in the enforcement proceedings, they acted not as procedural successors of their deceased next-of-kin but in their own right, as owners of the various awards. Given that Article 6 applies to enforcement proceedings because, in the absence of the necessary measures to comply with a final, enforceable judicial decision, Article 6 \u00a7 1 can be deprived of all useful effect (see Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 45), these applicants may not claim to be victims of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention.\u00a0As for Mrs\u00a0Y.\u00a0V.\u00a0Naumets, the debt to her was recognised by the liquidation commission and not by the court. There have not therefore been any court proceedings to which the benefit of Article 6 \u00a7 1 could attach. She therefore also cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. It follows that these complaints must be rejected as being incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4.",

Similarly, Mrs Y.V. Naumets' claim, which was recognised in the course of the liquidation as valid, is also to be considered as an item of property for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. These applicants may therefore claim to be victims of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
