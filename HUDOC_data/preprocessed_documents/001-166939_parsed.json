It further referred to a previous public plea to the media requesting them to deal with allegations of collaboration with the communist secret services with the utmost diligence, seriousness and caution, so as not to cause detriment to anyone and to avoid a sensationalist approach to a very serious issue. It recommended that only thoughtful discussion should be held about themes of such importance as collaboration with the secret services and the manner in which vetting legislation should be applied, commensurate with the gravity of the issues involved.",

It was limited by the criterion of truthfulness on the one hand, and the necessity to protect important values such as dignity, reputation, honour and the private life of individuals on the other. In the present case, the applicant had not had sufficient knowledge at her disposal to support the factual thesis she had advanced in the articles. She had therefore overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism, defamed the plaintiff and thereby committed a criminal offence.",

The court observed that the amount of the fine had been determined with regard to the degree of the applicant\u2019s guilt. The publication of the articles had been her idea and she had written them. However, the fine imposed on her was lower than that imposed on the editor, regard being had to the fact that her income was lower than his. The court further noted that the plaintiff had demanded that a custodial sentence be imposed on the applicant. However, the court was of the view that a non-custodial sentence was sufficient in the circumstances, commensurate with the gravity of the offence. It further ordered that the judgment be made public, having regard to a request submitted by the plaintiff and Article 215 of the Criminal Code, which obliged the court to allow such requests in cases involving convictions based on Article\u00a0212 of that Code.",

Indeed, as a matter of principle these rights deserve equal respect (see Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s (ICI PARIS) v.

Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Axel Springer AG v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, \u00a7\u00a7 87-88, 7\u00a0February 2012).",

In order for Article 8 to come into play, however, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Axel Springer AG [GC], cited above, \u00a7 83). The Court takes note that the accusation was serious for Mr A.C. To call somebody a secret collaborator with the communist-era security services carries a negative assessment of his behaviour in the past and is surely an attack on his good name. The domestic authorities were therefore faced with the task of balancing two conflicting values, namely freedom of expression of the applicant on the one hand and Mr\u00a0 A.C.\u2019s right to respect for his reputation on the other (see Axel Springer AG [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a084).",
