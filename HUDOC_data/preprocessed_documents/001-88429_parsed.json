(The content of Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention is similar, with the distinction that the latter substitutes \u2018civilised nations\u2019 for the term \u2018community of nations\u2019.) This separation makes possible the prosecution of the previously noted sui generis criminal offences defined by international law even by those States belonging to the community of nations whose domestic system of law does not criminalise or punish that action or omission. It follows logically, therefore, that such acts are permitted to be prosecuted and punished in accordance with the conditions and requirements imposed by international law. The second paragraphs of the Covenant\u2019s and the European Convention\u2019s relevant articles evidently override the guarantees of domestic criminal law, all the more so since Article 4 \u00a7 2 of the Covenant and Article 15 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention both imperatively require the prevalence of the principles of nullum crimen and nulla poena, even in situations of war or in states of emergency. For those States which incorporate into domestic law the international legal norms concerning war crimes and crimes against humanity subsequent to the commission of these crimes, the second paragraphs of the above-mentioned Articles amount to authorising retrospective criminal legislation in the State\u2019s domestic legal system. It is the international, rather than the domestic, law which must have declared, at the time of their commission, these acts to be punishable.",

A characteristic of these groups was their continuous dissolution and reorganisation, their rather loose contacts among themselves, which generally concerned only the exchange of information, and the lack of any coordinated military actions between 23\u00a0October and 4 November 1956. They elected their commanders from their own ranks, according to their achievements in the course of the fights.

On the premises, he found some policemen who were already disarmed and a few civilians. Of the squad led by the defendant, four persons stayed at the entrance of the police building to secure that position, while the other officers went into the inner yard of the police building under the defendant\u2019s leadership. There an argument broke out between the defendant and a person among the civilians called Tam\u00e1s Kasz\u00e1s, who had a pistol in his possession. Following demands by the officers, Tam\u00e1s Kasz\u00e1s had the intention to hand over the pistol in his possession when the defendant ordered fire. Among the civilians in the inner yard, the shots fired on the defendant\u2019s orders hit Tam\u00e1s Kasz\u00e1s, J\u00e1nos Senk\u00e1r, Istv\u00e1n Bal\u00e1zs and S\u00e1ndor Fasing.

Protocol\u00a0II, which further developed and supplemented the \u201cparent provision\u201d, was an additional instrument which was designed to set out more detailed rules and guarantees for a specific type of internal armed conflict, that is, for situations when insurgents exercised control over a territory of the State and were thereby able and expected to have the rules of war observed. It was clear that Protocol II had not been intended to leave the victims of all other types of internal armed conflicts unprotected. It was also evident from its wording and the Commentaries on it published by the ICRC that Protocol II did not affect the scope of application of Article 3. Although they could not identify any international judicial interpretation on the issue, the Hungarian courts had taken those Commentaries into account. In view of this, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of common Article 3 \u2013 namely that it had a scope of application which could not be considered to have been retrospectively restricted by Protocol II \u2013 had been reasonably foreseeable.",

Its interpretation of the offence committed by the applicant and defined by international humanitarian law had been aimed at the effective protection of the civilian population.

The decision of the Supreme Court\u2019s review bench of 28 June 1999 and the ensuing judgments reflected another approach, according to which common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions had an original scope of application which could not be considered to have been retrospectively restricted by Protocol II. Consequently, any civilian participating in an armed conflict of a non-international character, irrespective of the level of intensity of the conflict or of the manner in which the insurgents were organised, enjoyed the protection of common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The Court will proceed on the basis that the above interpretation by the Supreme Court is correct from the standpoint of international law (see Bothe, \u201cConflits Arm\u00e9s Internes et Droit International Humanitaire\u201d, Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Droit International Public, 1978, p. 90; Pilloud et al., Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, ICRC, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Geneva, 1986, \u00a7\u00a7 4424-26; and Prosecutor v.

In this connection, the Court finds it to be crucial that, according to the domestic court\u2019s finding, Tam\u00e1s Kasz\u00e1s was secretly carrying a handgun, a fact which he did not reveal when facing the applicant. When this circumstance became known, he did not seek to surrender in a clear manner. The Court notes that it is widely accepted in international legal opinion that in order to produce legal effects such as the protection of common Article 3, any intention to surrender in circumstances such as those in issue in the present case needs to be signalled in a clear and unequivocal way, namely by laying down arms and raising hands or at the very least by raising hands only (see, for example, the Commentary on Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, published by the ICRC (see paragraph 50 above); the proposed Rule 47 of the ICRC\u2019s study on customary international humanitarian law (2005) (see paragraph 51 above); and the Report of the [United Nations] Secretary-General on respect for human rights in armed conflict, UN Doc.

Referring to the four primary formulations of crimes against humanity (Article 6 (c) of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal annexed to the London Agreement of 8 August 1945, Article 5 of the 1993 ICTY Statute, Article 3 of the 1994 ICTR Statute, and Article 7 of the 1998 ICC Statute), the Court concludes that murder within the meaning of common Article 3 \u00a7 1 (a) could have provided a basis for a conviction for crimes against humanity. However, it considers that \u201cother elements also need to be present\u201d for an offence to qualify as a crime against humanity (see paragraph 81), namely international-law elements.",

On that point, it is incorrect in our view to maintain, as the judgment does, that the domestic courts did not examine whether in 1956 there had been a widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population, seeing that the Supreme Court\u2019s review bench held that it was common knowledge that the central power of the dictatorship had employed troops against the population engaged in demonstrations and against the armed revolutionary groups that were forming (see paragraph 34). As to the contention that the Supreme Court \u201cdid not address the question whether the particular act committed by the applicant was to be regarded as forming part of this State policy\u201d (see paragraph 84), it is quite simply at odds with the evidence in the case file and with the historical reality of the events in Tata on 26 October 1956.",

More specifically, was he a member of the insurgent forces who had \u201claid down his arms\u201d? The answer to this question requires an interpretation of the victim\u2019s actions at the time of the confrontation and shooting in the Tata Police Department building, where the insurgents were to be found on 26 October 1956. In this instance the Court concludes that \u201cthere is no element in the findings of fact established by the domestic courts which could lead to the conclusion that Tam\u00e1s Kasz\u00e1s expressed in such a manner any intention to surrender\u201d (see paragraph 91).

In its definition of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal included \u201cmurder ... committed against civilian populations before or during the war ...\u201d. The Nuremberg Trials applied the Charter and attributed criminal responsibility to individuals for \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. However, those crimes were linked to the conduct of war. At that time, it was not clearly established that such crimes were part of customary international law, especially where they were not linked to acts of war. Gradually, however, this was indeed established. Resolution 95 (I) of the United Nations General Assembly of 11 December 1946 expressly affirmed \u201cthe principles of international law recognised by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the judgment of the Tribunal\u201d. This resolution was evidence of the prevailing views of States and of State practice with regard to the principles in question and, additionally, provided solid legal support to the claim that these principles were part of customary international law (see, inter alia, Daillier and Pellet, Droit International Public, 6th edn., p. 677). A connection between crimes against humanity and war activities was not considered a requirement for the establishment of such crimes (see \u201cQuestion of the punishment of war criminals and of persons who have committed crimes against humanity: Note by the Secretary-General\u201d, UN GAOR, 22nd session, Annex Agenda Item 60, pp. 6-7, UN Doc.

One may add here that it has also been maintained and adopted by judgments of international ad hoc criminal tribunals that \u201c[s]ince the Nuremberg Charter, the customary status of the prohibition against crimes against humanity and the attribution of individual criminal responsibility for their commission have not been seriously questioned\u201d (Tadi\u0107 case, op. cit.).",

Where a situation such as that described by the Supreme Court prevailed, it was to be expected that several separate incidents such as that under consideration would inevitably take place as part of the armed forces\u2019 organised activities against the population. One should not lose sight of the fact that the applicant, in confronting and shooting Tam\u00e1s Kasz\u00e1s and the group near him, was acting as an agent of the dictatorial regime which was attempting to suppress by force those civilians, such as the victims of the applicant\u2019s attack, who were opposing that regime. In short, the use of force by the applicant was on behalf and for the purposes of that regime. In the circumstances, I do not see how we can disassociate the incident for which the applicant was found guilty from the general systematic attack by the military and the relevant State policy against the civilian population.",
