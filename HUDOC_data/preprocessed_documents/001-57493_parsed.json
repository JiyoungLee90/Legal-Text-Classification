It is true that some of the terms used (for example, \"employment considered essential to the community\") leave the Housing Authority a degree of discretion; this discretion is enlarged by the fact that section 5(2) permits the Housing Authority to have regard to \"such other factors\" as it deems necessary or expedient (see paragraph 33 above).

The Court will examine the applicants' complaints in accordance with the well-established principles laid down in its case-law: for the purpose of Article 14 (art. 14), a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it \"has no objective and reasonable justification\", that is, if it does not pursue a \"legitimate aim\" or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.",

The applicants themselves have accepted that it was legitimate for a State to try to ensure adequate housing for the poorer section of the community (see paragraph 53 above). In view of the legitimate objectives being pursued in the general interest and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, that policy of different treatment cannot be considered as unreasonable or as imposing a disproportionate burden on owners of more modest houses like the applicants, taking into account the possibilities open to them under the licencing system (see paragraph 33 above).",

The Court notes first that, although there was a factual nexus between the two appeals heard by the Royal Court, they related to two different people and two different questions: a civil case concerning the propriety of the refusals by the Housing Authority to grant licences to Mrs. Gillow and a criminal case concerning Mr. Gillow's alleged unlawful occupation of \"Whiteknights\". Admittedly, with one exception, each member of the  who had sat in the first case also took part in the second, but this in itself is not reasonably capable of giving rise to legitimate doubts as to the impartiality of the . It is in fact common in the Convention countries that higher courts deal with similar or related cases in turn.",

The only decision taken by the first Jurat in his capacity as Magistrate had been to adjourn, ultimately sine die, the hearing on the charges against Mrs. Gillow. With regard to the former President of the Housing Authority, it does not appear from the evidence adduced before the Court that he had at any stage been involved, directly or indirectly, in the applicants' case. The Court therefore finds that the performance of these previous functions is not sufficient to give rise to legitimate doubt as to the impartiality of the two Jurats in question.",
