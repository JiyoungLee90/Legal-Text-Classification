It established however that on 5 August 2002 the State Geodetic Institute had carried out an on-site examination in the presence of a representative of the Restitution Commission, in order to identify the land that was the subject of the restitution claim. On that occasion, the State Geodetic Institute, relying on cadastral records, had established that the relevant part of the land (part of plot no. 2943/6) had been \u201crecorded in the cadastral records ... as undeveloped\u201d (see paragraph\u00a017 above). The Restitution Commission further referred to the on-site examination report of 10 December 2003, according to which petrol tanks had been installed on the land (see paragraph 18 above). With a decision delivered on 3 March 2004, which was nearly two years after the restitution claim was submitted, the Restitution Commission refused to grant the applicants\u2019 claim to title and instead awarded them compensation in State bonds. It ruled this way since the relevant land \u201chad been developed\u201d and could not therefore be restored into their possession.

They referred to the on-site examination report of 22 February 2002, according to which \u201cplot no. 2943/6 ... was undeveloped building land, but that preparatory construction work had begun ...\u201d This report, which pre-dated the applicants\u2019 restitution claim, further confirmed that \u201cplot no. 2943/6 [was] recorded in the cadastral records as ... undeveloped building land\u201d (see paragraph 8 above). In this latter context, the report was consistent with the report of the State Geodetic Institute of 5\u00a0August 2002, which post-dated the applicants\u2019 claim and was admitted in evidence in the impugned proceedings (see paragraph 17 above). The applicants also referred to the court judgments delivered in the claimants\u2019 case at three judicial instances, including the plenary session of the Supreme Court. In those judgments, the courts drew two important conclusions which were of direct relevance for the applicants\u2019 case: firstly, that it was irrelevant that the building permit of 16 May 2001 for the construction of the petrol station pre-dated the claimants\u2019 restitution claim (as was the case with the applicants\u2019 claim) (see paragraph 11 above) and secondly, that the preparatory construction work undertaken on the land \u201c[did] not signify that the plot in question was developed within the meaning of the Building Land Act ...\u201d (see paragraph 12 above). The above had led the highest judicial authorities to conclude that the land should be returned into the claimants\u2019 possession given the fact that it had been undeveloped when the Restitution Act had entered into force and it had remained undeveloped after the restitution claim was submitted (see paragraph 11 above).",

As argued by the Government, this approach considered as decisive the state which the property was in when the on-site examination was carried out (see paragraph 42 above). The Court cannot accept this approach since it was not based on any valid legal instrument or domestic practice. In this connection it notes that under the Restitution Act (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above), the entitlement to ownership of land that is subject to restitution was dependent on the state of the property at the time the restitution claim was submitted. The Government agreed with that (see paragraph 41 above). There was no statutory provision that entitled the authorities to consider as decisive the state of property at the time of the on-site examination, which in the applicants\u2019 case was carried out a year and nine months after the applicants had brought their claim. Furthermore, this approach was contrary to established domestic practice. In this connection the Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the domestic case-law was inconsistent in this respect. The court judgments delivered in the restitution proceedings brought by the claimants referred to the state of the property at the time when the Restitution Act entered into force. However, they nevertheless relied on the state of property at the time the claim was submitted in order to restore the land into the claimants\u2019 possession under section 28(2) of the Restitution Act (see paragraph 11 above). The same practice was applied in domestic case-law post-dating the applicants\u2019 case (see paragraph 38 above). Accordingly, the practice applied in the applicants\u2019 case regarding the relevant date for assessing whether or not the respective land was undeveloped \u201cat the time the claim was submitted\u201d was a deviation from existing case-law and represented an arbitrary way for the domestic authorities to determine the applicants\u2019 claim.",

Apart from a brief reference to the building permit, the authorities did not explain why the applicants\u2019 case was decided contrary to existing case-law.
