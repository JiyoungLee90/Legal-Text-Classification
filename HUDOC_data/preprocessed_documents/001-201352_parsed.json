Then he had smelt alcohol on the applicant\u2019s breath and had called the police. The following day the police officers had visited them at home and enquired about something, which he no longer recalled.

Accordingly, he could exercise his defence rights. The District Court held that the police officers had received initial statements indicating that the applicant had been the driver of the car. Thus, the reports were drawn up on the basis of that information. They dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegation that the statement of J.\u010c. had not been drafted at the scene. The District Court relied on the witness testimony by J.\u010c. and S.H. and both police officers to establish the applicant\u2019s administrative liability. They did not find the applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s testimony to be reliable. The District Court imposed the following penalties on the applicant: five day\u2019s administrative custody (arests); a fine of 850 euros (EUR); a two-year driving ban; and a ban on obtaining a licence to operate recreational craft (boats) for two years.

The Court finds no reason to rule otherwise in the circumstances of the present case, which concerns the applicant\u2019s allegations that his administrative detention had been unlawful as it had been in breach of domestic law (see paragraph 46 below). The Court considers that genuine respect for human rights requires it to continue examination of the complaint in this case. The Court rejects the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant\u2019s allegations as regards his placement in the police car and the nature of restrictions imposed therein falls outside the scope of the present case. The Court has examined those issues above as they pertain to the question of whether the applicant was deprived of liberty (see paragraphs 38-41).

In the domestic proceedings the applicant raised an argument that he had been detained in breach of domestic law as he had not been taken anywhere (see paragraph 23 above).

Furthermore, the domestic courts relied on other evidence, which also corroborated the police officers\u2019 testimony, such as the reports that had been drawn up on the day of the traffic incident (see paragraphs 22 and 25 above). It is important to note that J.\u010c., an eyewitness to the traffic incident, also gave evidence in person before the District Court.
