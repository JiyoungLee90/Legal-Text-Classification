The prosecutor added that he had organised a reconstruction of the scene on 24 November 2004 in order to ascertain the credibility of this hypothesis, having regard to the bullet\u2019s entry and exit points, the point of impact on the ceiling and the deceased man\u2019s build, and that the conclusions of the reconstruction confirmed this sequence of events.",

In reaching that conclusion, the Court took into consideration that the person who had initially been in charge of the investigation, the commanding officer of the unit, was a representative of the authorities concerned, that subsequent investigators did not have guarantees against pressure from their hierarchy and that from the outset they seemed keen to accept the suicide theory preferred by the military authorities. In addition, the investigators had failed to carry out a reconstruction of the events, although this was not only essential but had also been ordered by the military court of appeal. Other essential investigative acts had been overlooked (tests for gunpowder on the hands of the dead man, or a second expert opinion from a graphologist) and the applicant had been excluded from the case, contrary to the usual practice.

For example, we would have included the case of Salg\u0131n v. Turkey, in which the Court found a violation of the procedural aspect of Article 2. In that judgment, on the basis of a premise stipulating more generally that compliance with Article 2 requires that a victim\u2019s relatives are able \u201cto take part in the investigation\u201d to determine the causes of the impugned death (see also Slimani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029 and 48), it was stated (see Salg\u0131n, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089):",

In spite of the other safeguards available to the judges, such as a specific appointment system requiring, in particular, the involvement of the President of the Republic (see paragraph 88 of the judgment), a specific reference to their independence in the Constitution and in the law (see paragraphs 86 and 87), the prohibition on giving them instructions or suggestions or to attempt to influence judgment (ibid.), and the criminal-law provisions against any attempt to so do (see paragraphs\u00a089 et seq.), this circumstance is such as to give rise to fears concerning their independence. Indeed, the Turkish Constitutional Court (on 8\u00a0October 2009) concluded that this part of the appraisal system was incompatible with the Constitution and set it aside (see paragraphs 99 to 102).",
