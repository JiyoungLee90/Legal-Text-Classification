He argued that the defective state of the barrier, which had been put in place to prevent cars from dropping down the side of the road in the event of impact, had greatly aggravated the outcome of the accident. Had the barrier been repaired prior to the accident, it would most probably have prevented the car, which had been travelling within the legal speed limit, from dropping down into the canal, in which case his wife would possibly not have sustained fatal injuries. He further claimed that the fact that there had been other accidents at the same spot in the past suggested a structural problem with the road.",

They emphasised in this regard that the decision whether to request an expert opinion was within the domestic court\u2019s discretion. The \u0130zmir Administrative Court had found in the instant case that the first applicant bore sole responsibility for the accident, as he had lost control of his car while taking a sharp bend at an excessive speed, and that the responsibility of the Municipality could not be engaged in these circumstances. According to the Government, the Administrative Court had based its decision on all the evidence available in the case file, including the expert report submitted to the \u0130zmir Magistrates\u2019 Court that had found no structural problems in the road, and had not deemed it necessary to obtain an expert report in addition to that evidence. The Government argued that there had been no arbitrariness in that decision. They added that the Administrative Court was in any event bound by the finding of the criminal court regarding the first applicant\u2019s guilt.
