The applicant\u2019s case could be distinguished from that of his younger brother for a number of reasons. Firstly, the applicant\u2019s conviction for robbery had represented the culmination of a long history of criminal conduct, and he had gone on to commit further offences after his release from prison, even in the knowledge that the Secretary of State was seeking his deportation. By contrast, his younger brother had committed no serious previous offences prior to his deportation offence and committed no further offences following his release from prison (see\u00a0A.W.\u00a0Khan v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 41). Secondly, as regards the brothers\u2019 respective ties to Pakistan, the present applicant had either arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of seven, or, on one reading of the evidence, had first arrived at the age of four but had then returned to  where he lived between the ages of seven and eighteen. His brother, on the other hand, had arrived in the  at the age of three and had remained there since. The present applicant had, even on his own admission, made at least two visits back to  and had married there in 1989. It appeared that the marriage was still, at least legally, subsisting. He therefore had far closer ties to his country of origin than his younger brother. Thirdly, as regards the relative strength of the brothers\u2019 respective ties to the United Kingdom, the Government pointed out that, while the present applicant relied on his family ties to his mother and siblings, he had at no stage produced any evidence of the strength of these ties, contrary to his younger brother whom the Court had accepted enjoyed a close relationship, involving an additional degree of dependence, with his mother. Furthermore, the applicant had not seen any of his six children since 2000 and had not provided any evidence to show that his deportation would have a detrimental effect on any of them. Indeed, given that four of his children had at various times been classed as \u201cat risk\u201d by social services due to the applicant\u2019s behaviour towards them and their mothers, it was considered that the applicant\u2019s children might well be better off if he were removed from their country of residence. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s younger brother had established that he had a stable relationship with his girlfriend and their daughter.",

Indeed it will be a rare case where a settled migrant will be unable to demonstrate that his or her deportation would interfere with his or her private life as guaranteed by Article 8 (see Miah v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53080/07, \u00a7 17, 27\u00a0April 2010). Not all settled migrants will have equally strong family or social ties in the Contracting State where they reside but the comparative strength or weakness of those ties is, in the majority of cases, more appropriately considered in assessing the proportionality of the applicant\u2019s deportation under Article 8 \u00a7 2. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see\u00a0Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a063). However, the Court has previously held that there will be no family life between parents and adult children or between adult siblings unless they can demonstrate additional elements of dependence (Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no.\u00a048321/99, \u00a7\u00a097, ECHR 2003 X; Kwakye-Nti and Dufie v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a031519/96, 7 November 2000).",

The Court is of the view that the applicant\u2019s lapse into re-offending, so soon after his release from prison, demonstrates that his conviction and lengthy term of imprisonment did not have the desired rehabilitative effect and that the domestic authorities were entitled to conclude that he continued to present a risk to the public. The Court therefore finds that the applicant\u2019s conduct subsequent to the deportation offence renders all the more compelling the Government\u2019s reasons for deporting him.",

Looking first at the nationalities of the persons involved, the Court notes that, unlike the applicant, his mother and siblings are all now naturalised British citizens. The applicant\u2019s six children are also British citizens, as are their mothers. Finally, the applicant claimed to be in a relationship with a British citizen. The Court notes that, although this relationship apparently began in 2008, the applicant made no mention of this partner at his appeal hearing in 2009, when both of the mothers of his children were referred to as his current partners. The applicant appears to have mentioned his new partner for the first time in representations to the Secretary of State in November 2009, only a few months before he was deported. The applicant has not stated whether the relationship has still subsisted since his deportation. The Court cannot therefore attach much weight to this relationship, or find that it is a relationship akin to marriage.",

The Court also notes that the extent of the applicant\u2019s relationship with his children and their mothers was limited even at the time of his deportation, given that he had not lived with them since 1999 or seen the children since 2000. The applicant had not therefore seen his children in the ten years prior to his deportation and the eldest child would only have been aged four the last time he or she had seen his or her father. There was also, as noted by the Tribunal, some doubt as to whether the applicant fulfilled a positive role in his children\u2019s lives, given that four of the six had, at various times, been on the social services\u2019 \u201cat risk\u201d register. Given the length of time since the applicant last had face-to-face contact with his children, as a result of his offending and consequent imprisonment, and the lack of evidence as to the existence of a positive relationship between the applicant and his children, the Court takes the view that the applicant has not established that his children\u2019s best interests were adversely affected by his deportation.",

The Court notes that, unlike his younger brother, the applicant returned to Pakistan for visits following his arrival in the  and also married there. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Court assumes that this marriage is still, legally at least, subsisting. The applicant therefore maintained some level of connection to his country of origin and was not deported as a stranger to the country. As regards his ties to the , the Court has addressed the question of his family life, both with his parents and siblings and with his various partners and children, above, and found it to be limited in its extent. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s private life in the , as observed by the Tribunal, has been constrained by his convictions and spells in prison. Whilst he was mainly educated in the  and has worked, he does not appear to have established a lengthy or consistent employment history. In short, and despite the length of his stay, the applicant did not achieve a significant level of integration into British society. The Court is aware that, as a settled migrant who spent much of his childhood in the United Kingdom, serious reasons would be required to render the applicant\u2019s deportation proportionate (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 75). However, having regard to his substantial offending history, including offences of violence and recidivism following the commencement of deportation proceedings against him, the Court is of the view that such serious reasons are present in the applicant\u2019s case. His private and family life in the United Kingdom were not such as to outweigh the risk he presented of future offending and harm to the public and his deportation was therefore proportionate to the legitimate aim of preventing crime. As such, the applicant\u2019s deportation to  did not amount to a violation of Article 8.",
