The Government further submit that the conduct of the parties, including that of the applicant, had a significant importance to the length of the proceedings. It would thus have been possible and expedient with fewer submissions to the NBI - even a single one might have sufficed if the parties had co-operated. In respect of the request submitted to the NBI on 13 April 1992, to have a further opinion from the Board the defendants only paid the obligatory charge 7 months after the request had been made. The applicant was several times - especially in the period from May 1991 to March 1992 - late in fulfilling requests for further and better particulars, and his objection to divide the case in order to have a separate decision on the question of liability prolonged the proceedings, as it prevented an efficient utilisation of the period until the case was ready for trial.

The Contracting Parties are, however, also responsible for delays attributable to public-law organs, like municipal authorities, which - although they are not organs of the State - perform official duties assigned to them by law (see mutatis mutandis the H\u00a0v. The United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no 120-B p.\u00a061, \u00a7\u00a7 80-82, and Eur. Comm. HR, application nos. 26114/95 and 26455/95, decisions of 28 June 1995, DR 82-A, p. 150). Furthermore, the fact that delays to some extent were caused by the conduct of the defendants in the proceedings does not in itself lead to the finding that these delays cannot be attributed to the State. Even in legal systems applying the principle that the procedural initiative lies with the parties, the latter\u2019s attitude does not absolve the courts from the obligation to ensure the expeditious trial required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see among other authorities the Pafitis and others v. Greece judgment of 26 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 458, \u00a7 93). In so far as the Government have argued that 4 requests to the NBI were excessive, the Court recalls that all requests were approved by the City Court - the last one, of 8 April 1992, also by the High Court - and that the case, which at the time of the last request had been pending for more than 4 years, remained adjourned, even if it took more than 2 years and 2 months to obtain the opinion of the Board.",
