On 20\u00a0November 2006 the Riga Regional Court convicted the applicant of nineteen episodes of misappropriation of property that had been entrusted to her. The applicant did not admit her guilt. She agreed that she had annulled three cash transactions and made three cash withdrawals in the amount of LVL\u00a01,228 (approximately EUR 1,747), but stated that she had done so at the request of the chief accountant and the deputy head of the company with a view to paying out salaries. As concerns other cash transactions, she had not annulled those. The court, relying on witness testimony and other case material (the results of three audits, the electronic cash register records, the relevant bills and receipts, the respective employment agreements etc.), convicted the applicant. The court did not rely on the applicant\u2019s statements made during the pre-trial investigation.",

That decision indicates that there was in fact a suspicion against the applicant that she had committed the criminal offence in question (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant was eventually convicted of the same offence. Although the applicant was not informed of the decision of 16\u00a0January 1998, she was nevertheless questioned in relation to those specific facts and she gave a statement in that regard on the same day. She admitted to having withdrawn cash on three occasions, but denied that she had misappropriated it. In her submission \u2013 which she continuously upheld throughout the criminal proceedings \u2013 she stated that she had handed the cash over to the deputy head of the company. During the trial she added that she had also handed the cash over to the chief accountant with a view to paying out salaries. It is true that the applicant was not officially informed about any charges against her before 2005. However, as can be seen from the statements that the applicant made on 16\u00a0January 1998, the domestic authorities were looking into allegations that she had committed the criminal offence of misappropriating the company\u2019s funds from the very beginning of the criminal investigation (see paragraph 10 above).",

Latvia, no.\u00a058442/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010 and 85, 28 November 2002). Rather her procedural status \u2013 until the official charges were brought against her \u2013 was a witness. However, this is not a decisive factor to be taken into consideration. Indeed, the Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the procedure in question (Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 35). The police summoned the applicant not only on 16\u00a0January 1998, but also on five more occasions in subsequent years, for her to give further statements \u2013 all in relation to the various episodes of the alleged misappropriation of the company\u2019s funds (contrast with Larionovs and Tess v. Latvia (dec.), nos.\u00a045520/04 and 19363/05, \u00a7\u00a7 183 and 187, 25 November 2014). She was also summoned twice for a confrontation. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicant was not the only person whose actions were examined within the framework of the criminal proceedings. However, the fact remains that the domestic authorities were looking into specific allegations against the applicant from the very first day of the criminal investigation. Overall, the actions taken by the police indicate that they did in fact consider the applicant a suspect from the start of the criminal investigation and throughout the pre-trial proceedings although her procedural status remained that of a witness.",

It is undisputed that the applicant, while having the procedural status of a witness, was not informed of any right to legal assistance.

The Court, accordingly, concludes that the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance was restricted from the start of the criminal proceedings, where her actions were being investigated and where she was questioned, until the day on which she was declared an accused person in those proceedings, that is to say from 16\u00a0January 1998 to 27\u00a0January 2005.",

The lack of legal assistance may undermine a full use of the right not to testify against oneself. However, the applicant\u2019s defence position did not change throughout the proceedings (see paragraph 67 above). Besides, she was not held in detention during the criminal investigation, therefore, she was not prevented from receiving legal assistance before and after her questioning by the police, if she wished so. The applicant was also given ample opportunity to contest the evidence used against her during the pre-trial investigation and trial. She exercised her rights in that regard at all stages of the proceedings. It is notable that on appeal the applicant\u2019s conviction was quashed for lack of evidence in relation to five (out of nineteen) episodes. Lastly, although the applicant could not benefit from legal assistance until 27\u00a0January 2005, on this date she was officially charged and became an accused person, who could benefit from legal assistance. In subsequent interviews she did not request that a lawyer be present (see paragraph 18 above). The final bill of indictment, nevertheless, was served on the applicant in the presence of a lawyer (see paragraph 19 above).",
