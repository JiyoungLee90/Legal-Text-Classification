However, those documents did not specify what kind of treatment was offered to the applicant and what examinations he was supposed to undergo. The Court reiterates that the authorities of the penitentiary institution should have kept a record of the applicant\u2019s state of health and the treatment he underwent while in detention (see Khudobin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a083, ECHR 2006-... (extracts)). Logically, such a medical record should contain sufficient information specifying what kind of treatment the patient was prescribed, what treatment he actually received, who and when administered it, how the applicant\u2019s state of health was monitored, etc (see the 3rd General Report of the CPT, quoted in the \u201cRelevant International Instruments\u201d part above). If the applicant\u2019s medical file is not specific enough in these respects (as in the case at hand), the Court may make inferences. Furthermore, the Court observes that in September 2007 the investigator recommended that the prison authorities ensure a medical examination of the applicant and the administration of the HAART treatment to him. In the circumstances the Court concludes that, in all probability, the applicant did not receive the HAART treatment from the prison pharmacy.",

Finland, no. 40900/98, Commission decision of 29 May 1998; see also S.C.C. v. Sweden (dec.), no. 46553/99, 15 February 2000; and Arcila Henao v. The  (dec.), no. 13669/03, 24\u00a0June 2003). The Court refers to its findings in the recent case of N. v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 26565/05, \u00a7\u00a044, 27 May 2008), where it recognised that \u201cadvances in medical science, together with social and economic differences between countries, entail that the level of treatment available in the Contracting State and the country of origin may vary considerably\u201d. That case concerned the provision of free health care to an alien suffering from Aids. In the Court\u2019s opinion, broadly the same principle applies in the area of provision of health care to detained nationals: the Contracting States are bound to provide all medical care that their resources might permit.",

The Court further observes that the applicant\u2019s health was examined on several occasions by mixed commissions made up of doctors from various clinics. In any event, the State \u201cshould not deny the possibility to receive medical assistance from other sources, such as the detainee\u2019s family doctor or other qualified doctors\u201d (see Sarban v.

Instead, the district court indicated that the defence could challenge the decision to begin operational and search activities within separate proceedings. The applicant, as a professional lawyer, should have been aware of that legal avenue available to him.",

The Court points out that the charges against the applicant concerned the period of 1998-1999 (misappropriation of shares) and 2000-2002 (personal income-tax evasion). Given that the acts imputed to the applicant had allegedly been committed by him in his capacity as head of the legal department of Yukos, a post which he had occupied until 2003, it is dubious that the applicant would still have been able to continue his alleged criminal activity in 2006-2007, and especially after 29 March 2006, when an interim receiver was appointed by the court to administer Yukos within the framework of the bankruptcy proceedings.",

To determine whether these measures were \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court has to explore the availability of effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness under domestic law and check how those safeguards operated in the specific case under examination. Elements taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure have been effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer \u2013 or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny \u2013, whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, and \u2013 where a lawyer\u2019s office is concerned \u2013 whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege is not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see Camenzind v.

They allowed the prosecution authorities to search for \u201cdocuments and objects important for the investigation\u201d. Such wording gave the prosecution unrestricted discretion in determining which documents were \u201cof interest\u201d for the criminal investigation. The Court recalls that in the case of Smirnov v. Russia, cited above, the vagueness of the search warrant was the key element which led the Court to conclude that the search in the lawyer\u2019s flat had been incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention. The Court came to the same conclusions in the case of Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria (no. 65755/01, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u00a0et seq., 22 May 2008), where the domestic authorities searched the office of a lawyer suspected of kidnapping and extortion. In that case the Court held that \u201cneither the application for its issue [of the warrant] nor the warrant itself specified what items and documents were expected to be found in the applicant\u2019s office, or how they would be relevant to the investigation. Moreover, in issuing the warrant the judge did not touch at all upon the issue of whether privileged material was to be removed\u201d.\u00a0The same characteristics can be found in the present case. The search warrants delivered by the Simonovskiy District Court on 4 and 5\u00a0April 2006 gave the authorities unfettered discretion in deciding what documents to seize, and did not contain any reservation in respect of privileged documents, although the authorities knew that the applicant was a Bar Member and could have possessed documents conferred to him by his clients.",

However, the Court notes that by the time of the searches the official investigation into the business activities of the Yukos management had been going on for almost three years. From the very beginning of the investigation the authorities should have known that the applicant had been head of the legal department of Yukos in 1998\u20131999, when the crimes were allegedly committed, and could have had in his possession certain documents, electronic data and other evidence pertinent to the events at issue.

The first was indicated on 27 November 2007, and then confirmed in December 2007 and January 2008. The Court, in view of the critical state of the applicant\u2019s health, invited the Government to transfer him to a specialist medical institution. However, it was not until 8 February that the applicant was transferred to Hospital no. 60. The Court leaves open the question whether Hospital no. 60 can be considered a \u201cspecialist institution\u201d in view of the recent developments in the applicant\u2019s medical condition. What is clear is that for over two months the Government continuously refused to implement the interim measure, thus putting the applicant\u2019s health and even life in danger. The Government did not suggest that the measure indicated under Rule 39 was practically unfeasible; on the contrary, the applicant\u2019s subsequent transfer to Hospital no. 60 shows that this measure was relatively easy to implement. In the circumstances, the Court considers that the non-implementation of the measure is fully attributable to the authorities\u2019 reluctance to cooperate with the Court.",

Namely, they did not allow the applicant\u2019s examination by a mixed medical commission which would include doctors of his choice. In indicating that measure, the Court sought to obtain more detailed information about the applicant\u2019s state of health and the medical facilities existing in the remand prison, which would allow it to corroborate or rebut the parties\u2019 conflicting accounts. Despite the applicant\u2019s attempt to form such a team, the Government refused to cooperate with him in this respect. The Court recalls that in its analysis under Article 3 of the Convention it found that the Government\u2019s justification of their refusal to allow such examination was not satisfactory (see paragraph 155 above). Bearing in mind that the applicant is seriously ill, was detained, and was therefore unable to collect all necessary information himself, the Court considers that such a position on the part of the authorities amounts, in the circumstances, to an attempt to hinder the applicant in pursuing his application under Article 34 of the Convention. The fact that the Court found itself in a position to decide the case on the basis of the information available to it does not, in the circumstances, affect this conclusion (see the case-law cited above, in particular the case of Olaechea Cahuas v.
