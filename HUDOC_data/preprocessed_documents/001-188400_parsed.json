It was only in February and April\u00a02009 (in the Ksani facility and the prison hospital respectively) that the treatment of multidrugresistant tuberculosis became possible in the prison sector and the first doctor and nurse received adequate training in that respect (see ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06566).",

Without waiting for the results of the susceptibility test in relation to first-line medication, the prison\u2019s medical authorities commenced the treatment with first-line medication on 21\u00a0December 2008, the date when the DOTS programme became operational at Rustavi Prison no.\u00a02. However, the treatment had no positive effect. G.T. was transferred to a specialist prison facility for inmates with tuberculosis on 29\u00a0January 2009. While the medical records drawn up at that facility indicate a sharp deterioration in his health, no adjustment of the treatment strategy was ever considered, and nor was a second susceptibility test regarding second-line treatment. There was no prompt reaction, even when on 24\u00a0February 2009 the susceptibility tests confirmed G.T.\u2019s resistance to the standard treatment. It was only then that the second susceptibility test was carried out. While the results were pending, G.T. continued to receive the first-line medication which had been proved to be ineffective.",

Therefore, although G.T. was diagnosed with tuberculosis on 17\u00a0December 2008, he did not receive effective treatment for the disease for about four months and two weeks. Such a lengthy delay, aggravated by the swift progress of the disease, could not be justified by the late receipt of the results of the drug susceptibility test, which could have been ordered earlier. Nothing prevented the prison medical authorities from ordering a second susceptibility test, especially considering the deterioration in G.T.\u2019s health in spite of the treatment being provided to him, as noted by the health professionals in his medical history in January\u00a02009 (see paragraphs 16-17 above). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s son was deprived of effective medication for a prolonged period of time. It cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of such treatment resulted in irreversible changes in his condition, leading to his death (see Ibragimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a039-40).",
