The prosecutor found that the applicant\u2019s version of the events was denied by the police officers and, \u201cmore importantly, it had not been confirmed by the remaining, objective and impartial evidentiary material.\u201d Within three days of the arrest the applicant had been examined by various doctors on three occasions \u2013 in two hospitals and at the detention centre \u2013 and on none of those occasions had any information of the applicant\u2019s injury been recorded. The prosecutor concluded that the only evidence which might confirm the applicant\u2019s version of events was the statement made by the applicant himself.

However, illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. Treatment has been held by the Court to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question of whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see Labita v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0119-120). Allegations of illtreatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (ibid., \u00a7 121).",
