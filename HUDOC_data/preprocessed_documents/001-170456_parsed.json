Applying the 2008 Criminal Code as applicable before the introduction of the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 22 and 23 below), the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case. While acknowledging that Article 53 \u00a7 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code applied to the case (see paragraph 22 below), the District Court sentenced the applicant to an overall term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. In its reasoning, it noted that the principle of the rule of law required, inter alia, that criminal-law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily. It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear, ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons. Although the maximum sentence applicable under the 2008 Criminal Code had been thirty years\u2019 imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence, enshrined in Article 53 \u00a7 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences, these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty years. The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment for one of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been ten years lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced. In support of its view, the District Court pointed out that the 1994 Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve thirty years\u2019 imprisonment along with sentences for other offences, the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term. Therefore, the District Court considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in Article\u00a053\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02\u00a0(2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, which had, however, been rectified in the meantime by the 2011 Amendment. The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain, clear and complete and that \u201c[o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent[ed] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality\u201d.",

He also claimed that the primary method of interpreting legal texts should be semantic interpretation. It was only where that method proved unsatisfactory in determining how a certain rule should be applied that other methods of interpretation should be applied. Lastly, the applicant agreed with the District Court that the provision in question could be regarded as unclear, ambiguous and deficient, but pointed out that any possible ambiguities or deficiencies should not be interpreted to his detriment.",

The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court\u2019s judgment, pointing out that the latter court\u2019s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un-amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than fifteen days and not longer than thirty years, it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms, one of which was for thirty years, could be ten years lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed. According to the Supreme Court, the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence, but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence, which in the applicant\u2019s case was thirty years.",

The Court notes that this deficiency resulted from the legislature\u2019s failure to regulate an overall sentence for a situation such as the applicant\u2019s in the 2008 Criminal Code. It moreover notes that the resultant lacuna in the legislation pertained for three years (see paragraphs 22, 23 and 39) and that no special reasons have been adduced by the Government to justify it (see, by contrast, Ruban v.

It further understands that the domestic courts were in a difficult position when called to apply an overall sentence in the applicant\u2019s case while lacking a clear legal basis to do so.

They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention. It further finds that the overall penalty imposed on the applicant was in violation of both the principle that only the law can prescribe a penalty and the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law.",

It is immaterial in the present case whether in Soros v. France there were indeed no multiple or different legal definitions. As highlighted by the dissent in Soros, it was unnecessary for the French legislature to deliberately choose an imprecise term that was inherently vaguely defined in the statute. Neither of these situations arises in the present case.

But we are not called upon to speculate on Slovenian law).

Accordingly, Article 53 primarily concerns the \u201cexecution\u201d of a penalty. As stated by the Court in Grava v.\u00a0Italy ( no. 43522/98, 10 July 2003), under such circumstances the relevant procedural statute would not fall within the scope of Article 7 since the procedure itself does not constitute a \u201cpenalty\u201d.",

                        "content": "In Del R\u00edo Prada, after final sentence was handed down, remissions that the applicant had already worked for were no longer deducted from her sentence and a new system was imposed which extended her imprisonment. This measure was considered to be a \u201cpenalty\u201d under Article 7. By contrast, the present case concerns neither an extension of sentence nor a redefinition of the scope of the penalty imposed. Unlike the situation that the applicant in Del R\u00edo Prada faced, the present applicant would not (according to any calculation) suffer an adverse effect as a result of the domestic courts\u2019 combining his sentence to thirty years. Article 53 \u00a7 2 (2) does not even directly govern the sentence that should be imposed for offences such as murder. It is merely a procedural provision that governs the procedure for combining multiple sentences. In this respect, Article 53 \u00a7 2 (2) appears to be purely a provision that regulates the enforcement of the sentence. Accordingly, that Article should not be construed as constituting a \u201cpenalty\u201d under the Court\u2019s case-law. Thus, the pre-condition for triggering the applicability of Article 7 has not been met.",
