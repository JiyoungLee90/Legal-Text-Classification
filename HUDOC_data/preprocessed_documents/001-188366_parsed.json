In the present case, the first-instance court which examined the applicant\u2019s complaint found that the toilets had not been partitioned from the rest of his cells in the manner required by relevant domestic regulations, and the appellate court upheld that decision in its entirety (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). The Government did not provide any information that would enable the Court to reach a different conclusion from that of the domestic courts. It also notes that neither the domestic courts nor the Government contended that the partitioning of the toilets varied in different cells within the prison. Accordingly, the Court accepts that the applicant was unable to use the toilet in private during the entire period of his detention in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison.",

While the Government indicated certain activities in which the applicant could participate (see paragraph 27 above), the Court nonetheless observes that the applicant was not able to freely move around the prison during the day and remained confined to his cell most of the time (see Daktaras v.
