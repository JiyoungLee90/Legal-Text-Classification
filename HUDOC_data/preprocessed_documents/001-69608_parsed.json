According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. , Werner v. , Kuopila v. ) it is up to each party to decide whether the material is such that it may affect the case and, whether it calls for the party to comment on it. A court\u2019s view that a submission or a statement has no bearing on the outcome of the case does not therefore automatically justify the non-communication of such material to a party.

It is clear from the case-file that the official receiver and the judicial secretary of the Court of Appeal several times discussed over the telephone the submission of the additional material and apparently about the timetable of the proceedings. The occurrence of numerous remarks in the police report and the submission indicate that the material was at least not regarded as manifestly irrelevant.

Further, the legal fee amounting to EUR 6,968.64 appeared to relate to all three applicants. They agreed that the second applicant had incurred some costs and expenses before the Court. However, the number of hours claimed to have been spent by the lawyer on the case and the hourly rate appeared somewhat excessive. The Government considered that the total amount of compensation for costs and expenses for the second applicant should not exceed EUR 1,500 (including value-added tax). They rejected the claims relating to the Supreme Court proceedings, arguing that the costs appeared to concern future proceeding with a view to having the case reopened and thus, these claims were premature. The remaining claims were not substantiated.",
