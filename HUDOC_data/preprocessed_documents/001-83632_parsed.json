The Court has examined the judgment in question and it would appear that no sufficient reasoning was given in the judgment to justify the interference with the applicants' right to freedom of expression (see, mutatis mutandis, S\u00fcrek v. Turkey (no. 4) [GC], no. 24762/94, \u00a7 58, 8 July 1999).
