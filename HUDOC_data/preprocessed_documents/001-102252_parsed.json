Numerous potential witnesses had been heard, expert medical assistance had been obtained, all available leads had been explored, and one police officer had even been disciplined. The applicant's own position, however, seemed ambivalent and his demeanour less than co-operative. In particular, he had been difficult to contact and had not reported the attacks in a timely manner. The applicant had also failed to request that his telephone line be monitored following the threats received in 2001, which could have been useful for identification purposes and led to a conviction. Further, the applicant's descriptions of his attackers had been vague, there had been no eyewitnesses, and the applicant had never remained in Jagodina after the attacks, thus precluding a timely on-site investigation in his presence. Finally, the Government submitted that no material traces of the attacks, apart from the injuries sustained by the applicant, had ever been found and provided the Court with several final domestic judgments, in unrelated incidents, arguing that the Serbian judiciary had been perfectly willing to convict individuals of hate crimes whenever the available evidence had so warranted.",

Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles\u00a05 and 8 of the Convention (see Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v.

The co-operation between the police and the public prosecution service also left a lot to be desired (see paragraphs 55 and 56 above), and the entire investigation seems to have been focused on Jagodina despite the fact that the suspected far-right organisations were known for operating throughout the country (see paragraphs 24 and 63 above).

Admittedly, proving such motivation may be difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible religious overtones to a violent act is thus an obligation to use best endeavours and is not absolute; the authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others v.

The Court considers, once again, that such views alone imply that the police had serious doubts, related to the applicant's religion, as to whether he was a genuine victim, notwithstanding that there was no evidence to warrant doubts of this sort.
