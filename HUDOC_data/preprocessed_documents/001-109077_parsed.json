The prosecutor did not make any reference either to the available forensic medical report concerning the applicant\u2019s injuries or to the statements made by the parties in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The Court recalls that it has previously found that an investigator\u2019s undue reliance on the evidence given by the State officials involved in alleged wrongdoing and failure to examine witnesses did not comply with the standards of a thorough and independent investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ergi v.\u00a0Turkey, 28 July 1998, \u00a7 83-84, Reports 1998IV).",

Dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaint, the District Court based its conclusion on the findings of the criminal proceedings against him, the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s concession at the hearing that the applicant had received some physical injuries before arrival of the police (see paragraph 25 above), and the material collected during the internal police inquiry. The applicant did not complain that he had not personally been questioned in the proceedings concerning his complaint of ill-treatment or that his mother\u2019s representation of him in the court proceedings had been defective.

The Court\u2019s task under the Convention is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among other authorities, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 67, Reports 1996II, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7\u00a050, Reports 1997III). In determining whether the proceedings were fair, regard must be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use (Bykov v.  [GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7 90, 10 March 2009). Finally, Article\u00a06 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court and it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among many other authorities, Bricmont v. , 7 July 1989, \u00a7 89, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0158).",
