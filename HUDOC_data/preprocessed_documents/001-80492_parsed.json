However, the Court notes that under Article 399 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952, a judgment creditor claiming the payment of a judgment debt from a state authority has to present the writ of execution to the financial department of that authority, not its superior (see paragraph 18 above).
