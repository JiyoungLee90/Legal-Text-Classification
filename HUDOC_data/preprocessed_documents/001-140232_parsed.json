The ground which was relied on by the Supreme Court to justify the decision in question was of a formal character, namely the failure of the applicant\u2019s lawyer to give the grounds which would justify the examination of his client\u2019s cassation appeal. The Court notes further that the reasons behind the Supreme Court\u2019s decision were the same as reasons relied on by the same court in other case examined by the Strasbourg Court namely in Antoni Lewandowski v. Poland, no. 38459/03, \u00a7\u00a025, 2 October 2012, where the Supreme Court refused to entertain the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. Therefore, the Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning adopted in the case of Antoni Lewandowski where the Court found that the applicant\u2019s procedural mistake did not have any material bearing on the effectiveness of his cassation appeal. Most cassation appeals which had been lodged by applicants with similar cases were considered by the Supreme Court as not deserving of substantive examination. Accordingly, the prospects of success of the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal, even if it had been lodged properly, were very slim and, therefore, not sufficient for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, Antoni Lewandowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a062-66).",

Even though the applicant had an opportunity to challenge the Social Security Board\u2019s decision of 8\u00a0October\u00a02002 in judicial review proceedings, her right to the pension was eventually determined by the courts almost two years later (see paragraphs 15-22 above).",

As a result of the impugned measure, the applicant was faced, without any transitional period enabling him to adjust to the new situation, with the total loss of his earlyretirement pension, which constituted his only source of income at that time. It is true that the applicant managed to find job relatively quickly after his EWK pension had been revoked (see paragraph 25-27 above). The Court notes however that, according to the applicant\u2019s submissions supported by the relevant documents in the first two years following the revocation of his EWK pension the applicant could manage to find employment only on temporary basis and his salary amounted to PLN\u00a01000 which constituted less than 50% of the average salary in Poland (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a027 and 28 above).",
