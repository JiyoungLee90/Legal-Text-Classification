The length of the proceedings was partly due to the fact that the applicant amended her claims several times and that she had requested that the case should not be processed pending the outcome of criminal proceedings which she had initiated. The District Court did not proceed with the case for approximately 17 months between 20 October 1997 and 17\u00a0March 1999. The District Court\u2019s judgment given on 3 April 2000 was served on the applicant on 7 June 2001 which is approximately 16 months after its delivery. At that time, the proceedings had been pending for more than 9 years. Having examined all the material submitted to it and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the overall length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
