He pointed out that the distinction between \u201cactivity\u201d and religious beliefs, drawn by the Russian authorities and the Government in their submissions, was artificial and ineffective since Article\u00a09 of the Convention protected both religious belief (forum internum) and its manifestation in practice (forum externum).

The Russian Government\u2019s official national security policy defining \u201cforeign\u201d religions and missionaries as a threat to national security was incompatible with the Convention. Religious plurality was at the foundation of a democratic society: national security required that governments protect it, not oppose it. Furthermore, the applicant submitted that neither he nor the  had ever engaged in any criminal activities, evidence of this being provided by the opinion submitted by the Expert Council to the Ministry of Justice (see paragraph 8 above).

The Government also referred to the same effect to Recommendation 1178 (1992) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on sects and new religious movements and the Committee of Ministers\u2019 supplementary reply to that Recommendation, adopted on 17 February 1994 (doc. 7030).

It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to \u201cmanifest [one\u2019s] religion\u201d. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions. The Court has held on many occasions that the imposition of administrative or criminal sanctions for manifestation of religious belief or exercise of the right to freedom of religion was an interference with the rights guaranteed under Article 9 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Serif v. , no.\u00a038178/97, \u00a7\u00a039, ECHR 1999IX; Larissis and Others v. , 24\u00a0February 1998, \u00a7\u00a038, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I, and Kokkinakis v. , 25 May 1993, \u00a7\u00a036, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0260A).",

The Court reiterates in this connection that, whereas the right of a foreigner to enter or remain in a country is not as such guaranteed by the Convention, immigration controls have to be exercised consistently with Convention obligations (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the , 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a094). As regards specifically Article 9, it emphasises that \u201cdeportation does not ... as such constitute an interference with the rights guaranteed by Article 9, unless it can be established that the measure was designed to repress the exercise of such rights and stifle the spreading of the religion or philosophy of the followers\u201d (see Omkarananda and the Divine Light Zentrum v. Switzerland, no. 8118/77, Commission decision of 19 March 1981, Decisions and Reports (DR) 25, p. 118). More recently, the Court has examined cases against Bulgaria, in which the State\u2019s use of immigration controls as an instrument to put an end to an applicant\u2019s religious activities within its jurisdiction was found to have given rise to an admissible complaint of an interference with rights under Article 9 (see Al-Nashif v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a050963/99, 25 January 2001, and Lotter v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39015/97, 5 November 1997). In a Latvian case the Court held that the refusal to issue an Evangelical pastor with a permanent residence permit \u201cfor religious activities\u201d, a decision which had been grounded on national-security considerations, amounted to an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of religion (see Perry v.\u00a0, no. 30273/03, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 53, 8\u00a0November 2007). It follows that, in so far as the measure relating to the continuation of the applicant\u2019s residence in a given State was imposed in connection with the exercise of the right to freedom of religion, such measure may disclose an interference with that right.",

There has therefore been an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights guaranteed under Article 9 of the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Omakaranda, and Lotter cases, all cited above).",

Legitimate aims mentioned in this provision include: the interests of public safety, the protection of public order, health or morals, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (see paragraph 58 above). However, unlike the second paragraphs of Articles 8, 10, and 11, paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the Convention does not allow restrictions on the ground of national security. Far from being an accidental omission, the non-inclusion of that particular ground for limitations in Article 9 reflects the primordial importance of religious pluralism as \u201cone of the foundations of a \u2018democratic society\u2019 within the meaning of the Convention\u201d and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, Kokkinakis, cited above, \u00a7 31, and Ivanova v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 52435/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2007...).

The Court observes, however, that the applicant had not been an employee of the  branch or a party to the dissolution proceedings, that he had not been mentioned by name or otherwise identified in the District Court\u2019s judgment, and that no findings of fact had been made in respect of him in those proceedings.

In this connection the Court observes that more than three months separated the issuing of the Federal Security Service\u2019s report of 18 February 2002, which apparently served as the basis for the applicant\u2019s exclusion, and the enforcement of the exclusion order in early June 2002. During this entire period the Russian authorities were obviously aware that the applicant would not be allowed to return to , but there is no indication that the applicant was in any way apprised of that possibility. After his exclusion from Russia in June 2002, a subsequent attempt to obtain a new visa and return to  to be reunited with his son was also thwarted. This resulted in a situation where the applicant was unable to have physical access to his son, who had remained in  in the care of a nanny. The physical separation of the applicant from his son lasted approximately ten months, during which the applicant attempted to challenge the exclusion order and arrange for the necessary documents \u2013 such as a Russian exit visa \u2013 that would enable his son to leave . The period of separation was the direct consequence of a combination of the Russian authorities\u2019 actions (the decision to exclude the applicant from Russia) and omissions (failure to notify the applicant of that decision and to take measures that would enable his son to leave ).",

In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life. The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar. In particular, in both instances regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests (see Dickson v. the  [GC], no.\u00a044362/04, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2007...).",

Nor were they oblivious to the fact that his exclusion from Russia would result in his separation from K., who had been born in and had previously never left , a situation which required complex paperwork for his departure. However, despite being aware of these factors, the authorities concealed the existence of the decision from the applicant, thereby depriving him of an opportunity to take measures to prepare for K.\u2019s departure, and also took no measures facilitating K.\u2019s exit from  and their reunion in any other country. The manifest absence of an assessment of the impact of their decisions and actions on the welfare of the applicant\u2019s son must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation of the State.",

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Nasrulloyev v. , no.\u00a0656/06, \u00a7\u00a066, 11\u00a0October 2007; Khudoyorov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a0125, ECHR 2005X; Je\u010dius v. , no.\u00a034578/97, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2000IX; Baranowski v.

As paragraph 9 of the Explanatory Report indicates, the word \u201cresident\u201d operates to exclude those aliens who have not been admitted to the territory or have only been admitted for non-residential purposes (see paragraph 48 above). These exceptions are obviously inapplicable to someone who, like the applicant, had continuously resided in the country for many years. It does not appear plausible to the Court that, after having been admitted for residential purposes and having established his or her residence in a given State, an individual would cease to be \u201cresident\u201d each and every time he or she took a trip abroad, no matter how short in duration. The notion of \u201cresidence\u201d is akin to the autonomous concept of \u201chome\u201d developed under Article 8 of the Convention, in that both are not limited to physical presence but depend on the existence of sufficient and continuous links with a specific place (see, mutatis mutandis, Prokopovich v. Russia, no.\u00a058255/00, \u00a7\u00a036, ECHR 2004XI, and Gillow v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 24 November 1986, \u00a7\u00a046, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0109). In the instant case the applicant had been continuously resident in  since 1994 and he had not established his residence elsewhere. His absence abroad was of a short duration and, on coming back, he expected to continue his residence in . This is all the more evident in the light of the fact that his very young son K. had remained on Russian soil. The Court accordingly finds that the applicant was \u201cresident\u201d in  at the material time.",

The Government did not explain why they considered that the applicant\u2019s visa had been invalid at the time of his attempted return to . The Court, for its part, does not discern any information in the case file to corroborate such an allegation. The visa the applicant possessed entitled him to reside in  and his place of residence had been registered on the basis of that visa (see paragraph 19 above). There had been no deportation order against him or any decision on reducing the term of validity of his visa. Finally, in so far as the Government may be understood to be referring to the effect of the border control\u2019s cancellation of the applicant\u2019s visa in the morning of 3 June 2002 (see paragraph 23 above), the Court considers that this act cannot deprive the applicant of his status as a \u201clawful resident\u201d in the preceding period. Were it otherwise, a decision to expel would in itself remove the individual from the protection of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 with the result that its guarantees would have no sphere of application at all. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government\u2019s claim that the applicant\u2019s residence was not lawful.",

With the exception of extradition, any measure compelling the alien\u2019s departure from the territory where he was lawfully resident constitutes \u201cexpulsion\u201d for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 (ibid.; see also paragraph 10 of the Explanatory Report cited in paragraph 50 above). The Court has no doubt that by issuing a decision of such nature as to bar the applicant from returning to Russia following his next trip abroad, the Russian authorities sought to prevent him from re-entering Russian territory and to compel his definitive departure from . The applicant may therefore be considered to have been \u201cexpelled\u201d.",

The document requested by the Court in the present case was the report of the Federal Security Service dated 18 February 2002 containing the factual grounds for the applicant\u2019s expulsion from  (see details in paragraph 51 of the judgment). The Court notes itself that the report was examined in the domestic proceedings and the applicant\u2019s representative in those proceedings was allowed to take cognisance of its contents, but he could not disclose its contents to the Court because of the confidentiality undertaking he had been required to sign (see paragraph 36). To my mind, the conclusion of the Court is rather strange: \u201cThis fact indicates that the nature of the information contained in the report was not such as to exclude any possibility of making it known to anyone outside the secret intelligence services and the highest State officials\u201d (see paragraph 56).
