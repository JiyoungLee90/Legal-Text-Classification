He had a gun.

It was also after that man arrived that the applicants\u2019 son had let out a terrible scream. Sometimes the man in question left Sandro Girgvliani and came over to hit L.B.-dze.

In the first part of the note D.A.-aia reported the same facts to the Minister as those described by L.B.-dze in his statements concerning the kidnapping and the assault that caused Sandro Girgvliani\u2019s death (see paragraphs 25-28 above). It went on to explain that on the night in question he had been in the Caf\u00e9 Chardin himself with a group of friends until 3.30 a.m., celebrating V.S.-dze\u2019s birthday. G.A.-ia, his subordinate, had also been invited by V.S.-dze. According to D.A.-aia, he had spoken to G.A.-ia several times on the telephone from the Caf\u00e9 Chardin to find out if he was coming. After confirming that he would be coming, G.A.-ia had informed D.A.-aia around 3 a.m. that he would not be able to make it after all.",

He then signalled to Th.M.-dze to come and join him. Th.M.-dze discreetly changed tables a few minutes later. The applicants\u2019 son asked her who the men were with whom she had come to spend the evening. Th.M.-dze said they were friends of her friends and that she did not really know them. So Sandro Girgvliani asked her what she was doing spending her evening with strangers.

Sandro Girgvliani then asked her what she was doing with \u201cthat poof\u201d, referring to G.D.-dze, the Minister of the Interior\u2019s spokesman. According to Th.M.-dze, the tone of their conversation, which lasted 15-20 minutes, was \u201cstilted\u201d and Sandro Girgvliani was gesticulating. At one point A.K.-dze left the Minister of the Interior\u2019s wife and her friends and went over to Th.M.-dze to ask her if everything was all right. Th.M.-dze said it was. A.K.-dze then went to the toilet and, on the way back, asked Th.M.-dze what she was doing. Th.M.dze said she would return to their table shortly. At the end of the conversation, Sandro Girgvliani suggested that Th.M.-dze leave the caf\u00e9 with him. She said she would join him later and asked him to call her in half an hour. Th.M.-dze then went back to her table. The Minister\u2019s wife asked her if \u201ceverything was all right\u201d. Th.M.-dze said she was fine.",

G.G. pointed out the place under a tree where he had seen what looked like the red imprint left by a bloodied face. The friends had gone through the cemetery and started to explore the river gorges. They asked a young village lad who was out bird-hunting (see paragraph\u00a019 above) to help them. The lad spotted what looked like a large blood stain in the snow some way off. They saw that it led to other stains, some of which indicated that Sandro Girgvliani had had to lie down in the snow to rest at regular intervals.

L.B.-dze further stated that he had also been observing M.B.-dze since the start of the trial and was now convinced that he had not been present in Okrokana.

L.B.-dze further explained that at the time of the investigation he had believed that the public prosecutor and he were on the same side. Later, however, he had realised that the prosecutor was strongly backing the hypothesis of an altercation between Sandro Girgvliani and G.A.-ia in the entrance to the caf\u00e9. During the different identification parades on 6 March 2006 the prosecutor had advised him not to request the assistance of a lawyer, as the suspects had just been arrested and no time should be lost.

The investigator, on the other hand, had impressed on him that it would be \u201cextremely serious if he identified the wrong person and that he should think carefully\u201d. L.B.-dze had been able to identify G.A.-ia without any doubt. The investigator had then told him that for the other suspects it would be sufficient for him to say whether there was a physical resemblance. L.B.-dze remembered that when he had been invited into an MP\u2019s office he had said that the man in the photograph looked like the fourth man, who had arrived later at the cemetery, but as he was not certain, he preferred not to incriminate him. He had not really been able to dispel his doubts until he had seen O.M.-ov give evidence in court. Only then had he been convinced, by the way O.M.-ov moved and spoke, that he was indeed the fourth assailant. To make absolutely sure, however, he had borrowed a video recording of O.M.-ov\u2019s hearing from the first applicant which had apparently been made in secret. After watching the recording several times, L.B.-dze had been able to identify O.M.-ov with certainty. He repeated that he could not exclude the possibility that there had been more than four assailants at the cemetery, but he had only seen four. L.B.-dze pointed out that he had said several times in court that he did not know who M.B.-dze was. He also specified that on\u00a06\u00a0March 2006 he had not identified that person as the fourth assailant (see paragraph\u00a060 above). The fourth assailant had kicked him in the face, held a gun against his head and eye and threatened to kill him, and pistol-whipped him. He had then gone over to hit Sandro Girgvliani before coming back to him again. According to L.B.-dze, when it was all over and he found himself alone with his assailants, O.M.-ov had suggested to his friends that they take a photograph of their bruised and naked victim with a mobile phone.",

About an hour and a half after they arrived in the caf\u00e9, the Minister\u2019s wife asked him to go and find her some K-brand cigarettes, a brand they did not stock in the caf\u00e9. D.A.-aia gave him his car keys. He had been drinking, however, and did not want to drive, so, using G.D.-dze\u2019s mobile phone he called V.S.-dze\u2019s chauffeur to drive him.

They bought the cigarettes from a night vendor near the B. supermarket. He then went back to the caf\u00e9. He must have been away for 20-25 minutes.

Indeed, as it later turned out, G.A.-ia, A.A.-uri and A.Gh.-ava had left the Ministry of the Interior in the vehicle concerned at around 1.00 a.m. on 28 January 2006, whilst the seized records of the relevant mobile telephone numbers established that G.A.-ia\u2019s mobile phone had been in communication through the antennas near Okrokana cemetery between 2.00 and 3.00 a.m. That highly sensitive information was immediately reported to the Minister of the Interior who, in his turn, transmitted it to the Chief Public Prosecutor.",

Indeed, the Court notes that it was only at the trial stage, after L.B.-dze had familiarised himself with the case materials, that he finally realised why the public prosecutor had been strongly supporting the hypothesis that he and Sandro Girgvliani might have left the caf\u00e9 separately (see paragraphs 65, 71, 86-87 and 165 above).",

For example, as disclosed by the video recording of the identification parade of 8 March 2006, L.B.-dze tentatively suggested that O.M.-ov resembled one of the assailants. However, the public prosecutor failed to note the suggested resemblance in the relevant written records. Then again, when questioned on 10 March 2006, L.B.-dze reiterated his suspicions concerning O.M.-ov\u2019s possible involvement in the crime, but instead of treating that serious allegation with the requisite vigilance (see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, \u00a7\u00a7 70 and 75, 27 November 2007), the prosecutor re-phrased that statement in the written records in such a manner as to ignore the real content and importance of the information received (see paragraph 80 above). A similar discrepancy between what was actually said by L.B.-dze as regards the circumstances surrounding his and Sandro Girgvliani\u2019s leaving the Caf\u00e9 Chardin and what was recorded by the prosecutor occurred during the first interview of 6\u00a0March 2006. Nor did the prosecutor note L.B.-dze\u2019s statement according to which a friend had come to sit with him exactly at the same time as Sandro Girgvliani was having a stilted conversation with Th.M.-dze at the same table (see paragraphs 63 and 65 above). The Court considers this to be a distortion of the witness\u2019s statements in the written records by the public prosecutor.",

Such a measure was indispensable for the verification of the applicants\u2019 allegation that there had existed some sort of complicity between the direct perpetrators of the crime and the Minister of the Interior\u2019s wife\u2019s group in the caf\u00e9. The Court observes, for instance, that, as disclosed by the case file, one particular telephone number \u2013 8 77 79 89 60 \u2013 was dialled most often on the night in question by both G.A.-ia, one of the perpetrators, and the senior officers of the Ministry of the Interior present in the caf\u00e9.

That statement, in its turn, contradicted the information disclosed by the relevant mobile phone company, according to which the number in question belonged to a certain K.N.-dze from the limited liability company \u201cFalko\u201d.

As to the consideration of the respect for those persons\u2019 privacy, apart from having difficulty in finding the force in that unelaborated and ambiguous argument, the Court would simply note that the prosecution authority could have allowed the applicants and the domestic courts to have those persons examined at least as anonymous witnesses (cf., amongst many other authorities, Kornev and Karpenko v. , no. 17444/04, \u00a7\u00a056, 21\u00a0October 2010).",

Bulgaria, no. 2747/02, \u00a7 91, 8 July 2010). The Court has no doubt that the establishment of that crucial element could have had an impact, inter alia, on the proper classification of the crime (see paragraphs 271 and 272 below).

In addition, by not allowing the applicants and the second civil party to have access to the criminal file or at least to be regularly updated on the developments in the investigation, coupled with certain other serious omissions, the prosecution authority fell short of its obligation to safeguard the interests of the next of kin and to ensure that the investigation received the required level of public scrutiny (see Medova, cited above, \u00a7 109).",

Of particular concern is the fact that the applicants did not have access to the fourteen exhibits, which items represented the backbone of the case, examined in their original form in public and adversarial proceedings. The importance of having direct access to the video materials concerned, rather than to their written transcripts, gains additional weight in the light of the prosecution authority\u2019s propensity to distort the facts in the relevant written records, as noted above by the Court (see paragraphs 252 and 253 above).",

The prosecution and the judicial authorities found that his death had been caused by the treatment inflicted by the four officers. The only possible logical corollary to these two established facts is that the perpetrators first stripped Sandro Girgvliani at Okrokana cemetery, which in itself was a form of deliberately debasing treatment, and then at least one of the group started vigorously cutting him with an unidentified sharp weapon.",

Furthermore, where the perpetrator(s) slashed such a vulnerable area of the victim\u2019s body as the throat twelve times with a sharp weapon, it is only reasonable to assume that the perpetrator(s) actually intended to take Sandro Girgvliani\u2019s life. Another element which emphasises the deliberately life-endangering nature of the attack was the threat and the use of a gun by at least one of the assailants. All things considered, the Court finds it regrettable that, when classifying the offence and passing sentences of from 7 to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment, the adequacy of which punishment is in actual fact doubtful, the domestic courts failed to take into account such manifestly aggravating circumstances as the debasing and particularly cruel nature of the treatment inflicted on the victim, quite deliberately, by the State agents.",

Then, as if that measure of clemency was not generous enough, on 5 September 2009 the prison authority recommended and the relevant domestic court granted the convicts\u2019 release on licence. The Government referred to the necessity of holding offenders accountable before the public at large (see paragraph 229 above). The Court observes in that respect that Georgian society was expected to accept the fact that three years and six months of imprisonment (see paragraphs 61 and 205 above) was sufficient punishment for senior officers of the Ministry of the Interior who had wantonly ill-treated and killed an innocent man.",

The Court cannot take seriously the Government\u2019s explanation, as regards the fourteen exhibits, that so much time was needed to copy some 23 CD\u2019s. As to the criminal proceedings against L.B.-dze, the Court first notes that they were conducted by the Tbilisi City Prosecutor\u2019s Office and not by the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, as claimed by the Government. It is noteworthy that the applicants\u2019 requests for those criminal proceedings to be taken out of the hands of the City Prosecutor and given to the Chief Prosecutor were rejected as unfounded on 4 August 2006 (see paragraph 202 above). Subsequently, as the Government asserted in their observations of 22 December 2008, those proceedings were discontinued.

The answer is that all the issues raised by the Court in the above-mentioned paragraphs should have been clarified by the investigating authorities and not by the domestic courts, because at the material time the judiciary had no right even to return a case for additional investigation without the consent of the prosecution.

However, in paragraph\u00a0104 the Court noted: \u201cAs to Article 38, the Court reiterates that it is applicable to cases which have been declared admissible. Taking into account the Government\u2019s compliance with the Court\u2019s request after the admissibility decision, the Court cannot find that the delays in submitting the information requested were such as to prejudice the establishment of facts or to otherwise prevent the proper examination of the present case. In these circumstances, the Court considers that there has been no breach of Article\u00a038 of the Convention as regards the timing of the submission of the documents requested by the Court\u201d.",

The judgment on the present case is direct evidence that, based on the materials received, the Court made the relevant factual inferences and drew the corresponding legal conclusions. Nothing suggests either that the Court was unable to fulfil its functions because of the Government\u2019s failure to discharge its obligations under the Convention.
