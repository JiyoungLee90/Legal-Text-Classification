The Court recognises the security risk presented by the fact that the applicant had been heavily sentenced for being a member of a terrorist organisation and that the doctor\u2019s consultation room was on the ground floor of the hospital with no window bars. Nevertheless, the Court considers that the insistence on the use of handcuffs during an examination by a gynaecologist, and the presence of three male security officers in the examination room during consultation, even behind a folding screen, were disproportionate security measures, when there were other practical alternatives.

Furthermore, according to the domestic legislation, handcuffs were not to be removed if they did not hinder the medical examination and as long as their removal was not requested by the doctor. These were strict requirements for all prisoners convicted of terrorism-related crimes who had to undergo such examinations. In the Court\u2019s view, these strict measures failed to allow a flexible and more practical approach to be taken, depending on the particular risk presented by such a prisoner and the type of medical examination to be performed.
