The Court of Appeal referred to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and noted that what was reasonable for the length of criminal proceedings depended on the specific circumstances of the case. It considered that failure to conduct criminal proceedings within a reasonable time did not necessarily require the person\u2019s acquittal; depending on the circumstances it could also be proportionate to terminate criminal proceedings for reasons of inappropriateness or to take unreasonable length of proceedings into account in the imposition of a punishment. The Court of Appeal found that the criminal proceedings in the present case had lasted for ten years and six months. It considered it \u201cnot unimportant\u201d that the applicant had been kept in detention for almost five years and two months. It held that the proceedings had not been conducted within a reasonable time. Considering the above, the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to reduce the applicant\u2019s sentence. He was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment for murder and one year\u2019s imprisonment for destruction of property and the composite sentence was set at eight years.",

It observes that the applicant was arrested on 1 December 2003 and subsequent to the City Court\u2019s authorisation to take him into custody his detention was regularly extended until the criminal case was transferred to the City Court for judicial proceedings in September 2004. By that time the applicant had been in pre-trial detention for less than ten months. During the judicial proceedings in the Narva City Court and Viru County Court the applicant repeatedly requested to be released but these requests were rejected (see paragraph 25 above). No procedural appeal could be lodged against these rulings. The Court considers that the domestic authorities have had an opportunity to put right the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. In the context of the present case it is not of decisive importance whether or not the applicant appealed against the initial decision whereby his detention was authorised or against the decisions to extend his detention during the pre-trial investigation, as at that time the issue of the compatibility of the length of his detention with Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 had not necessarily arisen. As to the question whether the applicant should have raised this issue in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in the main proceedings, the Court notes that at the time when the applicant lodged his application with the Court his case was still pending before the first-instance court and therefore such an appeal was not a remedy available to the applicant at the material time.

However, this general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, inter alia, Eckle v.\u00a0Germany, 15 July 1982, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 51; Jansen v.

In cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable time requirement guaranteed by Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress, in particular by reducing the applicant\u2019s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see, among others, Cocchiarella v.

Furthermore, the court proceedings had to be resumed from the beginning because of the presiding judge\u2019s death during the proceedings and subsequent withdrawal of two judges. What is more, there were considerable delays between the scheduled hearings. On the basis of the information available to the Court, it appears that from 2005 to 2008 there were five scheduled hearing days per year on an average, about half of which were adjourned. Thus, leaving aside the question of whether the grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention continued to be \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d throughout its duration, the Court finds that the authorities, in any event, cannot be said to have displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings.",

Considering the applicant\u2019s status as a witness and the shortness and superficiality of the interview, the Court does not consider that the applicant became affected on this date either. The Court finds that it is appropriate to consider 17 August 2001 as the starting date of the criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant. At that date a police investigator drew up charges against the applicant, he was declared a fugitive the authorities having failed to spot him, and a court authorised his detention if found. The Court considers that the applicant must have become aware on one of these days of the fact that he had been looked for by the authorities. It takes note of the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant went into hiding at that time, that he was arrested only about two years and four months later and that therefore the period up to his arrest could not be taken into consideration. The Court does not agree with this approach in the context of the determination of the starting date of the criminal proceedings.
