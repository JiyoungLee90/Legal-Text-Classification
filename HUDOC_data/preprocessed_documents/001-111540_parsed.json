Although the Government acknowledged that the legal position on this matter under domestic law had been less clear prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in 2005, they submitted that following this judgment the legal position must have been considered sufficiently clear.

These are, as noted by the Government, legitimate aims for regulating the access to court. However, these aims are directed not only to protect creditors but also to protect the debtors. Thus, while the Court agrees with the Government that creditors have an interest to enforce their rights speedily and efficiently, it also considers that the debtors have to be able to protect correctly their interests. In principle, this does not rule out that once a decision on the distribution and payment of attached funds has gained legal force, certain limitations on appeal of the actual attachment decision may be imposed in order to create certainty and predictability as to the legal effects of the decisions.",

In the Court\u2019s view, this includes the need for legal certainty for the debtor to be able to trust that the time-limit for appeal given in the law and expressly mentioned in a decision is valid and not open to exceptions, unless those exceptions are explicitly mentioned.

Consequently, the decision of distribution and payment of funds gained legal force on 15 September 2005, whereas the time-limit for appeal against the attachment order expired on 29 September 2005. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1990 judgment, with reference to Chapter 18, Article\u00a014, of the Enforcement Code, had established that an appeal against an attachment decision that was lodged after a decision regarding the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force could not be considered by the court, the applicant was in reality blocked from having his appeal tried, despite having followed the instructions about appeal in the attachment decision. Moreover, since he had not been informed about the distribution and payment of the attached funds, he was not aware of this limitation. To the Court, this cannot be considered satisfactory and it is of the opinion that the national system lacked safeguards to avoid such a situation.",
