However, on 18 February 2010 the Government of the Russian Federation issued an opinion (no.\u00a0626-p-P4), suggesting, inter alia, that the latter provision be deleted from the draft, arguing that the main purpose of the new legislation was to address nonenforcement of judgments against the State, its entities and municipalities, that is, public-law entities. The relevant paragraph was therefore deleted from the final draft Compensation Act as it was tabled in Parliament on 22\u00a0March\u00a02010.",

The courts\u2019 conclusions were supported by references to Russia\u2019s undertakings under the Convention and to the Court\u2019s case-law. They considered in particular that the reference to \u201ca judgment establishing a debt to be recovered from the State budgets\u201d should not restrict the scope of the Compensation Act to monetary obligations since the State\u2019s obligations in kind were also fulfilled at the expense of the State\u2019s budget (see, for example, the judgment by the Northern Caucasus Circuit Military Court of 13\u00a0July 2010 cited in Ilyushkin and Others v. Russia, nos. 5734/08 et al., \u00a7\u00a012, 17 April 2012).

The first case was brought by the Leningrad Circuit Military Court, which had reached the conclusion that section 1(1) of the Compensation Act was unconstitutional. The second was brought by an individual, Mr\u00a0Golovin, whose complaint on account of the delayed enforcement of a judgment against a private person had earlier been dismissed by the Saratov Regional Court and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court found both applications inadmissible by decisions delivered on 18\u00a0January (no.\u00a045O-O) and 8\u00a0February 2011 (no.\u00a0115-O-O), respectively. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, it was not acceptable that the public authorities could abuse their special position resulting from the impossibility of seizure of their budgetary funds through enforcement proceedings; the proper enforcement of such judgments should therefore be ensured through other means, such as the establishment of appropriate procedures for liability and effective remedies in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention. That the Compensation Act only addressed the delayed enforcement of judgments of a particular type did not mean that the legislator excluded the right to claim damages for other instances of delayed enforcement resulting from the fault of another. Referring to the above-mentioned Ruling by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court found that the general provisions of the Civil Code allowed compensation for delayed enforcement of judgments in cases falling outside the Compensation Act. As a result, the Constitutional Court did not find that section 1(1) of the Compensation Act violated the constitutional rights of the persons concerned. It added that it could not take over the legislator\u2019s function in extending the scope of the Compensation Act.",

The introduction of modern information technologies into the judicial system was found to be necessary. The programme envisaged in particular the setting up of a computer-based information system with the Federal Bailiff Service and development of an electronic archive. The latest Federal Programme, named \u201cJustice\u201d (Decree no.\u00a0517r of 4\u00a0April\u00a02013), listed the improvement of the quality of the enforcement of judicial decisions among the priorities of the State\u2019s official policy in the area.",

A pilot judgment procedure was accordingly set in motion. In so doing, the Court took account of its finding that large groups of people were still deprived of an effective domestic remedy and thus compelled to seek redress in the Court for straightforward violations of their Convention rights (see Kalinkin and Others v. Russia, nos. 16967/10 et al., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03738, 17\u00a0April 2012, and Ilyushkin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-44).

This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, thus fundamentally undermining respect for human rights as defined in the Convention. The Court accordingly communicated the present applications with an emphasis on Article 13 (see paragraphs 6 above and 141 below), which gives direct expression to the States\u2019 obligation, enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention, to protect human rights first and foremost within their own legal systems (see Kud\u0142a v.

Thus, the applicant Ms Kostyleva obtained two judgments by the domestic court acknowledging unlawful inaction on the part of the respondent administration and awarding substantial compensation in that regard (see paragraphs 82 and 84. above). The Government also provided three similar decisions by the courts of general jurisdiction awarding compensation for non-enforcement of judgments against the State authorities concerning the provision of housing: the judgment of 6\u00a0June\u00a02008 by the Nevskiy District Court of Saint-Petersburg awarding RUB\u00a030,000 to each applicant for an enforcement delay of eight years, the judgment of 19\u00a0April\u00a02012 by the Syktyvkar Town Court awarding RUB\u00a035,000 for an enforcement delay of four years, and the judgment of 1\u00a0September\u00a02010 by the Iglinskiy District Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan awarding RUB\u00a050,000 to each applicant for an enforcement delay of five years.

As the Court has repeatedly held in its judgments, while the possibility of such compensation was not totally excluded \u2013 and was indeed granted in certain rare cases \u2013 this remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, being notably conditional on the establishment of the authorities\u2019 fault (see Burdov (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 110). The Court reiterates its view that such fault is particularly difficult to establish as the respondent authority may delay execution of a domestic judgment due to various obstacles which do not, as a rule, entail the authorities\u2019 civil responsibility under the Russian law (ibid., \u00a7 111). The establishment of fault as a precondition for the State\u2019s responsibility for delayed enforcement of judgments by respondent State authorities is still difficult to reconcile with the very strong presumption that such delays will occasion non-pecuniary damage (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 100 and 111, and compare Section 1(3) of the Compensation Act).",

The Court thus consistently held that a delay of less than one year in payment of a monetary judicial award was in principle compatible with the Convention, while any longer delay was prima facie unreasonable (see, among many others, Kosheleva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a09046/07, \u00a7 19, 17 January 2012). However, this presumption may be rebutted in view of particular circumstances and with due regard to the aforementioned criteria of \u201creasonableness\u201d (see, for example, Belayev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 36020/02, 22 March 2011, where a delay of more than one year in payment of a judgment debt was considered acceptable given the applicant\u2019s uncooperative stance).",

The enforcement of certain judgments of that type must, in the Court\u2019s view, be completed within a stricter time-limit. For example, the judgment in Ms\u00a0Troshina\u2019s favour required a straightforward act to be taken by the administration, that is, to respond to the applicant\u2019s request for certain data from the land register. As regards the applications of Mr Gerasimov, Ms Baranova and Mr\u00a0Starostenkov, the domestic judgments in their favour were more burdensome for the respondent authorities but nonetheless required special diligence given what was at stake for the applicants (respectively, the obligation to ensure basic utility services and renovation, the provision of heating supply in time for the cold season and a car for rehabilitation of a person affected by a lifelong disability). The Court considers that a delay in the enforcement of any of these four judgments exceeding six months should in principle be considered as unreasonably long and, therefore, inconsistent with the Convention requirements.",

The Court has already acknowledged that enforcing a judgment requiring allocation of housing may take longer than the payment of a monetary sum (see Kravchenko and Others, no.\u00a011609/05, \u00a7\u00a035, 21\u00a0February 2011). In the great majority of such housing cases decided in the past, violations of the Convention were found on account of enforcement delays exceeding two years (see more than one hundred applications decided by groups in Kravchenko and Others; Zolotareva and Others; Ilyushkin and Others; and Kalinkin and Others, all cited above). The Court will thus presume, with due regard to the complexity of housing allocation procedures, that a delay of below two years in the enforcement of such a judgment would not be incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement unless it disclosed an exceptional situation requiring special diligence. For example, enforcement delays of one year or longer were considered by the Court to violate the Convention when a judgment ordered the applicants\u2019 rehousing from derelict buildings (see Bulycheva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a024086/04, \u00a7\u00a033, 8 April 2010, and Nevolin v.

This factor has, however, to be carefully balanced against the respondent State\u2019s attitude and efforts to combat such a practice with a view to meeting its obligations under the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0156).

The Court takes account, at the same time, of Ms Kostyleva\u2019s situation, which is marked by the defendant authority\u2019s persistent and extremely prolonged failure to comply with the two judgments in her favour notwithstanding her repeated attempts to secure enforcement by all available means in domestic law. It also takes account of the fact that the judgments remained unenforced for more than two years after the payment of the domestic compensation award and that there is still no solution in sight for the applicant, who continues to live in the very poor conditions that the domestic court found to endanger her life and health (paragraphs 31-33 above). All these elements taken together increase the applicant\u2019s distress and frustration and justify, in the Court\u2019s view, a higher award than those referred to by the Government.

Its primary aim is to facilitate the implementation of the judgment by indicating to the respondent State certain measures to be taken, if appropriate, within a certain time-limit, so as to resolve the structural problem that has led to the violations found by the Court. Another important aim is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. The Court may thus decide to adjourn adjudication of such cases, awaiting their resolution at the domestic level in accordance with the pilot judgment.

The Convention has consistently been interpreted as not allowing a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt within a reasonable time (see Burdov, cited above, \u00a7 35). However, the materials at the Court\u2019s disposal clearly show systematic delays in the State\u2019s compliance with its social obligations enshrined in the law and upheld by domestic courts (see, in particular, paragraphs 106, 112 and 208 above).",

The bailiffs\u2019 repeated threats under Article 315 of the Criminal Code did not yield a single criminal sanction (paragraphs 32, 37, 43, 63-65 above) and their decision to impose a fine on the respondent authority in accordance with the Code of Administrative Offences was quashed by the court (paragraph\u00a042 above).

As a result, people affected by the most basic and undisputable violations of the Convention, like those acknowledged by the Government in the present case, still continue to seek redress before the Court in the first instance. As the Court has repeatedly noted, this situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which commands that the High Contracting Parties bear primary responsibility for securing the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. It observes, moreover, that a number of applicants further complain that the domestic judgments in their favour remain unenforced at the domestic level notwithstanding the Court\u2019s judgments obligating the State to secure their enforcement by appropriate means (see paragraph 114 above).

While the effects of the most recent encouraging developments reported by the authorities with regard to the housing allocated to servicemen still remain to be assessed (see paragraph 106 above), the ultimate solution to the structural problems identified by the Court in paragraphs 213-215 above will no doubt require further general measures. Particular attention would have to be paid to the bailiffs\u2019 and other authorities\u2019 present incapacity to secure enforcement in such cases and the need to find appropriate mechanisms to that effect. However, given the complex legal, practical and policy considerations involved, the assessment of the specific measures required goes beyond the Court\u2019s judicial function. It is not the Court\u2019s task to advise the respondent Government in such a complex legal, political and budgetary process, let alone recommend a particular way of organising the domestic enforcement procedure in respect of judgments against the State. The Court will thus abstain in these circumstances from indicating any specific measure to be taken. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the general measures to ensure that all domestic judgments against the State authorities and entities be enforced within a reasonable time (see Burdov (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0136-37, and Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0194).",

The Russian authorities may obviously choose the most straightforward solution, extending the scope of the Compensation Act to all cases concerning nonenforcement of judgments delivered against the State and the Court welcomes the recent legislative initiatives to that end (see paragraphs 107108 above). The authorities may nonetheless choose to introduce changes to other legal texts that would produce the same effect. Any legislative exercise would benefit from the Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraphs 97 and 101), the Supreme Court\u2019s experience that resulted in its draft law of 2008 (Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-37), the Committee of Ministers\u2019 texts adopted under Article 46 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above) and its more general Recommendations CM/Rec\u00a0(2004)\u00a06 and CM/Rec\u00a0(2010)\u00a03 on effective domestic remedies. It would be, for instance, quite appropriate for the authorities to seek, by any means, to combine a compensatory remedy with an acceleratory one (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035), at least for certain cases involving persistent enforcement delays or requiring special diligence in the enforcement process (see, in particular, paragraphs 152 and 170 above).",
