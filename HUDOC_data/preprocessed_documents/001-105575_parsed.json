The fact that, since the 1993 amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Act, prisoners were affiliated to the unemployment insurance scheme was not conclusive as regards the question of their affiliation to the old-age pension system. In essence, the applicant raised a question of legal or social policy. However, it was not for the courts but for the legislature to decide whether or not to change the provisions relating to the social insurance of prisoners. In that connection, the Court of Appeal noted that it did not share the applicant\u2019s doubts regarding the possible unconstitutionality of working prisoners\u2019 non-affiliation to the old-age pension scheme.",

Legal commentators also favour the interpretation that social insurance law, like labour law, requires that employment contracts be established voluntarily. Services rendered compulsorily under public law are not based on any service contract. Accordingly, work performed in the context of execution of a sentence cannot be subsumed within section 4(2) of the General Social Security Act (see Krejci-Marhold in Tomandl, SV-System 3. ErgLfg 46; MGA ASVG 49, ErgLfg\u00a0125; Krejci in Rummel, ABGB \u00a7 1151 Rz 16). In its judgment of 26\u00a0November 1971 (B 128/71, VfSlg 6582 = SVSlg 21.170), the Constitutional Court held that the decision of the legislature that work performed in the context of execution of a prison sentence did not fall within the social insurance scheme \u2013 because the requisite voluntary acceptance of a specific duty to work required in order to make out a contract of employment necessitating the payment of social insurance contributions was absent \u2013 did not infringe the principle of equal treatment.",

Such periods of time, regarded as valid compulsory contributory periods, are to be regarded in the first-mentioned case as not requiring the payment of contributions (section 502(1), third sentence); in the second-mentioned case, the Federal State shall pay the corresponding contributions to the relevant insurance institution (section 506a, second sentence). The purpose in both cases is to compensate for the disadvantages incurred under social insurance law that have arisen on socially acceptable grounds rather than deprivation of liberty on grounds of guilty conduct. An extension of these exceptional provisions to time served in detention on grounds of culpable conduct would be contrary to the principle of equal treatment. Recognition of such periods of time as substitute periods would also be contrary to the principle of equal treatment, for similar reasons. ... Prisoners to whom the above-mentioned exceptions under section 502(1) and section\u00a0506a do not apply shall not thereby accumulate, in the context of their duty to work, either contributory periods under the compulsory insurance scheme or substitute periods. They are not, however, prevented by the execution of the sentence from continuing to make contributions to the old-age pension insurance scheme under section 17 and accumulating contributory periods through the payment of voluntary contributions, whereby continued insurance, at the request of the contributor, as far as this appears justified on the basis of his or her economic situation, shall be permitted, in accordance with section 76a(4), at a lower contribution level than the one provided for in subsections (1-3) of that provision. In accordance with section 75(3) of the Execution of Sentences Act, prisoners are to be informed of the possibilities and advantages of, inter alia, optional continued insurance, and they are also permitted to use funds for the payment of contributions to the social insurance scheme which are not otherwise available to them during execution of their sentence. By virtue of the very flexible continued insurance (see section 17(7-8)) \u2013 particularly in respect of the beginning, end and determination of the contributory months \u2013 a prisoner can also accumulate further contributory months in order to make up the qualifying period and/or obtain a higher pensions increment. In this connection, the fact should not be overlooked that if one were to proceed on the basis that a prisoner is covered under the invalidity and old-age pension insurance scheme in respect of work done during the execution of the sentence, contributions would accordingly have to be made for the relevant periods. Other than under section 506a, according to which the Federal State has to pay the contributions corresponding to these contributory periods (as part of the criminal compensation scheme) to the relevant insurance institution, a State contribution would not be reasonable here. ... It would not be reasonable in such cases to expect the community of insured persons to accept that periods for which no contributions have been made should give rise to pension entitlements; prisoners would have to make such contributions, so the position would not be essentially different from optional insurance. Accordingly, if the legislature has decided that work done in the context of a prisoner\u2019s duty to work cannot fundamentally give rise to compulsory contributory periods or substitute periods and, in the light of that, has made provision only for the above-mentioned exceptions, that decision is based on objective considerations.",

Noting that prison work for private employers was prohibited by Article 2 \u00a7 2 (c) of ILO Convention No. 29, the Committee found that there might be conditions in which, notwithstanding their captive circumstances, prisoners could be considered to have offered themselves voluntarily and without the menace of any penalty for work with a private employer. In this connection, apart from the formal written consent of the prisoner, conditions approximating a free labour relationship (in terms of wage levels, social security and occupational safety and health) were regarded to be the most reliable indicator of the voluntariness of labour. If such conditions were met, prison work for private enterprises was considered not to come under the definition of forced labour provided in Article 2 \u00a7 1 and, consequently, was considered to fall outside the scope of ILO Convention No. 29 (paragraphs 59-60 and 114-16 of the Committee\u2019s report).",

Working hours are adapted to the prison context, including certain favourable measures such as counting time spent in therapeutic or social treatment as working time up to five hours per week. Moreover, prisoners receive remuneration for their work, of which 75% is, however, deducted as a maintenance contribution. The Court notes in the first place that collecting such a contribution is not in itself at variance with the Convention (see Puzinas v.

However, the Court notes that the wording used in Rule 26.17 is cautious (\u201c[a]s far as possible\u201d) and refers to inclusion in national social security systems in general terms. Moreover, while an absolute majority of Council of Europe member States provide prisoners with some kind of social security, only a small majority affiliate prisoners to their old-age pension system, some of them, like Austria, only by giving them the possibility of making voluntary contributions. A minority do not include prisoners in the old-age pension system at all (see paragraph 60 above).",

In addition, working prisoners have been affiliated to the unemployment insurance scheme since 1 January 1994, following the 1993 amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Act which formed part of a broader reform of the system of execution of sentences. As the Government explained, the reason for that decision was that the legislature considered unemployment insurance to be the most efficient instrument for assisting prisoners\u2019 reintegration upon release as, in addition to payment of unemployment benefits, it granted access to a whole range of training and job-search facilities. At the time of the 1993 reform, affiliation to the old-age pension system had been envisaged, but it has so far not been put in place as a result of the strained financial situation of the social security institutions.",

It would rather attach weight to the fact that the applicant, although not entitled to an old-age pension, was not left without social cover.

According to his own submissions, the applicant currently still receives emergency relief payments complemented by social assistance in the form of a housing allowance.

In my view, the Court need not have gone so far. Contrary to what is suggested in paragraph\u00a095, the General Social Security Act is not intended \u201cto provide for old age\u201d generally, but only to make provision for, inter alia, an old-age pension for persons who are gainfully employed. By no stretch of the imagination can the applicant be considered to have been, while in prison, \u201cgainfully employed\u201d, the notion of gainful employment implying a measure of contribution to the national economy. In my view, therefore, the applicant, as a prisoner working in the prison kitchen or prison bakery, was simply not in a relevantly similar situation to ordinary employees (a point which is only hesitantly referred to in paragraph 93 of the judgment and then discarded). The position might have been different if he were performing work (whether within the prison confines or without) for a private person or company; or if he were engaged in producing things which the prison authorities then sell on the open market in direct competition with other producers; but that is not the case here.",

Again, I fail to follow the reasoning. Work which is excepted under Article 4 \u00a7 3 (because it is required to be done \u201cin the ordinary course of detention\u201d) does not cease to be so excepted because it is paid or unpaid, or because the prisoner is or is not affiliated to a pension scheme. Nor do the European Prison Rules (of 1987 and 2006) come into the picture in the instant case. What one has to look at is the nature of the work performed by the applicant. In this case, the applicant was not made to stand by the side of a public road to break stones with a sledgehammer \u2013 he worked in the prison kitchen and prison bakery, which must surely rank as an \u201cordinary\u201d contribution to the work that must necessarily be carried out in any community by its members, be that community domestic, monastic or penal.

We would observe that there is nowadays an evolving trend in the Council of Europe member States towards the affiliation of working prisoners to national social security systems. The 2006 European Prison Rules reflect the position of all the Council of Europe member States in terms of policy. On the basis of Rules 64 and 65 of the 1987 European Prison Rules, they lay down the principle of normalisation of detention conditions as the basis of policy on execution of sentences. They explicitly recommend that \u201c[a]s far as possible, prisoners who work [should] be included in national social security systems\u201d (Rule 26.17).

Section 4(2) of the General Social Security Act, as interpreted by the domestic courts, provides for the automatic exclusion of working prisoners from the compulsory old-age pension system. The applicant thus worked for twenty-eight years as a prisoner without ever having been affiliated to the system. Besides the consideration that working prisoners are in a different situation from ordinary employees in that they do not perform work on the basis of an employment contract but by virtue of a statutory obligation, the exclusion is mainly based on the premise that prisoners do not have the necessary means to pay contributions to the old-age pension system. However, this situation is a result of the State\u2019s deliberate policy choice to withhold 75% of a working prisoner\u2019s remuneration as a maintenance contribution, a percentage which is particularly high. Prisoners are thus in a sense \u201ccondemned\u201d to be unable to pay sufficient contributions.",

In our view, there is a lack of balance between the possible public interest in ensuring that prisoners contribute towards the costs incurred by the community as a result of their imprisonment and the individual prisoner\u2019s interest in providing for old age. Nowadays, because of the long-term sentences being imposed in many countries, the presence of an older prison population is a new sociological reality which will necessarily raise the question of old-age pensions for such prisoners at the time of their release. The applicant\u2019s case is a good example. He has spent twenty-eight years of his life in prison and was released at the age of sixty-six.",

The former constitute assistance, whereas the latter is a right. The difference is significant in terms of respect for human dignity. Social security forms an integral part of human dignity. In addition, it is now acknowledged in modern penology that social rehabilitation implies the development of personal responsibility.

Germany (nos. 3134/67, 3172/67 and 3188-3206/67, Commission decision of 6 April 1968, Collection 27, pp.\u00a097116), in which the application was declared manifestly ill-founded.",

Traditionally regarded as an area outside the law, prisons have gradually opened up to fundamental rights, to the benefit not only of prisoners but also of the prison authorities and their staff. Thus, regarding the same issue of prisoners\u2019 remuneration which formed the subject of the Commission\u2019s 1968 inadmissibility decision referred to in the previous paragraph, it is interesting to note that thirty years later, in a judgment of 1 July 1998, the German Federal Constitutional Court held, on the contrary, that since the State had a constitutional duty to promote prisoners\u2019 social rehabilitation and had chosen compulsory prison work as one of the means of achieving that aim, it had to ensure appropriate remuneration for such work, which could not yield the expected results unless it was properly rewarded. Although the Constitutional Court did not specify the amount that would constitute an appropriate reward, it held that it was unconstitutional to pay prisoners low wages that bore no relation to the value of the work performed or to the minimum wage in the outside world. The guiding principle is that of human dignity. Similarly, Rule 26.10 of the 2006 European Prison Rules emphasises the need for equitable remuneration for prisoners.",

This situation thus clearly entails \u2013 as was not disputed \u2013 work under the menace of a penalty within the meaning of the International Labour Organization Forced Labour Convention (No. 29), and hence forced or compulsory labour.",

I do not think so. This, in my view, is the fundamental point. Nowadays, work without adequate social cover can no longer be regarded as normal work. It follows that the exception provided for in Article 4 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention is not applicable in the present case. Even a prisoner cannot be forced to do work that is abnormal. In the examination of the case under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, moreover, the judgment notes explicitly that \u201cthe applicant as a working prisoner was in a relevantly similar situation to ordinary employees\u201d (see paragraph 95 of the judgment).",

This argument, to my mind, raises two difficulties. The first is of a factual nature. Nowadays, with the development of long-term prison sentences, the profile of prisoners has changed and the reality is that prisons house increasing numbers of older inmates. Whereas for younger prisoners, the requirements of social rehabilitation encompass health and accident cover and affiliation to the unemployment insurance scheme, for older prisoners they also include the guarantee of an old-age pension. The second difficulty is of a legal nature. What role is there in the present case for a European consensus, the main function of which is to determine the extent of the margin of appreciation? The flexibility inherent in the margin of appreciation is admittedly an essential factor, but, as the Court has frequently repeated, it must go hand in hand with European supervision. Such supervision was lacking in the present case.",
