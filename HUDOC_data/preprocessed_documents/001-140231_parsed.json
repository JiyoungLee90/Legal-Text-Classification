It requires that where an issue pertaining to the general interest is at stake, especially when it affects fundamental human rights, including property rights, the public authorities must act promptly and in an appropriate and above all consistent manner (see Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2004XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a021151/04, \u00a7 72, 8 April 2008; and Rysovskyy v. Ukraine, no.\u00a029979/04, \u00a7\u00a071, 20\u00a0October 2011). It is desirable that public authorities act with the utmost care, in particular when dealing with matters of vital importance to individuals, such as welfare benefits and other such rights. In the present case, the Court considers that having discovered their mistake, the authorities failed in their duty to act speedily and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Moskal, cited above, \u00a7 72).",

The Court notes in this connection that the applicant, after his right to the EWK pension had been confirmed by the authorities, decided to resign from his gainful employment (see paragraph 10 above).",

Moreover, the Court is aware of the potential risk that, in view of his age and the economic reality in the country, particularly in the undeveloped Podkarpacki region, the applicant might have had considerable difficulty in securing new employment. Indeed, it took the applicant more than four years after finding a job to earn the equivalent of the amount of his former EWK pension that is, approximately 50% of the average brut salary per month (see paragraphs 9 and 24 above).",
