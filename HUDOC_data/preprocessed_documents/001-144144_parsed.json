In certain circumstances, legal certainty can be disturbed in order to correct a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d or a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Kot v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020887/03, \u00a7\u00a024, 18\u00a0January 2007; Protsenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a013151/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-34, 31\u00a0July 2008; and Tishkevich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02202/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02526, 4\u00a0December 2008). In such cases, the Court has to assess, in particular, whether a fair balance was struck between the interests of the applicants and the need to ensure the proper administration of justice (see, mutatis mutandis, Kurinnyy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a036495/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013 and 2728, 12\u00a0June 2008). The judgment in question can be quashed exclusively in order to rectify an error of truly fundamental importance to the judicial system (see Shchurov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a040713/04, \u00a7\u00a021, 29\u00a0March 2011). The \u201cright to a court\u201d would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final and enforceable judicial decision to be quashed by a higher court and the case be reexamined merely on the grounds that the higher court disagreed with the assessment made by the lower courts (see Kot, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02730).",

As concerns the first-instance court\u2019s alleged failure to examine whether the same issue had already been determined by the Justice of the Peace on 25\u00a0March 2003, the Court reiterates its settled approach, that it is primarily for the domestic courts to interpret and apply the domestic law. Nevertheless, the Court is compelled to note that the judgment of 15\u00a0September 2004 contains an explicit reference to the earlier judicial decision, and states that the amount awarded on 25\u00a0March 2003 had been calculated to take into account the rise in inflation, but not the increase to the minimum wage for the specified period. Accordingly, the reason the judgment was quashed was in fact confined to a disagreement between the lower court and the Presidium as to whether the two adjustment methods could have been applied in the case at hand. In the Court\u2019s view, that disagreement did not go beyond the issue of the interpretation of the substantive law as applied by the domestic courts (see paragraph\u00a024 above). Lastly, as regards the Government\u2019s allegation about an incorrect application of the pensions law, the Court reiterates its settled approach, that in the absence of a fundamental defect in previous proceedings, a party\u2019s disagreement with the assessment made by the lower courts is not, in itself, a circumstance of substantial and compelling character warranting the quashing of a binding and enforceable judgment and a re-opening of the proceedings on the applicant\u2019s claim (see, among many other authorities, Dovguchits v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02999/03, \u00a7\u00a030, 7\u00a0June 2007). In any event, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine those arguments in further detail, for the following reason.",
