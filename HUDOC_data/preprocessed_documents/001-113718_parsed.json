The rule is based on the assumption that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no.\u00a024). At the same time, it is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v.

It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature (see Toshev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a056308/00, \u00a7 58, 10 August 2006). However, the words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2002-IV). Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see, among others, Dougoz v.

The Government argued that a time-limit was indicated implicitly and that the applicant was to be detained for two months, that is, the maximum period of initial placement in custody provided for in Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure. The Court observes that this argument contradicts the interpretation of the relevant national legislation given by the Russian Constitutional Court, which has emphasised on several occasions that the national courts are under an obligation to set a time-limit when ordering an individual\u2019s placement in, or extending the period of, pre-trial detention at any stage of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 30 above). It is therefore clear that, by omitting to specify such a time-limit, the District Court failed to comply with the applicable rules of domestic criminal procedure.",

The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure clearly provides that an initial period of pre-trial detention may not exceed two months. It also takes into account the fact that the applicant did not claim that he had not been aware of that provision. The Court, however, is not persuaded that the maximum time-limit provided for in Article 109 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure should be applied implicitly each time an individual\u2019s placement in custody is authorised by a domestic court. It is true that this period, in itself, does not appear unreasonably long and can be justified by the need for the authorities to ensure the proper conduct of various investigative actions. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the  ruled that the period of one\u2019s detention should be clearly defined by a domestic court, this being an essential guarantee against arbitrariness. With this in mind, the Court considers that the absence of any specific time-limit in the District Court\u2019s decision of 4\u00a0February 2011 amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d capable of rendering the applicant\u2019s detention pursuant to that order arbitrary and therefore \u201cunlawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Accordingly, there has been a violation of that provision as regards the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention from 4\u00a0February to 24\u00a0March 2011.",

In this connection, the Court takes into account the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant contributed to a certain extent to the length of the appeal proceedings. He sent his statement of appeal to the appeal court while he was required by law to send it to the court of first instance for processing purposes. The appeal court had to resend the document to the court of first instance, which, undoubtedly, caused a delay in the scheduling and preparing of the appeal hearing. Nevertheless, despite that omission on the applicant\u2019s part, the Court is not convinced that the review of the applicant\u2019s detention was speedy. The Government have not provided any explanation as to the length of time it took for the delivery of correspondence between courts located within the boundaries of the same city. It notes that it took the authorities sixteen days on one occasion and six days on another to deliver documentation from one court to the other and back. In the Court\u2019s view, it was those delays that significantly protracted the appeal proceedings. The fact that the correspondence delivery system between the courts did not function effectively cannot serve to justify the deprivation of the applicant of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention: it is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of that provision (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no. 50272/99, \u00a7\u00a078, ECHR\u00a02003IV).",
