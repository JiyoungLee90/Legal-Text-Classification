Although the question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Peers v. Greece, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06768 and 74, ECHR 2001-III, and Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania, no. , \u00a7 101, ECHR 2001VIII).
