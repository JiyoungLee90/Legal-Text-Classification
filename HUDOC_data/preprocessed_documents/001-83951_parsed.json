Although at the time of the events giving rise to the present application the applicant company was wholly owned by the State and currently an important part of its shares still belong to the State and a majority of the members of the board of directors are appointed by the State, it is legally and financially independent of the State, as transpires from Article 3 of the memorandum of association. In this connection the Court notes that in the Radio France and Others case, which was relied on by the Government, it found that the national company Radio France was a \u201cnon-governmental organisation\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention despite the fact that the State held all of the capital in Radio France, its memorandum and articles of association were approved by decree, its resources were to a large extent public, it performed \u201cpublic-service missions in the general interest\u201d, and it was obliged to comply with terms of reference and to enter into a contract with the State setting out its objectives and means. Therefore, it follows that public-law entities can have the status of a \u201cnon-governmental organisation\u201d in so far as they do not exercise \u201cgovernmental powers\u201d, were not established \u201cfor public-administration purposes\u201d and are completely independent of the State (see The Holy Monasteries, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

However, the idea behind this principle is to prevent a Contracting Party acting as both an applicant and a respondent party before the Court. The circumstances of the present case are therefore different from those cited by the Government and the fact that the applicant company was incorporated in a State which is not party to the Convention makes no difference in this respect. Furthermore, the Court finds that the applicant company is governed essentially by company law, does not enjoy any powers beyond those conferred by ordinary law in the exercise of its activities and is subject to the jurisdiction of the ordinary rather than the administrative courts. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant company is run as a commercial business and that therefore there is nothing to suggest that the present application was effectively brought by the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is not a party to the Convention.",
