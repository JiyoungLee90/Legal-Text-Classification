They received the full text of the judgment on the same day, which included the reasons for finding the applicants guilty of fraud. The court found that the applicants had set up a \u201cfake company\u201d, GPA, with the intention to use it as an intermediary to offer services to two clients of Russian Post, MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok. It held that the second applicant had taken advantage of insider information that Russian Post had ceased to provide the companies with certain services for lack of operational capacity and had convinced those clients to use GPA as a substitute; that he had misled the clients about GPA\u2019s pricing policy and its relationship with Russian Post, thus depriving them of the freedom of choice of service providers; that he had promoted his company\u2019s services while knowing that it would have to subcontract the work to other companies; and that GPA had retained the difference in price between what MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok paid for its services and what GPA paid to its subcontractors. The court concluded that the latter margin had been stolen from MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok by the applicants through GPA. The court further established that the amounts in question constituted the proceeds of crime, and that using that money to pay GPA\u2019s office rent, legal services, dividends to the applicants and for transfers to affiliated companies had constituted money laundering.",

According to the Government, he had contacted Russian Post\u2019s counterparties and deliberately misled them and had induced them to sign an agreement with his own company, GPA. That had resulted in damage to Russian Post\u2019s former business partners, in particular MPK, which had amounted to RUB\u00a04,493,186.88. To justify that finding, the court had referred to the difference in prices between what GPA charged and what it had paid to its subcontractors, considering that margin to be indicative of fraud. The fact that GPA had entered into an agreement to provide services but had intended to use subcontractors rather than its own logistics facilities had been considered by the court as constituting an element of fraud.",

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, \u00a7 92, 17\u00a0September 2009, and Huhtam\u00e4ki v.\u00a0Finland, no. 54468/09, \u00a7 41, 6\u00a0March 2012). Article 7 of the Convention is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article\u00a07 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03233, Series A no. 335C; S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-35, Series A no. 335B; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97, 44801/98, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2001-II; and Kafkaris v.

The courts concluded that the latter margin constituted the amount stolen by the applicants from MPK and Yves Rocher Vostok through GPA and classified it as proceeds from criminal activity; consequently, the use of those proceeds for paying GPA\u2019s office rent, for legal services, dividends to the applicants and transfers to affiliated companies constituted money laundering.",

The Court therefore has to examine whether the conclusions reached by the domestic courts concerning the nature of GPA\u2019s relationship with its clients, defined as containing elements of deception or abuse of trust, failure to recompense, and non-compliance with contractual obligations, were based on an analysis which could be considered as arguably reasonable and, consequently, whether it was foreseeable that the applicants\u2019 acts could constitute commercial fraud against those companies.",

As such, Article 159.4 called for an interpretation based on, or concordant with, the principles established by the Civil Code in relation to the functioning of commercial entities and their rights and obligations relating to the conclusion and execution of contracts and for breach of contract. However, in the present case the courts adopted an alternative interpretation of Article 159.4 on the basis of Article 159 as a lex generalis, which contained basic definitions and the constituent elements of fraud. Under this alternative interpretation, the courts could find someone liable for fraud on account of non-compliance with a contract, even if there was no breach of contract or it had not been declared null and void or invalid under the civil law. The effect was that the charges formulated under Article 159.4, read in conjunction with Articles\u00a0159 and 158, did not distinguish fraudulent conduct in the performance of contractual obligations between commercial entities from inherently lawful conduct.",

The courts did not establish what constituted the \u201cabsence of consideration\u201d in relation to the charges of general fraud, just as they did not identify what had constituted non-compliance with contractual obligations, a particular characteristic of commercial fraud.

However, we are unable to agree with our colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 18 of the Convention, brought in conjunction with Articles 6 and 7, is inadmissible. The applicants in this case argued that their domestic prosecution and subsequent criminal conviction pursued purposes other than bringing them to justice, specifically to curtail the first applicant\u2019s public and political activity (see paragraph 86 of the judgment). The majority dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 18 as inadmissible, observing that Article 18 can only be applied in conjunction with other Articles of the Convention that permit lawful restrictions. The Court held that because neither Article 6 nor Article 7 contains express or implied restrictions, the complaint brought under Article 18, in conjunction with these two Articles, had to be rejected as inadmissible. We respectfully disagree with this conclusion and argue that, although Article 6 does not contain a textual provision that permits restrictions, the Court\u2019s case-law has recognised that this provision does have inherent limitations. As such, complaints brought under Article 18 in conjunction with Article 6 should be admissible.",

According to the preparatory works, the Convention system was designed to preserve democracy and to protect the rights and freedoms enshrined in it from the dangers posed by totalitarian regimes. The drafters believed that States could, and would, always find excuses to limit and restrict individual rights and freedoms. The public interest in \u201cmorality, order, public security and above all democratic rights\u201d can all be abused for this purpose. Article 18, drafted in this context, was intended to prevent abusive and illegitimate limitations of Convention rights and freedoms, as well as to act as a deterrent to the resurgence of undemocratic regimes in Europe. A preliminary version of this Article, initially part of the universal limitations clause that was intended to apply to all Convention rights and freedoms, prohibited \u201cany restriction on a guaranteed freedom for motives based, not on the common good or general interest, but on reasons of State\u201d. Today, the role of Article 18 remains to protect individuals from limitations of their rights through State actions, such as politically motivated prosecutions, which run counter to the very spirit of the Convention and can be misused to hollow out the values of democracy.",

Although for a few decades after the enactment of the Convention Article\u00a018 remained fairly dormant, it resurfaced after the establishment of the permanent Court, when a more vigorous approach to the examination of claims under this provision emerged. The Court\u2019s modern practice reflects the drafters\u2019 original understanding that Article 18 was designed to protect individuals from the perils of totalitarianism, and confirms the application of Article 18 to politically motivated proceedings. In recent years, the Court has been applying the provision with even greater frequency. While findings of violations of Article 18 have been quite rare, in part because of the exacting standard applied by the Court as a result of the presumption that States generally comply with their Convention obligations in good faith (see Lutsenko v. Ukraine, no. 6492/11, \u00a7\u00a7 106-07, 3 July 2012), the Court has nevertheless found violations of Article 18 of the Convention in a number of cases.",

Russia (no. 70276/01, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2004-IV), for example, the Court held that \u201cthe restriction of the applicant\u2019s liberty permitted under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) was applied not only for the purpose of bringing [the applicant] before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, but also for other reasons\u201d. The Court based its findings on an agreement signed between the applicant and the acting Federal Minister for Press and Mass Communications that made it clear that the applicant\u2019s detention had been ordered to force the applicant to sell his medial company to the State (ibid., \u00a7 76). In Lutsenko (cited\u00a0above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-09), the Court again found that the criminal prosecution of the applicant had been initiated not only to bring him to justice for a suspected offence, but also \u201cfor other reasons\u201d, inter alia to punish him for asserting his innocence and for going to the media in order to contest the allegations made against him. The Court once again found a violation of Article 18 in Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (no. 15172/13, \u00a7\u00a027, 22 May 2014). In that case the applicant was called in for police questioning the day after posting a blog entry providing information about riots which the authorities wanted to keep from the public. Criminal proceedings were then brought against the applicant for organising and participating in actions that caused a breach of order and for violence or resistance against officials. Given the absence of \u201cobjective information giving rise to a bona fide suspicion against the applicant,\u201d the Court held that it was sufficiently proven that \u201cthe actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence or punish the applicant for criticising the Government and attempting to disseminate what he believed was the true information that the Government were trying to hide\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 143). There are also two separate cases currently pending before the Grand Chamber in which applicants have brought complaints under Article 18: Merabishvili v.\u00a0Georgia (no.\u00a072508/13, 14 June 2016) and Navalnyy and Ofitserov v.\u00a0Russia (nos.\u00a046632/13 and 28671/14, 4 April 2016). Neither case will, however, resolve the issue brought before the Court in the present case.",

The Court is called upon to apply the accessory protection of Article 18 solely in conjunction with Article 6 and 7 of the Convention. In this case, the majority followed the reasoning set out in Navalnyy and Ofitserov (cited above) and held that a violation of Article 18 can only arise in conjunction with another Article of the Convention which contains an express or implied restriction. Thus, because the applicants relied on Article 18 in conjunction only with Articles 6 and 7, neither of which contains such restrictions, their complaint was found to be incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention and thus inadmissible (see paragraphs 87-89 of the judgment).",

Although the text of Article 18 makes clear that the Article enshrines an accessory right that must be invoked with another Article of the Convention, there is nothing to suggest that this other Article must have express or implied restrictions built into the text of the provision. In fact, the drafting history of Article 18 indicates that its application was never intended to be limited to those provisions of the Convention containing a restriction clause. Instead, as per its ratio conventionis, Article 18 applies to limitations on all Convention rights, with the exception of those absolute rights, like Article 3 for example, that do not permit limitations and to which it therefore cannot logically be applied. Article 6, unlike Article 3, does not protect an absolute right, and according to both its wording and the Court\u2019s case-law the provision does include inherent or implied restrictions (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III; Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, \u00a7 72, Reports 1996-II; Deweer v.

Russia, no. 14902/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a065966, 20 September 2011). The Court has also allowed Article 18 to be invoked together with one of these three provisions and other Convention provisions, like Article 6. For example, in Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia (nos.\u00a011082/06 and 13772/05, 25 July 2013), the Court allowed the applicants to bring a complaint under Article 18 in conjunction with Articles\u00a05, 6, 7 and 8. Although the Court cautioned that when allegations of improper State motives are made the Court must show particular diligence, it nevertheless scrutinised the State\u2019s motives and undertook an assessment of the criminal proceedings in order to determine whether the State had violated Article 18 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 897-909). While the Court held that the evidence was insufficient to find a violation of Article 18, nowhere did it suggest that Article 18 could not be invoked in conjunction with just Article\u00a06. In short, although Article\u00a06 does not provide for restrictions in a separate paragraph analogous to those contained in Articles 8-11 of the Convention, there is no a priori reason why Article 18 should apply in conjunction with Article 5, for example, but not in conjunction with Article\u00a06.",

Article 18\u2019s relevance is particularly significant when examining the present case, and especially with regard to the first applicant. The Court already agreed that the interpretation of the criminal offence the applicants had been charged with was \u201cextensively and unforeseeably construed\u201d (see paragraph 68 of the judgment) and that the \u201cjudicial examination of this case was flawed with arbitrariness which was distinct from an incorrect legal classification or similar error in the application of domestic criminal law\u201d (see paragraph 84), in violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. This process \u201cundermined the fairness of the criminal proceedings in such a fundamental way that it rendered other criminal procedure guarantees irrelevant\u201d (ibid). These domestic criminal proceedings subjected a prominent and politically active individual critical of the government to fundamentally unfair and arbitrary criminal prosecution. Singling out dissidents in order to silence them by means of criminal proceedings is precisely the sort of abuse Article\u00a018 of the Convention is intended to prevent. This is a separate issue from those under Articles 6 and\u00a07, and it is an issue in respect of which the applicants raised an arguable claim in Strasbourg. They argued that, in one particular instance, after the first applicant had investigated the off-duty activities of the chief of the Investigating Committee of the Russian Federation (\u201cthe Investigative Committee\u201d), Mr Bastrykin, criminal proceedings had been instituted against the first applicant on the direct orders of Mr Bastrykin (see paragraph 17 of the judgment). Mr\u00a0Bastrykin later made a public statement expressing his determination to have the first applicant prosecuted (ibid.). In another instance, on the same day that the first applicant made a public plea for the people to participate in the Freedom March, an opposition rally at Lubyanskaya Square, the Investigative Committee decided to open a criminal file based on material severed from the Kirovles case (see paragraphs 19 and 20 of the judgment).",

This, however, presents a dilemma for the Court. In all of these circumstances the applicant is in detention and the Court has strong reasons to believe that the detention is based on an unfair trial (see, in the present case, paragraph 6 of the judgment as regards the second applicant; see also Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (no. 2), no.\u00a0919/15, pending at the time of writing this dissenting opinion). It goes without saying that the Court should resolve these cases as soon as possible in order possibly to put an end to the allegedly unjustified detention.

Considering the purpose of Article 18, discussed in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, we believe that the Court was under a duty to at least examine the allegations made and not simply dismiss the complaint as inadmissible. Rejecting the complaint as incompatible ratio\u00a0materiae, as the majority did, is contrary to the ratio conventionis and the Court\u2019s previous case-law concerning Article 18. Although it is not our place to make a determination on the merits of the applicants\u2019 complaint in this context, we do consider that the Court should have declared the complaint under Article 18, in conjunction with Article 6, admissible.",

To that extent, the right in question is not an absolute one, but is a relative or limited right in conjunction with which Article 18 can be applied.
