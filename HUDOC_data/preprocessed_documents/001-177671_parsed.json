The Court understands the difficulties which the authorities faced while trying to organise a complex and advanced medical procedure for a patient who, without any plausible explanation, had a frequent change of attitude. It cannot see any significant delays in the authorities\u2019 response to his changing attitude or any resistance on their part to each new request from him. They took steps to organise the surgery, even when it became clear that a civilian institution was unable to accept him for treatment. The Court does not see any reason to conclude that the surgery will not be performed after the applicant finally firmly decides to undergo it.",

Albania, no. 25336/04, \u00a7\u00a7 185-87, 7\u00a0July 2009, in which the delay was seventeen days). The Government did not provide any sound explanation for their failure to act diligently and in due time in response to the Court\u2019s interim measure, and there appears to be no objective impediment or difficulty which could have prevented expedient compliance with the interim measure in the present case. Moreover, like in many similar cases (see Maylenskiy v. Russia, no. 12646/15, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39, 4\u00a0October 2016; Klimov v. Russia, no. 54436/14, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, 4 October 2016; Kondrulin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 12987/15, \u00a7\u00a7 46-47, 20 September 2016; Andrey Lavrov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 66252/14, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 1 March 2016; Patranin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a012983/14, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, 23 July 2015; and Amirov cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a072-73, 27 November 2014) the Government\u2019s submissions did not contain an analysis of the adequacy of the applicant\u2019s medical care and the compatibility of the conditions of his detention with his state of health. As a result, the documents furnished by the authorities have little relevance to the implementation of the interim measure indicated by the Court in the present case.",
