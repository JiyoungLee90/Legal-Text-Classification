In support of that claim, the defence referred to one of the co-accused, Mr\u00a0K., who had signed a written undertaking not to leave his city of residence and had not absconded. The defence indicated that the applicant\u2019s passports had been handed over to the prosecution and that his family were once again offering to put up bail for him. In the opinion of the defence it was absurd to suggest that the applicant would continue with criminal activity, since he was not charged with crimes of violence but with economic crimes: it would be impossible for him to commit such crimes if bailed on condition of house arrest.

However, when Mr\u00a0Stolyarov visited the remand centre on 30\u00a0January 2004 the head of the remand prison unlawfully refused him access to the applicant. Further, the applicant was denied access to his doctors in connection with his gastric problems.",

The PACE Special Rapporteur had no special status under the domestic law that would allow her to visit the applicant without prior authorisation. In such circumstances the Meshchanskiy District Court rightly considered that she should not be allowed to visit the applicant.

What the State must do under this provision is to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a044558/98, \u00a7\u00a0102, ECHR\u00a02001-VIII.).

In several previous cases against Russia where the applicants were held in cells with less than three square metres of personal space the Court found a violation of Article\u00a03 on that account alone (see, for example, Kantyrev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a037213/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-51, 21\u00a0June 2007; Andrey Frolov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0205/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-49, 29\u00a0March 2007; Mayzit v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a063378/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 20\u00a0January 2005; and Labzov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a062208/00, \u00a7\u00a044, 16\u00a0June 2005). In addition, such factors as access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements, the opportunity to use the toilet in private and the availability of ventilation are relevant to the assessment of whether the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded (see, for example, Vlasov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a078146/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 12\u00a0June 2008; Babushkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a067253/01, \u00a7\u00a044, 18\u00a0October 2007; and Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, ECHR\u00a02001-III).

He claimed that he had had slightly over 4\u00a0square metres of personal space in that remand prison. He acknowledged at the same time that the number of inmates had not exceeded the number of sleeping places. The Government produced different figures: they maintained that the applicant had had from 4.45 to over 5\u00a0square metres of personal space, depending on the cell. In support of their claims, the\u00a0Government submitted the exact measurements the cells and indicated the number of sleeping places in each of them. The Court has no reason to distrust those documents, at least in so far as the data on the size of the cells and the number of inmates is concerned. The Court thus accepts the figures provided by the Government. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant\u2019s cells were equipped with some furniture and contained such fittings as a toilet, beds, etc, which must have further reduced the floor space available to him (see Andreyevskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01750/03, \u00a7\u00a085, 29\u00a0January 2009). However, even taking into account that factor the Court cannot conclude that the cells in which the applicant was detained in remand prison IZ-99/1 were seriously overcrowded, and that the applicant was affected by the general overpopulation problem that exists in many Russian remand prisons. It has therefore to be ascertained whether the other conditions of his detention were compatible with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention.",

The applicant\u2019s own words are insufficient to prove his allegations. In practice it may be very difficult for a detainee to collect evidence about the material conditions of his detention, and the Court has already observed the difficulties experienced by applicants in substantiating their grievances in respect of the conditions of pre-trial detention in Russia (see Shcherbakov v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a023939/02, \u00a7\u00a081, 17\u00a0June 2010). Generally, a\u00a0detainee cannot question witnesses, take photos of his cell, measure the levels of humidity, temperature, etc. Such inspections are usually made either by the prison authorities themselves or by special bodies supervising the prisons.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally, the material conditions of detention should be assessed by independent observers. That being noted, the Court does not consider that the refusal of the State to allow independent observers to visit the applicant (irrespective of whether that refusal was lawful or not) gave rise to a separate problem under the Convention. At the same time, had such an inspection taken place, it could have helped the Government to refute the applicant\u2019s allegations.\u00a0The Court reiterates that in the context of complaints about conditions of detention it is permissible, under certain circumstances, to shift the burden of proof from the applicant to the Government (see, among other authorities, Zakharkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01555/04, \u00a7\u00a0123, 10\u00a0June 2010; Kokoshkina v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02052/08, \u00a7\u00a059, 28\u00a0May 2009, and Ahmet \u00d6zkan and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a021689/93, \u00a7\u00a0426, 6\u00a0April 2004). A failure on the part of a Government to submit convincing evidence on conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see Gubin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a08217/04, \u00a7\u00a056, 17\u00a0June 2010; Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7\u00a066 in\u00a0fine, ECHR\u00a02000-VI).",

The Court has examined several cases where the applicants presented very similar complaints to those of the applicant in the case at hand (see, for example, the case of Andreyevskiy v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 et seq.; see also Gubin v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a020 et seq., 17\u00a0June 2010; Starokadomskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a042239/02, \u00a7\u00a023, 31\u00a0July 2008; Popov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a026853/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050 et seq., 13\u00a0July 2006; Denisenko and Bogdanchikov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a03811/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 et seq., 12\u00a0February 2009; Sudarkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a03130/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a017 and 22, 10\u00a0July 2008; Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7\u00a035, 4\u00a0December 2008; and Trepashkin v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a02) (dec.), no.\u00a014248/05, 22\u00a0January 2009). Most of the cases cited above concerned remand prison no.\u00a077/1, whereas at least one application concerned the conditions in remand prison no.\u00a099/1, where the applicant in the present case was detained (Vlasov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a078146/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053 et seq., 12\u00a0June 2008). The Court observes in this respect that both remand prisons (nos.\u00a077/1 and 99/1) belong to the same detention centre commonly known as \u201cMatrosskaya Tishina\u201d. Furthermore, in a number of Russian cases the Court has examined complaints about conditions in the walking yards of various remand prisons (see, for example, Moiseyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a062936/00, \u00a7\u00a0125, 9\u00a0October 2008, Trepashkin v.\u00a0Russia (no.\u00a02), cited above, Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a07064/05, \u00a7\u00a043, 1\u00a0June 2006; Khudoyorov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a06847/02, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR\u00a02005-X (extracts); and Kokoshkina v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02052/08, \u00a7\u00a056, 28\u00a0May 2009).",

The Court would reiterate that on several previous occasions it has declined to accept the validity of similar certificates on the ground that they could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable given the lapse of time involved and the absence of any supporting documentary evidence (see Kokoshkina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060; Sudarkov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3130/03, \u00a7 43, 10\u00a0July 2008; Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7\u00a052, 13\u00a0November 2007; and Zakharkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0124).

In some countries (such as Spain, Italy, France or ) the accused are sometimes placed in a glass cage during the hearing. Such a practice has occasionally been examined in the context of the guarantee of the presumption of innocence under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention (see\u00a0Auguste v. France, no. 11837/85, Commission Report of 7\u00a0June 1990, D.R.\u00a069, p.\u00a0104; see also Meerbrey v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a037998/97, Commission decision of 12 January 1998). In recent years the Court has begun to examine the practice also from the standpoint of Article\u00a03 of the Convention. Thus, in the case of Sarban v.\u00a0Moldova (no.\u00a03456/05, \u00a7\u00a090, 4\u00a0October 2005) the applicant was brought to court in handcuffs and held in a cage during the hearings, even though he was under guard and was wearing a surgical collar (see, a contrario, the case of Potapov v.\u00a0Russia ((dec.), no.\u00a014934/03, 1\u00a0August 2006). A violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention was found in a case where the applicant was unjustifiably handcuffed during public hearings (see Gorodnichev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a052058/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0105-109, 25\u00a0May 2007). Handcuffing of the applicant gave rise to a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention in a situation where no serious risks to security could be proved to exist (see Henaf v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a065436/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051 and 56, ECHR\u00a02003-XI; Istratii and Others v.\u00a0Moldova, nos.\u00a08721/05, 8705/05 and 8742/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057 and 58, 27\u00a0March 2007).",

The standards under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03 and 4 cannot automatically be extrapolated to Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01: Article\u00a05 paragraph\u00a01 and its paragraphs\u00a03 and 4 are separate provisions and the non-observance of the latter does not necessarily entail also non-observance of the former (compare, for instance, Winterwerp v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 24\u00a0October 1979, \u00a7\u00a053, Series A no.\u00a033, and Douiyeb v.\u00a0the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a031464/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 4\u00a0August 1999).

By analogy, even if the domestic courts erred in their interpretation of the domestic law and held the proceedings in camera for no good reason, this did not amount to a \u201cgross or obvious irregularity\u201d invalidating the proceedings. It follows that the exclusion of the public from the detention hearings of 25\u00a0October and 23\u00a0December 2003, and from the appeal hearing of 11\u00a0November 2003 did not amount to a breach of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions. Arguments for and against release must not be \u201cgeneral and abstract\u201d (see Clooth v.\u00a0, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7\u00a044, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0225), but contain references to the specific facts and the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances justifying his detention (see Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7\u00a0107, 8\u00a0February 2005). Thus, the danger of absconding cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the severity of the possible sentence; it must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify pre-trial detention. In this context regard must be had in particular to the character of the person involved, his morals, his assets, his links with the State in which he is being prosecuted and his international contacts (see\u00a0\u00a0W.\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, 26\u00a0January 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0254-A, \u00a7\u00a033, with further references).",

The facts, referred to by the domestic courts as a proof that such risks existed, were the following: the applicant faced a long prison sentence, he had allegedly been involved in organised criminal activity for a long time, he was a very influential person, he had money abroad and a passport for foreign travel, his presumed accomplices had fled Russia, and the applicant still controlled companies where prospective witnesses continued to work.

However, the Court considers that in choosing a measure of restraint for the first time the courts may rely on relatively loose presumptions (such as the gravity of charges, the suspect\u2019s position in society, the nature of the impugned offences, etc.). Furthermore, the exceptional character of the case at hand, where the applicant was one of the richest persons in the country and, unofficially, a politically influential person, should not be disregarded. The Court is aware that the existence of a potential risk, for example, the risk of fleeing or re-offending, cannot be demonstrated with the same degree of certitude as the existence of a fact that has already occurred. This is a fortiori true at the beginning of a criminal investigation, when the prosecuting authorities have less information about the suspect, his connections, the circumstances of the case, etc. It explains why the Court\u2019s standard of review of the original detention order is usually quite relaxed (see in this respect the partial inadmissibility decision in the case of the applicant\u2019s co-defendant, Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a04483/04, 25\u00a0November 2004; see also the Court\u2019s finding in the case concerning another Yukos top executive, Aleksanyan v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046468/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0184-190, 22\u00a0December 2008; see also the case of Aleksandr Makarov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a015217/07, \u00a7\u00a0125, 12\u00a0March 2009). Having applied this standard, the Court concludes that the District Court cannot be considered as having erred in its assessment of the evidence but, taking into account the cumulative effect of the elements before it, came to a reasonable conclusion as to the potential risks posed by the applicant.",

Furthermore, by that time the pre-trial investigation was already over. The closure of the investigation excluded virtually any risk of tampering with material or documentary evidence, and significantly reduced the ability of the applicant to exert pressure on the witnesses, who had already been questioned by the prosecution (see Aleksanyan v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0191). Nevertheless, the Court is prepared to assume that the risks of tampering with evidence existed for some time after the start of the proceedings, at least until the witnesses testified before the court.

Nor did the behaviour of the applicant and his lawyer during the meetings give rise to any reasonable suspicion of abuse of confidentiality. It is also doubtful whether the prison officials had the power under the domestic law to search the lawyer and in what circumstances. The Court reiterates that any limitations imposed on a criminal defendant in the remand prison, including those concerning his contacts with lawyers, should have a lawful basis and that the law should be sufficiently precise (see, mutatis mutandis, Nolan and K.\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02512/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a098-99, 12\u00a0February 2009, with further references; see also the judgment of the Russian Constitutional Court of 2010 which makes the same point).

The Court notes that by that time the  in its decision no.\u00a0132-O had already interpreted the relevant provisions of the CCrP as giving the accused a right to participate in a hearing where the question of his further detention might eventually be decided. That approach was later confirmed in the Constitutional Court\u2019s Ruling\u00a0no.\u00a04-P of 2005 (both authorities are cited in the \u201cRelevant Domestic Law\u201d part above).\u00a0\u00a0The Government claimed that on 20\u00a0May 2004 that interpretation had not been known to the Meshchanskiy District Court, since the decision of the Constitutional Court of 8 April was published only on 9\u00a0June 2004. However, this argument is irrelevant for the Court\u2019s analysis under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04. It is not so important when the position of the Constitutional Court of Russia on the matter became known to the authorities, since the situation under examination was in any event contrary to the requirement of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention. The Court notes that at the hearing of 20\u00a0May 2004 the District Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention for up to six months, in the first detention order after the receipt of the case-file by the court for the upcoming trial. In such circumstances the applicant should have been given an opportunity to plead his case, either personally, or at least through his lawyers, if not both. As transpires from the materials of the case the applicant was not given such an opportunity, for reasons which remain unknown.

The fact that he had been convicted in no way precluded improper motives in bringing the charges.

Indeed, the fact that he had received a long sentence supported the inference of political motivation. The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires for Article\u00a018 indicated that the drafters of this provision were concerned to ensure that an individual was thereby protected from the imposition of restrictions arising from a desire of the State to protect itself according \u201cto the political tendency which it represents\u201d and the desire of the State to act \u201cagainst an opposition which it considers dangerous\u201d. The applicant maintained his argument that his arrest and consequent detention on 25\u00a0October, just a few weeks before the Duma elections on 7\u00a0December 2003 and shortly before the completion of the Sibneft/Yukos merger, had been orchestrated by the State to take action against an opposition which it considered \u201cdangerous\u201d, contrary to Article\u00a018.",

(extracts), the Court accepted that the applicant\u2019s liberty was restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article\u00a05. The Court in that case based its findings on an agreement signed between the detainee and a federal minister of the press. It was clear from that agreement that the applicant\u2019s detention was applied in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In Cebotari v\u00a0 (no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046 et seq., 13\u00a0November 2007) the Court found a violation of Article\u00a018 of the Convention in a context where the applicant\u2019s arrest was visibly linked to an application pending before the Court.

Indeed, those facts cannot be ignored. In particular, the Court acknowledges that the applicant had political ambitions which admittedly went counter to the mainstream line of the administration, that the applicant, as a rich and influential man, could become a serious political player and was already supporting opposition parties, and that it was a State-owned company which benefited most from the dismantlement of the applicant\u2019s industrial empire.",

The fact that the suspect\u2019s political opponents or business competitors might directly or indirectly benefit from him being put in jail should not prevent the authorities from prosecuting such a person if there are serious charges against him. In other words, high political status does not grant immunity.

The applicant strongly relies on those opinions; in particular, he relies on resolutions of political institutions, NGOs, statements of various public figures, etc. The Court took note of those opinions. However, it must recall that political process and adjudicative process are fundamentally different. It is often much easier for a politician to take a stand than for a judge, since the judge must base his decision only on evidence in the legal sense.",

Those findings are probably the strongest argument in favour of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a018 of the Convention. However, the evidence and legal arguments before those courts might have been different from those in the case under examination. More importantly, assuming, that all courts had the same evidence and arguments before them, the Court reiterates that its own standard of proof applied in Article\u00a018 cases is very high and may be different from those applied domestically. The Court admits that the applicant\u2019s case may raise a certain suspicion as to the real intent of the authorities, and that this state of suspicion might be sufficient for the domestic courts to refuse extradition, deny legal assistance, issue injunctions against the Russian Government, make pecuniary awards, etc. However, it is not sufficient for this Court to conclude that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State in the present case was ab intio misused, that from the beginning to the end the authorities were acting with bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention. This is a very serious claim which requires an incontrovertible and direct proof. Such proof, in contrast to the Gusinskiy case, cited above, is absent from the case under examination.",

The Court will seek to indicate the type of measure that might be taken only exceptionally, for example to put an end to a systemic problem, as in Broniowski v.\u00a0Poland\u00a0[GC] (no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7\u00a0194, ECHR\u00a02004-V), or to discontinue a continuous situation, as in Hasan and Eylem Zengin v.\u00a0Turkey (no.\u00a01448/04, \u00a7\u00a084, ECHR\u00a02007-XI; see also L. v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a027527/03, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR\u00a02007X). In other exceptional cases, the nature of the violation found may be such as to leave no real choice as to the measures required to remedy it and the Court may decide to indicate only one such measure (see\u00a0Assanidze, referred to above; see also Abbasov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a024271/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035 et seq., 17\u00a0January 2008, and Aleksanyan v\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a046468/06, \u00a7\u00a0240, 22\u00a0December 2008). Finally, in some situations the Court indicated to the respondent Government how to remedy a violation found in the applicant\u2019s case, for example, by way of reopening of the proceedings which had been fundamentally unfair (see Maksimov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a038228/05, \u00a7\u00a046, 8\u00a0October 2009), or by transferring the applicant\u2019s pension rights to a specific pension fund (see Karanovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, no.\u00a039462/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a028 et seq., 20\u00a0November 2007).",

The applicant did not request the Court to indicate to the Government how past violations should be remedied but rather asked the Court to prevent future possible violations of the same kind. However, the Court\u2019s primary role is to examine facts, and not to make assumptions for the future, especially where those assumptions would depend on a multitude of factors and be, therefore, speculative. The Court considers that the circumstances of the present case are different from those of Broniowski, Hasan and Eylem Zengin or Aleksanyan, referred to above. The Court considers that in casu there is no need to indicate any specific measure under Article\u00a046 of the Convention to the respondent Government other than the payment of the just satisfaction award. The determination of other measures, in pursuance to the substantive findings of the Court in this case, is therefore left to the discretion of the Committee of Ministers.",
