Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 68, ECHR\u00a02005IV). However, in order to raise an issue under Article 8 the interference about which the applicant complains must directly affect his home, family or private life and must attain a certain minimum level if the complaints are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see L\u00f3pez Ostra v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 303C; and Fadeyeva, cited above, \u00a7 69-70). Therefore, the first point for decision is whether the environmental pollution of which the applicant complains can be regarded as affecting adversely, to a sufficient extent, the enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life (see Ivan Atanasov v. Bulgaria, no. 12853/03, \u00a7 66, 2 December 2010). In this respect, the Court recalls that water pollution was one of the factors which was found to affect the applicants\u2019 health and hence their ability to enjoy their home, private and family life in the case of Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine (no.\u00a030499/03, \u00a7\u00a7 110 and 113, 10 February 2011).",

This cannot be regarded as a minor irregularity but as a rather serious breach of domestic regulations given that the actual distance is just over one tenth of the minimum distance permissible by those rules. Furthermore, the cemetery is a continuous source of possible health hazards and the potential damage caused by such is not easily reversible or preventable. Such environmental dangers have been acknowledged by the authorities on numerous occasions, including, by prohibiting the use of the illegal cemetery for burials and by the offer to resettle the applicant (see paragraphs 20 \u2013 25 and 49 above). It further notes that the domestic authorities established that the construction of a cemetery at the said location placed the applicant at risk of contamination of the soil and of the drinking and irrigation water sources because of emanations from decomposing bodies like ptomaine (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has particular regard to the fact that there was no centralised water supply in the Tatariv village and villagers used their own wells (see paragraph 9 above). It also appears that the high level of E. coli found in the drinking water of the applicant\u2019s well was far in excess of permitted levels and may have emanated from the cemetery (see paragraphs 12, 18 and 30 above), although the technical reports came to no definitive or unanimous conclusion as to the true source of E. coli contamination (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, the high level of E.\u00a0coli, regardless of its origin, coupled with clear and blatant violation of environmental health safety regulations confirmed the existence of environmental risks, in particular, of serious water pollution, to which the applicant was exposed.",

However, they concern allegations of health hazards arising from the local authority\u2019s decision to locate a cemetery just 38 meters from the applicant\u2019s home in breach of domestic regulations plus the State\u2019s failure to act in securing compliance with the domestic environmental standards. The allegations also concern the State\u2019s failure to regulate the activities of the municipality in line with such standards. The Court\u2019s task in such a situation is to assess whether the State took all reasonable measures to secure the protection of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article\u00a08\u00a0of the Convention. In making such an assessment factors, including compliance with the domestic environmental regulations and judicial decisions, must be analysed in the context of a given case (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubetska and Others v.
