Miailhe (no. 2) v. France, 26 September 1996, \u00a7 43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, \u00a7\u00a038, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0275). The provisions of paragraph 3 (a) of Article 6 point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the \u201caccusation\u201d to the defendant. Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7\u00a079, Series A no. 168). Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the \u201ccause\u201d of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. That information should be detailed (P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France, 25 March 1999, \u00a7 51, Reports 1999-II). The scope of the above provision must in particular be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. In criminal matters the provision of full, detailed information concerning the charges against a defendant, and consequently the legal characterisation that the court might adopt in the matter, is an essential prerequisite for ensuring that the proceedings are fair. In this respect it is to be observed that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) does not impose any special formal requirement as to the manner in which the accused is to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.",
