The Court would underline that it does not accept the reasoning of the first-instance court, namely that the allegations of serious misconduct levelled against the claimant should have first been proved in criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the right to freedom of expression cannot be taken to confer on newspapers an absolute right to act in an irresponsible manner by charging individuals with criminal acts in the absence of a basis in fact at the material time (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066) and without offering them the possibility to counter the accusations.

Since no one has ever bothered to charge the principal, the newspaper will have to wait a rather long time, more or less an eternity, for a judgment confirming or rebutting his culpability. Cutting-edge democracy requires that the one to be prosecuted is the one who makes credible charges, not the one against whom credible charges are made. And the public watchdog would do well not to bark at all, even if it has trustworthy evidence in its possession.

Personally I do not find the behaviour of the applicant newspaper particularly negative, but, for the purposes of this opinion I am prepared to go along with the majority and grant that it was. Where does that lead to? I too would have good governance and good professional behaviour go hand in hand, but, if the latter should fail, I would still opt to privilege good governance over good media professionalism. The truth is that in this case the Court attached more value to professional behaviour than to the unveiling of corruption.",

The Court has penalised the newspaper not for publishing untruths (had that been the case, I would have rushed to join in with emphatic fervour) but for \u2018unprofessional behaviour\u2019 which was, in any case, quite uninfluential.

Assuming the newspaper, suffering a fit of daft journalistic finesse, had asked the principal before publication: is it true you take bribes? The reply would have been a yes or a no, and, with some effort I rather guess which of the two would have been the more likely. Had he (how surprising) denied corruption, was the newspaper forever muzzled or would it have published its \u2013 credible \u2013 findings all the same? The domestic court and the  reply differently to this question. The domestic court answers that the newspaper could not publish anything at all since there is no res judicata conviction of the principal by a criminal court.

But a breach of an ethical duty, subsequent in time to the publication of alleged defamation, fails to render a newspaper retroactively guilty of defamation \u2013 the editor can be censured for failure to perform an ethical duty, but no way for libel. The Court did not see that these are wholly distinct issues which needed to be resolved separately.

Even if alarming facts are sufficiently borne out by evidence, in the balancing exercise to establish proportionality, disregard for professional norms is deemed by  to be more serious than the suppression of democratic debate on public corruption. To put it differently, in the Court\u2019s view the social need to fight poor journalism is more pressing than that of fighting rich corruption. The \u2018chilling effect\u2019 of sanctions against press freedom dreaded by the Court\u2019s old case-law has materialised through the Court\u2019s new one.",

Maybe freedom of expression should cease to exist when it offends, and that would not distress me unduly. The serious inference of this judgment is that freedom of expression also ceases to exist when it is punished for pushing forward for public debate allegations of public criminality made by witnesses certified as credible but in a manner considered unprofessional. When subservience to professional good practice becomes more overriding than the search for truth itself it is a sad day for freedom of expression.",
