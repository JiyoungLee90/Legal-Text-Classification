The case originated in an application (no. 13024/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Halina Olszewska (“the applicant”), on 23 March 2005.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 3 October 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time. It also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.
The applicant was born in 1929 and lives in .
In 1940 the applicant's father had been arrested by NKVD (Soviet People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) and was sent with his family to . The applicant's mother died in 1940 and her father died in  in 1967. In 1946 the applicant and her siblings returned to .
On 6 October 1948 the property belonging to the applicant's parents was taken over by the State.
In 1990 the applicant and her sister were designated jointly as their father's heirs.
On 29 November 2001 the applicant applied to the Podlaski Governor (Wojewoda Podlaski) to have the 1948 decision annulled and her parents' property returned to her. The case was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture for consideration.
Subsequently, the applicant wrote to the Minister and other authorities complaining that the property had not been returned to her.
On 28 November 2003 she complained to the Minister about his inactivity. As she received no reply to her complaint, on 5 December 2003 the applicant, represented by a lawyer, lodged a complaint about the Minister's inactivity with the  (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny).
Following her complaint, on 5 January 2004 the  requested the Minister to provide it with the case file within thirty days. It appears that the Minister did not comply with this order. However, the Minister started examining the merits of the applicant's case and made several requests to various authorities asking them for documents.
On 20 May 2004 the  (Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny), to which the case was transferred, informed the applicant that despite its repeated requests the Minister had not complied with the order to provide the case file. The applicant was advised that she could therefore apply for a fine to be imposed on the Minister.
On 4 June 2004 the Minister gave a decision in which he stayed the proceedings. The applicant lodged an appeal in which she asked for the decision to be reconsidered and the proceedings to be resumed.
On 23 June 2004 the applicant followed the 's advice and applied to have a fine imposed on the Minister.
On 3 August 2004 the  dismissed the applicant's complaint about the Minister's inactivity. The court found that since the Minister had stayed the proceedings the inactivity had ceased to exist. The applicant's lawyer lodged a cassation appeal against this decision with the . However, it was rejected on 8 October 2004 as the applicant's lawyer failed to pay court fees for the appeal.
After the decision of 3 August 2004, the applicant withdrew her application for the imposition of a fine, and on 17 September 2004 the  discontinued the relevant proceedings.
On 6 April 2005 the Minister resumed the proceedings.
On 18 November 2005 the Minister of Agriculture gave a decision. He annulled the 1948 decision and returned a part of the property to the applicant.
On 7 December 2005 the Doroszki Agriculture Co-operative, which has been using the land in question, joined the proceedings as a party and lodged an appeal against the decision.
On 22 May 2006 the Minister upheld its decision of 18 November 2005. The Doroszki Agriculture Co-operative lodged an appeal against the decision.
On 11 October 2006 the  gave a judgment. It quashed the impugned decision of 22 May 2006 finding that the co-operative had no standing in the proceedings. The Doroszki Agriculture Co-operative appealed.
The proceedings are pending before the .
Under Article 35 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (“the Code”) of 1960 an administrative authority should give a decision on the merits of a case within two months. If this time-limit has not been complied with, the authority must, under Article 36 of the Code, inform the parties of that fact, explain the reasons for the delay and fix a new time-limit.
A party to administrative proceedings may make a complaint under Article 37 of the Code in order to urge the relevant administrative authority to issue a decision within the time-limits fixed in the Code. Moreover, in cases where an authority persistently failed to do so, a party could lodge, under sections 17, 26 and 30 of the Supreme Administrative Court Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”) as in force at the material time, a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court against the authority's failure to give a decision.
In cases where allegations of inactivity were well-founded, the  could oblige that authority to issue a decision. Pursuant to section 30 of the Act, the decision of the  ordering an authority to put an end to its inactivity was legally binding on the authority concerned. If the authority did not comply with the decision, the court could, under section 31 of the 1995 Act, impose a fine on it. It also could itself give a ruling on the merits of the administrative case.
As of 1 January 2004 the 1995 Act was replaced by the Act on Proceedings before Administrative Courts of 30 August 2002 which provides for similar remedies.
On 15 May 2000 the  gave a judgment in a case IV SAB 143/99 in which it held as follows:
“No matter how substantive was the delay in dealing with the case, a decision to stay the administrative proceedings means that the inactivity of an authority ceases to exist and that the [] cannot allow a complaint about the inactivity and order the authority to issue a decision within a given time-limit.”
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.
