Relying on paragraph 2 of Article\u00a072 of the Land Code, the court concluded that the applicant had had a pre-emptive right to acquire the property in dispute. The court further concluded that, contrary to the requirements of Article 66 of the Land Code, the Governor had authorised the sale of the land at public auction while that land was subject to direct sale to the person who had a pre-emptive right to acquire it. Finally, the court referred to the decision no. 3-537 (VD) of the Court of Cassation of 30\u00a0March 2007 to state that for recognition of the existence of a pre-emptive right to acquire property, the fact that a person had been in possession of a property continuously, openly and in good faith for ten years prevailed over evidence of the existence of ownership rights of another person in respect of that property.",

Hence, according to the state of the law and the judicial practice, questions relating to adverse possession of land owned by the State and the communities are regulated by Article 72 of the Land Code which confers on persons who, although without legal recognition of their rights, have used lands owned by the State and the communities for more than ten years continuously, openly and in good faith, a pre-emptive right to acquire plots from those lands. Notably, neither the Land Code nor the case-law of the Court of Cassation makes a distinction between land owned by the State and that owned by the community in so far as the choice of the relevant legal regime is concerned. At the same time, Article 187 of the Civil Code sets out the conditions for acquiring ownership by adverse possession of property owned by others, not the State and the community (see paragraphs\u00a020, 21, 22, 23 and 24 above).",

It is not clear, however, which legal provision was found to be applicable to the applicant\u2019s case according to the decision of 2\u00a0April 2010 of the Court of Cassation. In particular, having concluded that Article 187 of the Civil Code was not applicable to the case since it did not concern land owned by the State and the communities, the Court of Cassation did not indicate which legal provision was eventually applicable to the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 15 above). Thus, on the one hand the Court of Cassation found that Article 187 of the Civil Code was not applicable and on the other hand it did not state that Article 72 of the Land Code would be applicable instead. Given the fact that the land in question was under State ownership, the implied finding of the Court of Cassation that Article 72 of the Land Code was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case was contrary to its findings expressed in the decision no. 3-1835 (A) of 12\u00a0December 2007 (see paragraph 24 above) whereas no reasons were given to explain such departure from its own case-law.",

The Court further observes that in the decision of 2 April 2010 the Court of Cassation made reference to its decision no. 3-153 (VD) of 27 March 2007 which, however, concerned the issue of transfer of title to property from one private party to another based on adverse possession in the circumstances where, as mentioned above, it had already concluded that Article 187 of the Civil Code was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case.",

However, in the absence of any reasoning, it is not at all clear that the Court of Cassation found that its decision no. 3-153 (VD) was the applicable caselaw. On the contrary, as it appears from the relevant part of the decision, the Court of Cassation made a reference to its decision no.\u00a03-153 (VD) to support its finding that Article 187 was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case rather than to state that decision as applicable case-law in view of its factual circumstances (see paragraph 15 above). Moreover, the impugned decision of the Court of Cassation does not contain any references to its decisions nos. 3-1835 (A) and 3-537 (VD) let alone any analysis of the factual background of the applicant\u2019s case in the light of the findings expressed in those decisions although the applicant\u2019s case specifically concerned land owned by the State.

Furthermore, the Court of Cassation did not address the factual findings of the Administrative Court by re-assessing the evidence examined in the previous proceedings and did not address at all the question of the lawfulness of the Governor\u2019s decision to alienate the land at issue at public auction. The only argument put forward by the Court of Cassation to refuse to acknowledge the applicant\u2019s preemptive right to acquire the land at issue by adverse possession was that he had paid rent to the community budget whereas the land was situated outside the community\u2019s administrative boundaries and therefore was owned by the State (see paragraphs 15, 36, 36 and 38 above). It is not clear, however, for what reason that argument was pertinent for the determination of the dispute in the circumstances where neither Article 72 of the Land Code nor the relevant case-law of the Court of Cassation made any distinction based on whether a plot of land was owned by the State or the community in so far as the applicable legal regime was concerned (see paragraph 35 above).",
