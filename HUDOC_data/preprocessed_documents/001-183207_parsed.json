D.\u00d6. denied the allegation that he had put his knee in the small of the back of the person on the ground and fired two bullets into his back (see paragraph\u00a021 above), and told the prosecutor that if he had not shot the person, the person would have shot him. He had therefore acted within the statutory limits regulating the use of force and had not intended to kill the person.",

He maintained that his son had been unarmed at the time of the shooting and alleged that the police officers had shot him at close range. He alleged that the police officers had been covering their tracks by destroying the evidence and that the clothes his son had been wearing at the time of his shooting had been taken away and lost by the police officers. The applicant also argued that, before the crime-scene officers had arrived at the scene of the incident, important evidence had been removed by another group of police officers (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, although according to the report prepared by those police officers both pistols, the hand grenades and the motorbike had been taken away by them before the arrival of the crime-scene officers, according to the crimescene officers\u2019 report the motorbike had still been at the scene on their arrival (see paragraph 12 above).",

In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in the subparagraphs of the Article (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0148149, Series A no. 324).

Thus, as has happened in a large number of other cases against Turkey concerning killings by members of the security forces, crucial evidence was removed from the incident site by members of the security forces. As set out above, four police officers arrived at the scene immediately after the incident and removed the pistol, the hand grenade and, allegedly, the motorbike (see paragraph 10 above), even though the crime-scene investigators who arrived at the scene after the four police officers noted that the motorbike was still there (see paragraph\u00a012 above). Even if, as argued by the Government, the four police officers worked for a different unit of the police (see paragraph 55 above), the Court considers that they cannot be regarded as independent and impartial and that their removal of crucial evidence from the scene before the arrival of the independent crime-scene investigators was not justifiable, especially given the fact that the crime-scene officers arrived at the scene only ten minutes after them (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). Moreover, the Court also remains unconvinced that the alleged rationale for the removal of that evidence from the scene, namely that the flow of traffic not be affected or that doing so would prevent panic among the public (see paragraph\u00a010 above), justified interfering with a crime scene and removing crucial evidence from that scene. Alternative methods, such as setting up a police cordon around the scene and keeping the public away from it would have sufficed to alleviate any concerns that might have been entertained about the welfare of the public.",

Turkey, no. 10036/03, \u00a7 68, 20 April 2010). In the opinion of the Court, a search for fingerprints on the pistol should have been the logical starting point for the prosecutor in the investigation. Having regard to the failure to carry out such a simple examination of an item of evidence which played a major role in the trial court reaching its conclusion \u2013,\u00a0namely that it had been the applicant\u2019s son who had fired first and that the police officer had therefore acted in self-defence and returned fire\u00a0\u2013 the Court harbours doubts about whether the applicant\u2019s deceased son handled the pistol and fired at the police officers (see Cang\u00f6z and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0135).",

In this connection the Court also observes that the pertinent arguments raised by the applicant about the swab samples taken from four persons having been placed in the same envelope and the fact that the forensic report had mentioned \u0130.T. (and not the applicant\u2019s son) as the person whose hands had had gunpowder residue on them (see paragraph\u00a033 above) were not addressed by the investigating authorities or by the trial court.

Moreover, there is no mention in any of the crime scene reports of the forensic authorities having searched for the bullet or the spent bullet case discharged from that police officer\u2019s pistol. Indeed, the applicant raised this failure throughout the proceedings (see paragraph 34, 41 and 43 above) but no reply was given to him. The Court also observes in this connection that there is no information in the file to suggest that the police officer who was charged with the offence of manslaughter on account of the killing of the applicant\u2019s son (see paragraph 30 above) was suspended from duty while the trial was being conducted (see, mutatis mutandis, Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7 55, 2 November 2004; see also, Savin v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a034725/08, \u00a7 68, 16 February 2012).",

Having reviewed its case-law, the Court observes that one of the common features of investigations conducted by prosecutors in Turkey into killings by members of the security forces is a failure to question the perpetrators in a timely manner or to question them at all (see, most recently, Karata\u015f and Others, cited above, \u00a7 77 and the cases cited therein).",

The Court also considers that this failure exemplifies the attitudes displayed by the judicial authorities throughout the investigation and the trial, who accepted at face value the information given by the police officers and did not look beyond what was stated in the police reports (see Cang\u00f6z and Others, cited above, \u00a7 128).",

Having examined all the material in its possession, the Court notes that no meaningful steps were taken to secure the clothes which, as the Forensic Medicine Institute remarked in its report, would have been needed to establish the distance from which the applicant\u2019s son had been shot (see paragraph 36 above) and to allow for an examination to be made of the accuracy of the allegations raised by the applicant that his son had been killed unlawfully, at close range and without any shootout having taken place (see paragraphs 32, 41 and 43 above).
