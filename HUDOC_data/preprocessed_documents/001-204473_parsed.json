The Court further notes that the Government\u2019s objection in the case of Mustafa Avci v. Turkey, to which they referred in their observations, was based on a provision of the new Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 namely Article 91 \u00a7 5 \u2013 which entered into force after the applicant\u2019s arrest. The Court accordingly concludes that the Government\u2019s objection in this regard must be rejected.",

In its judgment in the cassation proceedings, the Court of Cassation had limited the quashing of the first-instance decision to the issue of the sum awarded for the lawyer\u2019s fees being insufficient, and had simultaneously rejected all the arguments submitted by the applicant, including the one asserting that the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage was too low (paragraph 26 above). The dismissal of the other arguments by the Court of Cassation was binding on the Assize Court of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, which could not modify these aspects of its initial judgment. Only the question of legal fees was examined by the Assize Court of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y after the cassation proceedings and only this aspect of its original decision has been reviewed. The other aspects of the original decision having become final with the judgment in the cassation proceedings, the Assize Court of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y did not consider them and reiterated its original decision. Accordingly, the applicant cannot be accused of not having lodged an appeal in cassation against the decision of 22 March 2007.

In so doing, that court merely relied on the applicant\u2019s acquittal. The Court observes that Act No. 466 provides, inter alia, that the State shall compensate any person who, having been arrested or detained in accordance with the law, has then been acquitted.

The court in no way examined whether the applicant\u2019s detention had been procedurally defective or whether it had been based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence charged. As the award of compensation was an automatic consequence of the applicant\u2019s acquittal, it did not amount to a finding of a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see, to that effect, Medeni Kavak v. Turkey, no. 13723/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 3\u00a0May 2007, and El\u011fay v. Turkey, no. 18992/03, \u00a7 32, 20 January 2009). The Court considers that, in the absence of such recognition, the payment of compensation, particularly given the time which the applicant spent in pre-trial detention, was not sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Shkarupa v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a036461/05, \u00a7 78, 15 January 2015). Moreover, the Court considers that the sum awarded to the applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage was significantly lower than the sums that the Court has awarded in cases concerning unlawful detention (see, to this effect, Vedat Do\u011fru v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a02469/10, \u00a7 41, 5 April 2016). In conclusion, the Court considers that, notwithstanding the payment of a sum by way of compensation for the pre-trial detention, the applicant can still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a038884/97, \u00a7\u00a063, 30 January 2003). Indeed, both the record of questioning drawn up during his time in police custody and the record of his hearing before the judge clearly indicated that there was nothing on the applicant\u2019s criminal record.",

The Court considers that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of those proceedings would have been if they had not been affected by the statute of limitations. In any event, assuming that there was an irregularity in the record, as the applicant asserts, the Court considers that the alleged shortcoming could not be said to amount to such a \u201cgross or obvious irregularity\u201d as to render the arrest and subsequent pre-trial detention unlawful (see Mooren, cited above, \u00a7 75). It observes that an official arrest and search report, signed by the applicant, was drawn up properly; this report stated that the applicant had in fact been arrested on suspicion of attempted abduction (paragraph 4 above). The applicant\u2019s arrest and detention, and all other investigative acts, were documented in the records; the applicant was informed of the charges against him, and he was notified of his rights as a suspect and underwent medical examinations. At the end of his time in police custody the applicant was brought before the judge, who decided to remand him in pre-trial detention (compare with the serious irregularities observed during the arrest and detention of the applicant in the case of Venskut\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a010645/08, \u00a7\u00a7 75-81, 11 December 2012).",

However, the criminal investigation conducted by the Kartal public prosecutor revealed that the applicant had been presented alongside gendarmes in civilian clothes. The applicant did not repeat this allegation before the Court. In the Court\u2019s view, examination of the file did not reveal any procedural irregularity which could, under national law, have resulted in the identification parades concerned being invalid.",

Indeed, following an anonymous call reporting the presence of an individual who resembled the person depicted on the photofit of the alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults, gendarmes went to the area indicated by the caller and proceeded to arrest the applicant. During his hearing, the applicant himself admitted that he resembled the person depicted on the photofit of the alleged perpetrator. While it is true that the DNA test revealed that the applicant was not responsible for the sexual assaults (see paragraph 6 above), it had no effect as regards the attempted abductions of the children, since during the identification parade organised during the applicant\u2019s time in police custody, the two victims and the witness had identified the applicant as the perpetrator of the abduction attempts (compare with Fernandes Pedroso v.\u00a0Portugal, no. 59133/11, \u00a7 102, 12 June 2018, where the applicant complained in particular that he had been identified from a photograph, in the absence of an identification parade). Accordingly, having regard to the particular nature of the facts giving rise to the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty, the nature of the alleged offences, and the information in the file, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention were based on sufficient evidence to persuade a neutral and objective observer that the applicant could have committed the offence charged (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0182, and O\u2019Hara v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a037555/97, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR\u00a02001 X).",

Belgium (dec.) no.\u00a042914/98, 6 April 2004).
