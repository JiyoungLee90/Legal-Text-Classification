She had lacked the motivation for more active participation in her individual programme, remaining passive and inert, with no insight into her own behaviour and uncritical in respect of her criminal conviction. However, with time the applicant's attitude had altered for the better. She had expressed a higher level of motivation for completing her daily duties and had satisfactorily participated in her counselling sessions, distancing herself from negative events in the section, and concentrating on herself.

This approach has been confirmed by the Court's case law. The Court recalls that in the Peers case a cell of 7 sq. m for two inmates was noted as a relevant aspect in finding a violation of Article 3, albeit that in that case the space factor was coupled with an established lack of ventilation and lighting (see Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 70\u201372, ECHR 2001-III).
