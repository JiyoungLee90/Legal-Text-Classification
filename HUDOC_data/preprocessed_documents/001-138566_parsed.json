The report was signed by six gendarmerie officers, including \u0130.S. and M.K., who had taken part in the operation of 3 September 2007. The report drafted by the officers stated that the special operations team had received information that members of the PKK, an illegal organisation, would be going to the house where the applicant and his brother had gone. The information had been given by B.B., the son of M.B., the owner of the house, who had been threatened by members of the PKK. The security forces began search and detection activities in the region at around 3.30 a.m. after the receipt of this information and at 3.30 p.m. the commander of the operation, together with two team commanders, identified four points in the vicinity of M.B.\u2019s house at which the officers could position themselves. At around 7.40 p.m. gendarmerie officers arrived in the vicinity, took up position at the four different points identified earlier by their commanders and waited for PKK members. The applicant and his brother arrived at the house at 8 p.m. and left at 8.10 p.m. When they had left the house, E.\u00d6. and G.A., officers positioned at point no. 3 who had a thermal camera and a night vision device, informed the commander of the operation, \u0130.S., who was positioned at point no. 2, that the applicant and his brother might have weapons on them. They also informed the commander that the applicant and his brother were acting suspiciously and that they had checked the area around the house with their torches and then turned them off. The team commander subsequently asked M.A. and Y.S., officers who were positioned at the same point and who had thermal cameras, whether the applicant and his brother were carrying weapons. The officers informed the commander that the applicant and his brother had objects in their hands which looked like weapons. The team commander then ordered the applicant and his brother to stop when they were 60 metres away. As they failed to do so, officers first fired warning shots in the air (3-5 shots) and then opened fire in the direction of the applicant and his brother (13-14 shots) towards their feet. They stopped firing when the applicant and his brother shouted that they were villagers. The report further stated that when the officers approached the applicant and his brother and found that the former was wounded, they gave him first aid straight away and the applicant was transferred to Elaz\u0131\u011f Military Hospital by helicopter. According to the report, a total of twentysix spent bullet cases were found where the officers had been located and there was a distance of 15 to 30 metres between the officers and the applicant and his brother.",

The military prosecutor noted that the applicant had stated that he and his brother had had their torches on when he had been shot and that there had been hundreds of shots. The prosecutor found these claims unfounded, considering that at the time of the shootings night had not entirely fallen and that it would not therefore have been reasonable to have torches switched on. In the light of the statements of the applicant and his brother that they had not at first realised that they were being targeted and had only thrown themselves to the ground after the shooting had started, the prosecutor considered that the accused officers had not fired directly towards the applicant and his brother. The prosecutor further noted that the applicant\u2019s brother, M.B. and B.B. had all stated that the officers had fired because they had considered the applicant and his brother to be terrorists, a statement which was in line with the accused officers\u2019 defence submissions. According to the prosecutor, the manner in which the applicant and his brother had acted (staying in the house only for 5 minutes, leaving the house without the hosts coming out of the house, keeping a distance between them and turning their torches off while walking) had justified the officers\u2019 suspicions that they were terrorists. The prosecutor further noted that, had there been hundreds of shots fired, the applicant\u2019s brother would also have been injured. The prosecutor considered that it had been reasonable for the gendarmerie officers to think that the torches had been weapons as it had been dark and because the torches, whose dimensions were 25 cm x 15 cm, had not been switched on, and that the information given to the security forces had corresponded to the circumstances as they unfolded. The military prosecutor finally found it established that gendarmerie officers had fired towards the ground and towards the feet of the applicant, whom they had considered to be a terrorist, and with a view to effecting his arrest in accordance with the law. He therefore concluded that the officers had not been at fault and had not used excessive force.",

The gendarmerie officers thus had adequate time and resources to give thought to different ways of observing possible suspects and apprehending them by using nonlethal methods. Thus, it cannot be said that the security forces had to take decisions and act in the heat of the moment (compare with Anik\u00a0and Others v. Turkey, no. 63758/00, \u00a7 63, 5 June 2007).

In fact, \u0130.S. was the commander of the whole operation of 3 September 2007. The same officers also secured the crucial evidence, such as the spent bullet cases found in the area. The Court considers that allowing the same unit of gendarmerie officers involved in the operation to take such an active part in the investigation was not only so serious as to taint the independence of the entirety of the investigation but also entailed the risk that evidence crucial for establishing the responsibility of the gendarmerie officers would be destroyed or ignored (see G\u00fclbahar \u00d6zer and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63; Mi\u017eig\u00e1rov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 74832/01, \u00a7 100, 14 December 2010 and Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a7 333-341, ECHR 2007II).",

What is more, when the public prosecutor visited the area in question three of the members of the security forces who had directed and taken part in the operation accompanied him. The Court does not ignore the fact that they made statements to the public prosecutor in their capacity as suspects. Yet, the Court finds the absence of the applicant\u2019s lawyer, his brother or the witnesses during that visit inappropriate. In the Court\u2019s view, their presence would not only have helped the public prosecutor in establishing the circumstances of the incident, it would have also given the applicant\u2019s representative or his brother a chance to challenge the statements of the officers on the spot. The Court further observes that the Mazgirt Public Prosecutor failed to inspect M.B.\u2019s house with a view to verifying his statements that his house had been hit by the bullets and, thus, assessing the proportionality of the force used. Neither did he ensure the collection of the bullets used during the operation.",

There is nothing in the documents submitted to the Court demonstrating that the Mazgirt Public Prosecutor attempted to eliminate this inconsistency. He also failed to enquire why and how the statements of five gendarmerie officers, namely M.A., Y.S., R.E., B.B.A. and M.K., regarding the operation were almost identical to the extent that most of the texts were word-for-word the same. The Court also cannot overlook the fact that only ten of the twenty-six officers who took part in the operation of 3 September 2007 made statements before the Mazgirt Public Prosecutor.",

What is more, the military public prosecutor\u2019s decision of 31 December 2008 does not contain any reference to statements taken at his office. It appears that the Elaz\u0131\u011f Military Public Prosecutor simply took into account the statements taken by the Mazgirt Public Prosecutor, as well as the documents prepared by the latter. It appears that he did not conduct an onsite inspection either. The Court is therefore led to conclude that the Elaz\u0131\u011f Military Public Prosecutor rendered his decision solely on the basis of the investigation conducted by the Mazgirt Public Prosecutor, contrary to what was claimed by the Government.",
