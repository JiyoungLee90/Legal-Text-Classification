He and his family lived in Karrada, a Shi\u2019a-dominated district of Baghdad. In June 2003 he began working for a security company. After a year and a half he switched to another company in the same business and in January 2007 he began working for the biggest security company in the country which had connections to the US military. In May 2007 his clan disowned him due to this affiliation. In his work he had access to the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d, the international area of Baghdad. He also had the right to bear arms and to search suspected criminals. In October 2007 members of the Badr militia visited his house and told his wife that he should appear at their office for questioning. Some days later the al-Mahdi militia, which cooperated with the Badr militia in his neighbourhood, made the same demand. On 20 October 2007 he received a threatening letter pasted to his car, urging him to stop working for the US troops or else he would be killed. He asked his employer for help, but did not get any. On 1 November 2007 his house was hit by shell fire and was completely destroyed. No other house in the street was hit. He suspected that the two militias were behind the attack. The police arrived, but did not take any action. He and his family went to live with his parents-in-law in another part of Karrada. Three days later he left for Sweden, leaving his wife and son behind in Baghdad. In October 2008 they were assaulted at the home of his parents-in-law by men who were asking about his whereabouts. In late 2008 a friend visited his destroyed house in Baghdad and found another threatening letter addressed to the applicant which was forwarded via the applicant\u2019s wife to Sweden. The applicant claimed that he would risk persecution and inhuman treatment from the militias and his clan if he were to return to Iraq. He was also worried that he could be badly treated by the US military which may believe that he had disclosed information about them and because he brought with him his service identification cards when he left Iraq.",

The Board held that he had not proved his identity, but that he had made it plausible that he was from . It further considered that the situation in  as such did not constitute grounds for asylum. Noting that the applicant had not had any difficulties for religious or political reasons and that he had been able to live in a Shi\u2019a-dominated area without anything having happened to him until October 2007, the Board concluded that the threats against him were local and related to the militias in question. It could not be considered as persecution, however, and there was no indication that he risked persecution upon return. Nor did the Board find that he risked other forms of ill-treatment. In so finding, it noted that he had not been subjected to such treatment previously. Since the applicant had been working for security companies and thereby cooperated with the American troops since 2003, the Board found his claim that he had received threats only in October 2007, four years later, to be peculiar. As to the alleged threats by the militias, the applicant had not been able to state who the people visiting his house were or what had been the purpose of their visits. His accounts in these respects were, according to the Board, mere speculation. Moreover, if the threats concerned his work for the American troops, the applicant had since ended that job and the threats could therefore no longer be considered valid. Also the applicant\u2019s accounts of the destruction of his house and the attack on his wife and son lacked details as to who the perpetrators were and why the actions had been undertaken. Consequently, no connection had been shown between the militia visits and the alleged subsequent events and the latter events did not indicate that the militia groups were still looking for him. In this context, the Board also noted that a remarkably long period of time had passed between the applicant\u2019s leaving Iraq and the alleged attack on his family members. It was further deemed peculiar that someone should have left a threatening letter at his demolished house long after his escape from the country. Furthermore, the applicant had not been able to explain why his clan would pose a threat to him. Finally, the Board noted that the incidents to which the applicant claimed to have been exposed were locally restricted to the Shi\u2019a-dominated Karrara district; as a Sunni Muslim he should be able to move to a Sunni part of Baghdad.",

The court considered that, even though the applicant and his family had been assaulted in Iraq, there was no evidence of a remaining threat against him upon return. In so finding, the court noted that it had not been shown that there was a connection between the various incidents and that the applicant did not know who were the perpetrators or why they had carried out the acts. Furthermore, almost a year had passed between the destruction of the house and the assault on his family. His wife and child had stayed in Baghdad during this period and, if any group had had an interest in him to the alleged extent, they would in all likelihood have searched for him more actively. The court further took into account that more than two years had passed since the applicant had stopped working for the security companies and, consequently, that it was not likely that he would be exposed to further threats due to his former work if he were to return to Iraq. Also, many of the incidents dated back a number of years and had to be seen as consequences of the difficult general security situation in Iraq in 2007.",

Additionally, he submitted several documents in Arabic and translations into Swedish. The documents, a report to the police by the applicant\u2019s brother, instructions of an investigating judge, witness statements by the brother and neighbours and a police account of measures taken \u2013 all dated in October 2008 \u2013, provide the following account of events. On 10\u00a0October 2008 at 10 p.m., a black car stopped outside the applicant\u2019s house and four men got out of the car and went into the house.

Armed groups are also thought to be responsible for targeted attacks on government and security officials, politicians, tribal and religious leaders, and members of religious and ethnic minorities, among others. Occasionally, local cells manage to coordinate attacks across the country. The number of civilian casualties, though less than at the peak of violence in 2006 and 2007, remains nonetheless significant with around 4,000 civilians killed in both 2010 and 2011, respectively. At least 464 civilians were killed in January 2012, in what appeared to be a surge in mass casualty attacks. Shi\u2019ite civilians have been the most affected. After a short lull in violence, several major attacks across central Iraq were again reported in late February, March and April 2012.",

The number of civilian deaths from suicide attacks and car bombs decreased in 2011 compared to previous years, to an average of 6.6 per day. While these attacks still account for the highest number of civilian deaths each month, the number of civilians killed from gunfire/executions rose to an average of 4.6 per day in 2011. This suggests that an increasing number of Iraqis, especially government and security officials, are being individually targeted. Violence is mostly concentrated in the predominantly Sunni or mixed central governorates of Al-Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Ninewa, Kirkuk, and Salah Al-Din, but occasionally moves into the mainly Shi\u2019ite governorates further south. Armed Sunni groups such as Al-Qa\u2019eda in Iraq and Ansar Al-Islam are thought to be responsible for most of the violence. Shi\u2019ite armed groups have to a large extent been integrated into the ISF [Iraqi security forces] and the political process, though they reportedly maintain their independent military capabilities and at times threaten to use it to further their political agendas. Armed groups target civilians on the basis of their (imputed) political views, religion, ethnicity, social status or a combination of reasons. As a result of the weak law enforcement and justice system, persons at risk of persecution are reportedly unable to find protection or judicial redress. Observers mention undue political influence, the lack of trained legal professionals and corruption as further obstacles to the administration of justice, including in the Kurdistan Region. Legal professionals continue to work in a very difficult security environment, and remain a target of armed groups. Crime is widespread and some armed groups reportedly engage in extortion, kidnappings and armed robberies to fund their other, politically \u2013 or religiously, or ideologically \u2013 motivated activities, conflating acts of persecution and criminality. Consequently, the line between persecution and criminality appears to be increasingly blurred.\u201d",

This was the case, in particular, between the Badr Corps, the armed wing of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq / Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, and the Jaysh Al-Mahdi, the armed wing of the Sadrist Movement led by cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr. Jaysh Al-Mahdi became the main Shi\u2019ite opposition to the foreign coalition forces in Iraq after the fall of the former regime in 2003. It staged two uprisings against US forces in April and August 2004 and launched numerous attacks against mainly US military targets. Attacks on US forces peaked in mid-2007, when Jaysh Al-Mahdi was responsible for the majority of all US casualties. Both the Badr Corps and the Sadrists have integrated into the political process and the Sadrists have become a major political force and main backer of Prime Minister Al-Maliki. However, none of these groups have given up military capacity and, in the case of Jaysh Al-Mahdi / Promised Day Brigades, sporadic attacks on US targets continued into 2011. Some members of the Badr Corps, and to a lesser extent the Jaysh Al-Mahdi, have been integrated into the ISF. Armed Shi\u2019ite groups are accused of having a major role in the sectarian cleansing that followed the February 2006 Al-Askari shrine bombing. Armed Shi\u2019ite groups were significantly affected by the ISF-led offensives in southern Iraq and Sadr City/Baghdad in 2007\u20132008.",

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v.

These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials.

The UNHCR concludes that such individuals associated with or perceived to have been associated with supporting the US forces in Iraq are, depending on the circumstances, likely to be in need of international refugee protection on account of their (imputed) political opinion. The applicant (whose general credibility was not questioned by the domestic authorities) has already been the subject of threats, including, threats upon his life, whilst living and working in Iraq. These threats, he claims, were related directly to his association with the US forces. His home was targeted, specifically, and destroyed and his wife and son were assaulted after his departure from Iraq. The applicant\u2019s profile thus places him within a specific risk category of Iraqi asylum seekers.",

I cannot share this perspective. It has been reported that 2013 has, thus far, been the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008. The Interior Ministry has put the death toll for the month of November alone at 1,121 and the number of people injured at 1,349. Thus, even if one were to accept that the general situation in Iraq is not to be regarded as being sufficiently serious as to cause by itself a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of an individual\u2019s forcible return thereto, the significant escalation in violence this year is, nevertheless, of sufficient seriousness as to weigh heavily in the balance when assessing, cumulatively, any risk of exposure to treatment that would violate Article 3 of the Convention.",

For example, the Migration Board found it \u2018peculiar\u2019 that the applicant only received threats in 2007 four years after he had started working with security companies and thereby cooperating with the American troops (\u00a7 9). However, it is clear from the judgment (\u00a7 8) that the applicant\u2019s work with the company that actually had \u2018connections to the US military\u2019 had only commenced in 2007 (the year in which threats were received) and not in 2003. Another reason for the rejection of the applicant\u2019s claim was his inability to identify his attackers or to state who the \u2018visitors\u2019 to his house were or why they had carried out the attacks (\u00a7\u00a7 9, 12). How, precisely, are victims of targeted violence supposed to \u2018identify\u2019 those who terrorize them in arbitrary and unpredictable attacks? To be required to meet such an onerous test is to impose upon a person fleeing persecution an unreasonable and disproportionate burden. Further, while the Migration Court accepted that the applicant and his family had been assaulted in Iraq, it rejected his appeal, nevertheless, because it considered, inter alia, that the applicant failed to show that there was any connection between the various incidents and thus no remaining threat against him in the event of his return (\u00a712). The applicant\u2019s entire claim, however, is based upon the fact that there is, indeed, a connection between the various incidents in that they were all forms of retaliation against him for his imputed collaboration with the US military. That submission is plausible. That such attacks occur precisely because of perceived cooperation with foreign forces is confirmed by international observers.",

The applicant cannot be blamed for what his brother said to the men who arrived at the applicant\u2019s former home after he had fled to Sweden. The majority, to my mind, accords too much weight to this alleged discrepancy and too little weight to the overall credibility of the applicant - a credibility which those who interviewed him found no reason to question. The general reliability of the applicant\u2019s account when taken together with his specific risk profile and viewed in the light of the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, lead me to conclude that the applicant would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 2 or 3 of the Convention should the Respondent State return him to Iraq at this time.",
