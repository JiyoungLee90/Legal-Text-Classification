Such a period may be considered reasonable only in exceptional circumstances which the respondent State must account for. In this connection, the Government pleaded the excessive caseload of the Court of Appeal and organisational difficulties it had encountered. However, as the Court has repeatedly held, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, as the most recent authority, the S\u00fc\u00dfmann v.
