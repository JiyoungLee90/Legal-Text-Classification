For the purposes of the proceedings, the Secretary of State accepted that the question of early release from a determinate sentence fell within the ambit of Article 5 of the Convention and that Article 14 was therefore engaged. Hooper J found that there was differential treatment between analogous groups, namely those serving sentences of fifteen years or more and those serving sentences of almost fifteen years, in that prisoners serving sentences of fifteen years or more had to secure a recommendation from the Parole Board and approval from the Secretary of State whereas those serving almost fifteen years needed only a recommendation from the Parole Board. However, he considered that the differential treatment pursued the legitimate aim of reserving to a politically and democratically accountable minister the power to control the release of those serving long determinate sentences. He further considered that the power was proportionate in light of the problems posed by such prisoners for public safety and public order. Accordingly, he found that there was no violation of Article 5 together with Article 14.",

But this is not what the law of England and  provided, in respect of long-term determinate prisoners, at the times relevant to these appeals. That law provided for a time at which (subject to additional days of custody imposed for disciplinary breaches) a prisoner must, as a matter of right, be released, and an earlier time at which he might be released if it was judged safe to release him but at which he need not be released if it was not so judged.",

I accordingly find that the right to seek early release, where domestic law provides for such a right, is clearly within the ambit of article 5, and differential treatment of one prisoner as compared with another, otherwise than on the merits of their respective cases, gives rise to a potential complaint under article 14.\u201d",

This is because prisoners are divided by the domestic system into broadly defined categories, or groups of people, according to the nature or the length of their sentences. These categories affect the way they are then dealt with throughout the period of their sentences. As a result they are regarded as having acquired a distinctive status which attaches itself to them personally for the purposes of the regime in which they are required to serve their sentences. This is most obviously so in the case of prisoners serving life sentences and where distinctions are drawn between short-term and long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences. It is less obviously so in the case of long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences of different lengths.",

This suggests that a generous meaning should be given to the words 'or other status' while recognising, of course, that the proscribed grounds are not unlimited. It seems to me, on this approach, that the protection of article 14 ought not to be denied just because the distinguishing feature which enabled the discriminator to treat persons or groups of persons differently in the enjoyment of their Convention rights had not previously been recognised.",

The differential treatment of prisoners serving 15 years or more had, in my opinion, become an anomaly. That would not, in itself, be a ground for holding it to be unjustified. Anomalies are commonplace. But by 2002 it had, in my opinion, become an indefensible anomaly because it had by then come to be recognised that assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner, in the application of publicly promulgated criteria, was a task with no political content and one to which the Secretary of State could not (and did not claim to) bring any superior expertise.

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to \u201cthe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\u201d safeguarded by those provisions. However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention and to this extent it is autonomous (see Thlimmenos v.  [GC], no. 34369/97, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2000IV; and Kafkaris v.

A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may however infringe the Article when read in conjunction with Article 14 for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature (see, for example, the Belgian linguistic case (merits), 23 July 1968, \u00a7 9, Series A no.\u00a06, pp.\u00a033-34). Accordingly, for Article 14 to become applicable it suffices that the facts of the case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see, for example, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

(extracts) (currently pending before the Grand Chamber), the Government contended that the consistent jurisprudence of the Court, in application of Gerger, was that differences of treatment based on different laws providing for criminal penalties and procedures, being necessarily impersonal, fell outside the scope of Article 14 (see, for example, Budak and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57345/00, 7\u00a0September 2004; and Y\u0131lmaz and Bar\u0131m v. Turkey (dec.), no. 47874/99, 26\u00a0May 2005). In particular, the Court had held in Gerger that differences in treatment between prisoners in relation to parole would not give rise to \u201cother status\u201d where the difference in treatment was based on the legislature's view of the gravity of the offence. In the present case, the Government argued that the difference in treatment was a consequence of the view taken by the legislature of the gravity of the offence: for offences so serious that they justified a determinate sentence of imprisonment of fifteen years or more, the legislature had agreed that the Secretary of State should decide on possible release on licence, by contrast with less serious offences attracting sentences of less than fifteen years. In this regard, the Government disagreed with the applicant's submission that the Court in Gerger had considered the justification for the difference in treatment in deciding that there was no evidence of discrimination. In the Government's view, it was clear that the Court was applying the \u201cpersonal characteristic\u201d principle in order to assess whether the difference of treatment complained of fell within the meaning of \u201cother status\u201d.",

The Government argued that to the extent that the applicant sought to compare himself to prisoners serving determinate sentences of less than fifteen years, this difference did not exist independently of the matter of which he complained. The length of the sentence had as such no relevance to the law that governed how a prisoner served his sentence, although the Government accepted that being a prisoner could constitute \u201cother status\u201d for the purpose of Article 14.",

To\u00a0find otherwise would render nugatory the limit on Article 14. By way of example, the Government cited Article 5 \u00a7 4: in the case of a determinate sentence, that Article was satisfied by the sentencing exercise carried out by the trial court. The argument that, because Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not require a review of a determinate sentence prisoner's continuing detention, whereas it does require a review of the lawfulness of the continuing detention of a prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence, the determinate sentence itself constitutes \u201cstatus\u201d was, in the Government's view, circular.",

He argued that account should be taken of the purpose of the Convention, namely that it was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (citing Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, \u00a7 53).

Accordingly, the applicant concluded that even if a ejusdem generis construction were to be considered appropriate, this would not lead to a limitation of the scope of Article 14 based on personal characteristics. The applicant further referred to a number of cases in which he claimed that the Court had found Article 14 to be applicable without insisting on a \u201cpersonal characteristic\u201d (citing,\u00a0inter alia, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0October\u00a01996, Reports 1996IV; National Union of Belgian Police v.\u00a0Belgium, 27 October 1975, Series A no. 19; Larkos v.

He further pointed out that being a prisoner has previously been found by the Court to constitute \u201cstatus\u201d (see Shelley v. the United Kingdom, no. 23800/06, 4 January 2008) and argued that the correct test for deciding whether Article 14 applied was whether there was a distinct legal situation which was inextricably bound up with the individual's personal circumstances and existence. In the applicant's case, he was a member of a group to whom a differential legal regime applied, which was a regime that controlled his release into society and his relationships with his family, which were clearly matters of personal circumstances and existence.",

The Government have argued for a more limited interpretation, calling in particular for the words to be construed ejusdem generis with the specific examples listed in Article 14. The Court observes at the outset that while a number of the specific examples relate to characteristics which can be said to be \u201cpersonal\u201d in the sense that they are innate characteristics or inherently linked to the identity or the personality of the individual, such as sex, race and religion, not all of the grounds listed can be thus characterised. In this regard, the Court highlights the inclusion of property as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. This ground has been construed broadly by the Court: in James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 74, Series A no. 98, the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained was between different categories of property owners; in Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7\u00a7 90 and 95, ECHR 1999III, the difference was between large and small landowners. In both cases, the Court accepted that the provisions of Article 14 were applicable.",

In Engel and Others, cited above, the Court held that a distinction based on military rank could run counter to Article 14, the complaint in that case concerning a difference in treatment as regards provisional arrest between officers on the one hand and non-commissioned officers and ordinary servicemen on the other. In Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, 29 November 1991, \u00a7 64, Series A no. 222, the Court found a violation where there was a difference in treatment between the applicants and other holders of planning permissions in the same category as theirs. Although the Court did not specifically address the question of the relevant \u201cstatus\u201d in that case, it would appear that the distinction of which the applicants complained was between holders of outline planning permission who benefited from new legislation and holders of outline planning permission who did not (in that case, by virtue of the fact that the applicants' planning complaint had already been determined by the Court and that the outline planning permission had been found to be invalid \u2013 see \u00a7 26 of the judgment). In\u00a0Larkos v. Cyprus, cited above, \u00a7 21, where the Court found a violation of Article 14 as a result of a distinction between tenants of the State on the one hand and tenants of private landlords on the other, the parties did not dispute that Article 14 applied and the Court saw no reason to hold otherwise. In Shelley, cited above, the Court considered that being a convicted prisoner could fall within the notion of \u201cother status\u201d in Article 14. In Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v. Lithuania, cited above, again the Court did not specifically address the question of \u201cother status\u201d but in finding a violation of Article 14 and Article 8 implicitly accepted that status as a former KGB officer fell within Article 14. Most recently, in Paul\u00edk v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 10699/05, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006XI (extracts), the Court accepted that the applicant, a father whose paternity had been established by judicial determination, had a resulting \u201cstatus\u201d which could be compared to putative fathers and mothers in situations where paternity was legally presumed but not judicially determined.",

In Paul\u00edk, cited above, there was no suggestion that the distinction relied upon had any relevance outside the applicant's complaint but this did not prevent the Court from finding a violation of Article 14. The question whether there is a difference of treatment based on a personal or identifiable characteristic in any given case is a matter to be assessed taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim of the Convention is to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see\u00a0Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 37; and Cudak v.\u00a0Lithuania [GC], no. 15869/02, \u00a7 36, 23 March 2010). It should be recalled in this regards that the general purpose of Article 14 is to ensure that where a State provides for rights falling within the ambit of the Convention which go beyond the minimum guarantees set out therein, those supplementary rights are applied fairly and consistently to all those within its jurisdiction unless a difference of treatment is objectively justified.",

The Court observes that the approach adopted in Gerger has been followed in a number of cases, but all concerned special court procedures or provisions on early release for those accused or convicted of terrorism offences in Turkey (see, for example, Budak and Others, cited above; Y\u0131lmaz and Bar\u0131m, cited above; Akbaba v. Turkey, no. 52656/99, \u00a7 28, 17\u00a0January 2006; and Tanr\u0131kulu and Deniz v. Turkey, no. 60011/00, \u00a7 37, 18\u00a0April 2006). Thus while Gerger made it clear that there may be circumstances in which it is not appropriate to categorise an impugned difference of treatment as one made between groups of people, any exception to the protection offered by Article 14 of the Convention should be narrowly construed. In the present case the applicant does not allege a difference of treatment based on the gravity of the offence he committed, but one based on his position as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of more than fifteen years. While sentence length bears some relationship to the perceived gravity of the offence, a number of other factors may also be relevant, including the sentencing judge's assessment of the risk posed by the applicant to the public.",

Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 104, ECHR 1999IV). Where an early release scheme applies differently to prisoners depending on the length of their sentences, there is a risk that, unless the difference in treatment is objectively justified, it will run counter to the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention.

In\u00a0this regard, the Government emphasised that the Secretary of State was accountable to Parliament for the operation of the prisons and for the criminal justice system as a whole and that Parliament had decided that the Secretary of State should continue to be responsible for the early release of long-term determinate sentence prisoners.

The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (Burden, cited above, \u00a7 60; and Carson, cited above, \u00a7 61). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (Stec and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a02006).

As to the latter, as the Court noted in Stafford, cited above, \u00a7 80, it is not apparent how public confidence in the system of criminal justice could legitimately require the continued incarceration of a prisoner who has served the term required for punishment for the offence and is no longer a risk to the public. However, the Court considers that more stringent early release provisions in respect of some prisoners may be justified where it can be demonstrated that those to whom they apply pose a higher risk to the public upon release. The Court therefore accepts that in principle such differences in treatment between groups of prisoners pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the public.",

The Court has found that only considerations of risk could justify the imposition of different early release requirements in the present case (see paragraph 74 above). Given the apparently greater risk posed by life prisoners, the Court is of the view that a system which imposes on them less stringent conditions for early release while prisoners serving fixed-term sentences of fifteen years or more are subject to more stringent conditions appears to lack any objective justification. In this regard, the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 concerning the right of life prisoners to have their initial release determined by a judicial body cannot provide the justification for treating long-term prisoners less favourably.",
