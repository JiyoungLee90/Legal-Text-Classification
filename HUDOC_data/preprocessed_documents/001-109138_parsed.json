When officer P. had already crossed the mezzanine floor between the first and the second floor and when V.P. and officer K. were just arriving to the mezzanine floor, V. P. suddenly turned, struck with his open palm the left shoulder of the officer who held him by the wrist, broke away and jumped, head first, through a closed window into the yard. After having reeled, officer K. unsuccessfully attempted to catch him by the legs as they disappeared through the broken window. The police officers started to shout in order to have an ambulance called, ran out to the yard and provided, together with other officers, first aid to V. P.

Turkey, no. 21987/93, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, ECHR 1996-VI, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, no. 21893/93, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, ECHR 1996-IV). It has further recognised that for assessing whether that Article has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 69 and Aksoy v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54). The applicants may be dispensed from exhausting domestic remedies should they show that they had a negligible prospect of success in pursuing them (Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 73). The Court has held, particularly in respect of the procedural limb of Article 2 of the Convention, that applicants are not obliged to use a recourse unable to bring about any independent investigation and incapable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the perpetrators of fatal assaults, still less of establishing their responsibility (Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, \u00a7 119-121, 24 February 2005). Furthermore, the Court has found in respect of Article\u00a013 of the Convention that, as a general rule, if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of effectiveness, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (Kud\u0142a v. Poland, cited above, and \u010conka v. Poland, cited above).

Such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. A positive obligation will arise, the Court has held, where it has been established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual by a third party or himself and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (Keenan v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 90; Osman v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 116; Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2002-III). However, even where it is not established that the authorities knew or ought to have known about any such risk, there are certain basic precautions which police officers and prison officers should be expected to take in all cases in order to minimise any potential risk to protect the health and well-being of the arrested person (Mi\u017eig\u00e1rov\u00e1 v.
