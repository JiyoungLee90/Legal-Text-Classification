In that connection, among many documents examined, the report also referred to the information provided by the enforcement authorities, which specified the total amount paid to the applicant company by the Iron and Steel Company and the interest rate applied in the calculation of that amount. It pointed out that the applicant company, which had not been active for a long time, appeared to have made a substantial number of transactions with some of its partners, without any documents justifying them. Moreover, it found that the company had profited from its investments in foreign currencies, which had not been declared to the authorities. Concluding that the applicant company had acted fraudulently in its bookkeeping, the report requested that corporate income tax and provisional tax be imposed on it, together with a penalty for potential lost revenue.",

Reiterating the content of the records drawn up during the visits to that latter address, the report noted that after having obtained a search warrant from the Magistrates\u2019 Court, the inspectors had had to seize the relevant documents and take them to the Tax Inspectorate, as the audit could not be carried out there due to the staff\u2019s behaviour and as it was not the applicant company\u2019s registered business address within the meaning of section 139 of the Tax Procedure Act (Law no.\u00a0213).",

In submitting that request, inspector S.K., who was acting in the name of the Tax Inspectorate, explained why she considered that a search should be conducted at the applicant company\u2019s business premises. Besides pointing out that there were indications of tax evasion, which was a prerequisite for making such a request pursuant to section 142 of the Tax Procedure Act, she referred to her previous visits to the said premises and argued that the representatives of the applicant company had acted in a manner which obstructed the work of the tax inspectors. In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the search and seizure warrant was based on reasonable grounds. It does not accept the applicant company\u2019s argument that the request for a warrant had been made in bad faith in that the requested documents had already been presented to the inspectors at its business premises, as the gist of the request was that an audit could not be carried out at those premises due to the difficulty caused by the representatives of the applicant company themselves.

The inspectors sealed the documents they deemed relevant for the audit and stated that an inventory would be drawn up at a later stage. The Court notes that such an inventory was indeed drafted after the seals of the bags containing the documents had been broken, in line with section 143 of the Tax Procedure Act. By a letter sent approximately one month before the bags were unsealed, the applicant company was invited to be present during the procedure. However, neither the first applicant nor any other person representing the applicant company accepted the invitation. Under those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant company implicitly but unequivocally waived an important guarantee offered to it by the domestic legal system (see, mutatis mutandis, D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, \u00a7 202, ECHR\u00a02007IV), which would have allowed it to perform an ex post facto check of the content of the bags in order to reveal whether the authorities had seized any documents that were irrelevant for the tax audit, as it alleged (see Cacuci and S.C. Virra & Cont Pad S.R.L., cited above, \u00a7 99). In that connection, the Court contends that the first applicant\u2019s letter, sent only one day before the unsealing procedure, requesting information as to the meaning of the word \u201cunsealing\u201d (see paragraph 20 above), does not constitute sufficient reason to depart from this finding. It notes that the applicant company benefited from the assistance of a lawyer during that period (see paragraph 15 above). Moreover, it did not explain why it had failed to attend the unsealing procedure and did not mention its lack of understanding of the procedure either before the domestic courts or in the present applications.",

As the Government pointed out, those documents appear to be at the disposal of the applicant company pursuant to section 144 of the Tax Procedure Act. The Court further observes that the applicant company did not make any requests for the return of its books and documents either. It notes that under section\u00a0145 of the same Act, it could have had the seized documents returned to it on condition that its representatives signed the records drawn up by the inspector during the course of the audit. That would have enabled it to have access to them and to submit whatever comments it wished to make about the inspector\u2019s findings before the end of the audit.",

Virra & Cont Pad S.R.L., cited above, \u00a7 101). It notes that the applicant company had the opportunity throughout the taxation proceedings to contest the impugned measures and their impact on its rights. All of its complaints concerning the circumstances in which the search and seizure were carried out and the tax-assessment report was drafted were examined by the Tax Court and were found to be unsubstantiated. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to arrive at a different conclusion from that of the domestic authorities. It reiterates that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited, it being in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply that law (ibid., \u00a7 103).",

Nevertheless, the Court notes that the documents the applicant company requested were not among those relied on in the tax-assessment report and were not in the case file before the court, causing no hindrance to its ability to have a complete picture of the case (see, mutatis mutandis, Schuler-Zgraggen v.

Nor is there anything to call into question the objective impartiality of the domestic court. Lastly, despite the applicant company\u2019s allegations that the Tax Court failed to examine whether the amount it had received from the Iron and Steel Company had been subject to taxes, the Court observes that the domestic court assessed these arguments and dismissed them in its judgment (see paragraph 34 above).",
