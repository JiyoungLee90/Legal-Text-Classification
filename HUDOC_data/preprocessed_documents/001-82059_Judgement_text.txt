The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 15 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Lensk, a town in the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic of the .
The applicant brought a civil action against the Ministry of Finance of the , seeking to recover the monetary value of state promissory notes for purchase of a Russian-made car.
On 3 April 2003 the Lenskiy District Court of the  (Yakutiya) found for the applicant and awarded her 91,500 Russian roubles.
By a decision of 5 May 2003 the Supreme Court of the  (Yakutiya) rejected an appeal by the Ministry of Finance and upheld the judgment. On the same date the judgment of 3 April 2003 acquired legal force but it has never been enforced.
On 1 September 2004 the President of the Supreme Court of the  (Yakutiya) referred the case to the Presidium of the Supreme Court, upon the defendant's application for supervisory review.
On 23 September 2004 the Presidium quashed the judgment of 3 April 2003, as upheld by the decision of 5 May 2003, and dismissed the applicant's claim in full. In so deciding, the Presidium noted that the courts had failed to take into account the provisions of the Federal Law on State Promissory notes of 1 June 1995, as amended on 2 June 2000, which extended the period of redemption of the state promissory notes until 31 December 2004. In the Presidium's assessment, that failure amounted to a substantial violation of the material law warranting a re-examination of the case.
The applicant submitted that she had not been properly notified of the session of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the  (Yakutiya) of 23 September 2004 and therefore she could not attend it. The defendant's representative had attended the hearing and presented his arguments. According to the Government, the applicant had been informed of the date and the time of the hearing by a letter of 13 September 2004. The applicant submitted that she had become aware of the decision of 23 September 2004 on 8 November 2004 when she had received it by post. She provided the Court with an envelope sent by the Supreme Court of the  (Yakutiya) postmarked on 8 November 2004.
