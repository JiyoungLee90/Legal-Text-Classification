They asked the court to (a) issue declaratory judgments confirming that they were still holders of a specific number of shares, (b) order the DAB to transfer the corresponding number of shares from its portfolio to them, and (c) order the bank to record them as holders of the specified number of shares in the bank\u2019s register of shareholders. Finding for the plaintiffs, the High Commercial Court directly applied Article 48 \u00a7 1 and Article\u00a049 \u00a7 4 of the Constitution (see paragraph 20 above).

U-III-3471/2003 of 16 March 2006 (presented in paragraph 36) it became clear that a constitutional complaint in the instant case would be ineffective. Firstly, this last judgment was issued in the context of a lawsuit founded upon a different legal basis. Applicants should not be required to predict the prospects of success of a remedy on the basis of judgments and decisions concerning claims that relied upon different legal provisions, even if certain constitutional issues may be common to all such cases. Secondly, in a legal system which does not adhere to the principle of stare decisis or recognise the binding force of precedent, there is always a certain level of uncertainty as to whether a first judgment or decision concerning a legal issue will be followed. In particular, a court sitting in a different composition may interpret the relevant legal provisions differently. Applicants should be encouraged to plead on the basis of the Convention in order to seek to trigger changes in the domestic case-law, especially in States where the Convention is directly applicable. One has to note in this context that, in general, domestic courts in Europe develop attitudes that are favourable to the effective enforcement of the Convention rights and the Court should take this into account when assessing the question whether the applicants should have exhausted specific remedies (compare the partly dissenting opinion of Judge Wojtyczek appended to the judgment in the case of Camelia Bogdan v. Romania, no. 36889/18, 20 October 2020 (not yet final)). Thirdly, outcomes of cases may depend upon the quality of the pleadings. A party convincingly pleading a new case may obtain a different outcome. Fourthly, what matters here is not whether the Constitutional Court would have examined the gist of the applicant\u2019s case but whether the possible quashing of the final judgment by this domestic court could result in the examination of the gist of the grievance by any domestic court.",

There is no doubt that its financial situation deteriorated severely and that it was facing serious difficulties.

However, the question whether the bank should have been nationalised is a different matter. It is necessary to note that several crucial issues connected with this question have not been addressed in the domestic proceedings. In particular, the authorities did not examine whether any means less restrictive than nationalisation were available. They did not assess with precision the real level of the risk of insolvency. They did not consider the possible evolution of the bank\u2019s condition, taking into account its real capacity to recover uncertain debts and to develop other profit-making activities. Without taking a firm stance on the question whether the impugned interference was objectively justified, one has to conclude that the reasons adduced by domestic authorities to justify the bank\u2019s nationalisation are not sufficient. The Court should have found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 also for this reason.",

There are therefore strong indications that the impugned measures were not objectively justified. Under the Court\u2019s case law, if the authorities do not justify an interference with a Convention right, the Court may find this interference disproportionate (see, for instance, Association Rhino and Others v.

Only the company, endowed with legal personality and acting through its competent governing bodies, can take action in respect of corporate matters (see Olczak\u00a0v.

Accordingly, in respect of measures directly affecting the company, victim status before the Court can only be claimed by the company itself. It is only in certain very exceptional situations that the Court has accepted that shareholders may be entitled to bring a complaint on behalf of the company (see Albert and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 139, 142-45). By contrast, the possibility for a shareholder to submit complaints in his or her own right is limited to circumstances where his or her rights as shareholder were directly affected as such, e.g., where the measures complained of were directly aimed at the applicant\u2019s rights as shareholder and where, therefore, the applicant\u2019s own rights as protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were directly affected (see Olczak, cited above, \u00a7 58, and Albert and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 126-27).",

In such a situation, shareholders will, inevitably (albeit indirectly), be affected by such measures because, applying the most fundamental features of company law, the losses of share capital incurred must ultimately be attributed to the holders of the shares; as the lowest ranking stakeholders they will have to suffer the inevitable consequences of the company\u2019s financial failure, thus incurring the risk inherent in their investment.",

Therefore, any remedy capable of being effective for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 (as well as, on the substance, Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and/or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) would have had to exist against that decision, primarily by an action both (a) against the decisionmaker responsible for the Decision in question (i.e. the Government of Croatia) and (b) directed at the annulment of that decision in whole or in part and/or an action for damages against the State for having imposed an allegedly unlawful or unconstitutional measure. If such a remedy was available but has not been exercised, the problem arises that the applicant will have failed to exhaust domestic remedies. If, on the other hand, no such remedy was available, there will be a problem of failure to comply with the six-month rule, which the Court is required to apply even in the absence of an objection raised by the respondent Government.",

The requirements contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and the six-month period are closely interrelated. Normally, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of the exhaustion of domestic remedies. However, in application of this provision the Court will only have regard to domestic remedies which are normal and effective. Thus, an applicant cannot extend the strict six-month time-limit imposed under the Convention by seeking to make inappropriate or misconceived applications which are unable to offer effective redress for the complaint in issue under the Convention. It follows that if an applicant has recourse to a remedy which is doomed to fail from the outset, the decision on that remedy cannot be taken into account for the calculation of the six-month period (see, among many other authorities, Leki\u0107 v. Slovenia [GC], no.\u00a036480/07, \u00a7\u00a0112, 11\u00a0December 2018). Furthermore, where no effective remedy is available at the domestic level, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect or prejudice on the applicant (see, among many other authorities, Jeronovi\u010ds v. Latvia, no.\u00a0547/02, \u00a7 75, 1 December 2009).",

On the contrary, the first action it brought was an action before the commercial courts against the bank and the DAB (the State Agency for Deposit Insurance and Bank Resolution), respectively the subject of the Decision of 23 September 1999 and the agency directed by that decision to fund the bank\u2019s recapitalisation and to become the holder of the new shares that were to be issued by virtue of that decision. It appears that, in this action, the applicant company sought (a) a declaratory judgment to be issued against the bank \u201cconfirming\u201d that the applicant company remained the holder of the portion of shares in the bank that had belonged to it before the Decision of 23 September 1999; (b) an order for the DAB to \u201ctransfer\u201d the corresponding number of shares from its portfolio to the applicant company; and (c) an order for the bank to record the applicant company as holder of those shares (see paragraph 13 of the judgment). In other words, what the applicant company attempted was to obtain a judgment by which the bank and the DAB would have been required to \u201cundo\u201d the effects of the Decision of 23 September 1999, which itself remained in force and which the commercial courts had no jurisdiction to quash.",

Firstly, the shares had been extinguished by the Government\u2019s Decision of 23 September 1999, which was not annulled at any stage, nor otherwise found to have been unlawful or unconstitutional, and thus continued to produce its legal effects. Secondly, it would have been incompatible with the fundamental principles pertaining to public companies for the bank to \u201crestore\u201d the shares extinguished by the above Decision. A company cannot issue new shares unless it obtains a corresponding cash payment toward its share capital. Otherwise, the result would be either a fictitious increase of the nominal capital or the dilution of the value of all existing shares. Nor could it be envisaged that the civil/commercial courts would or could order the \u201ctransfer\u201d of shares from one shareholder, the DBA, which, by virtue of a measure which remains legally valid, had obtained title to those shares, for the benefit of a person (the applicant company) whose shareholdings had been extinguished through that very same measure. In our view, the attempted remedy was not and could not have been effective. Its anomaly is so blatant that, even making allowance for the fact that we are concerned here with a legal system that is not our own, we cannot see any reasonable excuse for the postponement of the complaint before this Court beyond the six months provided for in Article 35 \u00a7 1 by reference to the pursuit of such proceedings.",

As stated above, we consider that the originally attempted remedy was clearly futile from the outset. However and in any event, it must have become clear at the very latest through the publication of this decision by the Constitutional Court that the applicant company could not entertain any expectation either that (a) the High Commercial Court, in the context of the proceedings on appeal (see paragraph 16 of the judgment), could revisit the question of the lawfulness or constitutionality of the Decision of 23 September 1999; or that (b) its own constitutional complaint initiated on 14 October 2008 (see\u00a0paragraph 17), more than nine years after the Government\u2019s Decision and more than two years after the decision of the Constitutional Court confirming its constitutionality, would subsequently result in a reversal of the position taken. Thus, even assuming that the applicant company could not have realised from the outset that no remedy would be effective without the prior annulment of the Decision of 23 September 1999, or else an incidental finding to the effect that the Decision was unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful, this must at the very latest have become clear at the time of the publication of the above decision by the Constitutional Court (compare Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a046477/99, 7\u00a0June 2001).",

In these kinds of situations, however, both time and legal certainty are very much of the essence. It seems clear that there were certain deficiencies in the Croatian legal framework, including importantly the availability of and access to timely and effective remedies, at the time when the restructuring measures regarding Croatia Bank were taken (see in particular paragraphs\u00a083-84 of the judgment). This in turn has without doubt contributed to a situation where some of the original shareholders have attempted to have recourse to \u201csurrogate\u201d remedies which, however, have been without any prospect of success. Nevertheless and in any event, the bottom line is that the historic underlying problems cannot now be rectified through the vehicle of a judgment of the Court addressing complaints based, not on the substance of the underlying decision, but solely on the recourse to such futile \u201csurrogate\u201d remedies.",

Croatia, nos.\u00a022238/13 and 6 others, 14 May 2020). However, our specific concern in the present context is that the application of this practice in the present case (see paragraph 111) is particularly inappropriate. In our view, it is highly problematic if shareholders, who are bound to be the first to suffer the losses of a company\u2019s failure, can first spend (many) years pursuing domestic legal proceedings which, from the outset, had no real prospect of success, thereafter bringing their complaints before this Court, and after yet more time has passed obtain a finding of a (procedural) violation of the Convention, the only remedy for which is said to be a request for the reopening of the same (futile) proceedings. After all, although these proceedings were always (and have proved to be) unsuited to their intended purpose, and although the Croatian Constitutional Court has since ruled conclusively on the substantive validity of the Government\u2019s Decision of 23\u00a0September 1999, this Court\u2019s recommendation nonetheless appears to raise the prospect (or at the very least an expectation) that the restructuring effected more than two decades ago will now be called into question and somehow \u201cundone\u201d for the benefit of the original shareholders. Such a scenario fundamentally undermines legal certainty in a manner which in our view is wholly unacceptable.",

In our opinion, any such development would be inconsistent with the Court\u2019s approach to date and, as a matter of principle, profoundly unsound. As a result, the Court should do what it can to avoid such a situation; something it will unfortunately have failed to do if the present judgment should become final.",
