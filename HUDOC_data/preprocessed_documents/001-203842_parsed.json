It was further noted that the seizure of assets belonging to third parties was triggered by the nature of the crime of money laundering. In the specific circumstances of the case, the prosecutor explained that the measure was justified for several reasons: the proceeds of crime had not been recovered, the accused were shareholders of N. and there was a risk that assets belonging to it would be alienated, and also, the accused had put in place a fictitious circuit of money and assets, more specifically the kiosks in question, according to which N. became the final beneficiary of the lease contracts since both companies \u2013 N. and S.C. \u2013 were controlled by the same accused.",

It clarified that it owned 779 of the 1,483 kiosks seized by the contested decision. It claimed that maintaining the measure breached its right to property, as guaranteed by the Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. It also argued that the seizure had been unlawful since Article\u00a0163 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the old CCP (see paragraph 33 below) provided for the seizure of assets only from the suspect or accused, and none of the situations listed in Article 118 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph\u00a038 below) were applicable in its case. In its opinion, the measure had also been unnecessary since the purpose of this type of measure was to prevent the suspect, accused or party liable under civil law from selling its assets or going bankrupt. However, the seizure decision did not refer to any specific fact necessitating the adoption of such a measure in respect of assets belonging to a third party to the criminal proceedings, such as itself. Lastly, the applicant company argued that the seizure of its assets had prevented it from using its property and had caused it a loss of EUR 387,352 excluding tax, as calculated by a financial expert.",

The prosecutor observed that in previous proceedings before the courts all sales contracts concluded by S.C. concerning the kiosks (see paragraph 12 above) had been annulled and the assets returned to N., therefore the reasons on which the seizure measure had been based were no longer valid. This decision was communicated to N.",

The decision stated that on 16 March 2018 the seizure had already been lifted as regards 1,390 kiosks, following a request submitted by the injured party, N. (see paragraph 26 above). However, that decision had failed to identify the kiosks concerned and so, to date, there were still ninety-three kiosks formally seized. Therefore, since the reasons for the lifting of the measure applied to all the kiosks, it was decided to lift the measure as regards the remaining ninety-three kiosks and to reject the applicant company\u2019s request for the remaining kiosks as being devoid of purpose. As regards the six vans, noting that the applicant company had notified S.C. of the termination of the lease contract, the prosecutor considered that they had remained the applicant company\u2019s property and decided to lift the seizure, ordering their return to the applicant company. Since there was evidence indicating that the truck had been sold (see paragraph\u00a06 above) and then sublet by S.C., the prosecutor considered that further verifications were necessary and decided to examine the request concerning the truck separately in a future decision. With respect to the applicant company\u2019s request for compensation for losses incurred, the prosecutor decided that such a request was not within the competence of the prosecutor\u2019s office.",

It claimed that the lifting of the seizure had been a mere formality since the assets concerned were not in its possession, had not been identified and had not been returned to it in the authorities\u2019 presence. It further requested that the ninety-three kiosks and six vans be identified, their depreciation due to use be valued by the prosecutor and possession of the goods be restored in the authorities\u2019 presence. It also contested the prosecutor\u2019s decision as regards the truck, which, in its opinion, was in the same situation as the kiosks and vans. It requested that the seizure be lifted, that the truck be identified and that possession of the truck be restored under the authorities\u2019 supervision. Furthermore, it alleged that the prosecutor had wrongly rejected its complaint against the seizure of the 779 kiosks, since the decision of 16\u00a0March 2018 had ordered the lifting of the seizure in favour of N. and had not even been communicated to the applicant company. The latter also contested the rejection of its claim for compensation. In this connection, it submitted that the assets seized had been used for the benefit of N. and considered that the benefits generated by their use should be returned to it as rightful owner. In conclusion, the applicant company requested the annulment of the decisions of 16 March 2018 and 6 March 2019, the lifting of the seizure in respect of the 779 kiosks, six vans and one truck, their identification and valuation and restoration of possession in the authorities\u2019 presence.",

The new CCP, in force after 1 February 2014, includes similar provisions in Articles\u00a0538 and 539 on the right to compensation for judicial error and unlawful detention. Under these provisions, a person who receives a final conviction has the right to be compensated for any damage suffered if the conviction has been overturned and a final decision for acquittal has been pronounced owing to a new or recently discovered fact that proves that the conviction was the result of a judicial error. A person unlawfully detained in the course of criminal proceedings has the same right.",

The plaintiff in this case (an ex-customs officer and former member of parliament) had been placed in pre-trial detention for several months during the criminal investigation and then convicted by a court. Subsequently, his conviction had been overturned, the criminal investigation reopened and the charges against him dropped. In whole the proceedings against him lasted eleven years and ended with the prosecutor\u2019s decision to close the investigation as he had committed no crime. Under Articles 504 and 505 of the former CCP concerning the right to compensation for unlawful conviction and deprivation of liberty (see paragraph 39 above) and the general tort provisions in Articles 998 and 999 of the former Civil Code (see paragraph\u00a040 above), the court awarded the plaintiff compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The court established that the plaintiff first had been held in pre-trial detention but subsequently had not been brought before a court and had had the charges against him dropped. This was considered by the court to be a judicial error giving rise to the right to compensation. The court awarded compensation for a number of measures adopted by the prosecutor during the investigation and their excessive duration. These measures included the pre-trial detention and seizure of the plaintiff\u2019s car.",

The Constitutional Court explained that Article 957 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided for the possibility of requesting the lifting of the seizure if a sufficient real or personal guarantee was given by the debtor. Accordingly, in criminal matters, a suspect or defendant whose assets had been seized could, during the criminal proceedings, request the lifting of the measure if he or she offered a sufficient guarantee, made a deposit covering the entire value of the debt or paid the entire debt.",

It pointed out that the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of 30 January 2014 on which the Government had based their arguments (see paragraph 43 above) concerned a claim for compensation for unlawful detention to which the claim for compensation for the alleged unlawful seizure had been accessory. As regards the Government\u2019s second allegation concerning the possibility to seek compensation from N. or from those accused in the criminal proceedings, the applicant company submitted that there was no legal provision allowing a third party to the criminal proceedings to be compensated for damage caused by an excessively lengthy preventive measure ordered by the prosecutor while the investigation was still ongoing. Also, the possibility to request the lifting of the seizure under Article 957 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 44 above) was only available to a suspect or defendant and only after offering a guarantee.

The Government did not contest the interference with the applicant company\u2019s property rights over the seven vehicles seized (six vans and a truck). However, as regards the kiosks, they claimed that these assets appeared to be the property of another company, which had even concluded valid purchase contracts in respect of them (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 59 above). The Court observes that, in accordance with the lease contracts concluded for the kiosks, the applicant company remained their owner (see paragraph 9 above). Moreover, following the user\u2019s failure to fulfil its contractual obligations, the applicant company asked for the return of the kiosks (see paragraph 11 above). The Court further observes that the applicant company notified the prosecutor of its property rights over the seized kiosks on 23 November 2010 (see paragraph 18 above) and that the purchase contracts mentioned by the Government were annulled in court proceedings (see paragraph 26 above). Therefore, the seizure complained of may be regarded as an interference with the applicant company\u2019s exercise of its right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions in respect of the seven vehicles as well as the 779 kiosks.",

The three\u00a0rules are not, however, \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected.

Under the above-mentioned legal framework, the adoption of preventive measures such as seizure was compulsory for the crimes under investigation in the present case (see paragraph 37 above). The Court further observes that the seizure was justified by the need to secure the subsequent special confiscation in order to recover the proceeds of crime and to guarantee payment of the fine applied (see paragraphs 15 and\u00a016 above). The provisions on special confiscation set forth by Article\u00a0118 letters a) and e) of the Criminal Code in force at the relevant time, allowed for the confiscation of assets produced or acquired through the commission of a crime, in other words of the proceeds of crime, without specifying whether this concerned only assets belonging to the perpetrator (see paragraph\u00a038 above). Nevertheless, on this point the Court considers, as held on numerous occasions, that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts and it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see among many other authorities, Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.\u00a0Ireland, 29\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 222; and S.C.

The seizure involved assets considered by the authorities to be necessary to recover the proceeds of crime and to secure their subsequent confiscation (see paragraphs 15, 16 and 19 above). Therefore, the seizure measure in the instant case was carried out in the general interest to ensure that the use of the property in question did not benefit the defendants to the detriment of the community (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Phillips v. the United Kingdom, no. 41087/98, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a02001VII).

The Court notes, along with the applicant company, that the Constitutional Court explained in the decision submitted by the Government (see paragraph 44 above) that this possibility was open to a suspect or defendant whose assets had been seized and only after offering a sufficient guarantee, making a deposit covering the entire value of the debt or paying the entire debt. However, the applicant company was neither a suspect nor defendant in the criminal proceedings. Even supposing that the above-mentioned provisions had been applicable to the applicant company, which was not party to the criminal proceedings, the Court observes that, in order to be able to apply for the lifting of the seizure, it would have had to cover the debt caused by the crimes under investigation.

It is true that in 2014 new criminal law provisions entered into force providing for the possibility of contesting measures such as that in the present case before the courts (see paragraph 35 above). However, the new provisions also introduced a time-limit for lodging such complaints (three days from the adoption of the measure) and the Government did not submit any examples of case-law where the domestic courts had examined, after 2014, complaints against measures ordered by the prosecutors under the old CCP lodged by third parties during the criminal investigation.

It thus lasted for more than eight years and eight months. Moreover, according to the applicant company (see paragraphs 30 and 67 above), even after the measure was lifted, the authorities failed to identify the assets in question and return them to their lawful owner. Also, no decision was adopted in relation to the truck, which was also not returned to the applicant company. During this entire period, the applicant company was deprived of the possibility to use its assets and/or to contest their seizure before a court, and no specific legal provision or case-law example allows for the conclusion that it would have been able to obtain compensation for the interference with its property rights (see paragraph 85 above).
