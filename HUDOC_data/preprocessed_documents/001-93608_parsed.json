They had forced all the family members on to the floor and searched the house. After that they had handcuffed her son Arbi Karimov and without letting him get dressed had taken him and his father into the yard and forced them into the Ural vehicle. Then the intruders had released her husband, but had taken away her son Arbi. During the search the men had taken family belongings (kitchen utensils, male underwear), passports and documents for the family car. The abductors had used four APCs and four Ural vehicles, as well as several UAZ and GAZ (\u201cGazel\u201d) vehicles. All the registration numbers were covered with mud. According to the applicant, on 16-17 January 2003 she had complained about her son\u2019s abduction to the International Committee of the Red Cross. From the organisation\u2019s response, in which they had referred to a letter from the military prosecutor\u2019s office of military unit no.\u00a020102, she had found out that Arbi Karimov had been eliminated during a special operation.",

There were Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The armed men who had abducted Arbi Karimov spoke Russian without an accent, which proved that they were not of Chechen origin. The men had arrived in military vehicles late at night, which indicated that they were able to circulate freely after curfew. The men had arrived at the applicants\u2019 house as a large and well-organised group and they had acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. They were wearing specific camouflage uniform, were armed and were using APCs, which would not have been available for paramilitary groups. The applicants further pointed out that the investigators had accepted the factual assumptions as presented by the applicants concerning the involvement of Russian military servicemen in the abduction (see paragraph 68 above) and that the investigators had failed to credibly refute the information provided to the Red Cross about the killing of Arbi Karimov while resisting arrest.

The Government further alleged that the applicants\u2019 description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction was inconsistent. In particular, the applicants\u2019 accounts concerning the number of APCs involved in the events and the abductors\u2019 behaviour were questionable, as the events had taken place at night, with no light, and while the applicants had been forced on the floor; the applicants had provided to the Court and to the investigators of the criminal case different lists of the property taken away by the abductors; finally, the applicants had failed to inform the investigators about the village residents who had witnessed the abduction. The Government contended that the fact that the perpetrators of the abduction spoke unaccented Russian and were wearing camouflage uniforms did not mean that these men could not have been members of illegal armed groups trying to prevent leakage of information which could have been available to Arbi Karimov from his brother Umar Karimov, who had been a member of illegal armed groups. They pointed out that groups of Ukrainian, Belorussian and ethnic Russian mercenaries had committed crimes in the territory of the  and emphasised that the fact that the perpetrators had Slavic features and spoke Russian did not prove that they were attached to the Russian military. They also observed that a considerable number of armaments and APCs had been stolen from Russian arsenals by insurgents in the 1990s and that members of illegal armed groups could have possessed camouflage uniforms. The abductors also could have been criminals pursuing a blood feud. The Government further contended that the investigation of the incident was pending, that there was no evidence that the men were State agents and that there were therefore no grounds for holding the State liable for the alleged violations of the applicants\u2019 rights.",

Nevertheless, it considers it very unlikely that several military vehicles, such as APCs and Ural vehicles, unlawfully possessed by members of illegal armed groups, could have moved freely through Russian military checkpoints without being noticed.

In their application to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that Arbi Karimov had been detained by unknown servicemen and requested the investigation to look into that possibility (see paragraphs 28, 34, 35 and 69 above). The domestic investigation also accepted factual assumptions as presented by the applicants (see paragraph 68 above) and took steps to examine whether federal forces were involved in the kidnapping (see paragraphs 45, 48, 50 and 59 above), but it does not appear that any serious steps had been taken in that direction.",

The investigation in case no.\u00a042009 was instituted on 14 January 2003, that is, three days after Arbi Karimov\u2019s abduction. It appears that in spite of the relatively timely opening of the criminal proceedings, a number of essential investigative steps were subsequently either delayed or were not taken at all. For instance, the Court notes that, as it follows from the information submitted by the Government, the investigators had not identified or questioned any servicemen from the local military and law enforcement agencies who could have participated in the events on the night of the abduction; they had not established the identity of the owners of the APCs and Ural operating around Proletarskoye on the night in question and they had not elucidated the alleged inconsistencies in the description of the events in the witness statements provided by the applicants and their neighbours to the investigators. Further, the investigators had failed to take investigative measures, other than one interview with an employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross (see paragraph 78 above), to clarify the circumstances surrounding the receipt by this organisation of the information about the killing of Arbi Karimov during a special operation or to identify and question the other residents of Proletarskoye who, according to the applicants, had also been abducted on the same night and released a few days later (see paragraph 69 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced or received this information. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2004XII).",

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to suspend them were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
