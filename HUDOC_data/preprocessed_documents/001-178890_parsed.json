The fact that the applicant association had sought registration under the name \u201cOrthodox Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d had implied that its real intention was to create a parallel orthodox religious group to the MOC, which had been using that name (Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese) \u201cconstitutionally, historically, actually and continuously\u201d (\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e, \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0432\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) for over eight centuries. That was not in compliance with section 8 (2) of the 1997 Act, under which only one religious community could be registered for one faith group. The Commission referred to a decision of the Constitutional Court which had found that provision compliant with the Constitution. It had ruled that the provision had protected people from being manipulated and same-faith believers from being divided into several religious groups (U.br.223/97 of 28 October 1998, see paragraph 54 below). The Commission also argued that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that it was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese. This was confirmed on 17 July 1967 when the Ohrid Archdiocese declared autocephaly, which was continued by the MOC. The Commission further held that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had asked the Industrial Property Bureau (\u201cthe Bureau\u201d, \u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442) to register the name \u201cMacedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese\u201d in its trademark register (TM 2004/574).",

Consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association\u2019s Holy Synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association\u2019s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court\u2019s interpretation that the expression \u201cGreek\u201d was an English translation of \u201cOrthodox Church\u201d was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the MOC to which \u201cOhrid Archdiocese\u201d had been unlawfully added. In this connection the applicant stated \u201c(it) differs from the MOC, with which we refuse to be associated.\u201d It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of two churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same, namely \u201cChristian Adventist Church (church of the Adventists of the Seventh Day) in the Republic of Macedonia\u201d and \u201cChristian Adventist Church in Macedonia\u201d. It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that \u201chad the court had difficulty with the intended name, it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied. This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name\u201d; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the MOC; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox Greeks and Serbs in the respondent State, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to.",

He stated \u201cI\u2019m prevented from exercising my freedom of religious observance in association with other people on a voluntary basis.\u201d He further argued that without legal-entity status the applicant association was prevented from enjoying certain statutory rights: it could not construct religious temples; its members could not conduct religious ceremonies; it could not instruct religion or create religious schools; and it could not manage its property, nor could it hold bank accounts. Bishop D. invited the court to consider his appeal as submitted on behalf of all members of his religious organisation. Since the Constitutional Court had already rejected a similar appeal lodged on behalf of several people (U.br.182/09, see paragraph 55 below), he consented that his appeal be regarded as being submitted only in his name.

In support of their arguments they referred to the relevant jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above) and provided statistical information regarding cases submitted to the Constitutional Court under Article 110 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution. Between 1992 and 2012, of 214 constitutional appeals lodged with the Constitutional Court thirty-five were decided on the merits (in only one case, in 2010, the court found a violation of freedom of political activity) and 164 were rejected on formal grounds.

The Rules of that court further specified that \u201cany citizen\u201d could seek protection from the Constitutional Court of the rights and freedoms set out in that Article. The relevant jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court demonstrates clearly that it had full jurisdiction to decide constitutional appeals submitted by physical persons (see paragraph\u00a057 above). However, the domestic practice was somewhat uncertain when it comes to a constitutional appeal of an association or organisation through which individual members act collectively in a field of mutual interest. From the available material, it appears that the Constitutional Court initially declined jurisdiction to decide such appeals (see paragraphs 20, 36 and 55 above). This practice prevailed in 2009-2010 i.e. at the time when D.N., a founding member of the applicant association, lodged constitutional appeals which had relevance for the present case. It was only later, and only in one case, that the Constitutional Court accepted jurisdiction and decided on the merits an appeal submitted by a religious community which was not recognised, as in the present case, as having legal-entity status (see paragraph 56 above).",

While it may be necessary for the State to take action to reconcile the interests of the various religions and religious groups that coexist in a democratic society, the State has a duty to remain neutral and impartial in exercising its regulatory power and in its relations with the various religions, denominations and groups within them. What is at stake here is the preservation of pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy, one of the principal characteristics of which is the possibility it offers of resolving a country\u2019s problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome (see Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 412/03 and 35677/04, \u00a7 119, 22 January 2009). The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion (see \u0130zzettin\u00a0Do\u011fan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2016). It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may work together and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 92).",

On the facts of the case, it is clear that the founding members of the applicant (three physical persons), who were also members of its Holy Synod, the highest managerial body (section 6 of the Charter, see paragraph 27 above), gathered at the constituent assembly on 27 April 2009 in order to adopt relevant documents for the applicant association\u2019s registration. At that meeting, they adopted the founding decision, which specified that the applicant association was \u201ca voluntary association ... of Christians\u201d (see paragraph 26 above). The registration court found such a practice to be contrary to the 2007 Act, notwithstanding that similar circumstances regarding the adoption of the founding decision of 1 September 2004 had not led the Commission in the first registration proceedings to refuse to register the applicant association (see paragraph 11 above).

In the context of the freedom of association this is a relevant element since the name is among the most important elements identifying an association, be it religious or otherwise, and distinguishes it from other such organisations. In this respect, the Court accepts the approach underlying the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 20 November 2012 (see U.br.\u00a024/2012, paragraph 56 above) that identical names or names that are substantially the same can create confusion and misperception in the public. Indeed, as stated in that decision there may be a risk that \u201cthe absence of such (distinctiveness of a religious entity) or the competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public ...\u201d and \u201cthe aim of the statutory requirement that the name ... (is) not identical ... is to prevent confusion among believers, incorrect perceptions, and lawful indefinite division of same-faith believers ...\u201d However, in the present case the name chosen for the applicant was sufficiently specific as to distinguish it from the Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese (see point 74 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 59 above). Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant association intended to identify itself with the MOC. On the contrary, during the impugned proceedings it had continuously and expressly refused to be confused or associated with the MOC (see paragraphs 15(c), 26 and 33 above). Lastly, it appears that the public had been sufficiently informed about the applicant association, its leadership and the positions they represented, and that these were perceived as conflicting with those of the MOC (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above).",
