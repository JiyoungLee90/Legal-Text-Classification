Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kud\u0142a v.

By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of the physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the opportunity to use the toilet in private, the availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, the adequacy of the heating arrangements and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was in issue \u2013 measuring between three and four square metres per inmate \u2013 the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with an established lack of ventilation and lighting (see Aleksandr Makarov v.

As it follows from the Government\u2019s submissions, the domestic court annulled the facility administration\u2019s refusal on the ground that it did not comply with the legal norms. At the same time in the two other cases in which the applicant attempted to challenge the facility administration\u2019s actions, the courts, in dismissing the applicant\u2019s complaints, explicitly relied on the fact that the impugned limitations on the applicant\u2019s rights were established legally (see paragraph 72 above). The approach adopted by the Russian courts seems unduly formalistic. It allows a large number of cases, such as the applicant\u2019s, where the conditions of detention result from legal regulations, to be dismissed. Thus, as a result of that stance of the courts, an action to a court offers no prospect of success and could be considered theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective in the sense of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\u201d",

At the same time, it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been beaten up (see, by contrast, Dedovskiy and Others v.

There is also nothing in the case file to show that the use of force against the applicant exceeded the minimum level of severity required in order to raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, or that it was disproportionate to the applicant\u2019s own conduct. In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that the use of force against the applicant on 14 February 2008 was the result of legitimate actions taken by the prison officers to put a stop to the applicant\u2019s unruly behaviour and did not reach the threshold required in order to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment.

At the same time, the documents submitted in support of the Government\u2019s position refer only vaguely to the applicant\u2019s failure to comply with lawful orders, without elaborating on the nature of the orders or the form of the applicant\u2019s defiance which allegedly prompted the use of a rubber truncheon (see paragraphs 63-64 above). It appears therefore that the domestic authorities failed to properly account for the necessity of causing the applicant multiple injuries (abrasions and a haematoma) and to demonstrate convincingly that the use of force had not been excessive. The Court is particularly concerned at the use of a rubber truncheon against the applicant in view of the involvement of a special-purpose unit (see paragraph 59 above), which it finds established in the light of the following considerations. The Court observes, first of all, that the Government did not contest the applicant\u2019s allegations as to the involvement of such a unit in the events in question. Furthermore, according to the material in the case file, the domestic court quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings concerning the use of special means against the applicant as premature and incomplete, and indicated, among other things, that it would be necessary in the course of the additional inquiry to question the head of the special-purpose unit in order to clarify the issue of the unit\u2019s involvement (see paragraph 65 above).

The matter was hence duly brought before the competent authorities at a time when they could reasonably have been expected to investigate the circumstances in question. The applicant\u2019s allegations were corroborated by reference to the results of his medical examination after the incident, which recorded multiple abrasions and a haematoma on the applicant\u2019s body (see paragraph 61 above). The applicant\u2019s claim was therefore shown to be \u201carguable\u201d and the domestic authorities were placed under an obligation to carry out \u201ca thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible\u201d (see, for similar reasoning, Generalov v.

The decision did not elaborate on the measures taken in the course of the inquiry, such as, for example, the questioning of those involved in the incident and of possible witnesses and the examination of the medical evidence.

Relying on the results of the applicant\u2019s medical examination, the report on the use of a rubber truncheon and the statements made by four officers involved in the incident, the public prosecutor\u2019s office arrived at the conclusion that physical force and a rubber truncheon had been lawfully used against the applicant in the course of the search carried out in his cell, owing to his failure to comply with the lawful orders of the prison officers (see paragraph\u00a064 above). Almost a year later, on 27 July 2009, the decision in question was cancelled because the inquiry had been found to be incomplete. It was indicated that in the course of the additional inquiry it was necessary, among other things, to question the applicant, to obtain and examine his medical documents and to question the head of the \u201cTayfun\u201d specialpurpose unit which was allegedly involved in the incident of 28\u00a0October 2007 (see paragraph 65 above).

This length of time does not seem to be unreasonable. It appears, therefore, that the only delay in the proceedings against the applicant for which the domestic authorities could be criticised was the one which occurred from June 2006 to December 2006 as a result of the trial court\u2019s abortive attempt to resubmit the case to the public prosecutor for amendment of the bill of indictment.
