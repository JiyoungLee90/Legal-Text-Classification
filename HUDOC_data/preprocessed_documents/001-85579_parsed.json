Russia, no.\u00a026853/04, \u00a7\u00a7 215 et seq., 13 July 2006). In those cases the Court considered the extreme lack of space to be the focal point for its analysis of compatibility of the conditions of applicants\u2019 detention with Article 3. It found that the fact that an applicant was obliged to live, sleep, and use the toilet in the same cell with so many other inmates was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and arouse in him feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him.",
