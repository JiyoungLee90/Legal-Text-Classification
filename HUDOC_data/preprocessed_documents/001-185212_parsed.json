The details of the applicants\u2019 detention are indicated in the appended table. The Court refers to the principles established in its caselaw regarding inadequate conditions of detention (see, for instance, Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no.\u00a07334/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096101, ECHR 2016). It reiterates in particular that a serious lack of space in a prison cell weighs heavily as a factor to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the detention conditions described are \u201cdegrading\u201d from the point of view of Article\u00a03 and may disclose a violation, both alone or taken together with other shortcomings (see Mur\u0161i\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0122\u00a0141, and Ananyev and\u00a0Others v.

Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, 10 January 2012, the Court already found a violation in respect of issues similar to those in the present case. In that case the Court also stressed that in conditions-of-detention cases the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting allegations made by applicants. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations. The Court further reiterates that certificates issued by the director of the impugned detention facility after the Government have been given notice of the complaint, lacked references to the original prison documentation and were apparently based on personal recollections rather than on any objective data are of little evidentiary value (see, among other authorities, Veliyev v. Russia, no. 24202/05, \u00a7 127, 24 June 2010, and Igor\u00a0Ivanov v. Russia, no. 34000/02, \u00a7 34, 7 June 2007). The Court emphasises that, in every case, the Government have to account properly for the failure to submit the original records, in particular those concerning the number of inmates detained together with the applicant, as well as authentic evidence showing both the size of cells where applicant was detained (floor plans) and confirming correlation between the general prison population, the population in the cells where the applicant was detained and the size of those cells (cell records). It further stresses that documents bearing signs of corrections, such as figures in documents being erased or written over, as in case no. 46863/16, or any other alterations to the documents without any explanations as to the their origin, reason and timing, cannot be considered reliable (see Klyukin v. Russia, no. 54996/07, \u00a7 59, 17 October 2013, with further references).",
