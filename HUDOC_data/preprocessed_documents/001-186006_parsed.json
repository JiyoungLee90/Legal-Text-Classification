In particular, he noted that jurisdiction to deal with alleged delays in administrative proceedings was vested in administrative tribunals under Article 250t of the CCP. This excluded the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court in relation to the length of administrative proceedings as such. However, if an administrative tribunal\u2019s decision concerning the length of administrative proceedings was considered to be arbitrary, the Constitutional Court could still review it under Article 127 of the Constitution for compliance with the requirement of fairness. Moreover, as an action under Article 250t of the CCP had no compensatory effect, it could have been complemented by compensation claims under the State Liability Act.",

The rule in Article 35 \u00a7 1 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has a close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention rights (see, for example, Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000XI, with further references).",

The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 157).",

The Court notes, however, that the situation assessed in the present case is different from that in Csepyov\u00e1 in two respects. First, in the present case the proceedings brought by the applicants comprised not only an administrative phase, but also a judicial phase. Consequently, the Court\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of that remedy and others in the present case is made with reference to such two-tier proceedings as a whole. Secondly, unlike in Csepyov\u00e1, in the present case the absence of established practice demonstrating the effectiveness of an action under Article 250t of the CCP despite its longterm existence, combined with examples of its failure, cannot but be seen as indicative of its actual ineffectiveness.",

Its examination focused rather on the overall effectiveness of the combination of remedies available to Mr I\u0161tv\u00e1n and Ms I\u0161tv\u00e1nov\u00e1 and on whether they had complied with the exhaustion requirement under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in view of how they had made use of those remedies. The central theme of that assessment was that the availability of redress under Article 127 of the Constitution for Mr I\u0161tv\u00e1n and Ms\u00a0I\u0161tv\u00e1nov\u00e1 had been dependent on their making a complaint under the Courts Act (see in particular paragraphs 77, 84, 85 and 91 of that judgment).",
