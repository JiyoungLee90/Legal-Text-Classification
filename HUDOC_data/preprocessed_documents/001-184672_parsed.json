He stated, inter alia, that it was not a priority for him for the girl\u2019s name to be disclosed and that he was not seeking revenge against her. He accepted that, having placed himself in the media spotlight, he had to tolerate publicity which was not always \u201csunshine and lollipops\u201d but criticised the way the media had covered his case. When asked about the girl\u2019s age, he responded that the girl had been in a club where the minimum age had been 20 years and that it had been a shock to find out later that she had been only 18 years old. When asked about his complaints against the girl for allegedly wrongful accusations, he stated again that he was not seeking revenge against those who had reported him to the police, but that it was clear that they had had ulterior motives. He hoped that the police would see that it was important to have a formal conclusion in the case and that the documents in the case were \u201cscreaming\u201d conspiracy.",

In this connection, there are different ways of ensuring \u201crespect for private life\u201d, and the nature of the State\u2019s obligation will depend on the particular aspect of private life that is at issue (see, inter alia, Petrie v. Italy, no.\u00a025322/12, \u00a7 41, 18 May 2017).\u00a0Moreover, where the balancing exercise between the rights under Article 8 and 10 of the Convention has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, no. 39401/04, \u00a7 \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 155, 18 January 2011, Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 88, and Von Hannover v.

Germany, cited above, \u00a7 75). The member States of the Council of Europe may regulate questions of compensation for nonpecuniary damage differently, and the imposition of financial limits is not in itself incompatible with a State\u2019s positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention (see Mertinas and Mertinien\u00e9 v Lithuania (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 51). However, such limits must not be such as to deprive the individual of his or her privacy and thereby empty the right of its effective content (see Biriuk v.

However, they did not find that the interference justified ordering X to pay the applicant nonpecuniary damages and the costs of publishing the judgment in a newspaper. In reaching its conclusion, the District Court, confirmed by the Supreme Court, took into account the applicant\u2019s previous behaviour, the public reputation he had made for himself, the material which had stemmed from him and its substance, which was often ambiguous and provocative and could be interpreted as an incitement to sexual violence, the distribution of the comment, on a Facebook page amongst hundreds or thousands of other comments, and the fact that the statements were removed by X as soon as the applicant so requested. The District Court, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, found that the applicant had received \u201cfull judicial satisfaction\u201d by the comments being declared null and void (see paragraph 13 above).",

In other words, the decision not to grant compensation does not in itself amount to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, in its review, the Court will examine whether the national courts analysed the specific circumstances of the case, including the nature and gravity of the violation as well as the conduct of the applicant. On this basis, and in particular in light of the findings of the District Court, as analysed above (see paragraph 38), the Court finds that it cannot be held that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Icelandic courts, finding that he had been defamed and declaring the statements null and void, was not effective or sufficient with regard to the State\u2019s positive obligations or that the decision not to grant him compensation deprived the applicant of his right to reputation and, thereby, emptied the right under Article 8 of the Convention of its effective content.",

In this regard, the Court notes in particular that although the domestic courts accepted to declare the impugned statements null and void, they did not accept all of the applicant\u2019s claims. Against this background, it cannot be said that the domestic courts handled the issue of legal costs in a manner that appears unreasonable or disproportionate (see paragraph 37 above).",
