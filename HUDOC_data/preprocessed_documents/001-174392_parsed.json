Recalling that pursuant to Article 90 of the Constitution, international treaties that were duly in force were legally binding and that in case of a conflict between the domestic law and the Convention and its Protocols, the latter should take precedence over domestic law, the Constitutional Court held that the fact that a married woman could not solely bear her maiden name constituted a breach of Article 17 of the Constitution.",

France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001V (extracts)). In the present case, the Court does not find any reasons justifying such an exception. In this connection, it notes that the change in the case-law of the Court of Cassation was in October 2015, whereas the present applications were lodged with the Court between 2009 and 2011. While the change in the case-law of the Court of Cassation could provide an effective remedy for new applications, in the present cases, the applicants, who had lodged their applications prior to the aforementioned change, could not be expected to make fresh applications in domestic law before lodging their applications with the Court.
