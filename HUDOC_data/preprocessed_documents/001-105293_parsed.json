I was told that a person suspected of murder was to be questioned and that I was needed as his defence lawyer. When I arrived I saw the accused immediately sign a power of attorney for me to represent him before the police. However, the police officers told me that the defendant had already been questioned and had confessed. I saw a handwritten record of the defendant\u2019s deposition and it was then dictated to the typist. That was the defendant\u2019s entire statement. He did not say anything in my presence. I only asked him whether he was sorry and whether the police had treated him correctly, that is to say whether any force had been used. The defendant denied that there had been any use of force. I did not read myself the handwritten record but, since I was sitting next to the police officer, as was the defendant, I saw that the officer was dictating from that handwritten record to the typist, who was typing on a computer. I was not served with a copy of the typed record of the defendant\u2019s questioning because it is not the custom. Although the defendant had been questioned before my arrival I raised no objections in that respect. I would like to clarify that when the handwritten record was dictated to the typist, the police officer would sometimes repeat a question and ask the defendant whether it had truly been as he was dictating; neither the defendant nor I raised any objections. I did not ask the defendant any questions as regards the circumstances of the critical event because I was told that he had confessed, and he repeated his confession during further questioning when the written record was made.",

The second-instance judgment established that the choice of lawyer P.B. was not imposed on the applicant. Immediately after his arrest, and at the applicant\u2019s request, the police officers attempted to inform lawyer E.Z., but the latter was absent, travelling abroad. After that the applicant engaged lawyer V.M., who did not arrive either. The police then asked the applicant to choose a lawyer from the list of lawyers on duty for each county, compiled and submitted by the Croatian Bar Association, and he signed a power of attorney in respect of lawyer P.B. Thus ... the applicant was not denied the right to a lawyer of his own choosing. Whether the lawyer thus chosen truly offered a satisfactory professional service to the applicant in accordance with the Croatian Bar Association Statute is a question of the lawyer\u2019s professional ethics and not a matter to be assessed in the appeal proceedings, as correctly stressed by the Supreme Court.",

The allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.

It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the organs of the Convention and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (see, amongst other authorities, Walker v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34979/97, ECHR 2000-I).",

Nor can Article 35 \u00a7 1 be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to inform the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to take the start of the six-month period as the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 4 June 2001).",

The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0296-A, and Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports 1996-II). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. To hold otherwise would mean duplicating the domestic process with proceedings before the Court, which would hardly be compatible with the subsidiary nature of the Convention (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a074012/01, \u00a7 42, 6 November 2008). Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires only that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances (see Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7\u00a030, 20\u00a0July 2004, and John Sammut and Visa Investments Limited v.

Thus, Article\u00a06 -\u00a0especially paragraph 3 \u2013 may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 of the Convention is one element, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in paragraph 1 (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 37, and Brennan, cited above, \u00a7 45).",

It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court\u2019s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to \u2018guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective\u2019 and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (Imbrioscia, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

In such circumstances, Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right has so far been considered capable of being subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, has therefore been whether the restriction was justified and, if so, whether, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, it has not deprived the accused of a fair hearing, for even a justified restriction is capable of doing so in certain circumstances (see John Murray, cited above, \u00a7 63; Brennan, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Magee, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused.",

Austria, no.\u00a09300/81, Commission\u2019s report of 12 July 1984, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR\u00a02006-..., and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the CPT (paragraphs\u00a039-40 above), in which the committee repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against illtreatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies.",
