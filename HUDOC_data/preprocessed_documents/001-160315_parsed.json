On seeing him, the applicant\u2019s wife fainted. A doctor was called and a number of female neighbours came to help. At that point the head of the police team informed the applicant that his house was to be searched, briefly showing him the relevant search warrant. The applicant alleged that attesting witnesses G.G. and M.S. were asked to participate only after the search had already begun. It appears that G.G. was a war veteran who had suffered concussion and was seriously disabled, while M.S. was seventyfour years old. The search was conducted by more than ten police officers who also used two specially trained dogs. Having searched the house and not found anything, the police officers started searching the yard and the adjacent buildings. The applicant alleged that during the search of the outside premises, the front door of his house was left open and people, including police officers, were coming and going. Moreover, a group of police officers was standing by the front door while the others continued the search. Having found nothing outside the house, the head of the police team announced that they would again search inside the house, to which attesting witness G.G. objected. Following the additional search the police officers found the above-mentioned plastic bag. The attesting witnesses submitted that their objections were not recorded.

It appears that such appeals can only deal with the substance of the judicial warrant and not the manner of its execution. Although the search warrant prescribed a time-limit of fifteen days to lodge an appeal, no time-limits are prescribed by the relevant provisions of the CCP for lodging such appeals.

Moreover, the search was executed immediately after the applicant was taken to his house on the last day of his administrative detention, and there is no mention in the record of the search about the applicant having been acquainted with the warrant prior to the beginning of the search. This in itself raises doubts as to whether it would, in practice, have been feasible for the applicant to lodge any appeals to contest the grounds of the warrant. The Court notes, however, that despite the fact that the Government have not provided any examples of use, whether successful or not, of the remedy on which they rely, the Court of Appeal did have the competence to carry out further judicial review of the grounds of the search warrant. In any event, the Court is not willing to speculate on what the outcome of the appeal proceedings might have been and whether this remedy could indeed have been effective in the particular circumstances of the present case, since it remains to be established whether contesting the legality of the search warrant in the course of the judicial proceedings against the applicant was a proper avenue of exhaustion for this type of complaint. The Court notes in this regard that the domestic courts examining the applicant\u2019s case were called to determine the charge against him and not the lawfulness of the search warrant. The Court further observes that most of the applicant\u2019s complaints concerned the manner of execution of the search warrant and that, in any event, the courts examining the criminal case did not have the power to invalidate it. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it has not been established that raising the issue of the alleged invalidity of the grounds of the search warrant before the courts determining the criminal charge against the applicant was an effective remedy to exhaust. Accordingly, and in the circumstances where the applicant himself claims that recourse to the right of appeal was not an effective remedy, the sixmonth period in relation to the complaint concerning the grounds of the search warrant should be calculated from 20 April 2004, the date when the warrant was issued and executed. The application having been lodged with the Court on 14 January 2005, the applicant has not satisfied the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in relation to this part of his complaint.",

Under the same provision an application can be submitted to courts within two months from the date on which a complaint was lodged with the prosecutor and no reply has been received.

The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s case was brought before the Armavir Regional Court in early June 2004 whereas the applicant had to apply to the courts within two months from the dates on which he had lodged his complaints with the prosecutor. The Court further observes that the issue of the manner of execution of the search warrant was closely and inextricably linked to the evaluation and admissibility of evidence against the applicant, including the results of the search. Therefore, it can be accepted that, having lodged a number of complaints at the close of the investigation and these having remained unanswered before the case was transferred to the trial court for examination on the merits, it was not unreasonable for the applicant to raise this issue before the trial court (see, mutatis mutandis, Romanova v. Russia, no. 23215/02, \u00a7 172, 11 October 2011). In such circumstances, and notwithstanding the fact that the Regional Court did not in any way address the applicant\u2019s arguments relating to the manner of execution of the search warrant, it cannot be considered that the applicant made use of an ineffective remedy by raising this issue before the courts determining the criminal charge against him. Accordingly, and in the specific circumstances of the present case, the applicant can be considered to have complied with his obligations under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards his complaint concerning the manner of execution of the search warrant.",

In fact, the applicant does not contest that the measures complained of had a basis in domestic law but rather complains that the implementation of the search warrant was in violation of the procedural law. The Court observes that the applicant raised his complaints concerning the procedural irregularities during the execution of the search before the domestic courts which, although without providing detailed reasoning, came to the conclusion that the procedural violations pointed out by the applicant could not be considered as significant rendering the search unlawful under the domestic law (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above). The Court is unable to arrive at a different conclusion. It recalls that the Court\u2019s power to review compliance with domestic law is limited, it being in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply that law (see, among many other authorities, Barthold v. Germany, 25 March 1985, \u00a7 48, Series\u00a0A no. 90). The Court consequently finds that the matters relied on by the applicant do not suffice to establish that the interference was not in conformity with the Armenian law. It will rather address these matters below in its examination of the necessity of the interference. The Court finally notes that no issue arises as to the accessibility or foreseeability of the relevant legal provisions which moreover have not been questioned by the applicant.",

The obtaining of such information is rather a matter which calls into play the Contracting State\u2019s responsibility under Article 8 to secure the right to respect for private life in due form (see Chalkley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 63831/00, 26 September 2002).

The attesting witnesses did not make any such statements before the trial court.
