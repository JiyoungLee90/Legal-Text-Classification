The court reasoned, inter alia, that a valuation under section\u00a0102 of the Property Act had to be based, as a rule, on the market prices at the time of the expropriation. However, no evidence about these prices had been adduced by the municipality. The only data available was that in the expert's report drawn up during the proceedings before the Pleven Regional Court (see paragraph 58 above), which indicated that the value of the property at the time of the mayor's order \u2013 23 August 2002 (see paragraph 55 above) \u2013 was BGN 2,524.50. The court instructed the mayor that this new valuation only replaced the original valuation made at the time of the expropriation, but did not change the manner of compensation. Therefore, the mayor had to issue an order under section 100 of TUPA and specify the exact flat with which Ms Metodieva was to be compensated, thus completing the expropriation procedure. However, it was open to Ms\u00a0Metodieva to request to be compensated in cash instead.",

The State's liability is strict, i.e. no fault is required on the part of the civil servant in the commission of the unlawful acts or omissions (section 4 in fine). Section 7 of the Act provides that the action in responsibility must be brought against the authority employing the civil servant concerned. Section 4 of the Act provides that compensation is due for all damage which is the direct and proximate result of the unlawful act or omission of the civil servant. Section\u00a08(2) of the Act provides that if another statute provides for a special manner of indemnification, the Act does not apply.",

The Government conceded, however, that the procedures for the compensation of the applicants were still pending and that the authorities had not fulfilled their obligation to build and deliver the flats due to the applicants. They submitted that the reasons for this had been the social and economic changes in the country after 1989, the adoption of a package of new restitution laws and the difficulties in providing financing for the construction of the buildings. Nevertheless, the Government argued that most of the applicants had been settled in municipal flats pending the completion of their own flats. The applicants' allegations that these flats were far worse in terms of space and location than those to which they were entitled were obviously exaggerated. Furthermore, the applicants could request full compensation for the damage they had sustained from the delay in actions against the respective municipalities under the State Responsibility for Damage Act.

Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7 111, 30 January 2003, and Toteva v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 42027/98, \u00a7 75, 19 May 2004). Having regard to the complexity of the case, the number of hours spent by the applicants' lawyers working on it does not appear unrealistic. However, the Court observes that Ms N. Sedefova represented before it Mr Kirilov, Ms\u00a0Schneider, Mr Ilchev and Ms Metodieva, that Ms Kalaydjieva represented Mr Kirilov, Ms Schneider and Mr Ilchev, and that Ms\u00a0A.\u00a0GavrilovaAncheva represented Mr Ilchev and Ms Metodieva. In these circumstances, having regard to the overlapping of facts and complaints in the three applications, the Court considers that a certain reduction is appropriate.",
