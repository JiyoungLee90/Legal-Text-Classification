The case originated in an application (no. 9842/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Milan Sedminek (“the applicant”), on 13 February 2007.
The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs T. Mihelič Žitko, State Attorney.
On 4 January 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Polzela.
On 21 August 1996 the applicant bought business premises from company I. Shortly afterwards, he learned that the premises were in fact smaller than had been agreed in the contract.
On 14 September 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against company I. before the Celje District Court, claiming reimbursement of the corresponding part of the purchase price exceeding the payment for the actual size of the premises.
Hearings were held on 26 November 2001 and 19 December 2001. On the latter date the court decided to appoint a construction expert and adjourned the main hearing so that an expert opinion could be obtained. Both parties agreed that I.U. would be appointed as expert.
On 23 January 2002 the Celje District Court appointed I.U. as the construction expert. On 21 February 2002 notification of the appointment and a summons to retrieve the case file were sent to I.U. Two attempts to serve the court’s correspondence on I.U. were made, but he failed to collect them from the post office. The correspondence was finally served on him on 24 May 2002.
After I.U. had failed to retrieve the case file, despite being reminded to do so by the Court in letters dated 17 July and 15 November 2002 respectively, the Celje District Court appointed another construction expert, J.A, on 12 February 2003. The applicant filed a request to have J.A. excluded from the case on grounds of partiality.
On 25 April 2003 the court granted the applicant’s request to have J.A. excluded and appointed a new expert, F. J.
On 5 May 2003 F. J. informed the court that owing to medical reasons he would not be able to fulfil his appointment. On the same date the court appointed V. T. as expert.
On 30 June 2003 V. T. submitted his expert opinion.
On 29 September 2003 the court held a main hearing at which the parties proposed that the expert opinion be supplemented by further information. The main hearing was for that reason adjourned.
On 4 December 2003 V.T. informed the court that there was no need to supplement his opinion.
On 12 January 2004 a main hearing was held. The parties agreed to obtain additional project documentation from company S.
After having obtained the documentation from company S., the applicant informed the court that he would not be requesting a main hearing with regard to the submitted documentation.
On 2 April 2004 the Celje Distric Court delivered its judgment and ordered company I. to pay 1,103,650 Slovenian tolars (SIT − approximately 5,800 euros (EUR)) plus statutory default interest calculated from 1 September 1996.
On 8 April 2004 the Celje District Court decided to open bankruptcy (insolvency) proceedings against company I.
On 6 May 2004 the applicant lodged a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, seeking the amount payable under the Celje District Court judgment of 2 April 2004.
After the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, 247 creditors lodged claims in the total amount of SIT 2,320,682,457 (approximately EUR 12,212,000).
On 7 July 2004 the applicant’s claim in the amount of SIT 5,502,364 (approximately EUR 29,000) was acknowledged in the bankruptcy proceedings.
On 7 February 2007 the receiver reported to the applicant about the debts and assets of the estate, estimating that after distribution to the priority creditors there would probably be nothing left to repay the ordinary creditors.
On 9 July 2009 the Celje District Court issued a decision on the distribution of the bankruptcy estate to the first ranking (secured) creditors.
On 9 August 2010 the Celje District Court issued a decision on the distribution of the bankruptcy estate to the next ranking (preferential) creditors.
On 27 May 2011 the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal with the Celje District Court. In the appeal, the applicant complained about the length of both the contentious and bankruptcy proceedings. He argued that if the contentious proceedings had been conducted within a reasonable time, he would have been able to enforce his claim before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings. He further informed the court that he would be willing to settle in the bankruptcy proceedings for 50% of the claim.
On 8 July 2011 the president of the Celje District Court rejected the applicant’s supervisory appeal on procedural grounds as unsubstantiated, since he had failed to give valid reasons as to why he believed the court had been unnecessarily delaying the proceedings.
The bankruptcy proceedings are still pending.
The Act on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without Undue Delay (Zakon o varstvu pravice do sojenja brez nepotrebnega odlašanja, Official Gazette, No. 49/2006 – “the 2006 Act”) became operational on 1 January 2007. Under its sections 1 and 2, the right to a trial within a reasonable time is guaranteed for parties to court proceedings, participants in non-contentious proceedings and injured parties in criminal proceedings.
Section 3 of the 2006 Act provides for two remedies to expedite pending proceedings – a supervisory appeal (nadzorstvena pritožba) and a motion for a deadline (rokovni predlog) – and, after the case has been finally resolved, a claim for just satisfaction in respect of damage sustained because of the undue delay (zahteva za pravično zadoščenje).

The relevant provisions of the Compulsory Settlement, Bankruptcy and Liquidation Act (Zakon o prisilni poravnavi, stečaju in likvidaciji, Official Gazette 67/1933, in force until 15 January 2008) read:
Section 11
“(2) Bankruptcy proceedings shall be conducted promptly.”
Section 84
“(1) The bankruptcy panel may, in order to protect the interests of creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings, appoint a committee of creditors.”
Section 137
“(1) Creditors shall register their claims with the bankruptcy panel within two months of the notice of the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings being published in the Slovenian Official Gazette.”
The relevant provisions of the Financial Operations, Insolvency Proceedings and Compulsory Dissolution Act (Zakon o finančnem poslovanju, postopkih zaradi insolventosti in prisilnem prenehanju, Official Gazette, no. 126/2007, in force from 15 January 2008, operational from 1 October 2008) read:
Section 48: Principle of the promptness of proceedings
“(1) The court shall execute its procedural acts in insolvency proceedings within the time-limits prescribed by this Act, provided that by exercising its competencies of supervision over the receiver it makes efforts to ensure that all the actions of the receiver executed in insolvency proceedings are completed within the time-limits prescribed by this Act.
(2) Courts and other State bodies shall give priority consideration to matters which involve the debtor in bankruptcy as a party to proceedings, or the result of which affects the progress of bankruptcy proceedings.”
Section 57: Obtaining the capacity ad processum of a creditor
“(1) Creditors shall obtain entitlement to carry out procedural acts in main insolvency proceedings by lodging their claims in the proceedings within the time-limits prescribed in section 59...”
“The committee of creditors shall be a body of creditors which carries out procedural acts in insolvency proceedings which the law stipulates are to be carried out by the committee of creditors, on behalf of all the creditors subject to the proceedings.”
In practice, the bankruptcy proceedings are divided into three stages. In the first stage, claims are registered and acknowledged if they are not disputed by any of the other creditors within a certain time. It is also determined whether any creditors have separate rights entitling them to have assets excluded from the bankruptcy estate. In the second stage, the receiver realises the estate by determining the value of the assets and realising them through sales and recovery claims against third parties. In the third stage, the bankruptcy estate is distributed amongst the creditors.
The Government submitted to the Court copies of four domestic decisions dated 8 May 2008 (Dec. no. Su Np 3/2008), 28 November 2008 (Dec. No. Su Np 99/2008), 1 April 2010 (Dec. No. Su Np 25/2010) and 29 September 2010 (Dec. No. Su Np 64/2010) concerning supervisory appeals of parties in bankruptcy and compulsory dissolution proceedings. All four supervisory appeals were dismissed by the presidents of the competent courts as unfounded.
