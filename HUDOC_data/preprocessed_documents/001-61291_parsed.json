The Supreme Court found that, by declining to enter as a party to the original damage proceedings, the bankruptcy estate of the forwarding agent had not renounced any rights it might have had vis-\u00e0-vis the insurance company under the third party insurance. Consequently, the transfer of its rights under that insurance to the applicant was in fact valid. In view of this and the complexity of other issues raised by the parties in the compensation proceedings adjudicated by the District Court on 7 July 1995, there was no basis for concluding that the applicant\u2019s appeal against that judgment lacked prospects of success. As the inventory of the applicant company did not reveal any other important debts, the declaration of bankruptcy was entirely dependent on the applicant\u2019s possible liability to pay the insurance company\u2019s litigation costs in the compensation proceedings.

Thus, there is no exception to the estate\u2019s liability to pay the bankruptcy costs (chapter 2, section 25, and chapter 14, sections 2 and 3). According to the preparatory works to the Bankruptcy Act (see Government Bill 1986/87:90, pp. 206-207), the creditor who filed the petition for bankruptcy should not be liable for the bankruptcy costs, as it may be difficult for the creditor to make an assessment as to the debtor\u2019s insolvency. Instead, even if a declaration of bankruptcy is later quashed for being factually erroneous, the bankruptcy costs are paid out of the estate. The main reason for this unconditional liability is that the debtor, being aware of the liability, is expected to do the utmost in the District Court in order to avoid being declared bankrupt and, thus, not to wait until the bankruptcy case is pending before a higher court.

In that case, the District Court had summoned the debtor to its hearing in an erroneous manner. Following the hearing, at which the debtor did not appear, the debtor was declared bankrupt. After the Supreme Court had quashed the declaration of bankruptcy, the District Court, in determining the receiver\u2019s fee, recalled that the bankruptcy costs were to be paid out of the estate. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision. The Supreme Court, however, found that the State should pay the bankruptcy costs.

Under the relevant legal provisions, there was an absolute obligation on the part of the bankruptcy estate to bear the bankruptcy costs as long as there were enough assets in the estate. In case a bankruptcy decision was quashed, the bankruptcy debtor had no right to such assets as were necessary for the payment of the bankruptcy costs. As regards the above-mentioned Supreme Court decision of 6 April 1998, the Government pointed out that it had been taken after the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case and that, in that case, the Supreme Court had quashed the bankruptcy decision due to procedural errors and not, as in the applicant\u2019s case, because it had made a different assessment regarding the applicant\u2019s insolvency than that made by the lower courts.

The Bankruptcy Act does not provide for any exception to this payment liability. According to the preparatory works to the Bankruptcy Act (paragraph 32 above), even if a declaration of bankruptcy is quashed for being factually erroneous, this payment liability remains. It is true that, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 6 April 1998, the State \u2013 rather than the bankruptcy debtor \u2013 may be held liable to pay the bankruptcy costs when the declaration of bankruptcy is quashed due to a grave procedural error. However, this decision was taken after the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings in the present case. Furthermore, it provides for an exception to the main rule on payment liability for bankruptcy costs only in very specific circumstances. In the light of the unconditional wording of the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and the preparatory works, the exception established by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision must be construed as having a limited scope, only being relevant in the situations to which it refers, that is, instances where the declaration of bankruptcy is quashed due to a grave procedural error. In the present case, the declaration of bankruptcy was not quashed due to such an error but on account of the Supreme Court making a different assessment than the lower instances in regard to the applicant\u2019s insolvency. Thus, the applicant could not rely on any exception to the main rule that the bankruptcy estate should defray the receiver\u2019s fee in question. ",

Moreover, compensation for costs incurred in the domestic proceedings may only be granted in so far as they were necessary in trying to prevent the violation found (see K\u00f6nig v. Germany (Article 50), judgment of 10 March 1980, Series A no. 36, p. 17, \u00a7 20). In the present case, the Court considers that the hours of work stated by the applicant are somewhat excessive, having regard, inter alia, to the rather limited extent of the domestic proceedings relating to the question of bankruptcy costs and the fact that the proceedings before the Convention organs did not involve an oral hearing. It further takes into account that one of the applicant\u2019s three complaints was unsuccessful. Making an overall assessment, the Court awards the applicant by way of costs the global sum of EUR\u00a012,500, including VAT.",
