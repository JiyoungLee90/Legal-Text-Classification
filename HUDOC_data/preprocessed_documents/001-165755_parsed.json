On the orders of the Air Force Headquarters, the flight took place at a military aerodrome in Ozerne, near Zhitomir. According to the Special Commission, that flight could not qualify as a rehearsal for the performance at the air show, as it included a different sequence of manoeuvres; its purpose was rather to improve and practise piloting techniques. The Commission also established that V.T. had requested an additional training flight in Ozerne and that his request had been turned down by the command, citing a shortage of fuel. Although the air show preparation programme included an on-site rehearsal flight on 26 July 2002, the 14th Corps Commander decided to cancel it for the same reason. The pilots were not formally apprised of the boundaries of the aerobatics zone or the placement of spectators.",

There was a certain asynchronism in the performance of the right and left engines of this aircraft. Overall, however, it was in an acceptable technical condition and remained fully operational until it crashed. The aircraft had been supplied with extra fuel in order to enable the pilots to return to Ozerne without landing at the site of the air show. The fact that the pilots had trained in a different aircraft and with less fuel had a negative impact on their readiness for performing aerobatic displays. For unspecified reasons, the pilots decided to take off without the mandatory anti-gravitation suits (\u201cg-suits\u201d). On arrival at the Sknyliv aerodrome, the pilots immediately started the performance, without taking any time to familiarise themselves with the site, which was new to them. During the performance, the aircraft exited the designated aerobatics zone, the boundary of which was some 150\u00a0metres from the spectators\u2019 area. Neither A.T. nor Y.Ya., directing the flight from the ground, warned them of that fact or directed them to return to the designated zone. Still outside of the zone, V.T. decided to perform a certain aerobatic display (called \u201cthe trunk\u201d), which he had never practised before and which was not included in his mission order. He made a technical mistake in its performance and, as the second pilot did not intervene when appropriate, the pilots lost control of the aircraft and it started falling. Subsequent efforts by the crew to regain altitude were futile. Accordingly, the Special Commission concluded that the principal cause of the accident was a technical mistake on the part of the first pilot in performing a manoeuvre which he had not been commissioned to perform. It also noted that the prompt and appropriate intervention of the second pilot could have saved the situation and that loss of life and damage to health could have been avoided had the ground crew properly guided the pilots to stay within the aerobatics zone.",

In the Special Commission\u2019s opinion, such supervision was particularly important in view of the involvement in the show of officers from different military units that were not subordinate to each other and not accustomed to performing any tasks together.

(the 14th Corps chief flight safety officer), had failed to put in place any meaningful land-and-air safety precautions plan. In addition, the Special Commission regretted S.O.\u2019s decision to cancel the on-site rehearsal flight and concluded that the officers designated to direct the flight as ground crew (A.T. and\u00a0Y.Ya.) had had no relevant experience or clearance for such a mission.",

The mayor, having learned of the military authorities\u2019 initiative to organise the air show, took little action to coordinate the relevant preparatory activities. The show was authorised without the involvement of the competent officers and services legally responsible for carrying out assessments of the relevant safety risks and for taking the necessary prevention and response measures.

It also recognised that the organisation of the air show had been marked by significant shortcomings, including an unsatisfactory land and air safety precautions plan; refusal to arrange at least one training flight for the crew over the Sknyliv aerodrome; and poor supervision by the Air Force Headquarters and the 14th Corps Command of the preparatory activities.

In addition to the shortcomings pointed in the earlier Special Commission\u2019s report, they concluded that the aerobatics zone was too small; the boundaries of the zone were not clearly marked on site so as to be visible from the aircraft, which factor impaired the pilots\u2019 ability to orient themselves; the location of the aerobatics zone was potentially dangerous in case of any unforeseen situation; the airfield\u2019s preparation for the show was carried out without any account being taken of the possibility of pilot error or any other emergency; the crew did not receive a single mission order defining its mission according to all applicable standards; various documents defining its flight parameters were not comprehensive and not fully consistent with each other; the officers of the flight safety service failed to reveal the above shortcomings; the pilots were allowed to take off without g-suits and their preparedness being checked by any competent authority; the position of \u201cair show flights director\u201d assigned to Major-General A.T., which did not feature in any military training documents, appeared to be redundant; it paralleled that of the ordinary aerodrome flights director, with a lack of clarity as to the distribution of authority between the two officers; neither Major-General A.T. nor Colonel\u00a0Y.Ya., who directed the flight, had the proper clearance, experience, and qualifications; and there was no assessment of the quality of the first pilot\u2019s piloting technique during the training flight in Ozerne on 24\u00a0July 2002. In practice, the pilots\u2019 training was coordinated and supervised only by Colonel O.D., stationed at the Ozerne aerodrome, who had neither the authority nor the qualifications to assess their preparedness. The experts also noted that, regard being had to the army hierarchy, it was for the Air Force Commander-in-Chief to issue an appropriate formal order clearly designating the officers responsible for the mission and determining their personal responsibilities, as well as to bear responsibility for their proper training, since the programme envisaged the involvement of crew members and the use of equipment from various military units.",

It found that the provisions of Article 416 of the CCU did not apply to O.V. and V.A., as they had not operated the flight and had not been directly involved in its preparation. Other charges were dismissed as unsubstantiated. In particular, all the defendants were found to have carried out their service duties properly. The court noted that they had taken numerous measures to ensure proper organisation of the show and had produced a large volume of documents correctly delegating tasks to different officers. They had also reasonably trusted the pilots, the supporting crew and other officers to carry out the tasks assigned to them. No legal act could be interpreted as conferring on the defendants a different range of duties or imposing an obligation to act in a different manner. The relevant allegations of the prosecution, as well as the conclusions of the Special Commission and the expert findings dated 11 June 2003 in respect of the defendants were incorrect, being based partly on an overly broad interpretation of the applicable legal provisions and partly on references to provisions that were wrongly applied in the context.

In its appeal, the prosecution asserted, in particular, that the preparation for the show was based exclusively on the military training documents, which took no account of the specifics of an aerobatic performance involving civilian spectators. Lacking a body of relevant legislation and regulations, the Air Force Command had been obliged to develop specific documents adapting the military training rules for this purpose before planning the show. As an aerobatics performance could not be equated to an ordinary military training flight, a special training programme had to be set up, and the crew had to have special clearance. However, the reports by the Special Commission, the Ministry of Defence and the aviation experts indicated that not only did the defendants fail to act in developing relevant rules and regulations, but they also failed to supervise compliance with the existing general rules. The court\u2019s findings were at odds with the findings by these authorities, and no justification was provided for them. Moreover, they were inconsistent with the court\u2019s own position adopted in the judgment of 23 June 2005, where it heavily relied on the conclusions of the Special Commission and the aviation expert assessment in examining various aspects of the case and had referred to the relevant findings concerning poor organisation of the show in its reasoning.",

It next notes that there was an important unexplained delay in the payment of compensation due to the first applicant by the judgment of 23 June 2005 (see paragraphs 63-64 above). However, given that the larger amount of the payments due to the applicants\u2019 household and other State assistance was made available promptly, and that eventually the judgment award due to the first applicant was likewise paid in full, the Court considers that the aforementioned delay, which may be pertinent in examining complaints under other Convention provisions, such as, for instance, Article 6, cannot of and by itself constitute a basis for dismissing the Government\u2019s objection as to the first applicant\u2019s present victim status under Article 2 (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedina v.

In order to be \u201ceffective,\u201d an investigation must firstly be adequate (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 324, ECHR 2007II). That is, it must be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts and, where appropriate, the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Mustafa and\u00a0Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 172-174).",

Turkey, no. 21899/02, \u00a7 58, 17 June 2008, and Mosendz, cited above, \u00a7 94). It cannot be inferred that Article 2 may entail the right to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7 306, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). If the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article\u00a02 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. The Court has already held that in the specific sphere of medical negligence, or in respect of the possible responsibility of State officials for the deaths occurring as a result of their negligence, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors or other officers concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see Branko Toma\u0161i\u0107 and Others v. Croatia, no. 46598/06, \u00a7 64, 15 January 2009 with further references). At the same time, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-endangering offences to go unpunished (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7 95; Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 145; and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 306).",

It does not require that persons and bodies responsible for an investigation enjoy absolute independence, but rather that they are sufficiently independent of the persons and structures whose responsibility is likely to be engaged (see ibid. and Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7\u00a7 343 and 344, ECHR 2007II). The adequacy of the degree of independence is assessed in the light of all the circumstances, which are necessarily specific to each case. Where the statutory or institutional independence of the investigation is open to question, such a situation, although not decisive, will call for a stricter scrutiny on the part of the Court as to whether the investigation has been carried out in an independent manner. The correct approach in such cases consists in examining whether and to what extent the disputed circumstance has compromised the investigation\u2019s effectiveness and its ability to shed light on the circumstances of the death and to punish those responsible (see\u00a0Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0223and 224).",

According to the law applicable at the material time, they were on the staff of the Armed Forces, which was subordinate to the Ministry of Defence (see paragraphs 78, 96 and 99 (citing Section 63 of the Judicial System Act above). The Court also notes that, while most high-ranking defendants were dismissed from military service shortly after the accident, the former 14th Corps Commander (Lieutenant-General S.O.), who was demoted in his post by way of a disciplinary punishment following the air show accident, was promoted shortly afterwards and at the time of his trial occupied the very important post of Deputy Air Force Commander. It appears that at least for some period of the proceedings he was suspended from performing his duties (see paragraph 54 above), however, the duration of this suspension is not clear.",

However, the proceedings at issue in the present case cannot, in the Court\u2019s view, be approached in the same manner as the aforementioned serious intentional human rights violations, which cannot be covered by ordinary military functions. In particular, the present case concerned an accident, resulting in very serious but unintentional damage. The servicemen involved were accused of negligent performance of their duties, the scope of which was in dispute to be resolved by the courts. The criminal limb of the present proceedings was therefore very closely connected to the defendants\u2019 military service. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the referral of the criminal charges and, regard being had to the domestic legal tradition, the related civil claims to a military court for their contemporaneous examination, is not as such incompatible with the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court must look at the composition of the respective military courts and examine the statutory and practical safeguards enabling them to act independently and impartially in resolving these claims (see, mutatis mutandis, Yavuz v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a029870/96, 25 May 2000, and Tan\u0131\u015fma v. Turkey, no. 32219/05, \u00a7\u00a7 8184, 17 November 2015).",

According to the applicable law, these judges were on the staff of the Armed Forces subordinate to the Ministry of Defence. However, in examining the practicalities of their status, the Court observes that nothing in it suggests that they reported on their performance to any military official. In fact, the applicable law expressly prohibited military judges from carrying out any duties other than adjudication of cases. Eligibility criteria for a post of a military judge (apart from being a military officer) and procedures concerning their appointment, promotion, disciplining and removal were analagous to those in place for their civilian counterparts. Nothing in the relevant legal framework or the applicants\u2019 submissions indicates that either the Ministry of Defence or any career military officers were involved in these procedures.",
