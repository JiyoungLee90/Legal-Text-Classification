From 1 August 1997 to 10 April 1998 [he] served his sentence in case no. 14/95 ... This sentence cannot, by virtue of Articles 23-25 of the Criminal Code, be combined [with the other sentences] and it was served separately. From 10 April 1998 to 27 December 1998 the [applicant] served his sentence in case no. 88/96. This sentence was combined with the sentence in case no. 50/97 and therefore under Article 25 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code the [trial] court when delivering its judgment in case no. 50/97 should have deducted the whole period of the sentence [which had been] served. It should [also] have deducted the whole period of the remand in custody from 7 June 1996 to 1 August 1997 on the basis of Article 59 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. These two periods amount to two years, two months and twelve days. When the [trial] court wrote in its judgment that it was deducting the time during which [the applicant] had been detained, calculated from 7 June 1996 to 27 December 1998, it in practice wrongly included the time during which he had been serving his sentence [in case no. 14/95] \u2013 from 1 August 1997 to 10 April 1998. [Accordingly,] from the sentence of three years and two months [the trial court] deducted three years and two months, being the period between 7 June 1996 and 27 December 1998 and it [thereby] transpired that the [applicant] had no time left to serve. The [trial] court made this mistake in spite [of the fact that] the case file contained information from Plovdiv Prison [detailing] the periods served by the [applicant]. In its decision [of 26\u00a0July 1999] dismissing the request to interpret its judgment, the [trial] court stated that its intention had been to deduct the whole period from 7 June 1996 to 27\u00a0December 1998, i.e. the period during which the [applicant] was remanded in custody and not [just] a part thereof. This shows that the [trial] court was misguided [in thinking] that [the applicant was remanded in custody in case no. 50/97 throughout] this entire period. Thus, with this judgment, one year of the [applicant's] sentence was pardoned, because only two years and two months should have been deducted. In spite of this, the public prosecutor's office did not appeal against the judgment and it became final ... After [the judgment] became final, it became binding on the public prosecutor's office under Article 372 \u00a7 1 of the [CCP] which should have implemented it instead of attempting to correct the [existing] mistake by interpreting the intention of the [trial] court. In the period between 12 May 1999 and 4\u00a0February 2000, including from 12 May 1999 to 11 November 1999, the date the present action was brought, the [applicant] unlawfully served a sentence of imprisonment, which if the mistake had not been made he [would] have served lawfully.\u201d",

The Plovdiv public prosecutor's office made a justified assessment that the period stated in the judgment to be deducted, namely from 7 June 1996 to 27\u00a0December 1998, included a period of one year when the [applicant] served a sentence of 'deprivation of liberty' under the judgment in case no. 14/95 ..., which sentence was not combined with [the sentence] in case no. 50/97 ..., and therefore was to be served separately.

On this last point, the Court has previously stressed that, where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no.\u00a034578/97, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2000-IX; and Baranowski v. Poland, no.\u00a028358/95, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, ECHR 2000-III).",

However, it did not and deducted the whole period of the applicant's remand in custody in case no. 50/97 without taking into account the fact that that period coincided with the serving of the sentence in case no. 88/96, which the trial court expressly combined so that it would run concurrently, and the sentence in case no. 14/95, which it did not (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). The appropriate reaction in this situation would have been for the prosecuting authorities to appeal against the judgment. In so far as they did not do so and the judgment became final (see paragraph 11 above), it is questionable whether the prosecuting authorities, relying on their own interpretation that the remand in custody had been suspended on 1 August 1997, had the power under domestic law to order the applicant's recall to prison to serve an alleged remainder of his sentence in case no. 50/97.",

However, this confirmation by the trial court of its intention had no impact on the prosecuting authorities' position. In these circumstances, the Court considers even more doubtful the prosecuting authorities' insistence on requiring the applicant to serve an alleged remainder of his sentence in case no. 50/97 and their power under domestic law to impose, to the applicant's detriment and in spite of the quite explicit rulings by the trial court, their own interpretation on how the seemingly concurrently running periods of detention should be calculated.",
