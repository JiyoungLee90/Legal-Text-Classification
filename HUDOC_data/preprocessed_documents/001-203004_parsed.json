Those cases concerned pecuniary debts which remained unenforced due to a number of factors disclosing structural problems persisting in Ukraine (see Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 84). However, unlike those cases, the present case concerns the non-enforcement by a State body of judgments ordering it to undertake administrative registrations, that is not related to the above systemic problems and thus requires a continued examination. The Court is mindful of the fact that the enforcement of judgments which incorporate rulings of a non-pecuniary nature may sometimes take more time than is the case for the payment of money awarded under a court judgment (see, for instance, Tonyuk v. Ukraine, no. 6948/07, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 40, 1\u00a0June 2017, and the references therein).

It notes that on 20 January 2010 (see paragraph\u00a019 above) the Inventory Bureau informed the applicants that it could not enforce the judgment of 4 November 2009 and register their property rights over the flat because it had already been registered as the property of Company 3. However, in the subsequent final judgment of 16\u00a0February 2010 the Yalta Court repeatedly ordered the Inventory Bureau to register the applicants\u2019 property rights over the flat. It stated that Company 3 was registered as the owner of the building but not of the flat, which was a separate object of immovable property and belonged to the applicants (see\u00a0paragraph 21 above). Lastly, the case file does not contain any document from the Inventory Bureau informing the applicants that it had been unable to enforce the judgments at issue owing to the alleged breach of Company 4\u2019s rights. Nor does it contain any valid court decision confirming Company 4\u2019s title to the flat. On the contrary, on 25 April 2012 the Supreme Court confirmed the lower courts\u2019 findings that the applicants \u2013 and not Company 4 \u2013 owned their flat (see paragraph 33 above). The Court thus fails to see how the enforcement of the judgments of 4 November 2009 and 16 February 2010 would have breached the rights of Company 4.",
