As to the content of the classes at secondary level, the Department stated that, while respecting the same principles, the syllabus took a supradenominational approach (mezhepler \u00fcst\u00fc) and that the religious culture and ethics textbooks also presented other understandings of Islam. It added that the syllabus for the 2005/06 school year had been drawn up on the basis of this supra-denominational approach, which according to the Department was centred on the Koran, did not favour any particular branch of Islam and respected the principle of secularism. The Department also mentioned that the syllabus for Year 9 (the first year of upper secondary school) featured public figures who had been important in shaping the Turkish understanding of Islam, while the syllabus for Year 11 explained the different interpretations of Islam, and the Year 12 syllabus contained a wealth of information on Alevi-Bektashi (bekta\u015fi) culture. In the same letter, the Department further specified that teacher training had been introduced ahead of the entry into effect of the new syllabus. Lastly, it observed that topics relating to the Alevi faith had been included in the religious culture and ethics syllabus for secondary schools for the 2005/06 school year.",

They submitted that the teaching that was provided focused on the Sunni interpretation of Islam and that the Alevi faith was presented in summary fashion. Providing examples, they argued that much of the information presented contained errors. In particular, they claimed that the symbols linked to their faith had been ignored and that the mosque was presented as the Muslim place of worship. They asserted that certain Sunni Muslim rituals, namely the prayers or Salat (namaz) and ablutions (abdest) were imposed and were presented according to the Sunni interpretation of Islam. They also complained that the experts had denied that the cemevi was the Alevis\u2019 place of worship. They criticised the Year 5 textbook, in which the main rituals of Islam were reportedly listed as Salat, fasting, pilgrimage and charity, arguing that the information provided was confined to the Sunni interpretation of Islam, whereas, in their view, a theological debate was under way as to how Salat should be performed. Lastly, they alleged that the textbooks in question treated the Alevi faith as a tradition or culture rather than as a fully-fledged faith.",

It is clear from recent developments that the argument that the course content is \u2018supra-denominational\u2019 is false. In that connection, why is it that the textbooks which in 2005 were supposedly \u2018supra-denominational\u2019 were amended in 2008 and 2011, with passages on the Alevis being added following the meetings? One particular \u2013 and admittedly perfectly respectable \u2013 school of religious thought predominates in this course, and the Alevi faith is not adequately represented.

The applicants also rejected the argument that the syllabus for religious culture and ethics had been drawn up using a supradenominational approach, taking the view that the syllabus was based wholly on a particular religious perspective and publicly endorsed the beliefs and traditions of the Sunni understanding of Islam. The Alevi faith, of which they were followers, was dealt with in a sub-category rather than as one of the main branches of Islam, an approach which undervalued it. Their faith was a fully-fledged branch of Islam, from both a faith-based and a theological perspective, in view of the fact that it had its own rites \u2013 for instance, the cem, the semah and the Muharram fast \u2013 and its own place of worship, the cemevi.

However, the changes did not entail a real overhaul of the key components of the syllabus, which focuses primarily on knowledge of Islam as practised and interpreted by the majority of the population in Turkey. In that connection the Court notes that, although the applicants conceded that the textbooks in question henceforth contained information concerning their faith, they nevertheless maintained that it was presented, in both the old and the new syllabus, from a \u201cSunni\u201d perspective, as a cultural and traditional concept rather than a branch of Islam in its own right. Furthermore, in the context of these lessons Alevi pupils received instruction on the main faiths solely from the standpoint of the Sunni interpretation of Islam. In addition, the fact that the surahs of the Koran and the practice of prayer (Salat) were regarded as elements to be acquired meant that children were liable to face a conflict of allegiances with the beliefs handed down by their parents. The principal Alevi rites (notably the cem and the semah) were presented as cultural activities or folk rituals rather than as religious rites, and the cemevi was not recognised as a place of worship in keeping with its status in the Alevi faith. Referring to the study carried out by A.\u00a0Yaman, a member of the commission tasked with revising the content of the syllabus for this subject (see paragraph 22 above), the applicants contended that the changes made to the textbooks clearly fell short of the proposals made by that commission.",

The applicants, for their part, rejected that argument, maintaining that the Sunni approach predominated in the classes in question and that there were significant disparities between Sunni Islam and their faith, which had many features particular to it. In their view, it was because of the predominance of this approach that their children were caught in a stranglehold between the information provided at school and that handed down by their families.",

In the context of such issues the Court reiterates its case-law to the effect that, in exercising its regulatory power in this sphere and in its relations with the various religions, denominations and beliefs, the State, as the ultimate guarantor of pluralism in a democratic society, including religious pluralism, has a duty to remain neutral and impartial (see\u00a0Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a030985/96, \u00a7 78, ECHR\u00a02000XI). It reaffirms that the role of the authorities is not to adopt measures favouring one interpretation of religion over another or aimed at forcing a divided community, or part of it, to come together under a single leadership against its own wishes (see Sinan I\u015f\u0131k v. Turkey, no.\u00a021924/05, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 2010, and Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, \u00a7 53, ECHR\u00a01999\u2011IX). The State\u2019s duty of neutrality and impartiality excludes any discretion on its part to determine whether religious beliefs or the means used to express such beliefs are legitimate, and requires the State to ensure that conflicting groups tolerate each other, even where they originated in the same group (see, mutatis mutandis, Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26\u00a0September 1996, \u00a7 47, Reports 1996IV). Religious and philosophical beliefs concern individuals\u2019 attitudes towards religion (see Sinan I\u015f\u0131k, cited above, \u00a7 49), an area in which even subjective perceptions may be important in view of the fact that religions form a very broad dogmatic and moral entity which has or may have answers to every question of a philosophical, cosmological or moral nature (see, mutatis mutandis, Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053).",

Admittedly, the fact that the syllabus gives greater prominence to Islam as practised and interpreted by the majority of the Turkish population than to the various minority interpretations of Islam and of other religions and philosophies cannot in itself be viewed as a departure from the principles of pluralism and objectivity amounting to indoctrination (see, mutatis mutandis, Folger\u00f8 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089).

As the Government pointed out, even persons who follow the same religion may have differing views as regards interpretation and practice. Admittedly, parents may always enlighten and advise their children, exercise with regard to their children natural parental functions as educators, or guide their children on a path in line with the parents\u2019 own religious or philosophical convictions (see Valsamis, cited above, \u00a7 31 in fine). Nevertheless, in the Court\u2019s view, the disparity complained of by the applicants between, on the one hand, the approach taken by the syllabus and, on the other hand, the particular features of their faith when compared with the Sunni understanding of Islam is such that it could not easily be bridged to an adequate extent solely by means of the information concerning Alevi beliefs and practice inserted in the textbooks. As to the Government\u2019s argument that more detailed information could be imparted to pupils in the context of the optional religion classes, the Court considers that this possibility does not exempt the State from its obligation to ensure that the teaching of such compulsory subjects satisfies the criteria of objectivity and pluralism while respecting religious or philosophical beliefs.",

As it stated in its judgment in Hasan and Eylem Zengin (cited above, \u00a7\u00a074), this necessarily suggests that the teaching given in this subject is likely to lead these categories of pupils to face conflicts between the religious instruction provided by the school and their parents\u2019 religious or philosophical convictions. In that judgment the Court, like ECRI, considered that this situation was open to criticism, in that \u201cif this [was] indeed a course on the different religious cultures, there [was] no reason to make it compulsory for Muslim children alone. Conversely, if the course [was] essentially designed to teach the Muslim religion, it [was] a course on a specific religion and should not be compulsory, in order to preserve children\u2019s and their parents\u2019 religious freedoms\u201d (see Hasan and Eylem Zengin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074; see also, at paragraph 33 above, the relevant parts of ECRI\u2019s report). These considerations apply mutatis mutandis to the present case. Moreover, the Court observes that in the aforementioned case it stressed, with regard to religious education in Europe, that in spite of the variety of teaching methods, almost all of the member States offered at least one route by which pupils could opt out of religious education classes (by providing an exemption mechanism or the option of attending a lesson in a substitute subject, or by giving pupils the choice of whether or not to sign up to a religious studies class) (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 71). However, the Court notes that the Turkish education system offers very limited scope for exemption. The Court also found that the procedure for exemption was likely to subject pupils\u2019 parents to a heavy burden and to the necessity of disclosing their religious or philosophical convictions in order to have their children exempted from the lessons in religion (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 75-76).",

This finding in itself implies that the violation of the applicants\u2019 rights as guaranteed by the second sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 stems, as in the case of Hasan and Eylem Zengin (\u00a7 84), from a structural problem. Accordingly, the Court stresses the need to make the necessary means available without delay, in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraphs 76 and 77 above and without pupils\u2019 parents being obliged to disclose their religious or philosophical convictions in order to make use of them (see Folger\u00f8, cited above, \u00a7 98, and Hasan and Eylem Zengin, cited above, \u00a7 75).",

We respectfully disagree. These alleged violations fell to be examined on their own merits. The judgments in Folger\u00f8 and Others v. Norway ([GC], no. 15472/02, ECHR\u00a02007III) and Hasan and Eylem Zengin v. Turkey (no. 1448/04 9\u00a0October 2007, in which, by the way, a violation of Article 14 was not even alleged by the applicants), to which a brief reference is made in paragraph 80 of the judgment, are not decisions of principle but of circumstantial practicality and do not have the force of a precedent for omitting to examine the claims in the present case. Earlier judgments can serve as binding precedents for future cases only where the issues raised by the applicants were examined and determined, and not where the Court refused to examine them.",

The much broader problem of alleged Alevi discrimination in the Turkish education system which the Court was called upon to examine, and should have examined, in the present case is of essentially the same nature as the one which the Court was asked to examine but declined to deal with in Hasan and Eylem Zengin, cited above. The very fact that this issue persists testifies to the need to examine it and not to turn a blind eye to the alleged violations of Articles 9 and 14 of the Convention. The situation requires examination under these Articles because the applicants have made a wellsubstantiated claim that the Turkish education system treats Alevism merely as a culture and that their religion is therefore relegated to an inferior status in relation to the majority faith in the religious education syllabus. The Alevi faith has not been designated as a distinct religion with the associated right, granted to Christian and Jewish pupils, to opt out of compulsory religious education. Neither is the Alevi faith treated with a respect equal to that enjoyed by other branches of Islam. The majority\u2019s analysis under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not address this underlying religious discrimination issue, but only considers the content of the current religious education syllabus.",
