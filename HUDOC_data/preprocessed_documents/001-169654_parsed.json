The Agency stated that it suspected that significant amounts of money had been withheld from Swedish taxation through irregular transactions between SNS and a Swiss company. According to the Agency, the latter company had been established solely in order to evade taxes on some of the business profits in the above-mentioned Swedish companies. While it was considered highly likely that the persons owning or having a decisive influence in the Swedish companies, including a Mr\u00a0\u00a0Toivo Jurik, were also running the Swiss company, it had proved impossible to obtain information on ownership and control of the latter company from the persons involved, who claimed that they had no knowledge of these matters. After Mr Jurik had been shown an extract of the Swiss company register, where he was listed as an executive, he had admitted that he and another person involved in the Swedish companies had been present at the establishment of the Swiss company but that he was listed as an executive only for formal reasons. The other person mentioned had since stated that he would not assist the Tax Agency any further in the audit. The Agency therefore considered that it could not continue to investigate the ownership issue and the accuracy of certain business costs unless it obtained access to documents that showed the Swiss company\u2019s relationship to the Swedish companies and their owners and leaders as well as the Swiss company\u2019s role in the business activities.

In these circumstances, the appellate court concluded that the applicant was not affected by the appealed judgment in such a way that it was entitled to appeal against it.

Draupner requested that the decision be quashed, referring, inter alia, to attorney-client privilege pertaining to its representatives. By a judgment of 26\u00a0March 2008 the interim decision was confirmed by the court, which found that the seizure of the documents at issue had been justified.

In regard to Mr Jurik, it was noted that he had not been a party to the case at the lower court.",

The court noted that the company register listed Mr Jurik as a board member and signatory of Draupner. Furthermore, the available evidence in the case showed that he was the representative of the company and that the flat where the search and seizure had taken place constituted the company\u2019s business premises.

The court found that, due to the extremely extensive data material \u2013 more than 300,000 files and entries \u2013, it was impossible to examine each and every data file, and the Tax Agency was therefore instructed to list the documents and files it considered as part of its examination after which Draupner would have an opportunity to lodge a new request for exemption. The appellate court agreed with the County Administrative Court\u2019s assessments that the material, including the hard disk drive and the USB memory stick, had been seized on Draupner\u2019s business premises, that there was, accordingly, a presumption that it was included in the audit and eligible for the Tax Agency\u2019s examination and that the burden of proof for exemptions rested with the company, even though a modest level of evidence was sufficient. With regard to Draupner\u2019s assertion that certain documents came under attorney-client privilege, the court noted that the Tax Agency had not ordered a law firm to provide information in the case and that the documents had not been seized at a law firm.

The Supreme Court stated that, if a lawyer claimed that there were impediments to seizing documents, a modest level of evidence should be considered sufficient in order to avoid undermining legal professional privilege too much. In the case at hand, the court found that it could be assumed that all the documents in question contained information that had been confided to the lawyer in his professional capacity or that he had learned of in that capacity. Consequently, as the documents were protected under Chapter 27, section\u00a02, their seizure lacked a legal basis.",

The case concerned the excessive length of criminal proceedings and the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff\u2019s right under Article 6 of the Convention to have the criminal charges against him determined within a reasonable time had been violated. Based on this finding and with reference, inter alia, to Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law under these provisions, in particular the case of Kud\u0142a v. Poland ([GC], no. 30210/96, ECHR 2000-XI), the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under Swedish law for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. With respect to the level of compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the Supreme Court took note of the criteria established in the Court\u2019s case-law stating that the Court\u2019s practice constituted a natural point of departure in this regard.",

In 2011, the Office estimated that it had dealt with roughly 1000 cases over the previous three years. During this time the Chancellor of Justice had also represented the Swedish State in a number of cases before the civil courts concerning alleged violations of the Convention. A majority of the cases that the Office had dealt with had concerned non-pecuniary damages for excessive length of proceedings under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Since November 2009, it had received more than 400 such complaints, and in more than half of them the Chancellor had found a violation and granted compensation. Furthermore, the Chancellor had dealt with a substantial number of cases (around 160) concerning the registration of individuals in the Security Police register. These cases had concerned one or more of Articles 8, 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention. Since 2011 there have been many other compensation cases determined by the Chancellor of Justice relating to alleged violations of Articles 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 of the Convention as well as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, among others.",

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. Thus, the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made \u2013 at least in substance \u2013 to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V, with further references, and Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

Reference has been made to the case-law established by the Supreme Court and the Chancellor of Justice in recent years and their continued development of precedents in this domain. In particular, the Supreme Court judgment of 3\u00a0December 2009 (see paragraph 60 above) affirmed that it is a general principle of law that compensation for Convention violations can be ordered without direct support in Swedish law, to the extent that Sweden has a duty to provide redress to victims of Convention violations through a right to compensation for damages. This judgment shifted the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law from establishing precedent in specific matters to introducing a general principle for the domestic courts and the Chancellor of Justice to follow in cases relating to all claims for compensation for alleged violations of the Convention. Consequently, the Court has found that potential applicants may, as a general rule, be expected to lodge a domestic claim for compensation for alleged breaches of the Convention before applying to the Court (see Eriksson, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52; Ruminski (dec.), no.\u00a010404/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a037 and 39, 21 May 2013; and Marinkovic (dec.), no.\u00a043570/10, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 41, 10 December 2013).",

It was described in detail in the Agency\u2019s submissions to the County Administrative Court and was based on reasonable suspicions. Furthermore, a representative of the applicant and other persons were present. In addition, Swedish law provided for the possibility of exemption of documents from a tax audit, and this issue had been examined numerous times by the courts at the request of Draupner, the audited company.

In this respect, the Court notes that the data media was not seized on the premises of the applicant law firm, but at the flat belonging to Draupner. The domestic courts \u2013 notably by judgments of the County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal of 16 October 2008 and 14 September 2010, respectively \u2013 concluded that the flat served as the business premises of Draupner. Having regard to the principle of subsidiarity \u2013 that the domestic courts are better placed to examine and interpret facts \u2013 the Court can see no reason to deviate from the findings of on this point. The courts went on to state that, as the company was the subject of a tax audit, any material linked to its business and found on its premises should be considered as belonging to it and as eligible for examination. The Court considers that this was a justifiable presumption, which was further supported by the fact that Mr Jurik, who used the flat also as a pied-\u00e0-terre, was the manager of the company. The applicant has stated that it was unable to argue its ownership of the media as it was denied legal standing in the matter. Nevertheless, as was acknowledged by the applicant, in the proceedings concerning Draupner\u2019s requests for exemption of documents, the ownership arguments were in fact put to the domestic courts, presented by Draupner\u2019s representative Mr Lindstrand, a lawyer of the applicant law firm. In this connection, it should be noted that the courts also examined whether any documents or other material was covered by attorney-client privilege.

Austria, no. 30457/06, \u00a7 44, 3 July 2012, with further references). In this context, it should be noted that, where a lawyer is involved, an encroachment on professional secrecy may have repercussions on the proper administration of justice and hence on the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention (Niemitz v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 37, and Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, \u00a7 38, 22 May 2008).",

The application mentioned the known connections of Mr Jurik to the various companies, including the involvement in the three Swedish companies subjected to the original audit and his management of the parent company Draupner, and mentioned why, in the Agency\u2019s view, there was a need to search the two premises specified. The connection between SNS and Draupner was mentioned already at this early stage of the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the judge examining the application had ample information to satisfy himself that there were reasonable grounds to conduct the search and that material of significance might be found at the applicant law firm. Neither the fact that nothing was found and seized at the law firm nor the fact that the tax audits of SNS and Draupner led to no levying of additional taxes can be taken as proof that, as has been asserted by the applicant, the Tax Agency had no \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d; rather, the reasonableness of the suspicion must be assessed in the light of the information available at the time of the court\u2019s judgment approving the search.",

Tamosius v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62002/00, ECHR 2002VIII). In the circumstances of the case, the interim decision taken by the audit manager under section 15 of the Coercive Measures Act to effectively extend the search to cover also Draupner should, in the Court\u2019s view, be seen as a continuation of the original judgment issued by the County Administrative Court and was, moreover, immediately referred to the court for confirmation.

However, this issue has been extensively examined in the domestic proceedings concerning exemption of documents, in which a lawyer of the applicant law firm specified the documents for which exemption was requested and put forward arguments to that end. While some documents were exempted because they were considered to be of a private nature, none of the material seized or copied by the Tax Agency was found to contain information subject to professional secrecy. It should be mentioned that, apparently, the challenged material was kept by the courts throughout the exemption proceedings and was thus during that time not available for examination by the Tax Agency.",

Thus, whereas the applicant was not formally a party to the proceedings relating to Draupner, the substance of its claims was examined in those proceedings and it was able to present all its arguments on the issue.

The applicant, who had not been a party to the proceedings before that court, appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal but was denied legal standing as the appellate court found that the applicant was not sufficiently affected by the appealed judgment to give it a right to appeal (see paragraph 16 above). Second, the Tax Agency, on 14 March 2008, took an interim decision to use coercive measures in regard to Draupner which, after referral, was confirmed by the County Administrative Court on 26 March 2008.

The Court disagrees with the Government\u2019s contention. As has been concluded above (see paragraph 97), the Tax Agency\u2019s interim decision must be seen as a continuation of the original judgment of the County Administrative Court of 10 March 2008, which allowed the applicant\u2019s offices to be searched and led to the enforcement during which the interim decision extended the scope of that search. The applicant did appeal against the original judgment, but the appeal was dismissed because the applicant was not considered to be sufficiently affected. Against this background, an appeal by the applicant against the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment of 26 March 2008, concerning an issue identical in substance to that examined in the original judgment, would obviously have been to no avail.",

In the Court\u2019s view, the search therefore clearly affected the applicant, which had a justified interest in obtaining a review of whether the search complied with its rights under the Convention, in particular Article 8. Due to the special nature of a search of the present kind, notably the importance of not giving forewarning to persons concerned by the measure, a review that takes place after the enforcement may still be considered effective (see Iliya Stefanov v.
