He had participated in almost all these demonstrations until the beginning of March 2011. He claimed that he and his friends had organised peaceful demonstrations every Tuesday. As the demonstrations had been brutally oppressed by the Iranian regime, he and his friends had documented the demonstrations and had circulated this documentation to people. He further claimed that during the last demonstration he had attended, at the beginning of March 2011, several of his friends had been arrested. He alleged that they had been tortured and that one of them had probably mentioned his name to the Iranian authorities and had told them about his participation in the demonstrations. Consequently, on 10\u00a0May 2011, a summons issued by the Revolutionary Court of Teheran had been delivered to his residence, namely his parents\u2019 house in Karaj, by a court courier. He had not been present at the time of delivery as he had been on a visit to his sister\u2019s house in Teheran. The summons had ordered him to appear in court on 12 May 2011. Fearing that he might be arrested upon his appearance, he had not presented himself in court but had hidden at his sister\u2019s home and at the homes of various friends in Teheran. As a result of his non-appearance before the court, agents of the secret service had come to his parents\u2019 house the following day (13 May 2011) in order to arrest him. Because of his absence, his father had been arrested instead. The applicant had been left a message that he should report to the district police, otherwise his father would remain in detention. For fear of arrest and on his family\u2019s advice, he had fled the country without legal exit papers in June 2011.",

Asked whether he knew the people who had been arrested, the applicant responded that he just knew these people from the street. They had not been people from his region. Teheran was a big city and people had come from everywhere.

The Migration Board reasoned that the applicant\u2019s statement of facts was not credible as his descriptions of the events in Iran had not been consistent during the two hearings. The descriptions diverged considerably from each other with regard to decisive points of the applicant\u2019s story. During the first hearing, the applicant had neither mentioned the appearance of the Ettelaad security forces at his parents\u2019 house, nor had he mentioned the house search, nor the fact that it had been the Ettelaad who had issued a summons directly at his parents\u2019 house on 10 May 2011, but had simply stated that a courier of the court had brought the summons. Furthermore, the accounts of the applicant\u2019s hiding prior to his escape from Iran diverged from each other, as the applicant had first stated that he had hidden at his sister\u2019s home and at friends\u2019 homes, whereas he had claimed to have stayed exclusively at his sister\u2019s home during the second hearing. Finally, the applicant had only mentioned the arrest of his friends during his last demonstration only in the account he had given during the first hearing and not during the second interview. The Migration Board took into consideration that the applicant had submitted some documentary material including the alleged summons of 10 May 2011, but was of the view that these documents could not dispel the doubts about the applicant\u2019s account. The documentary material gave only a general account of the demonstrations, but not specifically anything about the applicant\u2019s alleged participation, and a summons alone could not prove any public persecution.",

It was therefore understandable that he had not described the house search of 10 May 2011 until the second hearing. With regard to his hiding prior to his departure from Iran, his two reports were correct and consistent. He had stayed at his sister\u2019s home but he had also met friends from work and spent time with them. With regard to the events during the last demonstration, he had in essence stated the same facts during the two hearings, namely that he and his friends had documented the demonstration and had handed out leaflets, that many participants, including his friends, had been arrested, and that he believed that one of the arrested persons had passed on his name to the Iranian authorities. The applicant further argued that when assessing his two statements, it had to be taken into consideration that almost two years had elapsed between the two hearings and that no one was able to describe events in exactly the same way after such a long time. Finally, the applicant claimed that the second hearing had not been fair, as the interviewer had constantly interrupted him and treated him as if he were lying.",

An oral hearing was not provided for in the rules of procedure. In accordance with section 111a of the Asylum Act, the Federal Administrative Court also abstained from the possibility of exchanging observations between the parties. The Migration Board was hence not given an opportunity to comment on the submission of the copies of the alleged summons of 5\u00a0February 2013 and the judgment of 7 May 2013 or on the possibility of having the alleged original documents \u2013 which were allegedly in the possession of the applicant\u2019s family \u2013 checked by the Swiss embassy in Teheran.",

His accounts of the events during the two hearings diverged with regard to essential details and the applicant had not managed to explain these discrepancies to the Federal Administrative Court\u2019s satisfaction. The time that had passed between the two hearings could not explain the contradictions, since the applicant had not been expected to describe the events in Iran in exactly the same way but rather in a consistent manner. Furthermore, contrary to the applicant\u2019s allegation, there was no indication that the second hearing had been unfair. The hearing had been attended by a member of the Aid Organisation of the Protestant Church of Switzerland as a neutral witness. This person had not made any remarks about irregularities witnessed during the hearing, although he could have done so. The minutes had been translated for the applicant and signed by him.

His sister had therefore kept the documents safe and had waited for an invitation to take them to the embassy.

The Court considers that if the applicant\u2019s punishment, as he claimed, were to be enforced, such extensive flogging would cause deliberate and severe physical suffering of a severity that would have to be regarded as torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. As the applicant left Iran without an exit visa and without a passport, he is likely to be arrested upon his return to Iran, where his background would be checked and any conviction would be discovered immediately (see the summary and the assessment of the U.K. Home Office\u2019s Country of Origin Information Report on Iran from August 2009 in R.C. v.

The Court further agrees with the national authorities that the discrepancies cannot be explained by the applicant\u2019s allegation that the interviewer at his second hearing was biased. The fact that a neutral witness from a nongovernmental aid organisation was present during the hearing and that this witness had no cause to document any irregular procedural events in the minutes of the hearing are strong indicators that the interview was carried out in a fair way.",

The Court disagrees with the Swiss authorities in so far as the latter considered that these explanations were generally not sufficient to dispel the doubts about the veracity of his story. It agrees with the applicant that the difference in the nature of the two hearings cannot be disregarded when assessing the credibility of his accounts. It is clear from the interviewer\u2019s own comment in the minutes of the first hearing (\u201cFor lack of staff, the facts summarised under no. 15 of the minutes were not established in detail.\u201d) that during the first interview the applicant was questioned in only a cursory way and was expected to give only a summarised account of the events leading to his escape from Iran. The detailed enquiries about specific points concerning events in Iran during the second interview, on the other hand, show that the applicant was expected to give an in-depth account of the events. This difference may well explain some of the major discrepancies between the applicant\u2019s two accounts, which do not necessarily have to be interpreted as contradictory statements but may result from the fact that the applicant gave a compressed and abridged account of the events during the first hearing. This is especially true with regard to the applicant\u2019s omission to mention the house search of 10 May 2011 during the first hearing and the fact that he plainly stated during the first hearing that he had hidden at his sister\u2019s home and at friends\u2019 homes before his departure from Iran and explained only during the second hearing that he had indeed hidden with his sister but had also spent time with friends during that period.",

The document was therefore provided to the national authorities as early as possible. Neither the Migration Board nor the Federal Administrative Court challenged the authenticity of the summons. The Migration Board did not consider this question as it deemed the applicant\u2019s account to be inconsistent and was therefore of the view that a summons alone could not prove the applicant\u2019s persecution anyway. The Federal Administrative Court did not mention the summons of 10 May 2011 in its judgment at all. There is no indication that the Federal Administrative Court checked the authenticity of the summons or the assertion that the Swiss embassy in Teheran was contacted for help by the Federal Administrative Court. The one and only party to challenge the authenticity of the summons was the Swiss Government in their observations before this Court, in which they called into question the authenticity of the summons with the generalised allegation that documents of such kind could be purchased in Iran. The Government did not provide any reasons as to why they believed that the summons in question was falsified, however, alleging merely that the applicant\u2019s story was not credible. As noted above, the Court does not share the view that the discrepancies in the applicant\u2019s accounts were of such a serious nature that they could allow the documents submitted by the applicant to be ignored, but considers that they could to a considerable degree in fact be dispelled by the applicant\u2019s further explanations. Consequently, as there is no indication that the Government tried to verify the authenticity of the summons through specialists or with the help of the Swiss embassy in Teheran, the Government did not challenge the authenticity of the documents in a proper manner. The Court is therefore of the view that the summons of 10 May 2011 cannot reasonably be disregarded. The summons matches the applicant\u2019s account of the events of 10 May 2011 in Iran and therefore adds to the plausibility of his story.",

However, it has to be recognised that the applicant gave reasonable explanations as to why he provided only copies during the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court and why he could not provide the originals at that time. The applicant explained that he had only learnt about the existence of the second summons and of the judgment in absentia when he called his family on his lawyer\u2019s advice when preparing his application to the Federal Administrative Court. As the applicant was not represented by counsel until that stage, this explanation seems plausible. Furthermore, the applicant explained that his family was too afraid to send the originals by post. Having in mind the reports on the surveillance of houses and of correspondence by the Iranian authorities (see paragraph 36 in fine above), the applicant\u2019s assertion that his family had been too afraid to send the originals by mail is also plausible. The same holds true for the applicant\u2019s assertion that his sister did not dare to take the originals to the Swiss embassy on her own initiative without an invitation to do so, as she feared being questioned and checked out by the Iranian guards in front of the embassy if she did not have an official appointment. It must also be taken into account that under the circumstances described by the applicant, the time period between the alleged conviction (7 May 2013) and the judgment of the Federal Administrative Court (2 July 2013) was a relatively short one in which to acquire original documents from the country from which the applicant had fled. The applicant therefore gave a credible explanation as to why he had not been able to provide the Federal Administrative Court with the originals of the documents submitted.",

The Court agrees with the Government that such explanations would have been helpful and would have added to the credibility of the applicant\u2019s story. However, it must be pointed out that the applicant was not asked to provide any information about the whereabouts of the copies by the Federal Administrative Court, because that court simply maintained that, being copies, the submissions did not have any probative value.

It did not follow up the applicant\u2019s proposal to submit the copies to the Migration Board for further comments, but instead decided directly on the basis of the applicant\u2019s file and his appeal. Furthermore, the Federal Administrative Court, without giving any reasons, neither followed up the applicant\u2019s suggestion to ask the Swiss embassy in Teheran whether the alleged originals could be handed over to it by the applicant\u2019s relatives, nor did it ask the embassy for any help in assessing whether the copies could have been produced from an original summons and an authentic conviction, nor is there any indication that the Federal Administrative Court checked whether the documents showed any indication of being copies of falsified documents. Furthermore, the Government did not respond to the applicant\u2019s announcement during the exchange of observations that he was now in possession of the originals of the summons and the judgment and could submit them to the Migration Board if the Government so wished.
