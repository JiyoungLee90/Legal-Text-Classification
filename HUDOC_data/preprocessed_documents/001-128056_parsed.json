While the number of abductions and disappearances in Chechnya might have decreased in the more recent period compared to 2009, the situation remained far from normal. The issue of torture and ill-treatment of persons deprived of their liberty was the subject of a number of allegations brought to the Commissioner\u2019s attention in relation to various parts of the North Caucasus. The information indicative of ill-treatment he received was of a serious nature and required decisive action on the part of the authorities. Most of the allegations received related to treatment of persons by law-enforcement officials; however, some allegations of physical ill-treatment related to a pre-trial detention centre (SIZO). The Commissioner also received documents from lawyers of persons remanded in custody which were indicative of inaction on the part of prosecutorial authorities in the face of clear allegations and other information concerning ill-treatment.",

In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91, Series A no. 161).",

The effect of Article 13 of the Convention is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable claim\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 of the Convention varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see, among other authorities, Aksoy v.

Firstly, the Khazar District Court was only called upon to decide whether to extend the period of the applicant\u2019s detention pending extradition; it did not examine any appeals against the extradition order itself (see paragraph 31 above). For that reason, it could not grant any appropriate redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints, as it was not in a position to quash the extradition order. Secondly, in any event, according to the Government\u2019s own admission, the domestic court only undertook a limited assessment of the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment that he submitted had taken place during his temporary extradition in 2006 and 2007, and did not assess any potential risks of ill-treatment facing the applicant if he were to be extradited at the end of the currently pending extradition proceedings. Therefore, no assessment of the applicant\u2019s Article 3 complaint was in fact made by the Khazar District Court.",

Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2002II (extracts)). However, the Court notes that, despite the fact that the applicant had explicitly complained before the Sabayil District Court and the Baku Court of Appeal of the risk of torture or ill-treatment and that his allegations in this regard were arguable, the domestic courts ignored his arguments and their decisions were silent in this regard (compare Garayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 53688/08, \u00a7 84, 10 June 2010). It does not appear that the courts ever took these considerations into account when they examined the question of the applicant\u2019s extradition (see paragraphs 25-27 above), even though they were required to do so not only under the Convention, which was directly applicable in the Azerbaijani legal system, but also under the substantive provisions of the domestic law on extradition detailing the situations in which extradition should be refused (see paragraphs 35 and 38-39 above).",
