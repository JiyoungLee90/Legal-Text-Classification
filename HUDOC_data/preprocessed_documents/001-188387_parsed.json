Although not expressly mentioned, it can be seen that the main reason that prompted the authorities to engage in multiple transactions was their desire to identify the suppliers of the applicant\u2019s drugs and other members of the drug-trafficking network. Following these illicit multiple transactions the authorities managed to identify the way in which the network was organised and its main suppliers. In this connection they noted that the applicant\u2019s main supplier was C.B.S. but also that on one occasion he had bought ecstasy pills from N.F. The evidence secured during the multiple illicit transactions allowed the identification and prosecution of the members of the drugtrafficking network.
