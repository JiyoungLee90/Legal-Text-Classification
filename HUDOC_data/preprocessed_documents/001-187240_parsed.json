As the main part of the convoy was passing along the main street, two armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and four military lorries stopped next to his garden and their crew started to repair one of the APCs. Shortly thereafter something exploded next to the APC. The servicemen immediately cordoned off the area, including the applicant\u2019s house. They went to the garden fence and ordered Mr Vait Askhabov to climb over the fence and come to them. They then forced him into a military Ural lorry and did not let anyone come close to that lorry. About thirty minutes later they drove away with Mr\u00a0Vait\u00a0Askhabov. Several people, including Mr Vait Askhabov\u2019s sister (Ms\u00a0L.A.) and his neighbours (Ms Z.Kh., and Ms A.U.) witnessed the incident. The applicant submitted to the Court their written statements, which confirmed the applicant\u2019s account of the events. Mr Vait Askhabov has been missing ever since.",

Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. , \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV, and Ertak v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-V).",

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government\u2019s position in this regard, and assuming that the applicants\u2019 abducted relatives were under the control of State agents after the abductions, then the period of time which has elapsed since each person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere \u201cirregular detention\u201d in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life, as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. , \u00a7 83, ECHR 2000VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government\u2019s objection in this respect should be dismissed.",

In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigations have been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing relatives. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that each set of criminal proceedings has been plagued by a combination of the defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). Each was subjected to several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of solving the crimes.
