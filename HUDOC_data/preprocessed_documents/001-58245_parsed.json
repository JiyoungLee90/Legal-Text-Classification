It has (unsurprisingly) not been argued before the Court that the criminalisation of acts of apology for serious offences of collaboration in itself went beyond the margin of appreciation. As regards the content of the advertisement, the applicants have, in order to distance Philippe P\u00e9tain from personal responsibility for the darker side of what was done in France during the Vichy era and as part of the vindication of his actions during the period, pointed to the references in the text to \u201cNazi atrocities and persecutions\u201d and its claim that he afforded protection to the French people from \u201cGerman omnipotence and barbarism\u201d.

European supervision consists, as our Court has said repeatedly since its Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, in reviewing under Article 10 \u201cthe decisions [the national courts] delivered in the exercise of their power of appreciation\u201d (Series A no. 24, p. 23, \u00a7 50).",

In the present case, assessment of how a country\u2019s history should be presented and of the effect of a publication on the feelings of the population in an important sector of society, with a view to determining the necessity in a democratic society of imposing a restriction like the one in issue, is a matter for the judicial authorities of that country, who are \u201ccalled upon to interpret and apply the laws in force\u201d (see the Handyside judgment previously cited, p. 22, \u00a7 48).",
