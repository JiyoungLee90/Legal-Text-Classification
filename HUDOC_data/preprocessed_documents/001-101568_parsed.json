First, it considered the applicant's requests of 20 August 2007. In a separate decision on procedure it found that there were no grounds to accept the applicant's new statement of appeal and decided to examine the case on the basis of the statement by the applicant's former counsel, Ms P., from 2002. It also rejected the applicant's request to attend in person, finding that the video link would be sufficient to ensure that the applicant could follow the proceedings and make objections or other submissions, and that this form of participation would be no less effective than if he was personally present in the courtroom. The Supreme Court then introduced the applicant to Ms A., his new legal-aid counsel who was present in the Supreme Court's courtroom and then allowed them fifteen minutes of confidential communication by video link before the start of the hearing. All persons, both in the courtroom and in the detention facility, left the rooms.",

That approach was also confirmed by the Presidium of the Supreme Court in its report concerning cases adopted in the third quarter of 2005 (Decree of 23 November 2005) and by the Decree of the Plenary of the Supreme Court of 23 December 2008, as amended on 30 June 2009. In the later document the Supreme Court emphasised that the accused could waive his right to a lawyer only in writing, and that the court was not bound by that waiver.",

That approach is based to a large extent on the procedural particularity of the supervisory review in Russian criminal procedure, which does not establish any time-limits for bringing such an action. In Berdzenishvili the Court noted that, under the Code of Criminal Procedure supervisory-review appeals could be lodged at any time after a judgment became enforceable, even years later.

Indeed, the assessment of the victim status largely depends on the legal characterisation of the second set of the proceedings as a separate case or, alternatively, as part of the same criminal case. This appears to be the principal subject of controversy. The Court thus prefers to join the Government's objection concerning victim status to the merits of the case and examine them together.",

It had been acknowledged by the Government and affirmed by the Chamber that the first set of proceedings that ended on 31 October 2002 fell short of the guarantees relating to legal assistance (\u00a7 47 of the judgment). Further, as regards the appeal hearing of 29\u00a0November 2007, the Chamber found that \u201cthe lack of personal contact with the applicant at the hearing and the absence of any discussion with him in advance of the hearing, combined with the fact that she had to plead the case on the basis of the points of appeal lodged five years earlier by another lawyer, reduced Ms A.'s appearance at the appeal hearing to a mere formality\u201d (\u00a7 50). The applicant's dissatisfaction with the manner in which his legal assistance had been organised was made sufficiently clear to the Supreme Court, and was reasonable and justified in the circumstances. The Chamber found that the applicant could still claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, since \u201cthe Supreme Court [had] failed to ensure the applicant's effective legal representation in the appeal hearing that took place on 29 November 2007, as it had in the earlier proceedings\u201d (\u00a7 52). In the operative part of the judgment the Chamber held that \u201cthere [had] been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention in that the applicant [had] not receive[d] effective legal assistance during the appeal proceedings\u201d.",

The Court's ex post facto examination of the situation had to focus on the practical results of the remedy's actual application. Thus, for example, where the claimed remedy for the excessive length of judicial proceedings was a subsequent action for compensation, the Court had to determine not only the availability of such an action under the domestic law, but also the timeliness of the adjudication of that action because \u201cexcessive delays in an action for compensation [would] render the remedy inadequate\u201d (see Cocchiarella v.

Given that the reason the case had been sent back to the Supreme Court for a rehearing had been its violation of the applicant's right to legal representation at the initial hearing, and in view of the seriousness of the charges to be considered at the rehearing (double murder), this had surely been a case where the Supreme Court should have used its best endeavours to ensure that the applicant had effective representation.",

In the first place, there were no limits as to the number of times and the circumstances in which the case could be reopened. Second, reopening depended on the discretion of the State prosecutor or judge who decided whether a supervisory-review complaint or application deserved to be examined on the merits. Whether it was a prosecutor lodging an application for reopening or the president of the court reversing a decision of a judge not to entertain a supervisory-review complaint, the decision might be taken proprio motu.

In any event, by accepting the Government's request for referral to the Grand Chamber, the Court gave the Government an additional opportunity to present their views on the matter. In that connection, the Grand Chamber reiterates that even after a Chamber has decided to declare a complaint admissible it may, where appropriate, examine issues relating to its admissibility, for example by virtue of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 4 in fine of the Convention, which empowers the Court to \u201creject any application which it considers inadmissible ... at any stage of the proceedings\u201d, and in cases where such issues have been joined to the merits or where they are otherwise relevant at the merits stage (see K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a025702/94, \u00a7\u00a7 140-141, ECHR 2001-VII, and Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02324, ECHR 2003-V). Having regard to the  proceedings as a whole, the Court does not consider that the Government have been placed at any disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the applicant. Finally, the Court has an interest in ensuring that the proceedings are not unnecessarily protracted.",
