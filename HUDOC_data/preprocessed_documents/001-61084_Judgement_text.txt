The case originated in an application (no. 39619/98) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Polish nationals, Mr Andrzej Piłka and Mrs Barbara Piłka (“the applicants”), on 15 August 1997.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicants alleged that their right to a “hearing within a reasonable time” had not been respected.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of the Court.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 11 June 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicants were born in 1943 and 1942 respectively and live in Józefów, Poland.
The applicants share a house and a plot of land with another family (“the neighbours”). On 2 January 1989 the applicants filed with the Otwock District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a petition in which they requested that the co-ownership of the plot of land and the building be dissolved in accordance with an administrative decision issued in 1983.
From 2 January 1989 to 1 May 1993 the court held hearings on the following dates: 23 March, 21 August and 4 December 1989, 15 January, 9 April, 14 May, 21 June, 6 September, and 15 October 1990.
On 16 May 1991 the court held a hearing and ordered not to carry out any construction works in the building except for the erection of a wall in the attic. Subsequently, the court held hearings on 16 September 1991 and 16 January 1992.
On 30 January 1992 the court stayed the proceedings until the termination of the administrative proceedings concerning the annulment of the 1983 decision.
The court held hearings on 11 June and 16 July 1992.
On 20 July 1992 the court dissolved the co-ownership of the property. The neighbours appealed.
On 30 October 1992 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed the decision of 20 July 1992 and remitted the case for re-examination.
On 6 August and 2 September 1993 the experts’ reports were submitted to the court. The neighbours challenged the report of 6 August 1993.
Subsequently, the court held hearings on the following dates: 11 May, 6 June and 25 August 1994.
On 25 August 1994 the Otwock District Court quashed in part its decision of 16 May 1991 and allowed the applicants to carry out certain works in the building. The neighbours appealed against this decision.
A hearing listed for 20 October 1994 was adjourned as the neighbours’ lawyer was not present.
On 5 December 1994 a supplementary expert report was submitted to the court. Subsequently, on 21 December 1994 the court held a hearing.
On 4 August 1995, in the course of the administrative proceedings, the Mayor of Józefów (Burmistrz) issued a decision allowing the construction of a wall dividing the building co-owned by the applicants. On 22 January 1996 the Warsaw Governor (Wojewoda) allowed the applicants’ appeal and quashed the decision of the Mayor of Józefów.
In the meantime, on 4 January 1996, the court had held a hearing.
On 24 January 1996 the neighbours’ lawyer requested the court to stay the proceedings until the termination of the administrative proceedings. On 30 January 1996 the court stayed the proceedings.
On 14 February 1996 the neighbours lodged an appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny) against the decision of the Warsaw Governor.
On 15 February 1996 the Otwock District Court resumed the proceedings. On 26 February 1996 the neighbours again requested the court to stay the proceedings. On 15 May 1996 the court held a hearing and stayed the proceedings. On 11 July 1996 the court resumed them.
Further hearings were held on 18 October, 23 December 1996 and 27 January 1997.
On 27 January 1997 the court issued a preliminary decision (postanowienie wstępne) by which it dissolved the co-ownership of the property and divided it into two separate estates. On 30 January 1997 the applicants’ neighbours appealed.
On 6 February 1997 the court stayed the proceedings as one of the neighbours had died. They were resumed on 18 February 1997.
On 29 April 1997 the Warsaw Regional Court held a hearing and quashed the decision of 27 January 1997.
At the hearing held on 26 September 1997 before the Otwock District Court the applicants presented their proposal for the division of the building. On 17 October 1997 the neighbours rejected the proposal.
On 27 November 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decision issued by the Warsaw Governor on 22 January 1996.
The Otwock District Court held further hearings on 3 February and 24 March 1998.
On 30 March 1998 the court ordered that a valuation of the property be carried out by an expert.
On 12 February 1999 the court held a hearing.
On 12 April 1999 the court requested the Józefów Town Office (Urząd Miejski) to submit an opinion on a plan for the division of the property. On 20 July 1999 the Józefów Town Office submitted its opinion indicating that the division would not be in accordance with a town planning scheme (plan zagospodarowania przestrzennego).
On 8 March 2000 there was a fire, which substantially destroyed the part of the building belonging to the applicants’ neighbours. On 26 April 2000 the applicants submitted to the court a proposal for the division of the building, taking into account the new circumstances of the case.
On 27 June 2000 the District Construction Inspector (Powiatowy Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego) ordered the demolition of the part of the building occupied by the applicants’ neighbours and certain adjustments of the applicants’ part.
The next hearing was held on 12 February 2001. The court decided to obtain a fresh expert report in order to determine the division of the property.
Subsequently, the court held hearings on the following dates: 4 June, 20 August and 24 September 2002.
It appears that the proceedings are pending in the Otwock District Court.
