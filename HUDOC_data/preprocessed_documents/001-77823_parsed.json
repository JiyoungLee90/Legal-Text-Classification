As regards the applicant\u2019s behaviour, they maintained that he had failed to take any action to speed up the proceedings and had even contributed to their length by withdrawing the objection to the employer\u2019s request for the reinstatement of the proceedings of June 1996; by providing the court with the wrong address for the witness proposed by him; by not paying the court fees, as a formal precondition to proceed with a case; by requesting the court to enforce the judgment in full, although he had already been reinstated to work. They also argued that the employer had contributed to the length of the proceedings by availing itself of three extraordinary remedies available under domestic law. Concerning the conduct of the authorities, the Government submitted that the courts had proceeded with the case with due diligence, despite the several changes of the composition of the judicial council (\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442); that the scheduled hearings had been held without any interruption and delays. They noted that the time lapsed before the trial court for drafting and service of its 1998 decision had been due to the applicant\u2019s failure to pay the court fees. Concerning the three-year period within which the Supreme Court decided the applicant\u2019s case, they noted its extensive scope of jurisdiction and its excessive workload due to the low statutory threshold for lodging an appeal on points of law that existed before the new legislative amendments entered into force. They also submitted that the national courts had enforced the \u2019s decision while the case had been pending before the Supreme Court.",

The same applies to the withdrawal of his objection to the employer\u2019s request for reinstatement of the proceedings and his obligation to pay the court fees, which he complied with within the time-limit given by the court.

It notes that nearly three years passed after the employer had lodged the appeal on points of law.
