While exercising her parental authority the mother consciously and purposefully acts in total disregard of the recommendations of the experts and her lawful duties; she completely prevented communication between the father and [the child], at first without any reason. Subsequently, under an invented pretext, in April 2008 she took [the child], without the permission of the father, the court or [the custody and guardianship authority] abroad to the Russian Federation, where she has kept [the child] until now. At the same time the mother has not complied with the decision of the court pursuant to which she should have handed [the child] over to the father, to render to the father [the child\u2019s] travelling passport and not to remain [with the child] outside the territory of the Czech Republic. [It was established that the decision in question] was served on [the mother] first of all through her representative in the Czech Republic, and thereafter to her personally in the course of the proceedings at the courts in St Petersburg and Moscow. Furthermore, the mother refuses to send an invitation for visiting Russia to the father, [who] has to go through demanding procedures to obtain Russian entry visas, and when the father succeeds in obtaining a visa and goes to Russia the mother often hides [the child] and refuses to communicate with the father[.] [S]he does not even allow the father to talk to [the child] on the telephone, and even if she lets them talk she purposefully manipulates the father\u2019s and [the child\u2019s] mindset according to the situation. Therefore, the court believes that the mother has, in disregard of the law of the Czech Republic, willfully interfered with [the child\u2019s family life], her right to know her father and her right to be in her father\u2019s custody. She has interfered with [the child\u2019s] right to freedom of movement and to choose her place of residence, and her right to free entry to her homeland, the Czech Republic. Thereby the mother has breached the rights guaranteed by the State in the framework of Conventions on Human Rights, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The mother, unbeknownst to the father, the court or [the custody and guardianship authority] and without their consent in contravention of the legal order of the Czech Republic, applied to Russian administrative authorities to grant [the child], a national of the Czech Republic, Russian citizenship, on the basis of which in a record-breaking short term of five days the latter was granted Russian citizenship.",

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for family life even in the sphere of relations between individuals, including both the provision of a regulatory framework of adjudicatory and enforcement machinery protecting individuals\u2019 rights and the taking, where appropriate, of specific steps. The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision do not always lend themselves to precise definition; nonetheless, the applicable principles are similar. In both contexts, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, including other concerned third parties, and in both cases the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see Kosmopoulou v. Greece, no.\u00a060457/00, \u00a7\u00a043, 5 February 2004).",

This applies not only to cases dealing with the compulsory taking of children into public care and the implementation of care measures, but also to cases where contact and residence disputes concerning children arise between parents and/or other members of the children\u2019s family (see Hokkanen v.

This Convention sets criteria for defining whether the removal of a child to another country by one parent was \u201cwrongful\u201d and whether it required appropriate measures to be taken by the authorities of the State where the child was retained. In particular, in cases of international child abduction the Court has presumed, save for certain exceptions, that the best interests of the child are better served by the restoration of the status quo by means of a decision ordering the child\u2019s immediate return to his or her country of habitual residence in the event of abduction (see X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096-97 and 106-107).",

That rule is supported by serious considerations of public order: the \u201cabductor\u201d parent should not be permitted to benefit from his or her own wrong, should not be able to legalise a factual situation brought about by the wrongful removal of the child, and should not be permitted to choose a new forum for a dispute which has already been resolved in another country. Such presumption in favour of return is supposed to discourage this type of behaviour and to promote \u201cthe general interest in ensuring respect for the rule of law\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Nuutinen v. Finland, no. 32842/96, \u00a7 129, ECHR\u00a02000VIII; see also M.R. and L.R. v. Estonia (dec.), no. 13420/12, \u00a7\u00a043, 15\u00a0May 2012). It is also recalled that a child\u2019s return cannot be ordered automatically or mechanically when the Hague Convention is applicable. The child\u2019s best interests, from a personal development perspective, will depend on a variety of individual circumstances, in particular his age and level of maturity, the presence or absence of his parents and his environment and his experiences. For that reason, those best interests must be assessed in each individual case (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.\u00a0Switzerland [GC], no.\u00a041615/07, \u00a7\u00a0138, ECHR 2010).",

Furthermore, until the termination of the child custody proceedings before the Czech court the first applicant was deprived of the possibility to have the arrangements for contact with his daughter formally determined by the Russian court (see paragraphs 29-32 above). It appears, therefore, that, in the absence of an agreement between the parents, the regulatory legal framework which existed in Russia at the material time did not provide for a practical and effective protection of the interests of the father (the first applicant) in maintaining and developing family life with his child, which in the present case has had irremediable consequences for relations between them. The Court considers therefore that in failing to set up the necessary legal framework that would secure prompt response to international child abduction at the time when the events in question took place the Russian Federation failed to comply with its positive obligation under Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that that judgment, which was unfavourable to O.H., was taken in the absence of O.H., whom neither the Czech nor the Russian authorities have been able to apprise of the hearing in the absence of information about her whereabouts.

The Court will therefore proceed to determine whether the refusal to recognise and enforce the judgment of Prague 4 District Court of 2\u00a0June 2011 granting the first applicant custody of the second applicant struck a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the first applicant. In carrying out this balancing exercise, the Court will attach particular importance to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent. In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see Sommerfeld v.

Since her departure from the Czech Republic the child had very limited contact with her father, the first applicant, until the final rupture of emotional ties between the applicants in May 2011 when they lost all contact. Regard being had to the foregoing, the Court considers that since 2008 the child has settled in her new environment in Russia, and that her return to her father\u2019s care would have run contrary to her best interests (see Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0138).
