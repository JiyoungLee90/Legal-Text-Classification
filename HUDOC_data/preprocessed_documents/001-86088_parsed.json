By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1, namely a fair hearing, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Pretto and Others v.
