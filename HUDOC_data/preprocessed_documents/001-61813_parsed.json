The purpose of that provision must be borne in mind, namely to permit national authorities to take measures with respect to persons who were under the influence of alcohol or other inebriating substances, or persons whose mental condition was otherwise such as to present a danger to themselves or their environment. In that connection the Government prayed in aid the Court's judgment in Witold Litwa v. Poland case (cited above) and decision in Dieudonn\u00e9 Duriez-Costes v. France (no.\u00a050638/99, dec. 24.10.2000).

However, it is not necessary to establish whether this was the case. The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Convention when read in the light of its object and purpose cannot be interpreted as only allowing the detention of \u201calcoholics\u201d in the limited sense of persons in a clinical state of \u201calcoholism\u201d. Under this provision, persons who are not medically diagnosed as \u201calcoholics\u201d, but whose conduct and behaviour under the influence of alcohol pose a threat to public order or themselves, can be taken into custody for the protection of the public or their own interests, such as their health or personal safety. It does not, however, permit the detention of an individual merely because of his alcohol intake (see, in particular, the above-cited Witold Litwa v. Poland judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 60 to 63).",

In other words, the matter was covered by the notion of \u201calcoholic\u201d in sub-paragraph (e), which is therefore applicable.",

It further considered that the police had sufficient reasons for detaining the applicant for a short period and had no other means at their disposal. Thus the Supreme Court appears to have reached the view that the impugned arrest and detention of the applicant on six occasions between 31\u00a0January 1988 and 24 June 1991 had a legal basis and were justified. The Court, bearing in mind the primary role played by national authorities, notably the courts, in interpreting and applying national law, has considered the matter itself and sees no reason for arriving at a contrary conclusion. Although the Supreme Court's reasoning made no express reference to some of the legal sources relied on by the Government, notably Article\u00a061 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the general customary powers of the police and various police instructions, the Court is satisfied on the evidence before it that the arrest and detention in question conformed to the national substantive and procedural rules.

This is in particular the case of the 1988 Rules, which entered into force on 1\u00a0July 1988 and applied, not to the first instance of detention occurring in January 1988, but to the five instances which occurred after 1 July\u00a01988. Under those rules, conduct resulting from the use of alcohol and causing disorder or significant disturbance or inconvenience could warrant detention, provided it was highly likely that this situation would continue if the person were to remain at liberty. Detention was not justified in cases involving intoxication only and when alternative measures could be used, for instance taking the person home. However, the Court notes, although they implied that detention could be ordered only if it was necessary, even those provisions omitted to specify when detention ceased to be justified and the detainee had a right to be released.",

In my view this formulation was precise enough to allow an assessment to be made whether it applied to the case of an intoxicated woman particularly on a December or January night, as it was the case on four occasions. It is true that the 1988 Rules did not determine, in a clear manner, the duration of the detention. But, since the detention was allowed only if there was a component of a \u201cdanger\u201d, it could be assumed that once that danger no longer existed, there was no legal basis for the continuation of the detention. In plain language, it meant that once the person in question sobered up, he/she must be released. This was exactly what happened on each occasion to which the 1988 Rules applied.",

The facts of this case demonstrate that, on every occasion, the applicant had been so drunk that she lost control over her behaviour. Therefore, even without being aware of the details of the 1988 Rules, the applicant should have been able to foresee that if she got drunk and lost control in a public place (the police station is clearly a public place), Article 61 \u00a7 7 of the Code would have been applicable in her case. More generally, it should be assumed that any reasonable person could and should come to the conclusion that being seriously intoxicated in a public place, may result in a police intervention and may lead to a temporary deprivation of liberty.
