Further delays in the course of the social court proceedings stemmed from several requests to postpone scheduled hearings, difficulties in correspondence caused by the applicant\u2019s residence in  and the delayed payment of the advance for an expert opinion.

The length of the proceedings before the  was to a large extent caused by the expert Prof. S., who only submitted his report after two years and three months. The Court recalls in this respect that in cases where cooperation with an expert proves necessary, it is the responsibility of the domestic courts to ensure that the proceedings are not excessively prolonged (see, among other authorities, Volkwein v. , no. 45181/99, \u00a7 39, 4\u00a0April 2002). It notes that in the present case the  did set Prof. S. a number of time-limits for the submission of his report \u2013 in the end it also announced the imposition of a coercive fine. Nonetheless, it finds that the  only reluctantly inquired about the progress of the report, and the expert\u2019s repeated failure to comply with the time-limits set did not have any further consequences. Moreover, after the submission of the report, no real attempts to substantially further the case were made either \u2013 the Social Court merely awaited the return of the files and the comments of the applicant and then transferred the files, without making copies, to the Social Court of Appeal, where they remained for half a year (there is no indication that the outcome of these proceedings was of any relevance to the proceedings at issue here). Also, after the submission of the second expert opinion several months elapsed before the  reminded the Insurance Association to submit observations. The Social Court of Appeal on its part also \u2013 at least in parts \u2013 failed sufficiently to further the proceedings. That court also partly merely awaited the parties\u2019 submissions, and on the applicant\u2019s request to postpone the hearing just cancelled it, and moreover only reluctantly commissioned the first expert report.
