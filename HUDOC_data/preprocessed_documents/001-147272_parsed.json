In its weekend issue of 31 August to 2 September 2007, DV published an article about a high-profile criminal case which was being investigated at the time, involving Mr Y and his wife, Mrs X. Mr Y was the director of a Christian rehabilitation centre called Byrgi\u00f0 (the Shelter), which he had founded in 1996 to help people dealing with drug, alcohol and gambling addictions. Accusations against Mr Y surfaced in December 2006 when a television news programme broadcast a story in which he was accused of sexually abusing several female patients at Byrgi\u00f0 and embezzling public funds which had been granted to it. Documents, including sexually explicit video recordings, appearing to substantiate the allegations against Mr Y, were shown on the television programme. After the programme had been aired, three\u00a0women filed complaints with the police against Mr Y for sexual abuse while they had been patients at Byrgi\u00f0. Mr Y and his wife were both suspects in the criminal investigation.",

The article was entitled \u201cSatan\u2019s attacks\u201d and included, among other things, Ms A\u2019s description of how Mrs X had been active in the so-called sex games organised by Mr Y, in which female patients at Byrgi\u00f0 had been manipulated and convinced to participate as they had been told that it was part of their healing process. According to Ms\u00a0A, Mrs X had helped to seduce the women and had even sought sexual encounters with them by herself, without her husband. Ms A criticised the fact that Mrs X was at the time working as a teaching assistant in a school, stating \u201cI am not a psychologist or a psychiatrist but this person is crazy. I cannot see that she has anything to offer as a teaching assistant or in any kind of relief work. I do not know what she is doing in this school.

[Ms A] testified before the District Court that she vaguely remembered a conversation with a journalist from DV, discussing \u2018just something about the Byrgi\u00f0 case\u2019. However, she did not acknowledge having said what was referred to in items a. to j., but she was asked about each statement. When considering that the statements, which are quoted from [Ms\u00a0A] in items a., b., c., d. and h., are, according to the District Court\u00b4s premises in the aforementioned criminal case, in substance largely in line with her testimony before the police shortly before the article appeared, and that the defendant acknowledged having discussed the Byrgi\u00f0 case with a journalist from DV, but could not state what she thought she had said to the journalist about the case, it must be considered proved that the statements in these items are attributable to her. The statements in items e., f., g., i. and j. are, on the other hand, not in line with the testimonies given by [Ms A] during the investigation of the case against [Mr Y]. It is therefore not possible to consider that [the applicant] has been able to prove that those statements were quoted from [Ms A].",

However, the testimony given by [Ms A] about [Mrs X\u00b4s] participation in their sexual activities did not form the basis for that conviction. Regardless of whether it has been successfully proven that the statements in items a. to d. in respect of this subject are true, it must be considered that the above-mentioned statements quoted from [Mr B], which discussed in general terms [Mrs X\u00b4s] involvement in sexual activities with her husband and the female patients of Byrgi\u00f0, were considered proved. In this connection it cannot be found that those statements, which were quoted from [Ms A], were likely to further damage [Mrs X\u00b4s] honour. There are therefore no grounds to annul them under Article 241, cf. Article 235 of the Penal Code.",

I do not know what she is doing in this school...\u02bc, entails a value judgment which does not violate the above-mentioned provisions of chapter XXV of the Penal Code and it will therefore not be annulled. The latter part of the statement in item i., which states the following: \u02bd... not appropriate that the one who hunts for him works in a primary school\u02bc is a different matter. These words indicated that [Mrs X] was guilty of criminal conduct, which has by no means been proven to be true. [Mrs X\u00b4s] claim for annulment is therefore accepted, with reference to Article\u00a0241, cf. Article 235 of the Penal Code.",

Moreover, the impugned statement could not be considered to contain an exaggeration, as it had been established in both the criminal case and the defamation case (see paragraph 18 above) that Mrs X had played an active role in seducing and abusing the female patients at Byrgi\u00f0. In this respect, the applicant referred to Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. Austria (no.\u00a039394/98, ECHR 2003XI), in which the Court had reiterated that the degree of precision for establishing the wellfoundedness of a criminal charge by a competent court could hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his or her opinion on a matter of public concern, in particular when expressing it in the form of a value judgment.",

The Supreme Court had done so in the present case, finding the impugned remark to contain \u201ca coarse insinuation against [Mrs X] about a criminal act ...

That obligation required that the factual basis on which she relied be sufficiently accurate and reliable and be considered proportionate to the nature and degree of the allegation, given that the more serious the allegation, the more solid the factual basis has to be (see Bj\u00f6rk Ei\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, \u00a7\u00a071; and Pedersen and\u00a0Baadsgaard, \u00a7\u00a078, both cited above,).",

However, the domestic courts did not explain in their judgments how the word \u201chunt\u201d, used in the statement: \u201cthe one who hunts for him\u201d (emphasis added), would be perceived by the ordinary reader as an innuendo about a criminal act. Indeed, the judgments contained no reference to any legal provision under which the act could be objectively subsumed, nor did they offer any clarification or description of the alleged criminal offence. This was all the more necessary considering that the Supreme Court had already rejected Mrs X\u2019s libel action in respect of a series of statements contained in the applicant\u2019s article referring to the active participation of Mrs X in sexual activities with a number of female patients at Byrgi\u00f0, including seeking to have sexual encounters with Ms A in private (see item f., referred to in paragraph 10), as well as the allegation that Mrs X was fully aware of Mr\u00a0Y\u2019s abuse of the patients and that she sometimes participated in the sexual games (see item l., referred to in paragraph 10). The Court is therefore not convinced that the reasons relied on by the domestic courts were relevant to the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and reputation of Mrs X (see Erla Hlynsd\u03ccttir v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 43380/10, \u00a7 62, 10\u00a0July 2012, and Bergens Tidende and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).",

(see paragraph 10), to the effect that Mr B found it \u201codd that a woman in this position [was] working with children\u201d constituted a value judgment. On the other hand, the Supreme Court considered that the latter part (\u201c... not appropriate that the one who hunts for him works in a primary school\u201d) was \u201ca different matter\u201d, but without specifying in which way (see paragraph 18 above).",

On the other hand, the portrayal of Mrs X as being the \u201cone who hunts for\u201d Mr Y, which was the stated basis for the said value judgment, included a factual element, namely that Mrs X had taken part in sexual activities with Mr Y and female patients at the Byrgi\u00f0 rehabilitation center. However, that element was considered an established fact by the Supreme Court, which also noted Mr\u00a0Y\u2019s conviction for his conduct (see paragraph 18 above). The words \u201chunts for him\u201d, when assessed in light of the article as a whole, and in particular the established facts of Mrs X active participation in sexual activities, among other things her seeking to have sexual encounters with Ms A in private and her active participation in sexual games (see paragraph 65 above), may be more readily understood as a value based characterization of established factual events rather than a pure factual assertion (see, mutatis mutandis, Nilsen and\u00a0Johnsen, cited above, \u00a7 50).",
