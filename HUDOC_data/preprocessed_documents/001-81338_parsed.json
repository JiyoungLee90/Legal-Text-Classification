The District Court further noted that the applicant had acted with \u201cincredible brutality\u201d (unglaubliche Brutalit\u00e4t) towards his second victim, after having already exploited his former partner. The applicant had taken around 48,000 German marks from the latter without leaving her the necessary resources to cater to her own and her child's needs, his intention being to use the money for alcohol, drugs and other purposes of his own. The District Court put special emphasis on the exceptional brutality with which the applicant had exploited his former partner.

The Presidency of the Council made it clear that aliens who were not citizens of a  and resided legally in a European Union country for a period of time to be determined should be granted a number of rights which were as close as possible to those enjoyed by European Union citizens. At the European Council meeting in Seville in June 2002 the Heads of States and Government of the Union manifested their willingness to develop a common policy on asylum and immigration, and underlined their conviction that the integration of immigrants into the Union's countries entailed, on their part, rights and obligations dictated by the human rights recognised by the Union. Equally, the Council of Europe, through recommendations of the Committee of Ministers (Rec(2000)15 and Rec(2002)4) and the Parliamentary Assembly (Recommendation 1504 (2001)), has made it clear that long-term immigrants should not be expelled. Recommendation Rec(2000)15 of the Committee of Ministers even stated that \u201c[a]fter twenty years of residence, a long-term immigrant should no longer be expellable\u201d, while Recommendation 1504 (2001) of the Parliamentary Assembly called for member States \u201cto take the necessary steps to ensure that in the case of long-term migrants the sanction of expulsion is applied only to particularly serious offences affecting state security of which they have been found guilty\u201d and \u201cto guarantee that migrants who were born or raised in the host country and their under-age children cannot be expelled under any circumstances\u201d.",

A careful reading of its paragraph 55, to which I have just referred, shows clearly that the Court considers that a long-term immigrant who was born in a State Party has the right not to be expelled from that State, a right which is part and parcel of the more general right to private and family life enshrined in Article 8 of the Convention. That right is, of course, not an absolute one, since like all the other constitutive components of Article 8, it is subject to the limitations provided for by its second paragraph. Yet these limitations are the exceptions, not the rule; and in order for the exceptions to prevail, and for a State to be allowed to expel, very serious and exceptional considerations of public interest must exist in the circumstances of a particular case.",

Indeed, in both cases there existed very weighty reasons justifying expulsion. Although, admittedly, in the present case of Kaya the applicant was a second-generation immigrant (a matter which objectively makes expulsion even more difficult and exceptional), still the nature of the offences committed \u2013 offences which clearly were of an extremely serious moral and criminal nature \u2013 justified, to my mind, the measure taken against him.",
