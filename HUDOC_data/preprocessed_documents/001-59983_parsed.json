Accepting that the proceedings were of a certain complexity for the reasons adduced by the Government, the Court finds that considerable delays occurred in particular in the second set of proceedings before the Innsbruck Regional Court. The proceedings were pending before that court between 25 August 1989 and 12 February 1996 that is for some six and a half years. The Court finds that such a considerable duration cannot be justified by the need to prepare and supplement an expert opinion, even if it appears that part of the delay was caused by the parties\u2019 reticence to submit documents to the expert. Moreover, there is no explanation for the lapse of eleven months between the hearing of 15 March 1995 and 12 February 1996 when the Regional Court gave its judgment.
