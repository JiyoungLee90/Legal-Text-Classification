The exact number is unknown since, following their release, not all of the hostages reported to the authorities. However, a large number of hostages were affected by the gas; according to information gathered by the investigative authorities by the end of 2002, 129\u00a0hostages died: 102\u00a0died on the spot (114\u00a0according to the report of 31\u00a0December 2002), including three persons who were shot; 21\u00a0died in the course of evacuation and transportation to hospital; and six persons died in the emergency rooms of various hospitals. These figures were later adjusted or revised \u2013 see paragraph  above and paragraph  below, see also the conclusions of the official investigation summarised in paragraph 99. Apparently, the discrepancy in figures is mainly due to the fact that different methods for calculating the number of victims were applied by various State authorities and that not all the necessary information (cause of death, time of death, etc.) was recorded in the hospitals and/or morgues. Many of those who survived continue to suffer from serious health problems. For instance, one of the applicants, Ms\u00a0Gubareva, a former hostage, was taken in an unconscious state to the intensive therapy unit of\u00a0City Hospital no.\u00a07, where she underwent treatment until 28\u00a0October 2002. A week later she was hospitalised again. The applicant Ms Khudovekova, who was also amongst the hostages, lost her hearing. The applicants submitted medical records in respect of several former hostages from hospitals where they underwent medical treatment after release.",

The victims had received, in the first place, artificial lung ventilation, cardiac support, etc. Two or three hours later he had left for Hospital no.\u00a013, which had admitted a large number of the victims. As to possible treatment, he testified that it had been difficult to prepare any antidote in advance, given the situation of the hostages at the time of the storming of the building. Nalaxone was a specific antidote for opiate drugs and was widely used from the beginning of the operation. The fact that the victims were suffering from opiate poisoning had been evident from their symptoms. However, the use of Nalaxone had not been effective, as it had not produced any tangible positive results.",

On 22\u00a0April 2003 the case was transmitted to the trial court (case no.\u00a0229136). The applicants claimed that they learned of this from the press. The applicants requested the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow to allow their participation in the proceedings in the capacity of victims. However, this was refused on the ground that the case had already been transferred to the court. The Moscow City Court upheld that decision. On 20 June 2003 Mr Talkhigov was found guilty of aiding and abetting the terrorist attack by the Moscow City Court. He was sentenced to eight and a half years\u2019 imprisonment. On 9\u00a0September 2003 the conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Russia.",

At moderate doses those drugs suppress pain, and at high doses they cause a sleep-like state, and at higher doses they cause a coma. All opiates also suppress the urge to breathe in a dose-dependent way. When the individual is unconscious breathing may slow below the point that is needed to maintain sufficient oxygen in the blood to sustain normal body functioning. Even if breathing continues at a reduced rate, the relaxation caused by opiates can cause the neck and tongue to become limp and result in an occlusion of the airway. This positional asphyxia is a particular risk if the recipient is sitting upright. In addition, when opiates (and particularly Phentanyl-type drugs) are given rapidly, this causes muscular rigidity, which can stop breathing entirely. The spasm of rigidity can result in violent pitching of the trunk. Such a forward pitching might well have caused a blow to the forehead from the theatre seat ahead.",

Negotiations had been started, which led to the liberation of some of the hostages. The authorities had persuaded the terrorists to accept food and water for the hostages and medical assistance for the neediest ones. However, at a certain point the terrorists had interrupted the release of children and foreigners and had refused to accept any more food or water. Moreover, the terrorists had started to kill the hostages. They had shot five people in aggregate in order to demonstrate their determination to move to action. The terrorists had been dangerous criminals; their leader, Mr\u00a0Sh. B. (who had not been in the theatre himself but who had planned and directed the whole operation) had been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including a car bombing a few days earlier. Thus, the decision to storm the building had been taken after lengthy negotiations with the terrorists, as required by Article\u00a014 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, when all possibilities for further negotiations had been exhausted. The choice of means had been justified by the risks posed by the possible explosion of the bombs, which would have resulted in the death of all of the hostages. One of the hostages had later testified that suicide bombers had told them that the terrorists had been prepared to die; thus the hostages themselves had not seen any other solution than the storming. The telephone calls from Mr\u00a0S.\u00a0(B.), one of the leaders of the terrorists, to Mr\u00a0Yand., another person in the Chechen separatist movement, had been intercepted. It followed from those conversations that Mr S. (B.) had been prepared to kill the hostages and die himself if the terrorists\u2019 requirements were not met. FSB experts in explosive devices had made a preliminary assessment of the situation during the siege and had provided three alternative scenarios, and in each of them the loss of human life had been unavoidable. The ex post facto examination of the explosive devices installed by the terrorists in the theatre had confirmed that the cumulative effect of their explosions would in all likelihood have killed most of the hostages in the hall.",

Further, the detonation of even one explosive device would in all likelihood have led to the deaths of several other suicide bombers. If detonation occurred, they would pull clips on their own explosive belts, which would then explode and produce a chain reaction of explosions.

It had also been impossible to calculate the dose of the gas more precisely because of the differences in the physical condition of those in the theatre: young, physically fit terrorists, and the hostages, weakened by the siege, suffering from lack of food, fresh air, chronic diseases, some of them too old or too young to withstand the effects of the gas.

The territory near the theatre was thus used only for the preliminary examination of the condition of the victims. The medics applied two procedures recommended in such situations by the World Health Organisation \u2013 syndrome-based emergency treatment and rapid hospitalisation. Evacuation of the hostages affected by the gas from the theatre building and their transportation to hospital had been quick and well-organised, the hospitals had been equipped to admit them, and, in general, the rescue operation had been conducted in the most efficient manner possible in the circumstances. Use of the city buses as a reinforcement transport was provided by the applicable protocols for emergency situations of such extent. The two hospitals which received the maximum number of hostages ( no.\u00a01 and  no.\u00a013) were prepared for the admission of a large number of patients; they were the closest hospitals to the theatre and it was crucial to reduce transportation time to provide efficient medical aid to the victims.",

The official experts in their report concluded that there was no \u201cdirect causal link\u201d between the death of those 125\u00a0people and the use of the gas, and that the gas was just one of many factors which led to such a tragic outcome (see paragraph 99 above). The Court will not call into question the interim conclusions of the domestic experts on the medical condition of each particular victim. However, the Court considers that the general conclusion of the expert report, if applied to all the deceased hostages (except those shot by the terrorists), is difficult to accept. It is unthinkable that 125\u00a0people of different ages and physical conditions died almost simultaneously and in the same place because of various pre-existing health problems. Equally, the mass death of hostages cannot be attributed to the conditions in which they had been held for three days, during which none of them had died, despite prolonged food and water deprivation, immobility, psychological stress, etc. Further, the Government themselves admitted that it had been impossible to foresee the effects of the gas, and had considered that some losses had been unavoidable (see paragraph 194 above). This implies that the gas was not \u201charmless\u201d, because \u201charmless\u201d means that it does not have important adverse effects.",

This is an important characteristic of the gas; the Court will return to it in its further analysis. For the time being, the Court does not need to decide whether the gas was a \u201clethal force\u201d or a \u201cnon-lethal weapon\u201d. As transpires from the Government\u2019s submissions, and as the events of the case clearly show, the gas was, at best, potentially dangerous for an ordinary person, and potentially fatal for a weakened person. It is possible that some people were affected more than others on account of their physical condition. Moreover, it is even possible that one or two deaths amongst the applicants\u2019 relatives were natural accidents and were not related to the gas at all. Nevertheless, it is safe to conclude that the gas remained a primary cause of the death of a large number of the victims.",

It appears that his name was added to the list of applicants because his wife, Yekaterina Vladimirovna Matyukhina, who was amongst the hostages, had been affected by the gas but survived. In such circumstances the Court considers that only Ms Matyukhina herself can be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violation of Article 2 of the Convention within the meaning of Article\u00a034 thereof.

Many facts related to this aspect of the case are in dispute between the parties. The Court reiterates in this respect that its fact-finding capacity is limited. As a result, and in line with the principle of subsidiarity, the Court prefers to rely, where possible, on the findings of competent domestic authorities.\u00a0That being said, the Court does not completely renounce its supervising power. Where the circumstances of a particular case so require, especially where the death of a victim is arguably attributable to the use of lethal force by State agents, the Court may entertain a fresh assessment of evidence (see Golubeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01062/03, \u00a7\u00a095, 17\u00a0December 2009; see also, mutatis mutandis, Matko v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a043393/98, \u00a7\u00a0100, 2\u00a0November 2006; and Imakayeva v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a07615/02, \u00a7\u00a0113, ECHR\u00a02006-XIII (extracts)). The Court further reiterates that \u201cin the situation where persons are found injured or dead ... in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities. If they then fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn\u201d (see Varnava and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a016064/90 etc., \u00a7\u00a0184, ECHR 2009-...). As follows from this quote, the Court can make adverse inferences if the Government fails to disclose crucial evidence in the proceedings before the Court, as they were required to do under former Article 38\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (now Article\u00a038 of the Convention, which provides that States should furnish all necessary facilities to make possible a proper and effective examination of applications - see Tanr\u0131kulu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR\u00a01999-IV, and Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a023531/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066 and 70, ECHR\u00a02000-VI).",

Third, they had some control of the situation outside the building, where most of the rescue efforts took place (contrary to the situation within the building, which was in the hands of the terrorists). Finally, the more predictable a hazard, the greater the obligation to protect against it: it is clear that the authorities in this case always acted on the assumption that the hostages might have been seriously injured (by an explosion or by the gas), and thus the large number of people in need of medical assistance did not come as a surprise.

The Government did not specify how many coordinators (if any) were deployed, or whether all workers were informed about their presence, their role, insignia, etc. The video of the evacuation creates the impression that everyone involved acted on his or her own initiative, at least at the outset.

However, no such sorting could be seen on the video: the bodies were placed on the ground in a seemingly haphazard way, and many witnesses confirmed that in fact there had been no filtering (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a083, 90 and 91 above) or that it was inefficient, since dead bodies had been placed in the same buses as people who were still alive (see paragraphs\u00a090 and 93 above). Further, the purpose of sorting is itself unclear. The Government did not indicate whether, after the sorting, if any, priority was given to the most serious cases or to those victims whose chances of recovery were higher. The purpose of the sorting is not specified: the Court cannot thus tell whether it was to be carried out to ensure even distribution of the burden amongst the hospitals or to ensure that the most serious cases were sent to the closest (or better prepared) hospitals.

The admission capacity of several hospitals was indeed increased, but the ambulance teams and bus drivers did not know where to take the victims (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a086 and 87 above). As a result, the dispatching of the victims to hospitals was more or less unstructured: thus, four or five buses followed the ambulances and all arrived at the same destination, City Hospital no. 13, almost simultaneously. That hospital received 213 victims of the gas within 30 minutes (see paragraph\u00a051 above), many of them in a critical state. The Court has no exact information on how many doctors and paramedics were available in that hospital, since the Government failed to answer the Court\u2019s question on that point. However, bearing in mind the size of the hospital, the composition of the emergency teams and the number of regular patients who remained (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a057 et seq.) it is very likely that medical assistance to the majority of those 213\u00a0hostages was seriously delayed. At the same time the hospital closest to the theatre, which was 20\u00a0metres from the building, admitted considerably fewer patients than planned (see paragraphs\u00a020 and 50 above).",

The rescue workers and doctors confirmed that they had not received any specific instructions on how to deal with poisoned individuals, let alone people poisoned by opiate drugs. They had all been preparing to work on the site of an explosion (see paragraphs 67 et seq. above).

Several senior doctors and officials have claimed that information about the gas and the suggested treatment would have been irrelevant, and that the preliminary measures taken were valid for all circumstances, whether these concerned an explosion or a gas attack (see, for example, paragraph\u00a055 above). However, that opinion is open to doubt, especially in view of the statements by the field doctors who participated in the operation, many of whom expressed the opposite view (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a085 and 89 above). In any event, even if the doctors\u2019 training was sufficient to choose the appropriate treatment on the spot, this cannot be said in respect of the rescue workers and the special squad officers. Thus, the video recordings show that some (the majority) of the victims were placed on the floor in the \u201cface-up\u201d position, which increased the likelihood of suffocation by vomiting or from a swollen tongue. This was confirmed by several rescue workers (see paragraph\u00a068 above), contrary to what the public health officials asserted in their reports (see paragraph\u00a046 above). The same is true with regard to the placement of victims in the city buses which transported them to various hospitals (the position of the victims in the buses is visible on the video recordings). The Court concludes that the lack of information about the gas might have played a negative role and could have raised the mortality rate amongst the hostages (see also paragraph\u00a0119 above).",

Although the Chief Anaesthesiologist claimed that Nalaxone was not efficient (see paragraph\u00a054 above), most of the other doctors referred to Nalaxone as the main substance capable of restoring breathing and cardiac activity in such circumstances (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a055, 59, 60 and 78 above).\u00a0Some Nalaxone was administered on the spot. However, a careful examination of the video recordings showing the main entrance to the theatre building reveals only one instance when a doctor (or a rescue worker) gives an injection. The injections were probably administered inside the building, but this assumption is hard to reconcile with the existing evidence: thus, many witnesses testified that there had been a shortage of Nalaxone (see, for example, paragraphs\u00a080, 88 and 93 above). Further, as follows from the post-mortem reports, about 60 people did not have any trace of assistance when they were admitted to hospital (see paragraph\u00a096 above). This figure concerns only the deceased hostages \u2013 the Court has no information as to how many surviving hostages received injections of Nalaxone.

The applicants\u2019 inability to obtain a thorough and independent investigation into the events of 23\u201326\u00a0October 2002 must have created an additional stress for them.
