Although it is in the first place for the national authorities (notably the courts) to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 a failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, and the Court can and should review whether such law has been complied with (see, among many other references, Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 171, ECHR 2004II). For an assessment of compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention a basic distinction has to be made between ex facie invalid detention orders \u2013 for example, an order given by a court in excess of jurisdiction, or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing \u2013 and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court. A detention order must be considered as ex facie invalid if the flaw in the order amounted to a \u201cgross and obvious irregularity\u201d in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court\u2019s case-law (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 75, 9 July 2009, with further references).",
