In the cases of this type regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the relevant competing interests (see, for example, Von\u00a0Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a098-99, ECHR 2012).

The Court has found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention where the domestic authorities refused to deal with the putative biological father\u2019s request to establish his paternity by mere reference to the recognition of paternity by another man, without, however, examining the factual background of the case (see, in that regard, R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 55339/00, \u00a7 78, 18 May 2006). By way of contrast, Article 8 was not violated where the domestic authorities refused to deal with such a request after they had carried out a thorough scrutiny of the interests of the involved individuals, attaching particular weight to the interests of the child, while not ignoring those of the putative biological father (see, in that regard, Kriszti\u00e1n Barnab\u00e1s T\u00f3th v. Hungary, no.\u00a048494/06, \u00a7\u00a7 33-38, 12 February 2013).",

Under domestic law the courts had had powers to renew the time-limit provided that there had been a valid reason for doing so (see paragraph 16 above). When asking to renew the time-limit, the applicant insisted that he had missed it for good reasons \u2013 essentially because he had not wished to disturb the family situation of the child who had a legal father, as long as he had not been prevented from communicating with the child on a regular basis. Only when the applicant found out that the mother had decided to leave the country with the child, did he interfere (see paragraph 9 above). While these reasons were accepted as valid for renewing the time-limit and examining the claim on the merits by the first-instance court (see paragraph\u00a010 above), the court of appeal dismissed those arguments without providing any alternative reasons explaining its decision (see paragraph 11 above). Despite the child\u2019s complex factual situation, which involved the putative biological father, the legal father and the stepfather, the actual relationship of the child with those three men remained completely unexamined and no consideration was given to the question of whether or not the renovation of the time-limit for the applicant\u2019s claim and its examination on the merits would be in the best interests of the child. In that regard, no analysis was carried out to balance the child\u2019s interests with that of the applicant to have his paternity established in such circumstances. Despite the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law (see paragraph 12 above), the Supreme Court did not address those issues in the course of its review of the case (see paragraph 13 above).",
