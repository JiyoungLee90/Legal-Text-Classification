It further reiterates that where a State has taken a significant step by introducing a compensatory remedy, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. The Court\u00a0has therefore\u00a0been prepared to accept that the compensation amounts awarded by domestic courts for violations of the\u00a0Convention rights may be somewhat lower than those granted by the Court in similar cases (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v. Italy (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 189, ECHR 2006V). In the present case, however, the amount of compensation awarded by the domestic courts falls far below what the Court awards in comparable situations in respect of non-pecuniary damage. With reference to the Convention criteria as they were set out in the pilot judgment (see Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0154-157, ECHR 2009), the Court considers that the amounts awarded to the applicants by the domestic courts are unreasonably low, taking into consideration notably the nature of the court award at issue and the extremely long delay in enforcement.",
