It was also necessary that a candidate had the required expertise and independence, as provided in section 62(1) of the State Attorneys Act (see paragraph 19 above), and received a sufficient number of votes from the members of the State Attorneys Council. Therefore, even if all candidates met the formal statutory requirements, the post of deputy county state attorney could remain vacant if none of them received the required number of votes. In assessing the expertise and independence of the candidates in the present case, after holding a secret ballot the State Attorneys Council appointed Mrs D.K.I., and not the applicant, deputy county state attorney in the Vukovar County State Attorney\u2019s Office.
