It observes that enforcement of the judgment at issue was within the jurisdiction of the Bailiffs\u2019 Service until the liquidation commission for the IBF was formed and the writs of execution were transmitted to it (on 27 June 2002). It would therefore be inconceivable to suggest that the applicant should have instituted additional proceedings in the  seeking enforcement of a judgment with regard to an entity that did not yet have any jurisdiction over the enforcement proceedings and did not exist de facto (see paragraphs 17 and 35 above). As to the possibility of lodging complaints against the liquidation commission after 27 June 2002, the Court considers that, from the refusals of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Commercial Court to consider the applicant\u2019s complaints (see paragraphs 44-46 above), it ensues that this remedy, in the circumstances of the instant case, did not offer reasonable prospects of success to the applicant and was ineffective. Moreover, the liquidation commission ceased to exist on 23 July 2002 with the adoption of the friendly settlement between the parties to the bankruptcy proceedings. However, notwithstanding these considerations and taking into account the fact that the State cannot be held liable for the acts or omissions of the liquidation commission, the Court considers that this part of the application should be dismissed as being incompatible ratione personae.",
