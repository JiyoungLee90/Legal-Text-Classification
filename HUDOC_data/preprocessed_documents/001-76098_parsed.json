Furthermore, in assessing whether the assembly would run counter to these interests they were required to rely on circumstances which could be objectively verified. A number of factors justified the authorities\u2019 assumption that the applicant\u2019s assembly had been mainly aimed at disrupting the commemoration ceremony organised by Comradeship IV: the time and venue chosen for the assembly so as to make it coincide with the gathering of Comradeship IV; the view expressed by the applicant and by F.E., another member of the Green Party, that the latter gathering was unlawful; and their failure to give the required assurances not to disrupt the Comradeship IV wreath-laying ceremony. Furthermore, the authorities had rightly assumed that a confrontation between the two groups would endanger public order at the municipal cemetery and offend the religious feelings of uninvolved visitors. In arriving at that conclusion, the authorities had also been able to rely on experiences from previous years in which assemblies like the one planned by the applicant had annoyed visitors, had led to heated discussions and had required police intervention.",

Furthermore, in the past few years a number of organisations had organised protest campaigns with the aim of disrupting Comradeship IV\u2019s commemoration ceremony. These protests had led to vehement discussions with members of Comradeship IV and other visitors to the cemetery and had required intervention by the police. In the circumstances, the  was right in finding that the authorities had correctly assumed that the prohibition of the assembly being organised by the applicant was necessary to protect the general public against potential disturbances.",

The  expressed doubts regarding the correctness of this finding. I share these doubts and I would even go so far as to say that personally I do not see how such a finding can legally be justified. Be that as it may, the fact remains that Comradeship IV was a registered association and for more than forty years had commemorated SS soldiers killed in the Second World War by gathering on All Saints\u2019 Day and laying a wreath in front of the war memorial at  municipal cemetery. If the applicant\u2019s aim was to contest the legality of this provocative gathering, the proper way to do so was indisputably through legal means or peaceful demonstrations against the authorities who allowed the gatherings, and certainly not through a confrontation in a cemetery on All Saints\u2019 Day. In substance, the assembly planned by the applicant was a political meeting whose objectives may have been understandable (see paragraph 43 of the judgment), but I fail to see how the time and place of such meeting showed any respect for the rights of others in the cemetery (not belonging to Comradeship IV). The time and place of the proposed demonstration or gathering were not appropriate. A cemetery is a sacred place and is not, in my opinion, the proper place, especially on All Saints\u2019 Day, for political demonstrations, however respectable they may be, when other people are present in the cemetery and have a right to peaceful commemoration of the dead. This, I believe, becomes even more evident when there is undisputed evidence, as in this case, of a real danger of such disturbances in the cemetery as to require intervention by the police.",
