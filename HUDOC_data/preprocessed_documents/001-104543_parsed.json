It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case because what is accepted as an exception must not become a norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depended to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remained classified as secret and the decision to maintain the confidentiality was left within the powers of the current secret services, created a situation in which the lustrated person\u2019s position was put at a clear disadvantage (see, Matyjek, \u00a7\u00a062; Luboch, \u00a7\u00a067; Rasmussen, \u00a7\u00a050, G\u00f3rny \u00a7\u00a040, all cited above).",
