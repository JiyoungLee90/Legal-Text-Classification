The purpose of measures by the authorities depriving applicants of their liberty no longer appears decisive for the assessment of whether there has in fact been a deprivation of liberty. To date, the Court has taken this into account only at a later stage of its analysis, when examining the compatibility of the measure with Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. Article 5 \u00a7 1 may also apply to deprivations of liberty of a very short length (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a029226/03, \u00a7\u00a7 91-93, 23 February 2012).",

Austria, 28 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a073, Series A no. 242B). In order to be covered by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (b), the arrest and detention must also aim at or directly contribute to securing the fulfilment of an obligation and not be punitive in character (see Osypenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 4634/04, \u00a7 57, 9\u00a0November 2010, and Soare and Others v.\u00a0Romania, no. 24329/02, \u00a7 236, 22 February 2011). In addition, it is necessary that the nature of the obligation within the meaning of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 (b) whose fulfilment is sought must in itself be compatible with the Convention. As soon as the relevant obligation has been fulfilled, the basis for detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) ceases to exist (see Osypenko, \u00a7 57, and Lolova-Karadzhova, \u00a7 29, both cited above).",

It has found, for instance, that the statutory obligation to give evidence as a witness was sufficiently specific and concrete for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) and could thus be enforced by detention in a police station (see, in particular, Iliya Stefanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-75, and Soare and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0234-39).

When taking measures to prevent disorder or crime or to protect the rights of others, the national authorities may consider it pertinent and opportune to resort to a search and seizure in order to obtain evidence of offences in certain circumstances, for instance, when it is otherwise impossible to identify the person guilty of the offence (see Buck, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052).",

Secondly, the Court must consider the specific circumstances of each case in order to determine whether, in the particular case, the interference in question was proportionate to the aim pursued (see Camenzind, cited above, \u00a7 45). The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue have been, inter alia: the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure was effected; the manner and circumstances in which the order was issued, in particular with regard to the evidence available at that time; the content and scope of the order, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the safeguards taken in order to confine the impact of the measure to reasonable bounds; and the extent of possible repercussions on the reputation of the person affected by the search (see Funke, \u00a7 57, and Camenzind, \u00a7 46, both cited above).",
