In respect of the second of those conditions, the court found that it had been satisfied since the second applicant, as the owner of the lorry, was liable for the actions of the first applicant, who had acted as its agent \u2013 as provided in Article 3 of the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (hereinafter \u201cthe CMR Convention\u201d \u2013 see paragraph 21 below).

From the available material it can be seen that at the relevant time the second applicant was a limited liability company owned by a single person \u2013 namely the first applicant. The first applicant was the only party to the domestic proceedings, in which he maintained that he had taken out a bank loan in order to purchase the lorry so that he could carry on a business and support his family (see paragraphs 9 and 13 above). In such circumstances, it can be said that, according to the Court\u2019s relevant case-law (see Ankarcrona v. Sweden (dec.), no.\u00a035178/97, 27\u00a0June 2000), there was no risk of competing interests between the first applicant and any other party that could give rise to difficulties. Consequently, the Court considers that even though the official owner of the lorry was the second applicant, the applicants are so closely identified with each other that it would be artificial to distinguish between them in this context (see Eugenia Michaelidou Developments Ltd and Michael Tymvios v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 16163/90, \u00a7 21, 31 July 2003; Kin-Stib and Majki\u0107 v.

This was not disputed by the Government, and neither did they argue that in the present case there existed competing interests between the first applicant on the one hand and any other person or entity on the other (contrast Vesel\u00e1 and Loyka v.\u00a0Slovakia (dec.), no. 54811/00, 13 December 2005). Rather, the Court finds that the second applicant remained a vehicle for the family business and that there appear to be no competing interests which could give rise to difficulties (compare Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, \u00a7\u00a0125, 15\u00a0November 2007). The Court concludes that, given the specific circumstances of the present case, the first applicant\u2019s complaints are compatible ratione personae with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention. The Government\u2019s objection in this regard must therefore be dismissed.",

The second applicant, as the formal owner of the lorry, was not a party to the domestic proceedings. Nevertheless, the Administrative Court examined whether the subjective condition stipulated under section 269\u00a0(1) of the Act had been met and held that the second applicant, as the carrier, had been liable for the acts or omissions of its agents (specifically, the first applicant), as provided by the relevant provisions of the CMR Convention.

The domestic authorities examined the substance of the applicants\u2019 complaint; accordingly, the fact that the second applicant did not participate in the impugned proceedings cannot be held against it (compare G\u00e4fgen v.

As a result, a fine of EUR 1,500 was imposed on the first applicant and the goods and the lorry were confiscated. In so far as the applicants argued that the confiscation had not been lawful because the first applicant\u2019s actions had not constituted a misdemeanour, the Court observes that the Commission\u2019s findings were reviewed and upheld by the domestic courts. The latter affirmed that the failure to register the customs declaration with the customs office at the point of entry was to be considered as constituting a failure to submit the goods for inspection in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Customs Act and the Regulation (both of which had been published in the Official Gazette) (see paragraph 14 above). The Court does not find that this interpretation on the part of the domestic courts was tainted by arbitrariness. Accordingly, and bearing in mind its limited power to review compliance with domestic law (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7\u00a0108, ECHR 2000-I, and S.C.

Accordingly, the confiscation was not mandatory and the domestic authorities were required to assess the diligence and the behaviour of the owner of the vehicle. The Administrative Court held that the subjective condition had been met, finding that the second applicant, as the carrier of the goods, had been liable for the acts and omissions of the first applicant, who had been acting as its agent (see paragraph 14 above). However, the domestic courts did not consider the relationship between the applicants\u2019\u00a0conduct and the offence. The fact that the lorry had entered the country at an official border crossing point (where it had been weighed) and had subsequently been submitted for inspection to the custom authorities in Bitola with the Bulgarian authorities\u2019 seals unbroken were not taken into account in reaching the decision to confiscate the lorry, even though they were taken into account as a mitigating circumstance with respect to the determination of the fine (see paragraph 12 above). Similarly, the domestic authorities did not give any weight to the first applicant\u2019s arguments that the confiscated lorry had been his family\u2019s only source of income and that the impugned measure had imposed a disproportionate burden on him, given the circumstances.",

The Court also notes that there was no evidence that the applicants or company B. had been criminally prosecuted in relation to any related offences (see Ismayilov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30352/03, \u00a7\u00a037, 6\u00a0November 2008; Gabri\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038; and Boljevi\u0107 v.

In this connection, it is important to note that the present case differs from cases in which the confiscation measure applied either to goods whose importation was prohibited or to vehicles used for transporting prohibited substances or for trafficking in human beings (see the cases referred to in Ismayilov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035). The confiscation of the lorry in the present case was not undertaken for the purpose of obtaining pecuniary compensation for damage, but was rather intended as a deterrent, as stated by the Government. The Court reiterates that the first applicant was fined for the misdemeanour and the goods were confiscated. It has not been convincingly shown that in the circumstances of the case those sanctions would not have been sufficient to achieve the desired deterrent effect and prevent future breaches of the relevant domestic legislation. The confiscation of the lorry, as an additional sanction, was, in the Court\u2019s view, disproportionate in that it imposed an excessive burden on the applicants (see, mutatis mutandis, Grifhorst v.

Alternatively, if such a return is impossible, the Court awards the applicants jointly EUR 13,000 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, which is the figure corresponding to the estimated value of the lorry, as established in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 8 above).",
