The Competition Council clarified the definition of the geographical scope of the market, narrowing it to the territory of Lithuania. The Competition Council found that the applicant company had undertaken actions that had restricted competition \u2013 namely, it had abused its dominant position by applying discriminatory pricing, by imposing yearly loyalty requirements on other economic entities (that is to say by requiring them to agree to purchase a certain amount of fuel per year from the applicant company) and by restricting parallel imports and the onward sale by its clients of cheap fuel. The applicant company raised an issue regarding the limitation period, claiming that it had expired and that the Competition Council therefore had to terminate the investigation. The Competition Council was of the view that a limitation period had to be calculated from the time at which the economic entity in question had ceased engaging in unlawful activity. One of the breaches committed by the applicant company had started in 2002; one had started in 2003; and the rest had started in 2004. There was no information that the applicant company had ended its unlawful activities (except for one of them). Thus, the threeyear limitation period had not even started to run. Moreover, there was no information that the applicant company had changed its behaviour on the relevant markets in such a way that it no longer undertook actions contrary to the Law on Competition and the TFEU; therefore, the violation had been continuous, and it could not be held that the limitation period had expired. Even if the limitation period had started running before the Competition Council\u2019s issuance of its decision of 22 December 2005, the calculation of it would nevertheless have ceased to run on the day that the Competition Council adopted its decision. The timelimit for holding the applicant company liable should have started running on 8 December 2008 \u2013 the date of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s partial annulment of the decision of the Competition Council. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for the Competition Council to rectify the shortcomings in its decision owing to the length of the court proceedings. Such a situation would have been contrary to the principles of justice and reasonableness because the harmful actions in question could have continued and there would have been no opportunities to require the applicant company to terminate them. Moreover, it would have been impossible to enforce the execution of the court\u2019s decisions. The calculation of the limitation period provided by the applicant company was favourable to other economic entities that had breached the Law on Competition. Such economic entities would only have to behave in such a manner as to ensure that the court proceedings in respect of their own behaviour lasted for a long time.",

The Supreme Administrative Court held that responsibility for violations of the Law on Competition was an administrative responsibility in the broad sense and that the principles of administrative responsibility could also be applied to violations of the Law on Competition (see paragraph 38 below). The Competition Council decided that the provisions of the Code of Administrative Offences had to be applied in the applicant company\u2019s case and that \u2013 irrespective of the rules of the Law on Competition \u2013 the time-limit had to be calculated from the day on which the Supreme Administrative Court had adopted its decision. The provisions of European Union law also provided that the limitation period for imposing fines had to be suspended when the European Commission\u2019s decision was reviewed by the European Union Court of Justice (see paragraph 47 below).

On 21 January 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the arguments of the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court (see paragraph 18 above). It added that there was disagreement between the parties about the dates on which the applicant company had committed violations. Because the Competition Council had investigated the applicant company\u2019s activities between 2002 and 2004, the court held that the last violation had been committed by the applicant company on 31 December 2004. The court also observed that the Competition Council had not proved that the violation had continued after 31 December 2004, and did not accept its arguments that the applicant company\u2019s violation had been continuous or that the limitation period had not started running at all. The court then emphasised the importance of the principle of res judicata \u2013 that is to say the factual and legal aspects had been examined in another decision of the court and had to be accepted, and that a party to the proceedings or another person who had participated in the case (where the parties to the proceedings were the same) could rely on that court\u2019s decision without having to prove the same circumstances again. In addition, one of the most important elements of the principle of the rule of law was the principle of legal certainty, which required that the principle of res judicata be respected. Accordingly, when the courts resolved a case, their decisions should not be questioned or left unexecuted, because courts\u2019 decisions (together with legal norms) were a guarantee of the stability of public life and the certainty of social relations. Having regard to that, the Supreme Administrative Court was of the view that on 13 May 2010 it had already examined the Competition Council\u2019s right to reopen the investigation into the applicant company\u2019s activities (see paragraph 15 above). As a result, the legality of the reopening of the investigation had the power of res judicata and could not be questioned again.",

Court precedents must be invoked with particular care.

In a situation where there is competition of precedents (i.e. when there are several differing court decisions adopted in analogous cases) one must follow the precedent that was created by the court of higher instance (a higher court). Also, account should be taken of the time of the creation of the precedent and of other factors of significance, as, for instance: of the fact whether the corresponding precedent reflects the established court practice, or whether it is a single occurrence; of whether the reasoning of the decision is convincing; of the composition of the court that adopted the decision (whether the corresponding decision was adopted by a single judge, or by a college of judges, or whether by the enlarged college of judges, or whether by the entire composition of the court (its chamber)); whether there were any dissenting opinions of judges expressed because of the previous court decision; of possible significant (social, economic etc.) changes which took place after the adoption of the corresponding court decision, which has the significance of a precedent, etc. As mentioned before, in cases when the correction of court practice is unavoidably and objectively necessary, the courts may deviate from the previous precedents, which had been binding on the courts until then, and create new precedents, however, it must be done by properly (clearly and rationally) arguing it. It needs to be specially emphasised that, when deviating from its previous precedents, the court must not only properly argue the adopted decision itself (i.e. the created precedent itself), but also clearly set forth the reasoning and the arguments substantiating the necessity to deviate from the previous precedent.\u201d",

However, in order to harmonise the national and the European Union rules on competition, as defined in Article 1 \u00a7 3 on the Law on Competition, and to ensure the proper application of these rules in Lithuania, it was necessary to take into account the procedural rules on competition, as valid under European Communities\u2019 competition law. Under Article 10 of the TEC, it was not allowed to apply such national procedural norms that would render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Articles 81 and 82 of the TEC (the principle of effectiveness) or to apply such rules that were less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (the principle of equivalence) (decision no. A-248-715-08).",

It explained that analogy of law could be applied (in accordance with both general legal theory and Article 4\u00a0\u00a7 6 of the Code on Administrative Proceedings), but only when: 1) there was a legal gap; 2) there was a law regulating similar relationships; and 3) there were similarities between relationships governed by legal norms and those not governed by them, which allowed the conclusion to be drawn that the application of analogy of law would not be contrary to the essence and type of legal relationship in question. The court furthermore held that at the material time, the relevant provision of the Law on Competition had not provided that limitation periods had to be suspended once a case had been transferred to a court and renewed once the relevant investigation had been reopened by the Competition Council. The current provisions of the Law on Competition providing that the limitation period for imposing fines is five years (but that it is possible to suspend it if the case is examined before a court) came into force on 3\u00a0May 2011 (see paragraph 28 above). The court held that the provisions that had been in force at the material time were a conscious decision of the legislature. Even the explanatory report on the amendments to the Law on Competition stated that the three-year limitation period had not provided for any cases when the time-limit for imposing sanctions could be suspended. The court furthermore stated that general limitation periods, which were listed in the Code of Administrative Offences, were not applicable in the field of competition law because Article 40 of the Law on Competition provided a specific time-limit for the imposition of fines, and that analogy of law could thus not be applied. Moreover, the possibility (as stipulated in the Law on Competition) to suspend that time-limit was not provided in the case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court. The court refused to follow the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 13 May 2010 (see paragraph 15 above), stating that the factual circumstances of two cases were different.",

However, provisions of competition law could not have a retroactive effect. The only exception to this rule in the field of administrative law was that the law could have a retroactive effect if it mitigated liability for violations of administrative law (lex benignior retro agit); however, in the present case the amendments to the Law on Competition did not mitigate such liability. The court had to follow the law; it could not assume the functions of the legislature by, in the absence of legal regulation, creating new legal norms and applying them to any specific case. Article 4 \u00a7 6 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings obliged the court to apply a law regulating a similar relationship in the absence of any law regulating the issue in question, and, if there was no such law \u2013 to apply the principles of fairness and reasonableness. Having regard to that, the court concluded that the limitation period had been provided in the Law on Competition, as worded at the material time and that no analogy of law could be applied. The court thus decided that the decision of the Competition Council had been unlawful because it had been issued after the expiry of the limitation period.",

The economic entities were of the view that the Competition Council had imposed the fines after the expiry of the limitation period, because the investigated actions had ended in December 2007 and the fines had been imposed in June 2011. The Supreme Administrative Court found that in February 2008 the Competition Council had issued a decision to impose fines on the two economic entities that had participated in the dairy products market. In June 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court had obliged the Competition Council to additionally investigate the activities of the two economic entities. In July 2009 the Competition Council had reopened the investigation. In 2011 the Competition Council had found that the economic entities had breached the Law on Competition; accordingly, it had imposed fines on them. The Supreme Administrative Court held that Article 40 \u00a7 3 of the Law on Competition, valid at the material time, had provided that economic entities could be held responsible for a breach of the Law on Competition within three years of the day on which such a breach had been committed or, in the case of a continuous breach \u2013 within three years of the day on which the last of the actions constituting a breach of the law had been undertaken. There was no dispute that the last such action had occurred in December 2007. Article 40 \u00a7 3 of the Law on Competition did not provide that the limitation period could be suspended or restarted when a case regarding a violation of competition law was transferred to a court or when then a decision of the Competition Council was annulled and the case returned to it for additional investigation.",

The fact that no exceptions to the calculation of the limitation period had been provided meant that the legislature had not meant to provide them. In other words, the aforementioned provision meant that the limitation period had to be calculated in a similar manner in all cases and that it did not depend on the circumstances of the examination of the case by the Competition Council or before the courts. The court also held that fines provided in the Law on Competition fell within the category of economic sanctions. Similar sanctions were provided by the Law on the Control of Tobacco, the Law on the Control of Alcohol, and the Law on Advertising, and they came close to constituting penalties for administrative offences and could even come close to constituting criminal sanctions. The domestic case-law provided that legal norms pertaining to responsibility and sanctions could not be interpreted in a broader sense. The analogy of law in both criminal and administrative law was an exception, and could only be justified if it narrowed the scope of responsibility. If analogy of law was applied in calculating the limitation period to the detriment of an applicant, it would mean that an economic entity could be held responsible otherwise than in accordance with the rules provided explicitly by law. This would be contrary to the principles of legal certainty and the rule of law. A person could only be held responsible if the grounds of responsibility were clearly defined, and all doubts had to be interpreted in his or her favour. These were the general principles, and the court could not negate them.",

Even though there was some case-law indicating that responsibility for violations of the Law on Competition was an administrative responsibility in a broad sense, the general calculation of the limitation period set in the Code of Administrative Offences could not be applied in the area of competition law. The Supreme Administrative Court also held that a speedy reaction after a violation had a greater preventive effect. Moreover, the essence of the limitation period was to ensure that the persons responsible were held liable for certain violations within a specific time-limit set in advance. The substance of the limitation period determined that the court proceedings could not be endless and that the status of an economic entity could not be left unclear for a long period of time. The court then held that the Competition Council had argued that responsibility for breaches of competition law had not been newly ascribed to the economic entities and that the issue of the validity of those economic entities being held so responsible had been additionally assessed. The court, however, held that, irrespective of the course of the investigation, until the adoption of the decision of the Competition Council at issue, there had been no final decision to hold the economic entities responsible. The court disagreed with the Competition Council about the additional assessment of the validity of the economic entities\u2019 responsibility. The court also held that economic entities at issue had been held responsible after the expiry of the limitation period. The court also found that when the Supreme Administrative Court had adopted its decision in June 2009, the Competition Council had still had a possibility to carry out additional investigation and adopt a new decision without missing the limitation period.",

Afterwards, the proceedings before the Competition Council continued (see paragraph 16 above). It is therefore clear that when the Supreme Administrative Court adopted its decision of 13 May 2010, the applicant company could not predict the outcome of the proceedings before the Competition Council and whether it would receive a fine in the end.",

The Court is of the view that requiring the applicant company to apply to the Court on two different dates (after the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 13 May 2010 and the decision of the same court of 21 January 2013) would be to construe the six-month time-limit too inflexibly.",

The Court\u2019s established case-law sets out three criteria to be considered in the assessment of the applicability of the criminal aspect, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7\u00a082, Series A no. 22). The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, in particular, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31, ECHR\u00a02006XIV; Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a039665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2003X; and Blokhin v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a047152/06, \u00a7 179, ECHR 2016).",

Neither the applicant company nor its directors were the subject of a criminal conviction by the Lithuanian courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Valico\u00a0Srl. v. Italy (dec.), no. 70074/01, 21 March 2006). Furthermore, the fine imposed on the applicant company was based on the provisions of the Law on Competition (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above) and not on the provisions of the Criminal Code (see, mutatis mutandis, A. Menarini Diagnostics S.R.L. v. Italy, no. 43509/08, \u00a7 39, 27\u00a0September 2011).

The Government furthermore stated that, taking into account the direct applicability of the legal norms of the European Union, the domestic authorities were obliged to directly apply the rules on the suspension of the limitation period established by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2003 of 16\u00a0December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (Regulation No.\u00a01/2003) (see paragraphs 45 and 47 above).

Moreover, there had been no other cases involving the interpretation of the provision of the Law on Competition at issue; thus, there were no profound and long-standing differences in the case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court. The Government argued that the Lithuanian legal system was organised in such a way as to ensure the uniformity of its case-law. More specifically, only decisions adopted in similar cases could have the power of precedent. Having regard to the different factual circumstances in, respectively, the applicant company\u2019s case and the dairy products case, the necessity to apply the doctrine of court precedents did not arise.

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings (see Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2017 and the cases cited therein). Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court\u2019s decision (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.\u00a0Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7 26, ECHR 1999I). Moreover, it is acceptable under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for national superior courts to dismiss a complaint by mere reference to the relevant legal provisions governing such complaints if the matter raises no fundamentally important legal issue (see Baydar v. the Netherlands, no. 55385/14, \u00a7 46, 24 April 2018).",

The issue of legal certainty raised by the applicant company in respect of two different decisions delivered in two similar cases was only examined before the Supreme Administrative Court in 2013 (see paragraph 19 above). This issue ran parallel to the formation of jurisprudence on the application of limitation periods in cases concerning competition law.

The Court does not find this argument unreasonable or arbitrary.

Nevertheless, in the absence of any consistent jurisprudence regarding the issue in question, the Court finds that the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision was not based on a manifest factual or legal error, resulting in a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d (see Moreira\u00a0Ferreira (No. 2), cited above, \u00a7 85).",

The case-law of the Constitutional Court confirms that while courts are not formally bound to follow any of their previous decisions, it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that they should not depart, without good reason, and proper argumentation, from precedents laid down in previous cases (see paragraphs 33-35 above).
