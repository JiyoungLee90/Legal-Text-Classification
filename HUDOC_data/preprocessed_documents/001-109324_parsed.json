Therefore, the subject matter of the claim was founded on the alleged infringement of rights of a pecuniary nature (see Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 103-107, ECHR 2009....).

It is true that the applicant was responsible for some delays over the entire course of the proceedings. In particular, the Court observes a delay regarding the lodging of an application asking for a hearing date to be set after preliminary decision no. 1923/2001 of the Athens First Instance Civil Court was issued and the lodging of an appeal with the Athens Civil Court of Appeal challenging the First Instance Court\u2019s decisions nos. 1923/2001 and 1299/2004. These delays correspond approximately to four years of the total length of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the Court does not find that it was the applicant\u2019s conduct alone which contributed to the prolonged length of the proceedings. On the contrary, the Court is of the opinion that the actual length of the proceedings, which was more than seven years, - without taking into account the applicant\u2019s delays - remains excessive. In particular, it is noted that the actual duration of the proceedings when the case was pending the second time before the Athens First Instance Civil Court - which lasted approximately three years and six months - was attributable to the national courts. Their handling of the case did not facilitate its timely completion. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the length of the proceedings can be explained by the failure of the domestic courts to deal with the case diligently (see G\u00fcm\u00fc\u00fften v. Turkey, no. 47116/99, \u00a7\u00a7 24-26, 30 November 2004).",
