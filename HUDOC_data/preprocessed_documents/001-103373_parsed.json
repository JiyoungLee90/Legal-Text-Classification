Even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct (see Labita v.  [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2000IV, and Chahal v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p.\u00a01855, \u00a7 79). Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, \u00a7 34, and Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch, \u00a7 34, and Salman, \u00a7 100, both cited above).",

The other police officers \u2013 M., S. and Shch. \u2013 consistently denied, both during the pretrial inquiry and before the trial court, that there had been any recourse to physical force against the applicant.

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. This means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 103 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). They must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7 107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov, cited above, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Further, the investigation must be expeditious. The Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). It has also given consideration to the promptness in opening investigations, delays in taking statements and to the length of time taken for the initial inquiry (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

Russia, no.\u00a032704/04, \u00a7 155, 17 December 2009). The first two decisions refusing the institution of criminal proceedings were identical in their content and extremely limited in scope. The inquiry had been limited to the statements of two arresting officers and two officers from the police station, all of whom denied having used any physical force on the applicant. Neither the applicant's version of events, nor the existing medical evidence were mentioned. No genuine attempt was made to explain the origin of multiple injuries that the forensic expert discovered on the applicant's person. Furthermore, it does not appear that the investigator interviewed him or arranged a confrontation between him and the police officers from the Shatskoye police station who had allegedly been involved in the illtreatment.",

The applicant brought the conflict of interests and lack of independence to the attention of the district prosecutor who, in response, referred him back to the decisions that had already been made by the investigator Mr Bu.",

The  endorsed the District Court's decision in summary fashion, without examining the applicant's arguments in any detail. The Court cannot but note also that the Tula courts did not take any measures to secure the applicant's right to effective participation in the proceedings (compare Denis Vasilyev, cited above, \u00a7 126). He was neither present nor represented before the District and Regional Courts, notwithstanding his explicit request for leave to appear and for the attendance of his representative before the appellate court.
