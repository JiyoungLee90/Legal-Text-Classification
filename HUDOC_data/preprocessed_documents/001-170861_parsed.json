The parties disagreed on the number of trips to which the applicant had been subjected, and official documents contained inconsistent and mutually exclusive information on the number and dates of such trips: the certificate from the prison governor submitted by the applicant contradicted the certificate from the Ministry of the Interior produced by the Government. It can however be established with certainty that the applicant was transported by prison van on at least fifty occasions. On those days he was confined to a solitary cell which appears to have afforded even less personal space than that what was available to the applicants in the above-mentioned cases where a violation of Article 3 was found. Even assuming that the Government\u2019s submission on the duration of the actual travel time was correct, the aggravating impact of the lengthy check-in and check-out procedures cannot be gainsaid. The negative effects of the crammed conditions of transport must have increased in proportion to the time the applicant stayed inside the vehicle.",
