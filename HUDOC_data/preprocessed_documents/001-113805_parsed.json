This approach can be found in cases, such as, Buchholz v. Germany, 6 May 1981, Series A no. 42; Malicka-Wasowska v.\u00a0 (dec.), no. 41413/98, 5 April 2001; and Potas v.

Such an approach has been adopted in the instant case. One may argue that time and resources prevent this Court from conducting a closer scrutiny of every claim and that a summary approach to \u2018length of proceedings\u2019 claims is, therefore, justified.

The case law reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed \u201cin the light of the circumstances of the case\u201d. To my mind, the actual circumstances of a case which takes several years to litigate at national level, cannot, quite frankly, be analysed or appreciated in a few short lines.

All of these realities must be factored in to this Court\u2019s assessment and only where there is an obvious tolerance of unreasonable delays on the part of the State should a violation be found. It also has to be remembered that sometimes it suits a party to litigation to simply \u2018drag his heels\u2019 or to \u2018let matters lie\u2019. I accept that a State is responsible for organising an effective and efficient judicial system.

The complexity of the matter, the conduct of the relevant parties and the importance for the applicant of the issue at stake should be weighed in the balance and considered, carefully. As an international body, this Court should be cautious in declaring that a case heard at national level was not complex. Such a matter is often difficult to assess when far removed from the \u2018cut and thrust\u2019 of litigation. The conduct of the parties should be scrutinized, strictly, and, to my mind, an applicant should, generally, have made at least some effort to advance the proceedings at national level. When it comes to what was \u2018at stake\u2019, the facts, to my mind, should disclose that the delay was such as to bring the matter \u2018within the zone\u2019 of procedural injustice from the applicant\u2019s perspective.
