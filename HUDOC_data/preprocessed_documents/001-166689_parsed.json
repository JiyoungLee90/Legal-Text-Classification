The affirmations in lieu of oaths could not prove that the penal order had not been in the mailbox on 7\u00a0November 2008. The affirming persons had not testified that they had constantly paid special attention to a possible ringing of the doorbell. Furthermore, it could not be ruled out that the applicant had been inattentive when going through the mail because of the presence of guests.

They had the courier who had issued the record of service interviewed about the delivery of the penal order on the applicant. In addition, they had inquired with the local branch of J. company whether any irregularities had become known in respect of the service of the court mail in question, which the latter had answered in the negative. The Court considers that the domestic courts thus examined whether, in the particular case of the applicant, there had been any irregularities and concluded, without that finding disclosing any signs of arbitrariness, that this had not been the case.",

However, the Court is satisfied that the interpretation of domestic law, and in particular of the applicable procedural rules in practice by the domestic courts in the applicant\u2019s case, availed her of a sufficient opportunity to disprove the service of the penal order. The domestic courts, by taking additional evidence, addressed all arguments brought forward by the applicant in this respect. They found in reasoned decisions which do not disclose any arbitrariness that there was not sufficient proof that the penal order had not been served on the applicant in November 2008 as certified by the record of service. As a consequence, the applicant was awarded sufficient opportunity, by lodging an objection against the penal order within the statutory time-limit, to have the charges against her decided again by a court, following a hearing.",
