This is particularly true for the guarantees enshrined in Article\u00a06, in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial with all the guarantees under that Article (ibid., \u00a7 231). The rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal or an application for judicial review are aimed at ensuring the proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty. That being so, the rules in question, or their application, should not prevent litigants from using an available remedy (see Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7\u00a051, ECHR 2002IX). The Court recalls that \u201cexcessive formalism\u201d can run counter to the requirement of securing a practical and effective right of access to a court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This usually occurs in cases of a particularly strict construction of a procedural rule, preventing an applicant\u2019s action being examined on the merits, with the attendant risk that his or her right to the effective protection of the courts would be infringed (see Zubac v. Croatia [GC], no. 40160/12, \u00a7\u00a7 97-99, 5\u00a0April 2018).",

Next, it should be ascertained whether, in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the case, there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between that aim and the means employed to attain it. The Court has already examined a similar case where an appeal lodged by an applicant was rejected for failure to submit a second copy thereof (see Parol, cited above, \u00a7\u00a739-49). In that case a violation was found because, on the one hand, the applicant had not been informed of the obligation to lodge an appeal in several copies, and, on the other, he had displayed the diligence normally required from a party to civil proceedings; he had requested from the domestic court a copy of his original appeal and, when his request was not responded to, he submitted to the court a handwritten copy of his original appeal. By contrast, in the present case, even though the applicant had received, on 28 August 2012, general information that all pleadings should be submitted to the court in two copies, he lodged his appeal in one copy only. Subsequently, he informed the court that he had been unable to comply with the order (see paragraph\u00a019 above). He failed, however, to take any further steps. In particular, he did not make any attempt to submit to the court even a handwritten copy of his original appeal. Taking into account all the circumstances of the present case, especially the instruction of 28\u00a0August 2012, the Court is of the opinion that it was not unreasonable to expect the applicant also to lodge his appeal in two copies (see Berecki v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 46366/12, 3 May 2016). At the same time it considers that the applicant failed to display the diligence normally expected from a party to civil proceedings. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court finds that the requirement in issue did not appear to amount to a disproportionate hindrance impairing the very essence of the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court as guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It follows that the applicant\u2019s access to a court was not unduly restricted in the present case.",

That remedy was also available to the applicant. The applicant attempted to use that remedy, but his appeal against the firstinstance judgment was rejected for procedural shortcomings (see paragraph\u00a020 above). Since, as found above, the rejection of the applicant\u2019s appeal did not constitute a disproportionate restriction of the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court (see paragraph 39 above), the Court concludes that the applicant failed to use the available effective domestic remedy in accordance with procedural requirements because of his own procedural mistake and his lack of required diligence in the defence of his interests.",
