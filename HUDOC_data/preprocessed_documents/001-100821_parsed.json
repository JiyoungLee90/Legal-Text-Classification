First, they pointed out that Khamzat Merzhoyev had been detained by a large group of armed men, wearing camouflage uniforms, who had spoken Russian without any accent. During the same night seven other men from the village had been detained in identical circumstances and taken to the outskirts of the village in military vehicles; these men had had their identity documents checked and had been asked questions about their alleged involvement with illegal armed groups. The applicants stressed that the authorities had taken no steps whatsoever to identify the persons who had carried out the arrests and questioning. Moreover, the intruders had arrived late at night, which indicated that they had been able to circulate freely during the curfew and to pass through military roadblocks.

The applicants questioned the evidential value of the testimonies of twenty-one residents of Katyr-Yurt submitted by the Government, since these persons had lived too far from their house and could not have witnessed the abduction. They also pointed out that the transcripts revealed the very superficial nature of the questioning and raised doubts as to their authenticity, since ten witnesses had signed the same printed statement reproduced verbatim.

They further contended that the investigation into the incident was still pending, that there was no evidence that the men had been State agents and that there were therefore no grounds for holding the State liable for the alleged violations of the applicants' rights. They relied on several points. First, even though the applicants submitted that Mr Merzhoyev had taken part in the hostilities against the federal authorities in 1994-1995 and thus could have been targeted by the Russian law-enforcement agencies, no such information had been obtained by the investigation, either from the State authorities or from his neighbours. Second, the Government disputed the applicants' reference to witness statements about the involvement of military vehicles such as APCs in the abduction. They argued that the noise of APCs was very specific and would have been heard by many people, especially at night and in a rural area. However, none of the witnesses had stated that they had heard the noise of APCs' engines. Third, the head of the village administration, Mr\u00a0A.E., had not stated that he had heard either the noise of military vehicles or the shots allegedly fired by the abductors near the office of the local administration on the night in question. He had only learnt of the events from the relatives of the detained men. Next, the Government argued that the registration logs of the roadblocks situated at the exit of Katyr-Yurt had not noted any movement of military or law-enforcement vehicles between 22 and 24 November 2003. Furthermore, the Government argued that the other men who had been detained by unknown persons in Katyr-Yurt on the same night and later released had stated in their testimonies that they had been transported inside UAZ or Ural vehicles where there were no other detainees. None of them had seen Khamzat Merzhoyev. Therefore, there were no grounds to suggest that he had been detained by the same persons as the other villagers. Finally, the Government insisted that, according to their submissions to the investigation, neither the head of the administration nor the serviceman of the ROVD, Mr M.Ch., had been aware of the whereabouts of Khamzat Merzhoyev after the latter's abduction, contrary to the applicants' statements.",

Mr I.Sh. had been in the house opposite the applicant's house. He had observed the events from his window and heard the sound of military vehicles, including the APC. He also testified that the group of armed men had first entered the houses of two other villagers, Mr A.D. and M.Sh., and broken down their front doors. These two men had not been questioned by the domestic investigation. Mr A.Z. lived at the end of the village, near the river. On the night of 12 May 2002 he had clearly heard the noise of an APC engine which he could recognise and which had come from the river bed, from the side where the Russian military unit was located.

The Government also concluded from the statements of Mrs A.M. that the behaviour of the intruders who had burst the light bulbs before entering the applicant's house was more likely to be that of criminals than of the security forces.

In any event, the Court notes that no other elements underlying the applicant's submissions as to the fact of her son's detention and subsequent disappearance have been disputed by the Government. The circumstances of the event are sufficiently established through the eyewitness statements collected by the domestic investigation and by the applicant.",

In particular, the Court finds that Ali Gastamirov was detained at his home by a group of several persons, wearing camouflage uniforms and armed with automatic weapons, who used military vehicles, such as APCs. They moved freely during curfew hours in the vicinity of the Russian military unit. In their applications to the authorities the applicants consistently maintained that Ali Gastamirov had been detained by unknown servicemen and requested the investigation to look into that possibility. The domestic investigation also accepted factual assumptions as presented by the applicants and took steps to check whether law-enforcement agencies had been involved in the kidnapping. The investigation was unable to establish which precise military or security units had carried out the operation, but it does not appear that any serious steps were taken to that end. Finally, the Court notes the striking similarity between the two disappearances forming the subject of the present judgment, both of which occurred on the same street in the same village, although separated by eighteen months. The Court finds that this similarity not only must have come to the attention of the investigation into the two events, but also has a bearing on the credibility of the seventh applicant's allegation that her son had been detained by unknown servicemen during an unacknowledged security operation.",

This delay in itself was liable to affect the investigation of a crime such as abduction in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first few days after the event. It also appears that within the following days some of the applicants' neighbours were questioned and the scene of the crime inspected. The first applicant's brother was granted victim status on 11 December 2003. However, it appears that after that a number of crucial steps were delayed. In particular, the Court notes that the testimonies of other men who had been detained, questioned and released in Katyr-Yurt on the same night were collected in May 2004. The head of the local administration was also questioned in May 2004. It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. These delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

The Government argued that the first six applicants could have sought judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of the exhaustion of domestic remedies. However, the Court notes that the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. Nor were the applicants properly informed of the progress of the proceedings. Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times owing to the need to take additional investigative\u00a0steps. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants' allegations properly. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court similar decisions of the district prosecutor's office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",

It did not appear that anyone else had been questioned before 2006. The investigators had not taken any other urgent steps, such as collecting fingerprints, following the footsteps of the intruders and noting the tracks left by the military vehicles. The investigation had not identified the military units in the district which could have had access to APCs and UAZ vehicles and had not questioned anyone responsible for driving and registering them. The seventh applicant noted that as followed from the documents submitted by the Government, the investigation had considered only one version of the events, namely that her son had been detained by the authorities; however, no one from the military commander's office or from the military unit located near the village had been questioned about the events. As to the statements submitted by the Government, the applicant stressed that out of the six witnesses, three lived too far from her house to have been able to witness the events, one had been away from Katyr-Yurt at the material time and one witness had not lived at the indicated address (see paragraph 169 above). She argued that the fact that the investigation had been pending for such a long period of time without producing any known results had been further proof of its ineffectiveness. She invited the Court to draw conclusions from the Government's unjustified failure to disclose the documents from the case file.",

They argued that the proceedings had been opened on the day of the notification of the crime; that the applicant and other key witnesses had been questioned without delay; and that the applicant's husband had been immediately granted victim status. Over thirty witnesses had been questioned in the course of the investigation, including eyewitnesses and one serviceman of the ROVD; and numerous requests for information had been sent to various law-enforcement authorities. The investigation had looked into all possible versions of the disappearance, including the one advanced by the applicant. The seventh applicant had had every opportunity to participate effectively in the proceedings. The Government stressed, in particular, that even though she had no procedural status in the criminal investigation, she had been kept informed of the relevant developments and in March 2008 she had been allowed access to the case file by the court (see paragraph 152 above).",

First, there were delays in taking important investigation steps. While the applicant, her husband and their daughter-in-law testified in May 2002, other witnesses, it appears, were not questioned until 2006 and 2008. It also does not appear that any requests for information about Ali Gastamirov's possible whereabouts were sent prior to 2005. Second, the investigation did not take the most basic procedural steps in order to secure the available evidence, such as drawing up a report at the site of the crime, collecting fingerprints, and noting footprints and tracks left by vehicles, despite the clear reference in the statements collected by the investigation on 13 May 2002 (see paragraphs 132-133 above). It appears that some of the eyewitnesses to the detention, such as Mrs E.Z. and the applicant's immediate neighbours, were never questioned. The Court also notes that even though the applicant's husband had been granted victim status in the investigation, he and the applicant were only informed of the suspension and resumption of the proceedings, and not of any other significant developments. Accordingly, the investigators failed to ensure that the investigation received the required level of public scrutiny, or to safeguard the interests of the next of kin in the proceedings.",
