Thus, the period from 16 December 2005 to 22 September 2006 cannot be attributed to the State. As regards the delays caused by the applicant\u2019s alleged failure to return some documents to the case file after the hearing of 22 February 2008 (see paragraph 15 above), the documents submitted before this Court do not allow it to conclude that these delays were wholly imputable to the applicant. It appears that this situation emerged from a miscommunication between the applicant and the Administrative District Court and was followed by some obstacles encountered by the Administrative District Court to reobtain those documents. Finally, whilst some ancillary proceedings initiated by the applicant might have slightly prolonged the proceedings, the applicant cannot be blamed for making use of the remedies available to him under domestic law (see G\u00fcrkan v. Turkey, no. 1154/04, \u00a7\u00a028, 29 March 2011).",

Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The applicant\u2019s failure to act expeditiously and any delay imputable to him as a result of the above miscommunication as regards the documents from the file cannot justify the overall duration of proceedings which related to a relatively simple issue and was mainly due to delays in the examination of the case by the State authorities.
