The extent to which this duty applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 \u00a7 1, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Gorou v.\u00a0 (no. 2) [GC], no. 12686/03, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2009...).",
