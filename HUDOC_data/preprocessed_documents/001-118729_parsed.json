Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place.

In view of the applicant\u2019s repeated requests for the witnesses\u2019 presence in court to be secured and his objection to the termination of the trial as long as the witnesses had not been questioned, the Court cannot find that he may be regarded as having unequivocally waived his right to have them questioned (see, for similar reasoning, Makeyev v. , no. 13769/04, \u00a7 37, 5\u00a0February 2009; and, by contrast, Andandonskiy v. , no. 24015/02, \u00a7\u00a054, 28 September 2006).",

However, the efforts made by the bailiffs to comply with the trial courts\u2019 orders appear to have been insufficient. Thus, during the bailiffs\u2019 visit of 22\u00a0January 2003 it became clear that Mr\u00a0O. no longer lived at the address provided during the preliminary investigation. The Court finds it peculiar that after that date the bailiffs visited that address four more times, being informed each time by the new occupants of the flat that Mr O. had moved out long before. No other measures were taken by the bailiffs in order to establish Mr O.\u2019s new address or the address of his employer, even though they had been told by his mother that he lived and worked in . As regards Mr M., his address was known to the bailiffs, as his mother had informed them that he lived on the university campus. The bailiffs visited the campus once and, finding that Mr M. was not at home, left the summons to attend court with the campus guard. No other attempts to contact Mr M. were made. Finally, as regards , who was on a business trip to another region, the bailiffs did not make any attempt to inquire with his employer about the destination and the length of the business trip, or ask for his contact details.",

Moreover, and regard being had to the circumstances of the case, the Court has serious doubts that the decision of the domestic courts to dispense with the questioning of those witnesses and to rely on their statements given at the pre-trial stage can be said to have been justified. It considers that the domestic courts\u2019 review of the bailiffs\u2019 assertions that the witnesses could not be located was superficial and uncritical. The courts did not look at the specific circumstances in respect of each witness and they failed to examine whether the measures taken by the bailiffs to obtain the appearance of the witnesses had been adequate and sufficient, or whether there was an alternative means of ensuring that they gave evidence in person. While it is not unmindful of the difficulties encountered by the authorities in terms of resources, the Court does not consider that tracking down the witnesses in question for the purpose of calling them to attend the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and risked up to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 29 above), can have constituted an insuperable obstacle (see Bonev v.

It does not appear from the materials in the case file \u2013 nor has it been argued by the Government \u2013 that the applicant had the opportunity to cross-examine Mr\u00a0O., Mr M. or  before the trial. The applicant was not provided with an opportunity to scrutinise the witnesses\u2019 questioning by the investigator, nor was he then or later provided with the opportunity to have his own questions put to them. Furthermore, as the witnesses\u2019 statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the judges were able to observe their demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of their reliability (see, for similar reasoning, Makeyev, cited above, \u00a7 42).",
