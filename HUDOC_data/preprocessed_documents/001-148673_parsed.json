Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable, or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed, the rights of the defence would be respected, there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair.

Where there was a legitimate argument that the absent witness evidence was unconvincing and important to the case, the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe. This involved assessing the reliability of the impugned evidence, its place in the evidence as a whole, the issues in the case as they had emerged, and all the other individual circumstances of the case.

As is clear, the right to confrontation is a longstanding requirement of the common law and recognised in Article 6(3)(d).

The witness must be given all possible support, but also made to understand the importance of the citizen\u2019s duty, and indeed that the violent and intimidatory will only flourish the more if that duty is not done, whilst they will normally back down in the face of determination that it be performed. For this reason it is of especial importance that assurances are never given to potential witnesses that their evidence will be read. Unless the defendant consents, it is only the court applying the strict conditions of the [2003 Act] based on evidence that can admit such a statement. Any indication, let alone an assurance, can only give rise to an expectation that this will indeed happen, when if it does the impact of the evidence will be diminished and the disadvantage to the accused may result in it not being given at all.",

In the case before us of Marquis and Graham ... the Judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down, although relocated, and killed. Although notorious, that incident was an extreme and very unusual case. The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness. Whilst the [2003 Act] requires fear to be construed broadly, it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury. If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness, as will often be the case, it may not be admitted. If it is admitted and central to the case, there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the Judge may have to rule under s.125 that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe.\u201d",

Referring to the counterbalancing measures relied on by the Government, the applicants argued that the statement of P.R. was not, in any sense, demonstrably reliable in relation to the central issue at trial, namely the participation of the applicants in the attack. P.R. was a registered alcoholic who admitted to having drunk a significant amount of alcohol on the night in question and to having a vague memory; none of the descriptions he gave fitted Mr Blackmore; X. gave evidence that P.R. could not really remember who had attacked him; P.R. did not name the applicants to any other person to whom he spoke; and the medical notes indicated that P.R. was confused and forgetful at times. That being the case, the factors and safeguards to which the Government referred were not capable of compensating for the disadvantage suffered by the applicants in being unable to cross-examine P.R. and, in particular, to explore the extent to which he was confused in his recollection, the extent to which his account was corrupted by information provided to him prior to the making of his statement three weeks after the night in question and his relationship with M. in the light of the statement of his neighbour,\u00a0J.",

The applicants accepted that H.M. was in fear and that it was not necessary for her fear to be attributable to the applicants for there to be a good reason for her nonattendance. However, in this case it was clear from the evidence that H.M. had become unwilling to give evidence as a result of what was said to her by police officers and the question arose whether such fear constituted a good reason for non-attendance. Relying, inter alia, on the comments of the Court of Appeal, they argued that the conduct of the officers fell below the standards expected of them (see paragraph 68 above). The State, and not they, should bear the consequences of such unprofessionalism. Referring to the trial judge\u2019s ruling on 13 May 2008 (see paragraph 51 above), the applicants claimed that it was indisputable that but for the unprofessionalism of the officers H.M. would not have refused to attend. They submitted that there had been a violation of Article 6, since there was no good reason for the absence of a key witness. In the alternative, they argued that the fact that H.M.\u2019s fear was attributable to the police should weigh heavily in the balance when deciding on the admissibility of the evidence.",

In the applicants\u2019 case, although proper jury directions had been given by the trial judge, this could not compensate for the loss of the opportunity for the jury to see and hear a witness who, if she was telling the truth, was giving evidence about a serious and traumatic incident. Her demeanour, as well as her oral evidence, was crucial to the assessment to be made of her by the jury. In particular, the applicants pointed to the following aspects which they claimed provided strong support for the need for cross-examination of whether there had been a kidnap: first, G.P. told the police that H.M. was being held at a particular address when she was not and in circumstances where he had no reason to believe she was; and second, according to H.M.\u2019s account she was released with no money being paid. The applicants submitted that the unfairness was exacerbated by the trial judge\u2019s refusal to permit to be adduced by the defence the evidence of G.P. that the voice he heard using the \u201cMarquis phone\u201d during the kidnap was not Mr Marquis (see paragraphs 47 and 54 above).",

Further, even if the phone in Mr Marquis\u2019 possession at the time of arrest was H.M.\u2019s phone, all that showed was that he had come into possession of it by the time of arrest. It established neither that there had been a kidnap nor that he had participated in it. The presence of lukewarm water in the bath was irrelevant since such circumstances were not uncommon and it could have easily been contrived if the kidnap was an insurance scam.

Although the Court of Appeal had said that the statement of P.R. was \u201cto a decisive degree\u201d the basis of the convictions, it had also said that there was substantial evidence independent of P.R. (see paragraphs 70-71 above). It would be wrong to adopt the Court of Appeal\u2019s \u201cdecisive\u201d conclusion without scrutiny, since this was before the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment AlKhawaja and Tahery. According to the modified test, the evidence had to be determinative of the outcome. Where there was corroborating evidence, the statement was less likely to be decisive. In the present case, there was medical evidence and direct eye witness evidence that P.R. was the victim of a brutal attack on the night in question. Important concessions had been made by Mr Horncastle and Mr Blackmore. They admitted drinking with D.; that D. had been burgled; that D. had asked them for help to recover his property; and that they had gone with D. to P.R.\u2019s flat. They did not claim that anyone else had been with them (see paragraphs 14-15 and 21 above). There was scientific evidence that the attack had commenced at the entrance to the flat; it would therefore have been visible to anyone at the entrance (see paragraph 20 above). As the Court of Appeal said, there was an \u201cinescapable inference\u201d that Mr Horncastle had been present during the violence (see paragraph 70 above). The account that Mr Horncastle had given in evidence had been shown to be untruthful since blood had been found on the television (see paragraph 20 above). In his police interview Mr\u00a0Blackmore had admitted that he stepped over a man covered in blood (see paragraph 15 above). The Court of Appeal found that he must have been present when the violence began (see paragraph 70 above). Finally, although the defence had tried to implicate M. as the perpetrator of the attack, there was evidence that M. had been a friend of P.R. and that the latter had shown no fear of him after the attack (see paragraph 20 above).",

In making this assessment, the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses. Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 118).",

First, it has to be established that there was a good reason for the non-attendance of the witness. Second, even where there was a good reason, where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive extent on statements made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine, the rights of the defence might be restricted to an extent incompatible with the guarantees of Article 6. Accordingly, when the evidence of an absent witness is the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, sufficient counterbalancing factors are required, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, which permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 147).",

Where absence is the result of fear, a distinction can be drawn between fear attributable to threats or other actions of the defendant or those acting on his behalf and fear attributable to a more general fear of what will happen if the witness gives evidence at trial. In the former case, it is appropriate to allow a statement of that witness to be introduced at trial even if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant, because to allow the defendant to benefit from the fear he has engendered in witnesses would be incompatible with the rights of victims and witnesses. As to the latter, there is no requirement that a witness\u2019s fear be attributable directly to threats made by the defendant in order for that witness to be excused from giving evidence at trial. This does not mean, however, that any subjective fear of the witness will suffice. The trial court must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine, first, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, second, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence. In all cases, where no prior examination of the witness has taken place, the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort. The trial court must be satisfied that all available alternatives, such as witness anonymity and other special measures, would be inappropriate or impracticable (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 122-125).",

The Court of Appeal identified substantial evidence independent of P.R.\u2019s statement (see paragraph 70 above).

The safeguards contained in the 2003 Act and in section 78 PACE were applied appropriately. In particular, the trial judge considered a challenge under section 78 to the admissibility of P.R.\u2019s statement before it was read and provided detailed reasons for his refusal to uphold the challenge (see paragraphs 17-18 above). He identified the need for directions to the jury as to the weight to be given to the statement. In due course, careful directions were given to the jury by the trial judge in his summing-up, warning them of the need to approach the statement with care and identifying the various restrictions on the defence which resulted from P.R.\u2019s absence at trial (see paragraph 26 above). They would have left the jury in no doubt as to the limitations of P.R.\u2019s testimony and the extent to which they could rely on it. The applicants did not argue that the jury had been misdirected on this matter. It should also be noted that P.R.\u2019s identity, anonymised for the purposes of the present decision, was known to the applicants. They could, and did, lead evidence to challenge the reliability of the statement and P.R.\u2019s credibility. Full details of P.R.\u2019s hospital stay was disclosed to them, and they attacked P.R.\u2019s statement by reference to his admitted alcoholism, his drinking on the day in question and his subsequent admission that his memory was \u201cvague\u201d (see paragraph 17 above). The various elements of P.R.\u2019s statement were corroborated by the independent evidence in the case, including the applicants\u2019 admission that they, along with D., attended P.R.\u2019s flat, to recover items stolen in a burglary and the scientific evidence (see paragraphs 20 and 70 above). The defence did not make an application under section 125 of the 2003 Act for the prosecution to be stopped on the basis that the hearsay evidence was so unconvincing that any conviction would be unsafe (see paragraph 98 above). Further, the applicants were able to put forward their defence that M. was the perpetrator and were given permission to introduce into evidence details of M.\u2019s previous convictions (see paragraph 24 above).",

He had no doubt that H.M.\u2019s kidnap left her in fear for her safety. Her experience led her to believe that her assailants were \u201cvery dangerous people\u201d (see paragraph 44 above). She claimed that they threatened her with a knife and punched her in the back of her head and that she had heard them say that they would cut off her fingers and toes if they did not get money (see paragraphs 30-31 above). In his ruling on the admissibility of H.M.\u2019s statement, the judge said that she was clearly \u201cpetrified, genuinely in distress\u201d (see paragraph 50 above). The fact that she would rather risk imprisonment than testify at the trial was considered by the judge to demonstrate the level of her fear (see paragraph 51 above). The judge\u2019s refusal to admit the written statement of G.P. because he was not satisfied that G.P.\u2019s absence at trial was due to fear demonstrates the care and diligence with which the judge approached his task (see paragraph 53 above).",

As the Court of Appeal pointed out, potential witnesses should not be given assurances that their evidence will be read out (see paragraph 68 above). However, there is no evidence that any such assurances were given to H.M. The trial judge found no bad faith on the part of the police and noted H.M.\u2019s explanations that her being \u201cmore\u201d scared as a result of the police advice was \u201con top of her own fears\u201d (see paragraphs 51-52 above).",

She was warned of the serious consequences of failing to attend, which included the possible imposition of a prison sentence of up to two years. The police explained to her the availability of special measures to facilitate the giving of her evidence at trial (see paragraph 46 above). When the judge ruled her written statement to be admissible, her whereabouts were not known since she had fled some days earlier (see paragraph 48 above).",

It is significant that the Court of Appeal did not consider that the applicants\u2019 conviction rested on the evidence of H.M. to a decisive extent (see paragraph 78 above). It listed the extensive independent evidence in the case. That evidence included undisputed CCTV footage putting Mr\u00a0Graham, together with other masked men, outside H.M.\u2019s home at the time of the kidnapping and undisputed telephone record data showing calls from the victim\u2019s phone and from the phone of Mr Marquis to G.P., the victim\u2019s partner, on the night of the kidnapping (see paragraphs 38 and 77-78 above). There was evidence that Mr Graham had been identified in CCTV footage and subsequently arrested in G.P.\u2019s car, stolen during the kidnapping, and that a knife was recovered from the car (see paragraph 33, 38 and 77 above). Evidence was led that the two applicants had checked into a hotel on the night of the kidnapping with the stolen car in their possession (see paragraphs 39 and 41 above). There was other witness evidence, including from the victim\u2019s father as to H.M.\u2019s distress following the kidnapping and from the police officer who heard the ransom demands (see paragraphs 5758 and 78 above). It is significant that the statement of H.M. provided no evidence whatsoever as to the identity of her kidnappers: the applicants were linked to the crime by evidence wholly independent of H.M. (see paragraph 78 above). As the Court of Appeal pointed out, the only matter proved by H.M.\u2019s statement was that she had been kidnapped (see paragraph 78 above), and there was sufficient evidence of that from other witnesses including her father and the police officer who had listened to the ransom calls. It is also noteworthy that while Mr Graham sought to advance the defence that the kidnapping was part of an insurance fraud, he provided no evidence to support that allegation (see paragraph 60 above).",

Her statement was therefore neither the sole nor the decisive basis of the applicants\u2019 convictions. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to examine whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors which permitted a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of the statement (compare and contrast Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 154-155 and 160-161).",
