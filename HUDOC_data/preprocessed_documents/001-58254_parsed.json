The measure had been imposed some six months after the daughter\u2019s birth, during which period the mother had had access to her twice a week. The judgment stressed that taking a child into care should normally be regarded as a temporary measure to be discontinued as soon as circumstances permitted and that any measures of implementation of temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parent and the child. It considered the measures particularly far-reaching in that they totally deprived the applicant of her family life with the child and were inconsistent with the aim of reuniting them. Such measures could only be applied in exceptional circumstances and could only be justified if they were motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests (see paragraph\u00a078 of the Johansen judgment).",

While it is true that the adoption in the present case, like the contested measures in the Johansen case, had the legal effect of totally depriving the applicant of family life with his daughter, the context differs significantly. It does not concern the severance of links between a mother and a child taken into public care but, rather, of links between a natural father and a child who had been in the care of her mother since she was born. Nor does it concern a parent who had had custody of the child or who in any other capacity had assumed the care of the child. Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s view, it is inappropriate in the present case to apply the approach employed in the Johansen judgment.",

Admittedly, this state of affairs was to a certain extent due to the fact that the child\u2019s mother was opposed to contacts. Another factor was the applicant\u2019s own personal problems (see paragraphs\u00a07, 10\u201311 above). However, while it appears that those problems were solved by the end of 1984, it was not until June 1987, when the child was four years and nine months, that the applicant sought the assistance of the social authorities for arranging access.

He had taken part in the care of M., who regarded him as her father (see paragraph\u00a014 above). Thus, when the adoption was granted by the District Court in December 1989, de facto family ties had existed between the mother and the adoptive father for five and a half years, until they married in January 1989, and between him and M. for six and a half years. The adoption consolidated and formalised those ties (see paragraph\u00a014 above). In taking the measure the District Court had regard not only to the investigation carried out by the Social Council but also to the evidence given by the applicant and the adoptive father at a hearing (cf. the above-mentioned Keegan judgment, pp.\u00a020\u201321, \u00a7\u00a055) and was thus in a better position than the European judges in striking a fair balance between the competing interests involved.
