Personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed unless there is evidence to the contrary. Secondly, the tribunal must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubts in this respect. In other words, under the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge\u2019s personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his impartiality. Accordingly, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see, among many other examples, Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 1\u00a0October 1982, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a053, \u00a7\u00a030; Hauschildt v.
