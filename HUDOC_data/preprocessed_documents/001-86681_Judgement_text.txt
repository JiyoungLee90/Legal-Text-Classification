Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Jelenia Góra.
On 10 June 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 12 June 1999 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody.

On 2 September 1999 the  (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 30 September 1999. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. The court made reference to the measures already taken in the investigation and indicated, in detail, the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was necessary to extend the applicant’s detention. The court also referred to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case.
On 28 September 1999 the  extended the applicant’s detention until 10 December 1999. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.
On 7 December 1999 the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention until 31 December 1999. On 28 December 1999 it extended that period until 15 January 2000. It emphasised that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid.
On 14 January 2000 the  extended the applicant’s detention until 30 June 2000. It repeated the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions and added that further detention would not be excessively burdensome for the applicant or his family.

On 21 May 2001 the  applied under Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings to the Wrocław Court of Appeal for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond the statutory time-limit of two years. On 29 May 2001 the Wrocław Court of Appeal granted the request and extended the applicant’s detention until 20 September 2001. It held that there was a strong suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and that the nature of the offences justified the continuation of his detention. In addition, it stressed that the case was particularly complex.
On 20 September 2001 the Wrocław Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 November 2001. It repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.

On 5 March 2004 the Wrocław Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the . The court stated that the failure to call and hear evidence from six eyewitnesses,  nationals, had been a serious shortcoming justifying a retrial. The trial court had not made efforts to secure their presence at the hearing or to make use of a rogatory letter in order to have them heard as witnesses by the  authorities. Furthermore, as regards the anonymous witness, the court of first instance had failed to make efforts to secure his presence at the hearing. The court had not made sufficient inquiries about his whereabouts.
On 1 April and 23 September 2004 and 24 March 2005 the Wrocław Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. It referred to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and found that holding him in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.
During the proceedings the applicant made repeated unsuccessful applications for release. He also appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against refusals to release him and decisions extending his detention.
At a hearing held on 1 March 2005 the  decided to send a rogatory letter to the relevant Belarusian court, asking it to take evidence from six eyewitnesses. The applicant’s lawyer prepared questions in writing to be put to them on the applicant’s behalf. The court in  heard evidence from three witnesses, because, despite the efforts of the authorities, it was impossible for them to establish the current addresses of the remaining witnesses. The records of evidence taken from those witnesses during the investigation were read out by the trial court.

On 28 September 2006 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It considered that the facts of the case had been duly established and the rules of criminal procedure, as well as guarantees of a fair trial, had been respected. As regards evidence from the anonymous witness, despite the authorities’ efforts, the court could not secure his presence at the hearing. Consequently, it was necessary to take into account evidence given by him in the investigation.
The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On 19 December 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v.
