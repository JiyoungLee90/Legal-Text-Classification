He later introduced the same claim separately with the civil court (the Galytskyy court). Although the criminal court (the Yavoriv court) held that the compensation claim had been lodged not in accordance with Ukrainian law and the applicant did not appeal in cassation against that decision, the Court is satisfied that the criminal proceedings were decisive for the applicant\u2019s civil right for compensation and they, accordingly, fall within the ambit of Article\u00a06 of the Convention. Thus, the findings of the criminal court as to the fact that K. had intentionally inflicted bodily injuries on the applicant were a precondition for the outcome of the proceedings before the civil court, which did not consider that aspect of the case afresh. Therefore, both sets of proceedings were closely linked, if not strictly interdependent, and the Court considers that it would be inappropriate to separate these proceedings and to assess their length in isolation (see the Perez case cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 70-72, and, a\u00a0contrario, Serdyuk v. , no.\u00a015002/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-28, 20\u00a0September\u00a02007).",

Consequently, the mere fact that the proceedings were formally suspended does not exclude the intervals at issue from the overall duration of the proceedings, the reasonableness of which the Court will consider (see Dulskiy v. , no.\u00a061679/00, \u00a7\u00a071, 1\u00a0June\u00a02006).",
