The applicant\u2019s detention on remand thus lasted two years, three months and ten days. After the investigation was completed, the authorities decided that a requirement to pay bail would secure his attendance at the trial and released him. The applicant remained at liberty for approximately one year. Any complaint in respect of this period of detention should have been brought within six months of his release (see Idalov v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a05826/03, \u00a7\u00a0134, 22\u00a0May 2012).",
