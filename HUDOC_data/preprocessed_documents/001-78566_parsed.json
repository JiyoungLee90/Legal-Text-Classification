The appellate court agreed with the District Court that the need to take evidence from nineteen witnesses could justify the extension of the applicant's detention. At the same time, the Court of Appeal pointed out that the proceedings before the trial court were slowmoving and that the conduct of the proceedings by the trial court \u201cdid not contribute to their termination within the proper time\u201d. In this connection, the appellate court noted that only nine hearings had taken place within the first year of the proceedings and that the proceedings had begun in fact on 15\u00a0November 2001. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal observed that already in December 2001 and January 2002 some of the witnesses had informed the trial court that they could not attend hearings before it and had asked that they be heard by other courts at the request of the Wroc\u0142aw District Court. The delay in taking a decision concerning these requests was difficult to understand. Finally, the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal stated that the applicant's detention would be extended only until 28 July 2002 because a period of four months should be sufficient to allow the trial court to conclude the proceedings.",
