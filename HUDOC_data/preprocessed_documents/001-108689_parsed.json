On day two it was the turn of the court experts and C to give evidence. However, the girl was spared the ordeal of appearing before the . Now aged twelve, she gave her evidence on film during the preliminary proceedings. \u2018How far away are they, those bad people?\u2019 C had asked at the time, before describing her ordeal. The video footage shown to the jury lasted one hour. The public was prohibited from watching. C\u2019s lawyer, E.P., had requested that they be excluded. \u2018The girl was so frightened of giving evidence. She made her statements on the understanding that they would be treated with discretion. Her sense of modesty, integrity and trust would be damaged again if her statements were to reach the media.\u2019 The request was granted. According to forensic medical expert C.R., a plugged-in iron had been placed on the girl\u2019s upper body \u2018at least six times\u2019, \u2018not just gliding over it, but held in one place\u2019. The 10-year-old had third-degree burns, including burn wounds around her genitals, when she was taken to hospital by her father in December 2003. In addition she had a fractured skull, multiple broken ribs and a cut which went down almost to the bone. The abuse perpetrated against \u2018torture victim C\u2019 (the words of forensic child psychologist A.G.) will have lasting psychosexual effects. A.G. believes that the girl\u2019s experiences will resurface as soon as she begins to have contact with the opposite sex. But \u2018even now the child undoubtedly receives daily reminders of what happened, for instance in the form of nightmares. C\u2019s lawyer requested the court to award the girl 100,000 euros in compensation and 25,000 euros for the cost of a transplant. \u2018No civil proceedings will be conducted in this case, in order to spare C further examination\u2019. The jury\u2019s verdict was swift: fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the accused \u2013 the maximum sentence. C was awarded the 125,000 euros. \u2018You destroyed this child. You deserve the maximum sentence\u2019 said Judge J.J. C\u2019s father lodged an appeal immediately, while his wife asked for time to consider.\u201d",

In the present case such a genuine interest in the identity of the victim could not be established. There was no predominant public interest in revealing the identity of the offenders as the public could have been informed on the psychological dynamics of violent crimes and sexual abuse committed within the family without revealing the identity of the victim. The reporting also did not serve the purpose of warning and protecting the public (Warn- und Schutzfunktion) because the accused had already been taken into detention and there was no indication that they had assaulted other minors.",

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet\u00a0Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

By reason of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d inherent in the exercise of freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Fressoz\u00a0and Roire v.

Another important factor is whether articles or photos in the press contributed to a debate of general interest (see Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Eerik\u00e4inen and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66).",

However, given that neither the offenders nor the victim were public figures or had previously entered the public sphere, it cannot be said that the knowledge of the identity of these persons was material for understanding the particulars of the case (see \u201cWirtschafts-Trend\u201d Zeitschriften-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH (no. 2) v.

In this connection the Court refers to Article 31 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, which obliges the Contracting States \u201cto take the necessary legislative or other measures to protect the rights and interests of victims, by protecting their ... identity and ... by taking measures in accordance with international law to prevent the public dissemination of any information that could lead to their identification. The same concept of protecting the identity of victims of crime has also been recognised in various recommendations adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (see Recommendations Rec(85)11, Rec(2001)16 and Rec(2003)13, quoted in \u00a7\u00a7 24-26 above) as well as in the Court\u2019s case-law on Articles\u00a08 and 10 of the Convention (see Egeland and Hanseid, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61, and A. v.

The amount of compensation, EUR 10,000 for two articles published, even though substantial, appears reasonable taking into account the length of the articles, their contents which, on account of the details given, constituted a particularly serious interference, and the particular impact it must have had on C, who, following the detailed reports in the press on the trial of A and B, had a relapse and began suffering from severe psychological problems again, making it necessary for her to be re-admitted to hospital.",
