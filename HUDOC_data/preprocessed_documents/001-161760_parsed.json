Time starts to run the day following the date on which the final decision has been pronounced orally in public, or on which the applicant or his representative were informed thereof, and expires six calendar months later, regardless of the actual duration of those calendar months (see, among other authorities, Nelson v. the United Kingdom, no. 74961/01, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13, 1\u00a0April 2008; Otto v.

Moreover, a procedure for reviewing judgments that had become final had been split into a cassation appeal procedure and a supervisory-review procedure.

Furthermore, they stressed that the restriction of the first applicant\u2019s parental authority had been of a temporary nature, which the domestic courts had clearly stated in the decisions of 20\u00a0March and 17 July 2012, and could have been lifted as soon as it became clear that the first applicant had fully adapted himself to an independent life and had maintained a relationship with his daughter. In fact, the first applicant had successfully availed himself of the right to seek to have his parental authority fully restored, and his application to that end had been allowed by the domestic courts in 2013, when they had established that the relevant circumstances had changed and the restriction in question had no longer been needed, and had returned the second applicant to her father.

However, stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of contact, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Sahin v.

In fact, it remained in place for slightly more than a year, from 20 March 2012 when the Frunzenskiy District Court imposed it, until 8 April 2013 when the same court withdrew it (see paragraph 53 above).",

The Court reiterates in this respect that where the existence of a family tie with a child has been established, the State must act in a manner calculated to enable that tie to be developed (see Keegan v. Ireland, 26 May 1994, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 290, and Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1994, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 297C).

In particular, the domestic authorities noted that the second applicant showed signs of anxiety in her parents\u2019 presence and had difficulties communicating with them.

Those documents, as well as a representative of the care home and Ms O. in the proceedings before the District Court, confirmed that during his years at the home, the first applicant had lived in a separate room which he had kept in order. He had cooked for himself, maintained a household, and overall had been quite independent and fully able to care for himself (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 28 above). Moreover, he had not been confined to the care home, and had been authorised to leave the premises. He had actually worked part-time at the home, and had very positive references. He had also worked part-time outside in the city.

In the present case, it observes that the first applicant complained, in essence, that the restriction on his parental authority over the second applicant had been imposed because of his mental disability. It observes in this respect that in paragraphs 101-119 above it has analysed in detail the reasons, including the first applicant\u2019s mental health, advanced by the domestic courts to restrict his parental authority. It found those reasons to be insufficient to justify that restriction, with the result that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their family life was disproportionate in breach of Article 8 of the Convention. In view of the Court\u2019s analysis under that Article and the violation found, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether the domestic courts\u2019 decisions thereby discriminated against the first applicant in breach of Article 14, read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention (see, for a similar conclusion, Schneider v.\u00a0Germany, no. 17080/07, \u00a7 108, 15 September 2011, or A.K. and L. v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 37956/11, \u00a7 94, 8 January 2013).",

In addition, the District Court again explicitly referred to the first applicant\u2019s mental disability in stating \u2013 while seemingly disregarding all the written evidence to the contrary (see paragraphs 20-24) \u2013 that he had failed to provide reliable evidence that it would be safe for the second applicant to live with him (see paragraph 33).

Such an essentialist view of the parenting inabilities of persons with disabilities flattens and homogenises the experiences and capabilities of this group\u2019s members. The inadequacy of such a stereotyped approach is particularly acute given the vulnerability of persons with mental disabilities as a group that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past (see Alajos Kiss v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 38832/06, 20 May 2010, \u00a7 42).",

As regards the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Court has recognised this instrument of international law, which enjoys almost universal ratification, as setting the standard concerning the need to protect people with disabilities from discriminatory treatment (see Glor v. Switzerland, no. 13444/04, \u00a7 53, 30 April 2009). Concerning parental rights, the CRPD states in its Article 23 (see paragraph\u00a057) that State Parties are to render appropriate assistance to persons with disabilities in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities. Furthermore, Article 23 (4) explicitly confirms that no child is to be separated from his or her parents on the basis of a disability either of the child or of one or both of the parents. The written and oral evidence adduced by the first applicant (see paragraphs 20-24 and 25) convincingly showed that there was no objective indication of neglect, abuse or immediate danger for the child. On the contrary, the first applicant showed his concern for the child\u2019s welfare and his willingness to cooperate with the domestic authorities by even proposing a gradual transfer of the second applicant into his care in order to avoid causing her any unnecessary stress (see paragraph 25). Yet the domestic authorities did not attempt to impose any less invasive measures regarding the restriction on the first applicant\u2019s parental authority anywhere in their reasoning, and did not seem to make any efforts to provide the first applicant with the \u201cappropriate assistance\u201d required by the CRPD.",

However, the fact that the substantive provision invoked in the present case, Article 8 of the Convention, has been analysed in detail and a violation has been found does not mean that the discriminatory nature of the State action has been sufficiently examined by the Court. In other words, the scope and substance of Article 14 is by no means automatically absorbed by the scope of the substantive right with which it must be invoked. Such automatic absorption would deprive Article\u00a014 of all scope of application and render it the \u2018Cinderella provision\u2019 of the Convention.",

Thus, an applicant seeking a definitive finding by the Court on a discrimination issue would have to make a difficult decision prior to submitting his or her application. In order to achieve a separate examination of Article 14, an applicant would necessarily have to invoke only Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, instead of also invoking Article 8 on its own. In my opinion, such a restrictive practice does not correspond to the ratione Conventionis. Apart from the doubts expressed above, one has to bear in mind that it is also of practical significance whether the Court finds one or two Convention rights to have been violated: the amount granted under Article 41 is normally higher in the latter case.",

There is much evidence suggesting a violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8 in respect of the first applicant\u2019s claim that the restriction on his parental authority over the second applicant was imposed and maintained because of his mental disability. It follows that the inequality of treatment in question constitutes a fundamental aspect of the case (compare supra, \u00a7 3) and warrants examination by the Court under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8.",
