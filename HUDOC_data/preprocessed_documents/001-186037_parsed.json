Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, 31 March 2016).",

Italy (dec.), no. 30598/02, 20\u00a0January 2005). Moreover, it is not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see, among others, Perna v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a048898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V). In the present case, the applicant maintained that the statement of S.G. was in contradiction with the statements of S.T. and H.O. Nevertheless, the trial court and the Criminal Court of Appeal refused to hear S.G. (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above) without providing any concrete reasons therefore. Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s view, this is an element to take into account in the assessment of whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (ibid).",

If there is a good reason for the witness\u2019s non-attendance in that sense, it follows that there is a good reason, or justification, for the trial court to admit the untested statements of the absent witness as evidence (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 119).

The Court finds it noteworthy, though, that after receiving that information, the trial court did not initiate any further attempts in the matter, for example, try to find out whether the convictions of S.T. and H.O. would become final and, if so, when, and whether, under the Strasbourg Convention of 1959 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (see paragraph 29 above), they could be transferred to Armenia for the trial at a later stage. Nor does it appear that other means that would have enabled the applicant to examine the witnesses were contemplated, for instance the possibility of having oral evidence from them taken in Georgia, or by video link. As regards the latter, the Court notes that the Government argued that this would not have been possible since the authorities had not been properly equipped (see paragraph 36 above). However, in the light of the facts as supplied by the parties, it does not seem that the trial court ever considered recourse to that measure (see paragraphs\u00a014-20 above).",

Moreover, in respect of this evidence, the Regional Court was obliged to provide the applicant with an opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and put forward all his relevant arguments.
