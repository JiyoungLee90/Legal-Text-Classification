The Court sees no reason to depart from those findings in the present case. Moreover, the court decision produced by the Government in support of their statement about the effectiveness of a civil claim for damages caused by a lack of adequate medical assistance in detention was adopted by the national court after this Court had examined the case and had found a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of the authorities\u2019 failure to protect the claimants\u2019 daughter\u2019s and mother\u2019s right to life (Kats and Others v. , no. 29971/04, 18 December 2008).

While promptness has to be assessed in each case according to its specific features (see, among other authorities, Aquilina v.  [GC], no. 25642/94, \u00a7 48, ECHR 1999III), the strict time constraint imposed by this requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 leaves little flexibility in interpretation, otherwise there would be a serious weakening of a procedural guarantee to the detriment of the individual and the risk of impairing the very essence of the right protected by this provision (McKay v. the  [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2006X).",
