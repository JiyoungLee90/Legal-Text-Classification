The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of being deprived of his right of access to the Supreme Administrative Court. He complained that his legal aid lawyer had refused to prepare and lodge a cassation appeal in his case and that he had been informed about this refusal too late to find a new lawyer who could prepare and lodge such an appeal.
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Białe Błota.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, and subsequently by Mr J. Sobczak, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 4 December 2012 the Bydgoszcz Regional Administrative Court (Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny) dismissed the applicant’s appeal, which concerned urban planning, against the decision of the Governor of the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Region of 10 April 2012.
On 28 January 2013 the judgment, with its written grounds, was served on the applicant. Accordingly, the thirty-day time-limit to lodge a cassation appeal was due to expire on 28 February 2013.
On 18 January 2013 the Bydgoszcz Regional Administrative Court decided to appoint a legal aid lawyer to represent the applicant in cassation proceedings. The lawyer was designated by the Bydgoszcz District Chamber of Legal Advisers on 11 March 2013. By letter of 20 March 2013 the lawyer in question informed the applicant that she had been appointed to represent him. The parties did not inform the Court of the date when this letter was delivered to him.
On 29 March 2013 the legal aid lawyer prepared an opinion in which she stated that there were no grounds for lodging a cassation appeal in the applicant’s case. On the same day she sent this opinion to the Bydgoszcz Regional Administrative Court and to the applicant. The letter was received by the above-mentioned court on 2 April 2013. The applicant submitted that it had been served on him on 16 April 2013.
The domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny) prior to 15 August 2015 are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Subicka v. Poland, no. 29342/06, §§ 12-21, 14 September 2010; Subicka v. Poland (no. 2), nos. 34043/05 and 15792/06, §§ 27-30, 21 June 2011; and Piotr Kozłowski v. Poland, no. 24250/11, §§ 1619, 9 April 2013.
In its decision no. II FZ 651/07 of 18 January 2008, the Supreme Administrative Court held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only way by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the time-limit by a legally-aided applicant could be admitted for examination.
When legal aid had been granted and the time-limit for the submission of a cassation appeal had already expired, it was open to the legally-aided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time under sections 86 and 87 of the Law on the Procedure before the Administrative Courts (ustawa z dnia 30 sierpnia 2002 r.  Prawo o postępowaniu przed sądami administracyjnymi) (e.g. NSA FZ 754/04 of 31 January 2005 and NSA, I OZ 160/08 of 14 March 2008). Initially, the manner in which the beginning of the timelimit for lodging cassation appeals together with such an application was determined had led to divergent results. In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within seven days from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party; that date was considered to be the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist (for example the Białystok Regional Administrative Court, II SAB Bk 27/07 of 10 April 2008), or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file (e.g. the Poznań Regional Administrative Court, IV SA/Po 865/06 of 13 November 2007).
However, in a number of decisions delivered before 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court acknowledged the difficulties which legallyaided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first-instance administrative courts. It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough. The court held that the seven-day time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal, and not when he or she was informed of his or her assignment to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigid and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal aid system illusory. In any event, the cassation appeal had to be lodged within thirty days from the day on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal aid lawyer (see, in particular, cases nos. I FZ 569/06 of 8 December 2006; I FZ 667/06 of 15 January 2007; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2007; II OZ 513/08 of 27 May 2008; I OZ 376/08 of 13 June 2008; II FZ 177/08 of 25 June 2008; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009; and II OZ 1093/09 of 9 December 2009).
On 15 August 2015 section 177 of the Law on the Procedure before Administrative Courts was amended. Currently it provides that the thirtyday time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal for a legally-aided party starts to run only on the day when a legal aid lawyer is informed of his or her assignment to the case. If, however, the lawyer prepares an opinion on the lack of grounds for lodging a cassation appeal within this time-limit, this opinion is served on the party, which then has another thirty days to find another lawyer and lodge a cassation appeal.
