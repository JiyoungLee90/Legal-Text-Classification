Russia, no. 42255/04, \u00a7 24, 1 July 2010). The Court also finds that certain allegations concerning, prima facie, the physical conditions (namely, being largely confined to a cell with a lack of exercise and fresh air) are so closely connected to the complaints of ineffective treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, that it would be artificial to discount them in the overall examination of the healthcare arrangements. By the same token, the applicant's complaint of the incompatibility of the physical conditions of his detention in Penitentiary no. 47 with his state of health (for\u00a0example, the cell being damp and cold), should, in the circumstances of the present case, be examined in the light of his more general complaint of incompatibility of the physical conditions of his detention with his healthcare needs (see, for example, Ukhan v. , no. 30628/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08183, 18 December 2008).",

The Court considers that this delay cannot be explained by the medical tactics of preferential treatment for tuberculosis (see paragraphs 16 and 48 above). There is no record to suggest that HIV therapy was discussed during the several periods when the applicant's tuberculosis was inhibited (for example, in March 2002 and February 2005 \u2013 see paragraph 28 above). Moreover, according to the applicable guidelines, HIV treatment in tuberculosis patients is expected to be commenced immediately if the level of CD-4 immunity cells, which is advised to be monitored every few months, drops below a particular threshold. In any event, this treatment is expected to be contemplated within months of the administration of the tuberculosis therapy. The applicant, in the meantime, was denied tests to establish his count of CD-4 cells for numerous years in a row. In the absence of the level of his immunity cells being monitored, it may not be excluded that the applicant's recovery from tuberculosis was impeded by the absence of HIV therapy.",

There is nothing to suggest whether any special hygiene or exercise regime was developed for the applicant in the present case. The Court notes first of all that according to the Ukrainian legislation it is generally expected that tuberculosis treatment be administered in specially equipped hospitals (see paragraphs 38, 40 and 41 above). It is notable that in the present case, the applicant spent over two years in penitentiary no.\u00a047, designed for healthy inmates. It appears that for extensive periods of time he was confined to a common prison cell, at times sharing it with other inmates. In the absence of any information from the Government to the contrary, it also appears that at least during his stay in Penitentiary no.\u00a047, the applicant was likewise generally expected to follow the basic exercise\u2013rest regime established for healthy inmates (namely, confined to the cell without outdoor exercise for most of the day and generally not allowed to lie on the bed during the day).",

However, regard being had to absence of documentary evidence on the Government's behalf, a statement by G. (the applicant's occasional cellmate) and the general deterioration of the applicant's health (including the development of pneumonia in May\u00a02005 and chronic bronchitis by August 2008), the Court finds his description credible and is prepared to conclude that the physical conditions of the applicant's detention were not properly adapted to his healthcare needs.",
