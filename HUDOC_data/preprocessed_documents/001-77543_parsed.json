In view of the need for that right to be practical and effective, the obligation of the competent authorities is not limited to the appointment of an interpreter but, if they are put on notice in the particular circumstances, may also extend to a degree of subsequent control over the adequacy of the interpretation provided (see Kamasinski, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

In the grounds of appeal, the applicant confined himself to reiterating the arguments adduced in his defence before the preliminary hearings judge, namely that the drugs in his possession had been for his own personal use. He also alleged that the way in which the legislation on drugs had been interpreted was unconstitutional (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In addition, in the pleadings which they filed on 23 October 2000, the applicant\u2019s lawyers argued that the expert chemical analysis of the drugs was null and void owing to procedural defects (see paragraph 19 above).",

The applicant had been arrested in flagrante delicto (see paragraph 12 above) and had at no stage in the proceedings attempted to deny the factual basis of the charges against him. In particular, in so far as the applicant continued to maintain at the appeal stage, despite all appearances to the contrary, that the drugs found in his possession had been intended for his own personal use and not for sale, even though the quantity concerned, according to the preliminary hearings judge, was equivalent to more than twenty years\u2019 average consumption (see paragraph 15 above), the Court fails to see how in the present case the physical presence of the applicant at the appeal hearing could in any way have influenced the characterisation of the offence of drug trafficking which had formed the basis for his conviction.",

Even an extreme Hobbesian position is tenable in this respect, that is, that there simply are no legally relevant facts unless there is a prior legal norm (of criminal law) under which these facts become legally relevant. To cite one example, the killing of the pawnbroker woman described by Dostoyevsky in his novel Crime and Punishment can only be called \u201cmurder\u201d because there was a pre-existing norm of substantive criminal law that described and punished such conduct as \u201cmurder\u201d.",

The antinomy stems from the fact that the choice of facts which are to become legally relevant depends on the choice of legal norm, and vice versa.

This makes it all the more patent that the rigour of the principle of legality is not, as it is usually understood to be, a onedimensional subsuming of an obvious fact pattern into an obvious, single and exclusive norm. The choice of the combination of norms that best describes the fact pattern is in itself a complex mental exercise in which, like in a chess game, different combinations are considered before a final choice is settled upon.",

In my view, the fact that the notice did not provide either for an express waiver or for the automatic transfer of the defendant to the Court of Appeal was a simple clerical oversight caused by careless drafting of the printed form.",
