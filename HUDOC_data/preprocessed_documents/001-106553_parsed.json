The demonstration was organised by KESK (Kamu Emek\u00e7ileri Sendikalar\u0131 Konfederasyonu \u2013 The Confederation of Public Employees\u2019 Trade Unions). A large group of police officers, all wearing helmets and gas masks and equipped with the necessary material, was also deployed to the area. Nearly 500\u00a0demonstrators took part in the demonstration and slogans were chanted against NATO. After the statement was read out by the representative of KESK, the demonstrators started to disperse. A small group of demonstrators, carrying the flags of their non-governmental organisation Halkevleri Derne\u011fi (Peoples\u2019 Houses), walked towards the police officers who had blocked Istiklal Street to prevent the group from approaching Taksim Square. The demonstrators attacked the police officers with sticks and stones and the police officers used tear gas and truncheons to disperse the group.

It is also noted that at this time a small group of demonstrators, carrying the flags of the NGO Halkevleri Derne\u011fi (Peoples\u2019 Houses), had a confrontation with the police. While they attacked the police officers with sticks and stones, the police used force to disperse them. The Court notes at this point that it has been established by the Beyo\u011flu Criminal Court that the applicants were not among the demonstrators who had attacked and resisted the police officers. In this connection, the Court also observes from the video recording of the incident that a very large group of police officers, all equipped with helmets, gas masks and other necessary equipment, had been deployed to the area prior to the demonstration. It is therefore not possible to conclude that the security forces were called upon to react without prior preparation (see Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others, cited above, \u00a7 32). Furthermore, the Government have not provided any information showing that the intervention of the security forces was properly regulated and organised in such a way as to minimise to the greatest extent possible any risk of bodily harm to the demonstrators. The Court concludes therefore that although a small group of demonstrators attacked the police officers after the press statement had been read out, it is not possible to conclude that the force used by the police against the applicants, who were not among the resisting demonstrators, was justified.",
