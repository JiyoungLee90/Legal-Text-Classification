One of the elements of the broader concept of a fair trial is the principle of equality of arms, which requires each party to be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see, among many other authorities, Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. , judgment of 18 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, pp. 107-08, \u00a7 23). That right means in principle the opportunity for the parties to a trial to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court's decision (Lobo Machado v. Portugal, judgment of 20\u00a0February\u00a01996, Reports 1996I, p.\u00a0206, \u00a7\u00a031).

In those cases the non-communicated documents constituted reasoned opinions on the merits of the applicant's appeals, manifestly aimed at influencing the court's decision-making. In the two latter cases the opposing party also called for the appeals to be dismissed. Likewise, in the case of Lomaseita Oy and Others v.  (no.\u00a045029/98, \u00a7\u00a037, 5 July 2005) the Court found a violation of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 on account of the failure to communicate to the applicants material in which the other party had expressed his opinion on the relevance of the supplementary police report and the additional legal submission to the Court of Appeal, thereby intending to influence the court's judgment.",
