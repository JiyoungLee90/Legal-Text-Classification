It finds such incomplete and selective evidence unconvincing (see, for similar reasoning, Sudarkov, cited above, \u00a7 43, and Kokoshkina, cited above, \u00a7 60). It further observes that on at least five pages the entries in respect of the number of detainees in the applicant\u2019s cells were visibly altered, with a figure having been erased and another figure, corresponding in all cases to the number of sleeping bunks in the cell, having been written over instead. The Government did not indicate at what point and for what purpose the information in the register had been altered. The Court has already found that alterations in a prison population register, without any explanations as to their origin, reason and timing, made the information contained in it unreliable (see Glotov v. , no. 41558/05, \u00a7 25, 10 May 2012).",

The Government did not provide any explanation for that discrepancy. Moreover, the examination of the other entries made in the prison population register on the same dates reveals that in the other cells of the same wing the number of inmates exceeded the number of sleeping bunks. The Court finds it noteworthy that only the applicant\u2019s cells were unaffected by that problem, in particular in view of the visible alterations to the entries concerning those very cells described above and the abovementioned discrepancies in the total numbers of inmates. The foregoing factors make it impossible to determine whether the amended data has any probative value.

The Court reiterates in this connection that in previous cases where applicants had less than 3 square metres of personal space available to them, it found that the overcrowding was so severe as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. Accordingly, it was not necessary to assess other aspects of the physical conditions of their detention (see, for example, Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, \u00a7 40, 20 January 2005; Labzov v.

They did not point to any aspects of the applicant\u2019s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that he presented such risks. They gave no heed to important and relevant facts supporting the applicant\u2019s petitions for release and reducing the above risks, such as his clean criminal record, a permanent place of residence and positive character references. Nor did they consider the possibility of ensuring the applicant\u2019s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure. Finally, after the case had been submitted for trial in June 2005 the domestic courts issued collective detention orders, using the same summary formula to refuse the applications for release and extend the pre-trial detention of thirty-nine people, notwithstanding the defence\u2019s express request that each detainee\u2019s situation be dealt with individually.",
