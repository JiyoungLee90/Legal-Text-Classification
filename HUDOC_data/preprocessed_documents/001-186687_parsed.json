The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or a municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his or her possessions on the other.",

The lawfulness of each transaction and title in respect of the plots of land were subject to control by registration authorities. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting the fraud and protecting the municipalities\u2019 interests.

The Court reiterates that mistakes or errors on the part of State authorities should serve to benefit the persons affected. In other words, the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49).

It considers that there is a clear link between the violation found and the damage alleged. It accepts that the applicant\u2019s title to the plot of land should be restored. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which he would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).
