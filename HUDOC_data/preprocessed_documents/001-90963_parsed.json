They are therefore still entitled to receive their outstanding invalidity benefits for the period 1 April 2000 until 1 November 2001 (see paragraph 10 above). The Court further points to the fact that according to the same judgment the Botanica District Court ordered the company to recalculate their benefits periodically and to pay it for the rest of their lives. The Court, therefore, notes that the State\u2019s outstanding obligation to ensure the effective enforcement of the judgment in the applicants\u2019 favour is not in dispute. Accordingly, the applicants are still entitled to recover the remaining part of their judgment debts in the domestic proceedings and to be paid the recalculated benefits for the rest of their lives, except Mr Anin and Mr\u00a0Cebotari for the latter case (see paragraph 2 above). The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicants as far as possible are put in the position they would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7\u00a012, Series A no. 85, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present cases this principle also applies, having regard to the violations found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the compliance with the judgment of 23 October 2001 in respect of the applicants.",

However, the amount claimed by Mr\u00a0Gorbat\u00eei in his claims for just satisfaction and those claimed by the rest of the applicants in their initial applications appear excessive.
