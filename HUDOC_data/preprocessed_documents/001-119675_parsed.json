All persons are entitled to the protection of that right, that is to say, not to be deprived, or to continue to be deprived, of their liberty, save in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 5 \u00a7 1. The list of exceptions set out in the aforementioned provision is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely, to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Khayredinov v. Ukraine, no. 38717/04, \u00a7 26, 14 October 2010, with further references). No detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in this context extending beyond a lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention, in particular where there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7 72, 77 and 78, 9 July 2009, with further references) or where such deprivation of liberty was not necessary in the circumstances (see Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v.
