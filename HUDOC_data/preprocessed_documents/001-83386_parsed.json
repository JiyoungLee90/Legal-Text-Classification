The Court reiterates that the existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value-judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value-judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2001II, and Busuioc, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061), although opinions insufficiently based on facts can also be excessive (Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria (no. 2), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, p. 1276, \u00a7 33).
