Under such rules and circumstances, there was evidently a heavy burden of proof on the side of a father of a child born out of wedlock. The crucial point is that the courts did not regard contacts between child and natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father. Even if the District Court\u2019s decision contains the formulation that there was a risk to the child\u2019s mental and psychological well-being if she had to take up contact with the applicant against her wish, the mother\u2019s initial prohibition of further contacts and her influence on the child remained decisive.

There seems to be nothing indicating why the  Regional Court should have departed from the assessment made by the District Court.  For the European Court of Human Rights to say in these circumstances that the national court should have sought new expert advice (which not even the applicant had apparently requested it to seek), runs  counter to the above-mentioned  principle \u201cthat the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities\u201d.   In the circumstances of the present case the conclusion that \u201cthe national authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation\u201d (paragraph 45) amounts to leaving practically no margin of appreciation at all to the domestic courts which, after all, are in a much better position than this Court to make the type of sensitive decisions as the one at issue here.

According to paragraph\u00a051 of the present judgment the \u201ccrucial point is that the courts did not regard contacts between child and natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father.\u201d I fail to see that the approach of the domestic courts on this point was in any relevant manner different in Elsholz, in which the District Court stated  that the provisions \u201cconcerning the father\u2019s right to personal contact with his child born out of wedlock ... was conceived of as an exemption clause which had to be construed strictly\u201d (paragraph 13 of the Elsholz judgment).

Therefore it could  not \u201cbe said  ... that a divorced father would have been treated more favourably\u201d (paragraph 61).
