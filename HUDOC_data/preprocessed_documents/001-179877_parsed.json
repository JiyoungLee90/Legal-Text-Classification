Under the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judges\u2019 personal conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to their impartiality. In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance. When deciding whether, in a given case, there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7\u00a7 118-19, ECHR 2005XIII, and Morice v. France [GC], no.\u00a029369/10, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, ECHR 2015).",

Both Judge K. and Judge N. had the status of witnesses in the criminal proceedings against the applicant, but they were not involved in those proceedings in their judicial capacity. Nevertheless, the applicant\u2019s fear of a lack of impartiality stemmed from the fact that their colleagues \u2013 full-time judges of the criminal section of the Vasileostrovskiy District Court \u2013 remanded him in custody and subsequently extended his detention. As there was no complaint regarding the personal conduct of those judges, the case must therefore be examined from the perspective of the objective impartiality test. More specifically, the Court must address the question of whether hierarchical or other links with other actors in the proceedings may objectively justify misgivings as to the impartiality of the tribunal (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2009).",

In one case, the Court found that judges\u2019 working relationship with a colleague who was the brother of a party to a civil dispute, and a friendship between one of them and that same colleague, did not suffice to make an objective observer legitimately fear that they would not regard their oath made upon taking judicial office as taking precedence over any social commitments (see A.K.\u00a0v. Liechtenstein, no. 38191/12, \u00a7 75, 9 July 2015). In a more relevant context of criminal proceedings, the Court considered that, where a trial concerned an applicant\u2019s responsibility for the death of a judge\u2019s daughter, and where that trial was presided over by that judge\u2019s colleague from the same court, the situation prompted objectively justified doubts as to the impartiality of all the judges of the trial court (see Mitrov v.\u00a0the\u00a0former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 45959/09, \u00a7\u00a055, 2\u00a0June 2016).",

Although the available information about the relationships that had formed between the judges of the Vasileostrovskiy District Court is not as detailed as it was in the Mitrov case (see, in particular, Mitrov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54), the applicant\u2019s misgivings as to the impartiality of the court must be held to be objectively justified in the light of the court president\u2019s decision to allow his challenge for bias against the entire composition and move the trial to another district court in St Petersburg (see paragraph 12 above). However, that decision concerned the trial stage and could be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, whereas the applicant\u2019s complaint related to the pre-trial stage of the proceedings and was formulated under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

On each occasion the applicant filed a challenge for bias, and on each occasion it was rejected as unsubstantiated. In accordance with Article 65 \u00a7 4 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 16 above), the challenges were decided by the same judges who were being challenged. The Court has already found that the procedure by which judges did not actually decide, but merely appeared to decide, on challenges for bias against themselves was incompatible with the requirement of impartiality (see A.K. v. Liechtenstein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-84, and A.K. v. Liechtenstein (no. 2), no. 10722/13, \u00a7 66, 18 February 2016). This finding applies a fortiori in the circumstances of the present case, where the judges considered and rejected challenges which concerned themselves, thereby breaching the fundamental principle of justice that no one should be a judge in his own cause (nemo judex in causa sua).",

The Russian Constitutional Court has also considered that a measure of control by higher courts is an important guarantee against the risk of arbitrary decisions on challenges for bias (see paragraph 17 above). The City Court, acting as a court of appeal, had the power to quash the detention or extension orders issued by the Vasileostrovskiy District Court on the grounds that that court had not been sufficiently impartial; such a decision could have a legal basis in the \u201cother circumstances\u201d clause under Article 61 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 15 above), which was later relied upon to change the venue of the trial. However, on neither occasion did the City Court carry out an independent analysis of the applicant\u2019s arguments as to the District Court\u2019s alleged lack of impartiality, and each time it endorsed the District Court judge\u2019s self-assessment as being impartial (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). Moreover, the language of the City Court\u2019s decision of 26\u00a0January 2010 indicated that the requirement of impartiality of the tribunal did not apply at the pre-trial stage with the same force, if at all, as it would during the hearing on the merits. This approach is incompatible with the Convention requirement that the \u201ccourt\u201d referred to in Article 5 \u00a7 4 should meet the same stringent standards of independence and impartiality (see the case-law cited above in paragraph\u00a021).",
