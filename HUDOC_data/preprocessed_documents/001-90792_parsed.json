It argued that the fact that recognition of the right to deduct the input VAT was conditional on the compliance of the supplier \u2013 a factor which was beyond the control of the recipient of a supply \u2013 made the relevant provisions of the VAT Act unpredictable and arbitrary in their application. Accordingly, the applicant company considered that the refusal of the authorities to allow it to deduct the input VAT amounted to a deprivation of its possession, resulting from the fact that the price it had paid to its supplier included BGN\u00a03,610 (EUR 1,851) in VAT. Hence, it had not only lost the amount it had paid to its supplier in respect of VAT but had also had to pay the same amount a second time to the State budget under the tax assessment, together with interest in the amount of BGN 200.24 (EUR 102). In addition, the applicant company claimed that, as a result of the refusal to allow it to deduct the VAT, the amount it had paid to its supplier as VAT had not been taxdeductible as an expense and had been subject to corporate income tax, which amounted to a further deprivation of its \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

The Court observes, however, that the rules governing the VAT system of taxation \u2013 including the conditions for registration, charges, recharges, exemptions, deductions and reimbursements \u2013 are exclusively set and regulated by the State.

Likewise, in respect of the supply in question, the applicant company, as a VATregistered person, did not have a choice in respect of the applicable VAT rules.
