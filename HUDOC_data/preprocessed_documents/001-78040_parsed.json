In the instant case, it considers that the hourly rates and the number of hours claimed, both for the work before the domestic courts and before the Court, seem excessive and that a reduction is necessary on that basis. Moreover, the majority of the applicant's complaints were declared inadmissible (see paragraph 5 above). Thus, having regard to all relevant factors the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 750 in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
