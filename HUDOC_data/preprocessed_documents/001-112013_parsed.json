The questioning of accused individuals by government prosecutors, which often lasted for hours at a time over a period of several days, and the denial of bail in certain cases further exacerbated the perception of politically motivated prosecution (see section 4).

Much is at stake, as one of the most serious accusations leveled against the administration is that it is using the justice system\u2014and specifically the prosecutor general\u2019s office and the SBU\u2014to punish political opponents. Arguably no other issue has generated as much attention and criticism from inside  and from the international community than this perception of selective prosecutions, especially against former prime minister Tymoshenko and her associates. The level of concern has led the U.S. and other Western embassies, as well as officials in , to issue public statements highlighting this issue. Tymoshenko\u2019s is the most prominent case, but charges have been brought against nearly a dozen other top officials from her government, including former interior minister Yuriy Lutsenko and Ihor Didenko, the former deputy chief executive of the national energy company, Naftogaz Ukrainy. The charges brought against them, while not inconsequential, are nonetheless seen by many observers as a misuse of the judicial process. This is not to imply that the government and prosecutor general\u2019s office should not vigorously pursue all cases of corruption, or that former senior officials should be immune from fair prosecution. But the authorities have an extra burden to pursue such cases in a credible fashion, something they have failed so far to do. The government and prosecutor\u2019s office, anticipating such criticism, note that more than 350 current officials are being investigated for or charged with corrupt activities. None of these individuals, however, hold enough power or influence to suggest that justice is being pursued fairly and blindly. The highest-ranking official currently under investigation in Kyiv is Bohdan Presner, former deputy minister for environmental protection in Yanukovych\u2019s administration.",

In any case this is not a fair way for the court to inform the parties to the trial about a session, for which they need to prepare themselves and where it is essential that the persons with specific knowledge of the case can meet.",

The Monitor was impressed by the widespread opinion that the Ukrainian courts cannot be considered independent at least in cases related to politics. The judiciary certainly has a problem with its credibility in the public. As the decisive factor of such situation the composition of the Higher Council of Justice was pointed at with its heavy bias in favour of the representation from the President of Ukraine or his affiliated party and the membership of the Prosecutor General and his 2 deputies, the Head of the Security Service etc. after the Judicial Reform in the summer of 2010. The judicial reform has in other ways improved the conditions of the legal system, but the Higher Council of Justice has obtained an unacceptable decisive influence on the appointment of, the disciplinary measures against and the dismissal of judges. The judicial reform law was criticized by the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission.",

They noted that the applicant had not appeared before the investigator in order to study the case file, although he had been obliged to do so under Article 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Government further noted that the protection of witnesses had been the most important consideration in deciding on the applicant\u2019s detention and this ground had been persistent both on investigative and judicial stages of the case to ensure proper administration of justice by receiving the witness testimonies without any obstacles.

All persons are entitled to the protection of that right, that is to say, not to be deprived, or to continue to be deprived, of their liberty, save in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 5 \u00a7 1. The list of exceptions set out in the aforementioned provision is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely, to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Khayredinov v. , no. 38717/04, \u00a7 26, 14 October 2010, with further references). No detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in this context extending beyond a lack of conformity with national law. As a consequence, a deprivation of liberty which is lawful under domestic law can still be arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention, in particular where there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Mooren v.  [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7 72, 77 and 78, 9 July 2009, with further references) or where such deprivation of liberty was not necessary in the circumstances (see Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v.

Concerning the necessity to ensure the applicant\u2019s participation in further investigative actions, the Government submitted that the resumption of the investigation had been necessary to consolidate two criminal cases against the applicant (see paragraph 25 above). They did not claim however that any such actions within the first criminal case had been necessary or had been eventually conducted.

France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII). In particular, if an applicant complains that the proceedings lasted for an unreasonably long time the Court will normally deduct any period during which the delay is attributable to the applicant (see, for example, Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7\u00a081, ECHR\u00a02003-IX (extracts); and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses of Moscow v. Russia, no.\u00a0302/02, \u00a7 198, 10 June 2010). On the other hand, any such delay could affect the interests of other parties and the authorities should have the means to discipline the person responsible. The Court is not persuaded, however, that deprivation of liberty in such a situation is an adequate response to the problem of delay in studying a case file. Moreover, the circumstances of the present case show that the investigator decided to apply such a drastic measure to the applicant after only ten days of studying the case file.",

It may also be essential that the individual concerned should not only have the opportunity to be heard in person but that he should also have the effective assistance of his lawyer (see Bouamar v.\u00a0Belgium, 29 February 1988, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 129).",

They noted that the applicant made only general remark about hypothetical pressure on him and therefore this issue cannot be considered by the Court. They further reiterated that the status of a politician could not grant him or her immunity from criminal prosecution. The Government observed that the applicant had been deprived of his liberty in connection with the criminal proceedings instituted against him. The criminal offences with which he had been charged were defined in the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code. The prosecuting authorities had conducted an investigation in connection with the suspicion that the applicant had committed serious crimes and, as a result, more than forty-seven volumes comprising the criminal case file, together with the indictment, had been forwarded by the prosecuting authorities to the court. On 23 May 2011 the court had held a preliminary hearing in the criminal case against the applicant. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s behaviour during the period when he was at large had given sufficient grounds to believe that he had been attempting to influence the investigation and to obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case. Therefore, the Government considered that the purposes behind the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty had been exclusively those envisaged by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.",

The Government noted that apart from the aforementioned facts, there was no evidence that the reason for the applicant\u2019s detention had been his activities as a political figure and a member of the party in opposition to the Government as opposed to the existing suspicion of his having committed a crime.

This happened in the context, which the external observers described as politically motivated prosecution of the opposition leaders. The applicant\u2019s case, along with the case of the former Prime-Minister Tymoshenko, attracted important attention both nationally and internationally. In these circumstances, the applicant\u2019s submissions made at the initial stage as to the possible political pressure on him before the upcoming elections, as well as his complaint that one of the reasons for his detention had been his communication with the media and his public disagreement with the accusations against him, are sufficient reasons to examine the issue of the applicant\u2019s detention from the viewpoint of Article\u00a018.

However, an applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed (or as can be reasonably inferred from the context). A mere suspicion that the authorities used their powers for some other purpose than those defined in the Convention is not sufficient to prove that Article 18 was breached. Furthermore, high political status does not grant immunity (Khodorkovskiy v. , no. 5829/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0255 and 258, 31 May 2011).",

Thus, in Gusinskiy v.\u00a0Russia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a073\u201378), the Court accepted that the applicant\u2019s liberty had been restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article\u00a05. The Court in that case based its findings on an agreement signed between the detainee and a federal Minister for the Press. It was clear from that agreement that the applicant\u2019s detention had been applied in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In Cebotari v. Moldova (no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046 et seq., 13\u00a0November 2007) the Court found a violation of Article\u00a018 of the Convention in circumstances where the applicant\u2019s arrest was visibly linked to an application pending before the Court.",

In the present case, the Court has already established that the grounds advanced by the authorities for the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty were not only incompatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 but were also against the spirit of the Convention (see paragraphs 66 to 73 above). In this context, the Court observes that the profile of the applicant, one of the opposition leaders who had communicated with the media, plainly attracted considerable public attention. It can also be accepted that being accused of abuse of office, he had the right to reply to such an accusation through the media. The prosecuting authorities seeking the applicant\u2019s arrest explicitly indicated the applicant\u2019s communication with the media as one of the grounds for his arrest and accused him of distorting public opinion about crimes committed by him, discrediting the prosecuting authorities and influencing the upcoming trial in order to avoid criminal liability (see paragraph 26 above).",
