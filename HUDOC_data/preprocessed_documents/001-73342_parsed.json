Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A \u00a7 57). Article 9 lists a number of forms which manifestation of one\u2019s religion or belief may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance: it does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (Kala\u00e7 v. Turkey, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, \u00a7\u00a027). Thus, there was no interference with the right guaranteed by Article 9 where a military officer with fundamentalist beliefs was compulsorily retired for breach of discipline (Kala\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7\u00a728-31) or where a public service employee, member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was dismissed for breach of contract in absenting himself from work in order to keep the Sabbath (Konttninen v. Finland, no. 24949/94, Commission decision 3.12.96; see also Stedman v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a029107/95, Commission decision 9.4.1997, D.R. 89 p. 104, where the applicant was dismissed for refusing to work on Sundays).",

It considers that while it may be that this absence from work was motivated by the applicant\u2019s intention of celebrating a Muslim festival it is not persuaded that this was a manifestation of his beliefs in the sense protected by Article 9 of the Convention or that the penalty imposed on him for breach of contract in absenting himself without permission was an interference with those rights (see the cases cited at the end of the previous paragraph).",

While the notion of the State sitting in judgment on the state of a citizen\u2019s inner and personal beliefs is abhorrent and may smack unhappily of past infamous persecutions, the Court observes that this is a case where the applicant sought to enjoy a special right bestowed by Macedonian law which provided that Muslims could take holiday on particular days, including the Bayram festival in issue in the present case (see paragraph 29 above). In the context of employment, with contracts setting out specific obligations and rights between employer and employee, the Court does not find it unreasonable that an employer may regard absence without permission or apparent justification as a disciplinary matter. Where the employee then seeks to rely on a particular exemption, it is not oppressive or in fundamental conflict with freedom of conscience to require some level of substantiation when that claim concerns a privilege or entitlement not commonly available and, if that substantiation is not forthcoming, to reach a negative conclusion (see, mutatis mutandis, cases concerning conscientious objection where the authorities may legitimately require strong evidence of genuine religious objections to justify exemption from the civil duty of military service \u2013 e.g. N. v. Sweden, no. 10410/83, Commission decision of 11 October 1984, D.R. 40 p. 203, Raninen v.\u00a0Finland, no. 20972/92, Commission decision of 7 March 1996). The applicant however was not prepared to produce any evidence that could substantiate his claims. To the extent therefore that the proceedings disclosed an interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of religion, this was not disproportionate and may, in the circumstances of this case, be regarded as justified in terms of the second paragraph, namely, as prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights of others.",

Further, given that the applicant\u2019s name and way of life had not indicated membership of the Muslim confession and that he had first declared himself to be a believer in proceedings to justify his absence from work, it was necessary for the domestic courts to establish whether he was in a comparable situation to other Muslim believers. While Muslim believers orally declared their faith and manifested it through their lifestyle and performance of religious duties, the applicant refused to show that he was in such a situation. Even assuming that there was any difference of treatment, they argued that it had reasonable and objective justification as the applicant had never publicly manifested his belonging to the Muslim faith and his conduct cast doubt on his claimed conversion. These doubts were relevant and justified, in particular given that in a period of eight years he had changed his beliefs three times (in 1994 he had stated in the census that he was in an atheist while in 2002 he had stated that he was Orthodox).",

It may be applied in an autonomous manner as a breach of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those other provisions although, since it has no independent existence, it can only come into play where the alleged discrimination falls within the scope of the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions (see, amongst many others, Van der Mussele v. Belgium, judgment of 23 November 1983, Series A no. 70, \u00a7 43). Further, different treatment is discriminatory, for the purposes of Article\u00a014, if it \u201chas no objective and reasonable justification\u201d, that is, if it does not pursue a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d or if there is not a \u201creasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised\u201d.

The applicant was making claim to a privilege or exemption to which he was not entitled unless he was a member of the faith concerned and in circumstances which arguably gave rise to doubts as his entitlement.
