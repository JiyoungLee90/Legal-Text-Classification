In its initial decision of 21\u00a0November 2014, the magistrates\u2019 court found that according to the information obtained from the Istanbul governor\u2019s office, it had been decided to deport and detain the first applicant as (i) she posed a danger to public safety, and (ii) she had attempted to leave Turkey illegally. Her detention was, therefore, in accordance with the law. As for the remaining applicants, the Istanbul Magistrates\u2019 Court acknowledged the absence of any detention order in respect of them and dismissed their claims \u2013 regarding the unlawfulness of their detention \u2013 for that reason. The court did not respond to the applicants\u2019 remaining arguments.

In the remaining two decisions the court stated that the applicants had entered Turkey without a valid visa, although the applicants consistently denied that assertion.",

Moreover, although their deportation and detention were based on sections 54(1)(d) and 57(2) of Law\u00a0no. 6458, no concrete evidence had been provided to support the allegation that they posed a threat to public order, safety or health, particularly bearing in mind that three of the applicants were children aged 2, 3 and 7. Similarly, no explanation had been given as to why their detention was called for under section 57(2) of Law no.\u00a06458. The court also noted that the proceedings brought by the applicants against the decisions ordering their deportation and refusing their asylum request were still pending before the administrative courts. On the basis of those findings, the court declared the applicants\u2019 detention to be unlawful and ordered the applicants\u2019 release from the Gaziantep Removal Centre, unless their deportation could be carried out immediately.",

They stressed that the conditions of detention in which they had been held for two months at that centre, which were unsuitable even for adults, were particularly unacceptable in the case of small children. The second, third and fourth applicants\u2019 special needs were not being met at the centre, despite numerous appeals to the authorities. They added that although there was a play room and a yard at the centre, they were not allowed to benefit from those facilities. In particular, they were deprived of basic human needs, such as access to outdoor exercise. Arguing that the conditions of their detention had constituted ill-treatment, as well as violating their right to private and family life, the applicants requested that the Constitutional Court order their release from the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre by way of an interim measure. In support of their arguments, the applicants relied on the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Yarashonen (cited above) and Musaev v.\u00a0Turkey, (no.\u00a072754/11, 21 October 2014), as well as on the reports of the Human Rights Inquiry Committee of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d), the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants, the European Commission and the Human Rights Institution of Turkey, where the adverse conditions of detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre had been noted and criticised. The applicants also alleged that, apart from the unsuitable physical conditions at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre, they had been deprived of their liberty in an unlawful manner and that they had not had an effective remedy to complain about the unlawfulness and the conditions of their detention. They emphasised in this connection that the numerous cases that they had brought before the Istanbul Magistrates\u2019 Court to challenge the lawfulness of their detention had been dismissed by that court on stereotypical grounds without any real assessment of the lawfulness issue.",

It reiterated at the outset the requirement to exhaust all administrative and legal remedies before lodging an application with the Constitutional Court. Referring to its decision in the case of K.A. (no.\u00a02014/13044, 11\u00a0November 2015, see paragraphs 53-58 below), it stated that it had held in the past that there had been no effective remedies available in Turkish law to complain about the conditions of detention at foreigners\u2019 removal centres or the unlawfulness of foreigners\u2019 administrative detention. It then stressed, however, that it had recently changed that jurisprudence in the case of B.T. (no.\u00a02014/15769, 30 November 2017, see paragraphs 59-62 below), where it had held that an action for a full remedy (tam yarg\u0131 davas\u0131) before the administrative courts could provide an effective remedy in respect of complaints concerning both the conditions and the unlawfulness of the administrative detention of foreigners, provided, respectively, that (i) the individual was no longer being held in the conditions complained of, and (ii)\u00a0the unlawfulness of the detention had already been established by a magistrates\u2019 court. The Constitutional Court held that there was no reason to depart from the findings in the B.T. case in the present circumstances, and therefore declared the applicants\u2019 complaints inadmissible for failure to lodge an action for a full remedy before the administrative courts. The Constitutional Court stressed, in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article\u00a05, that their detention had already been declared unlawful by the Gaziantep Magistrates\u2019 Court on 5 February 2015.",

That said, in the event that such applicants sought to have recourse to the administrativelaw remedy at issue after the inadmissibility decisions delivered by the Constitutional Court in respect of them, the administrative courts would be required to assess compliance with the time-limit rules for bringing an administrative action in a manner that would not prejudice the right of access to a court.",

The Constitutional Court first examined whether there had been effective remedies at K.A.\u2019s disposal to complain about his conditions of detention. Referring mainly to the principles cited in the case of Ananyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia (nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a093-119, 10 January 2012), and noting that K.A. had lodged his first two applications while still detained in the impugned conditions, the Constitutional Court held at the outset that in order to be considered effective, the domestic remedy in question had to be capable of ameliorating the conditions complained of, as well as providing the victim with an enforceable right to compensation for the damage that he or she had suffered because of those conditions. It then went on to note that the newly enacted Law no. 6458 did not set out any standards of detention at foreigners\u2019 removal centres. Nor did it envisage any administrative or legal appeal mechanisms capable of assessing the conditions at removal centres and ordering the amelioration of those conditions or release from the centre, as appropriate. The Ministry of Justice had not mentioned the existence of any such remedies in their observations, either. Moreover, the magistrates\u2019 court had not examined K.A.\u2019s complaints regarding the conditions of detention, despite the fact he had raised those complaints along with his allegations concerning the unlawfulness of his detention. In these circumstances, the Constitutional Court found that K.A. had not had an effective remedy at his disposal by which to raise his grievances concerning the conditions of detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre, in breach of the right to an effective remedy under Article\u00a040\u00a0of the Constitution.",

Therefore, a legal remedy which offered reasonable prospects of compensating him for the damage he had suffered as a result of the adverse material conditions of detention would be considered effective for the purposes of Article 40 of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court noted in this connection that section 2 of the Administrative Procedure Act provided a remedy whereby compensation for all damage arising from the acts and omissions of the administration could be claimed before the administrative courts \u2013 namely by lodging an action for a full remedy. The fact that that remedy had never been tried and tested by any foreigners in B.T.\u2019s position did not mean that it did not offer reasonable prospects of success. Bearing in mind that the decisions ordering the detention of foreigners were administrative in nature, and the removal centres where they were held were operated and inspected by the Ministry of the Interior, there was no reason why B.T. could not bring an action for compensation against the Ministry on account of the conditions in which he had been kept at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre. According to the Constitutional Court, there was no doubt that administrative courts had the capacity to determine whether the conditions of detention had been adequate or not and to compensate B.T. as necessary. The Constitutional Court further noted that administrative courts were better placed than it was to assess the conditions of detention at removal centres within their jurisdiction as, unlike the Constitutional Court, they could perform on-site inspections and obtain expert reports.",

Since, on the instant facts, B.T.\u2019s detention had been considered lawful by the Istanbul Magistrates\u2019 Court, B.T. could not be expected to bring an action before the administrative courts to claim compensation for damage sustained prior to lodging an individual application with the Constitutional Court.

Accordingly, anyone claiming that a public authority had violated one of his or her fundamental rights as protected by the Constitution and secured under the Convention and the Protocols thereto could apply to the Constitutional Court. Where the Constitutional Court found a violation, it would order the necessary measures to be taken to end the violation and redress its effects, in accordance with section 50(1) of Law no. 6216 on the establishment and rules of procedure of the Constitutional Court. Under Article 153\u00a0\u00a7\u00a06 of the Constitution, the decisions of the Constitutional Court were binding on all State bodies, including judicial organs. The Constitutional Court also had the authority to order an interim measure pursuant to section\u00a049(5) of Law\u00a0no. 6216 and section 73(1) of its Internal Regulations, if there was a serious threat against an applicant\u2019s life or physical or mental integrity.

Turkey (no. 72710/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-81, 24 June 2014), and that the Government had not submitted any evidence to the contrary. The applicants maintained that the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre had been severely overcrowded at the time of their detention there, accommodating about 600\u00a0people despite its official capacity of 300. The overcrowding at the removal centre had been unacceptable, even based on the figures provided by the Government. In this connection, the information submitted by the Government on the sizes of the rooms on each floor and the number of bunk beds per floor showed that inside the rooms, the personal space per detainee was approximately 3.04 sq. m, 2.21 sq. m and 2.40 sq. m on the first, second and third floors respectively, which was well below the CPT standards.

For the remaining period of their detention at the Kumkap\u0131 and Gaziantep removal centres, they had stayed with other women and children in very crowded rooms.",

The length of the period during which a person is detained in the particular conditions must also be considered (see, among other authorities, Alver v.\u00a0Estonia, no.\u00a064812/01, \u00a7 50, 8 November 2005, and Aden Ahmed v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a055352/12, \u00a7 86, 23 July 2013).",

The Court considered in each of those cases that the extreme vulnerability of children \u2013 whether or not they were accompanied by their parents \u2013 was a decisive factor that took precedence over considerations relating to the child\u2019s status as an illegal immigrant. It found that the unsuitable living conditions imposed on the children concerned had caused them great emotional and mental suffering and had thus exceeded the threshold of seriousness for the purposes of Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

The Council of Europe Special Representative of the Secretary General on migration and refugees, Mr Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bo\u010dek, noted the presence of a separate living area with two rooms for families, as well as a separate internal courtyard with a playground for children, at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre during his visit in the summer of 2016 (see paragraph 66 above). However, there was no mention of such a separate area reserved for families or any playground in the aforementioned reports of the National Human Rights Institution of Turkey or the CPT. Indeed, the NHRI was critical of the fact that families with children were not being kept in a separate area, despite the requirement to that effect in section\u00a059(1)(\u00e7) of Law no. 6458, and the CPT expressly indicated in its report that there was no play area for children at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre at the material time.

The Court would stress that the manifestly adverse conditions of detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre, which have led to findings of violation even in respect of adult applicants, were particularly unsuitable for the applicant children in view of their extreme vulnerability and were completely at odds with the widely recognised international principles on the protection of children (see, mutatis mutandis, Popov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a096 and the international texts noted in paragraphs 67-79 above). In these circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine the applicants\u2019 remaining complaints under Article 3 regarding their detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre, such as the failure of the authorities to provide the minor applicants with the necessary medical assistance in a timely manner (see Alimov, cited above, \u00a7 84, and Boudraa v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a01009/16, \u00a7 36, 28 November 2017).",

Importantly, the Government have also not explained if and how the Gaziantep Removal Centre had been equipped with the essential infrastructure required for the detention of young children with their parents. To the contrary, the photographs they have submitted suggest that the minor applicants were made to sleep on iron-frame bunkbeds with sharp edges, which could be dangerous for children their age (see Popov, cited above, \u00a7 95 for a critique on this particular point), and that they were not provided with any indoor or outdoor play areas .

They reiterated their complaints on 29 December 2014 and urged the Constitutional Court to decide their case, stressing once again that the unsuitable detention conditions were putting the minor applicants\u2019 physical integrity seriously in danger (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). On 9\u00a0January 2015 the Constitutional Court dismissed their request for an interim measure, holding that the material conditions of their detention did not constitute an immediate and serious risk to their lives or their physical or mental integrity.

The Court notes that after lodging their application with the Constitutional Court, the applicants continued to be detained in highly unsuitable conditions for a not insignificant period. Having particular regard to the apparent vulnerability of the three minor applicants and to the well-known problems at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre \u2013 which had been flagged up not only by international bodies but also by domestic authorities (see paragraphs 46-52 above) \u2013 and to the fact that the Constitutional Court was apparently acting as a first-instance court in the circumstances, that court could have been expected to show the necessary diligence in reviewing the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 3. The Court stresses in this connection that the detention of children in adverse conditions for even very short periods of time, and even where they had been accompanied by an adult, has been found to amount to a violation of Article 3 (see, for instance, Muskhadzhiyeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63; Popov, cited above, 103; and A.B. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115).

The Constitutional Court opted for the latter option: in a decision it delivered on 24 May 2018, the Constitutional Court held \u2013 relying on its findings in the recent case of B.T. \u2013 that \u201cin the event of the release of the foreigner, the effective legal mechanism was that of the action for a full remedy\u201d before the administrative courts, which had the capacity to compensate the victims as necessary (see paragraphs 36 and 60 above).

Therefore, a purely compensatory remedy available after release, whether before the Constitutional Court or elsewhere, could not have provided them with an effective remedy in respect of their specific complaints under Article\u00a03 (see, mutatis mutandis, Vasilescu, cited above). The Court reiterates that the special importance attached by the Convention to Article 3 requires that the States Parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3 rapidly. Otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would legitimise particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weaken the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98).",

The new law now provides a clear legal basis and sets out the procedure governing detention in an immigration context.

It nevertheless reiterates that the detention of young children in unsuitable conditions, as found in paragraphs\u00a0111 and 112 above in the context of Article 3, may on its own lead to a finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1, regardless of whether the children were accompanied by an adult or not (see, for instance, Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102-05, and Muskhadzhiyeva and Others, \u00a7\u00a074, both cited above). The Court also notes that various international bodies, including the Council of Europe, are increasingly calling on States to expeditiously and completely cease or eradicate the immigration detention of children (see paragraphs 6779 above). The Court has found that the presence in a detention centre of a child accompanying its parents will comply with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) only where the national authorities can establish that such a measure of last resort was taken after verification that no other measure involving a lesser restriction of their freedom could be implemented (see, for instance, Popov, cited above, \u00a7 119; and A.B.\u00a0and\u00a0Others, \u00a7 123).",

In this connection, it is inconceivable that in a State subject to the rule of law a person should continue to be deprived of his or her liberty despite the existence of a court order for his or her release (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 173, ECHR 2004II).

Administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than a few hours (see, for instance, Ruslan Yakovenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a05425/11, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 69, ECHR 2015, where a delay of two days led to a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1).",

The Advisory Opinion of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the joint general comment of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Migrant Workers have both stated that \u201cwhen the child\u2019s best interests require keeping the family together, the imperative requirement not to deprive the child of liberty extends to the child\u2019s parents and requires the authorities to choose non-custodial solutions for the entire family\u201d (see paragraphs 79 and 70 above, respectively). The PACE in its Resolution 2020 has similarly called on Member States to adopt alternatives to detention that meet the best interests of the child and allow children to remain with their family members in non-custodial, community-based contexts while their immigration status is being resolved. In addition, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants emphasised that States must carefully evaluate the need to detain migrants who are accompanied by their children (see paragraphs 72 and 69 above, respectively). The Court itself has acknowledged, albeit as part of discussions under Article 8, that the child\u2019s best interests cannot be confined to keeping the family together and that the authorities have to take all the necessary steps to limit, as far as possible, the detention of families accompanied by children (see Popov, cited above, \u00a7 147).",

In its first decision dated 21\u00a0November\u00a02014, although the Istanbul Magistrates\u2019 Court acknowledged the absence of a detention order in respect of the minor applicants, it did not rule on the lawfulness of their detention at the removal centre, apparently precisely because there had been no decision ordering their placement there in the first place (see paragraph 17 above).

In these circumstances, it goes without saying that in exceptional circumstances where the national authorities nevertheless decide to detain a child and his or her parents for immigration-related purposes, the lawfulness of such detention should be examined with particular expedition at all levels. In the absence of any information in the case file to explain why the Constitutional Court could not have examined the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 detention while they remained in detention \u2013 which was a not insignificant period \u2013 the Court cannot hold that that court displayed the necessary diligence called for by the circumstances of the case. This is particularly so considering that the case was not complex and the applicants had presented clear arguments challenging the lawfulness of their detention, the accuracy of which could easily be verified from the case file without the need for further investigation.",

This effectively meant that the question of the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 detention during their initial three months in Istanbul was never subject to an effective judicial review as required under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention, which could also undermine their prospects of receiving any compensation for that initial period.",

The Court notes, once again, that the review mechanism set out under Law no.\u00a06458 appears to be wholly ineffective in a case, such as the present one, where the detention of a minor in the immigration context is not based on an administrative decision. Otherwise, however, the conclusion under this head should be seen in the light of the particular circumstances of the instant case and should not be taken as casting doubt on the general effectiveness of the judicial review mechanism under Law\u00a0no. 6458 or that of the individual application procedure before the Constitutional Court.",
