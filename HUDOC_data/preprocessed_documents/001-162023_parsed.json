It has already had occasion to hold that Lithuanian law prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners in the sense of Article 3, and that matters concerning conditions of detention in principle fall within the competence of administrative courts (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania (dec.), no.\u00a059304/00, 16\u00a0December 2003). The Court upheld that conclusion in its recent judgment of Mironovas and Others v. Lithuania (nos. 40828/12, 29292/12, 69598/12, 40163/13, 66281/13, 70048/13 and 70065/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092-98, 8\u00a0December 2015 (not yet final)). In the present case, and in so far as the applicant complains of the conditions of his detention in Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison, the Court notes that he did not take proceedings in the administrative courts in a timely fashion, and for that reason his claim for damages was dismissed by those courts at two instances (see paragraphs 11-14 above). In a similar vein, the Court notes that, with the exception of his allegation of lack of proper medical care in Lithuanian prisons voiced in front of the courts of criminal jurisdiction (see the following paragraph), the applicant also failed to raise before the administrative courts any complaints about having been held in overcrowded cells, or any other misgivings related to the conditions of his detention at Kaunas Remand Prison or at the Prison Department Hospital. It follows, that this part of the complaint must be dismissed for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",

The Court further considers that where the applicant complains about adequacy of medical assistance in prison whilst he or she is still being held in there, a claim for damages is not the remedy to be exhausted (see Tekin Y\u0131ld\u0131z v.

Even though he had been prescribed a special diet, physical exercise and rehabilitation treatment after the first myocardial infarction, the Lithuanian authorities had failed to provide such assistance. As a result, in December 2011 he had had the second infarction. Afterwards, his state of health had only been deteriorating: he was weak, gasped for breath, and would not go out of his cell because any movement caused him severe pain and high blood pressure. Consequently, he preferred to spend all his time in bed in his cell, even though he was allowed to leave his cell for one hour per day to go outside. To make matters worse, the treatment he had received at the Prison Department Hospital and at Kaunas Remand Prison fell short of what was necessary for a person in his condition. In particular, the Prison Department Hospital had not had a cardiologist among its medical staff. Even though he had been prescribed a diet which was low on fat and salt, he had been provided instead with a diet that was intended for women prisoners.

Contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertion, no rehabilitation had ever been prescribed for him by the cardiologists who had treated him at the Kaunas Clinics or the Santari\u0161k\u0117s Clinics for his myocardial infarctions. The Government acknowledged that the Prison Department Hospital did not have a cardiologist on its staff. That notwithstanding, the applicant had been provided with appropriate medical care at all times, including medications to control his condition, and had been promptly taken to the Kaunas Clinics or the Santari\u0161k\u0117s Clinics when necessary. Similarly, taking into account the fact that the applicant\u2019s condition had remained stable and that no worsening in his condition had been observed during his visit to the Santari\u0161k\u0117s Clinics in November 2012, the fact that that visit had taken two months longer to arrange than planned, could not be blamed on the State. Indeed, the waiting list for all patients in Lithuania was the same, and it was customary to wait several months for a visit. The applicant had also had the possibility to have a private doctor visit him in Kaunas Remand Prison, but had never used such an opportunity.

That notwithstanding, the Court is ready to accept that as soon as he had his first myocardial infarction the applicant could have experienced considerable anxiety as to whether the medical care provided to him was adequate and whether it could be properly provided within the prison setting. At the same time, the Court is careful to note that although the applicant\u2019s heart illness was detected two years into his detention, nothing in the case file suggests that it came about because of his being imprisoned rather than by natural causes.",

Once his condition became stable, he was prescribed treatment by medications, provided with exercise and dietary guidelines, and then transferred to the Prison Department Hospital. Therein, he had the second myocardial infarction, an event which in the light of the evidence before the Court again does not appear to have resulted from his detention or to have been linked to any discernible shortcomings on the part of the authorities.

As to the qualifications of that prison\u2019s medical personnel, the Court is prepared to accept that they may not have the same professional experience as specialist doctors working in the best civilian clinics (see Mirilashvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007). However, it has not been demonstrated by the applicant that the doctors at Kaunas Remand Prison were not capable of providing appropriate medical assistance to him, including sending him to the Prison Department Hospital and then to civilian hospitals, where he, whenever it was necessary, regularly sought and obtained medical attention. Thus, in March 2012 the applicant underwent a follow-up examination in the Santari\u0161k\u0117s Clinics, where he was seen by specialist doctors (see paragraph 20 above). Later the same month, the applicant was taken to the Prison Department Hospital, where he was treated for haemorrhoids (see paragraph 24 above). In June\u00a02012 his heart condition was examined at the same hospital (see paragraph 27 above). In the absence of a recommendation that the applicant\u2019s condition should be constantly monitored and treated by specialist doctors, and given that the applicant was prescribed outpatient care (see paragraph 21 above), those measures do not appear to be at variance with Article 3 requirements. Similarly, there being no proof of adverse effects on the applicant\u2019s state of health (also see paragraphs 81 and\u00a083 below), he may not claim that the absence of any necessary medical equipment at Kaunas Remand Hospital could raise an issue under the aforementioned provision of the Convention (see Mirilashvili, cited above).",

The Government\u2019s argument that the delay was caused by general queues in public hospitals does not seem to be implausible. In fact, the applicant\u2019s own argument before this Court was that he wished to be provided with the same level of health care as the general public (see paragraph 61 above). That, indeed, was the case. The Court has already held that there is no obligation to provide prisoners with better health care than the general population (see Prestieri v.

There, according to the Ombudsperson, such a diet was provided to him (see paragraph 17 above). Thereafter, the doctors at the Santari\u0161k\u0117s Clinics reiterated the dietary recommendation in March 2012. The following month, Kaunas Remand Prison, where the applicant spent most of his time afterwards, agreed to the applicant\u2019s request for a special diet for women (see paragraphs 20 and 25 above). It is not for the Court to conclude whether such a diet was central in the treatment and control of his heart ailment, or to take a position on the Government\u2019s explanation that the diet for female prisoners was lower on calories in general and consisted of different products (see paragraph 66 above). Be that as it may, the Court has already noted, referring to the applicant\u2019s health records, that the applicant had regular access to various specialists (see paragraphs 78-80 above). The fact remains that the applicant\u2019s health never showed any \u201ccomplications\u201d, remained \u201csatisfactory\u201d and that no aggravation of it was observed (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above; see on this issue Hummatov, cited above). Accordingly, the Court cannot but find that day-to-day care afforded to the applicant was such as to allow him to monitor his heart condition. Taking into account the applicant\u2019s overall health situation, the diet element alone is not sufficient to conclude that the Lithuanian authorities tangibly failed in their obligation to protect the applicant\u2019s health, to engage their responsibility under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Prestieri, cited above, \u00a7 76). No arguments have been submitted to the Court to demonstrate that after February 2013 (see paragraph 33 above) the quality of the treatment available to the applicant for his heart condition diminished.",

The medical board which performed that assessment comprised a surgeon with 35 years\u2019 experience and, on the specific instructions of the court, a cardiologist, namely a professor in cardiology from a public hospital, the Kaunas Clinics. Having assessed the level of the applicant\u2019s disability, the medical board accepted that his health situation was serious. Nonetheless, the board did not recommend his release from detention on health grounds (see paragraph 41 above). That report was later relied on by the Supreme Court, which found nothing to doubt its validity (see paragraph 46 above). Accordingly, the domestic courts gave serious consideration to the applicant\u2019s state of health in connection with his detention. The applicant did not submit that there had been any other medical assessments during his detention, except for the statements of the Upninkai Polyclinic, that would contradict those conclusions. The Court therefore sees no cause to depart from the domestic courts\u2019 findings, which were based on their direct knowledge of the facts of the case.",
