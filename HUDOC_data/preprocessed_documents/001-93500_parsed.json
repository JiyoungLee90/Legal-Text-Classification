Italy [GC], no 26772/95, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2000-IV).

The Court observes that, according to its constant case-law, measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve an inevitable element of suffering or humiliation. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Vala\u0161inas v.

In particular, allegations of overcrowding in correctional institutions have been examined with reference to the fact that personal space in the units must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees in correctional colonies during the daytime, which ensures that they have unobstructed access to natural light and air (see Nurmagomedov v.

The Court has previously examined complaints concerning the deployment of specialpurpose squadrons for conducting routine searches in correctional facilities (see Dedovskiy and Others v. Russia, no. 7178/03, \u00a7\u00a7 74-79, 15\u00a0May 2008). In that case the Court, having examined detailed submissions concerning the circumstances of such operations made by the parties, was able to establish a link between the manner in which force was used against inmates and the injuries sustained by the applicant. In the present case, however, the Court is not in possession of sufficient details concerning the events at issue. In particular, the applicant did not provide the Court with any such account, nor did the fellow inmates who wrote the statements in support of his complaint. In particular, it does not appear that L., A., K. or G. (inmates who originally confirmed the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment) were subjected to, or were eyewitnesses of, the alleged illtreatment. Furthermore, the file contains no conclusive evidence concerning the origin of the bruises seen on the applicant by other inmates. Even if the Court were to disregard the subsequent repudiation of their submissions by A. and K., the four original 2002 statements contain insufficient details to enable the Court to establish that the injuries described by them occurred on 6 February 2002, or that the applicant requested and was denied a medical examination.",

However, it notes that this refusal was not covered by any of the grounds provided for by Article 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure to which the court referred as the basis for the refusal. Accordingly, its rejection of the claims was not based on the Code of Civil Procedure.",

The Code of Civil Procedure does not provide for the possibility of relying on other legislation for limiting access to court. Accordingly there has been no legal ground for rejecting the applicant\u2019s claims.
