On the first two occasions the judges themselves had declared that they were biased and consented to their exclusion; therefore, no deeper analysis or reasoning was required to ascertain the cause of bias. In the third occasion, however, the judge had not accepted that they had been biased and the applicant had not adduced any further concrete reasons which would clearly substantiate that the judge had nonetheless lacked objectivity.",

To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal falling within its scope to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Piersack v. Belgium, 1 October 1982, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 53; and Grieves v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 57067/00, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2003XII (extracts)).",

As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will or has arranged to have a case assigned to himself for personal reasons (see\u00a0De\u00a0Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, \u00a7 25, Series A no. 86). The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long-established in the case-law of the Court (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 43).",

In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article 6 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test).",

In this respect even appearances may be of some importance (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 45, Reports 1998VIII; and Morel v. France, no.\u00a034130/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR\u00a02000VI). When it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, 7 August 1996, \u00a7 58, Reports 1996III; and Wettstein\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 44, ECHR\u00a02000XII).",

The Court draws attention to the fact that the reason for which Dr V. withdrew voluntarily from a previous case involving the applicant was their daily work relationship (see paragraph 9). This situation had not changed since then and the applicant was at the material time still working as a lawyer in that region. While the Court does not consider that the existence of a work relationship between a judge and a lawyer practising in the court concerned necessarily entails a lack of impartiality on the part of the former, the decisive factor in the present case is the fact that Dr V. had previously withdrawn on that very ground, which still pertained when he later participated in the decision to dismiss the applicant\u2019s appeal. Therefore, the Court finds that no sufficient guarantees were provided to exclude legitimate doubt as to his impartiality towards the applicant. For the Court, this is so despite the fact that the neutrality of the remaining two judges in the panel has not been called into question, because the doubt as to bias on the side of the president of the panel casts doubt on the impartiality of the whole panel.",
