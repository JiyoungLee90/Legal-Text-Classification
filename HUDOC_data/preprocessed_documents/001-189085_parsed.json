In their judgments of 22\u00a0May and 18 July 2008 the Tbilisi City Court and the Tbilisi Court of Appeal respectively held that the applicant\u2019s guilt was also confirmed by other evidence (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). Among the other evidence relied on, the courts listed the statement of the investigator in charge of the case, the results of the examination of the crime scene, the report on the applicant\u2019s arrest and the search of his person, and the report on the search of the applicant\u2019s home. The courts did not, however, explain how that evidence proved the applicant\u2019s guilt. None of the searches had revealed any unlawful object with a connection to the offence in question, and the investigator had simply recounted the initial stage of the investigation. It thus appears that the applicant\u2019s conviction was principally based on the victim\u2019s evidence and the forensic reports, which primarily implied that the applicant had taken the taxi in question on the day of the crime.",

For the rest, he concluded that the proposed witnesses had not seen the applicant at the actual time of the commission of the offence (see paragraph 7 above). The prosecutor confirmed that rejection. The applicant subsequently sought leave to call those witnesses before the trial court. The latter dismissed the request concluding that it had been lodged out of time. The applicant reiterated his request in his appeal before the Tbilisi Court of Appeal. However, the appeal court rejected it, concluding that the request had not been submitted in writing, as required by Article 231 of the CCP.",

Croatia, no. 51355/10, \u00a7 42, 10 October 2013, and Polyakov, cited above, \u00a7 34-35). In the current case, the domestic courts dismissed the request on procedural grounds. However, at the material time, the CCP made provision for a defendant to call witnesses, if there were proper grounds to do so, at any stage of the proceedings (see Article 231 \u00a7 1 as cited in paragraph 17 above). The fact that the lawyer representing the applicant at that time had been newly appointed could, in the Court\u2019s view, serve as a valid reason for the delayed submission of the request. In any event, during the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, the applicant had filed a request for the examination of the alibi witnesses. It was submitted well in advance and in writing as a part of the appeal to the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 12 above). The latter, however, dismissed it erroneously concluding that the request had not been submitted in writing. The Supreme Court disregarded that procedural omission and rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law as unsubstantiated.",

The Government further argued that in any event, given the solid incriminating evidence on which the applicant\u2019s conviction had been based, the refusal to have his witnesses examined in court had not had a detrimental impact on the overall fairness of the proceedings. The Court notes in this respect the following: the applicant was convicted of the armed robbery of a taxi driver; he maintained consistently, from the time of his arrest onwards, that he had an alibi; it was his only line of defence and he requested that witnesses be examined in order to prove his alibi for the time of the offence. There is no doubt that the application was sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could even arguably have led to the applicant\u2019s acquittal (see Kartvelishvili, cited above, \u00a7 61, with further references therein; and contrast Dorokhov v. Russia, no. 66802/01, \u00a7 74, 14 February 2008). Without going into an assessment of the incriminating evidence, the Court considers that the applicant should have had the opportunity, in line with the principle of the equality of arms, to present the domestic courts with evidence in his defence that might have exonerated him. By preventing him from doing so, in a procedurally flawed manner (see the Court\u2019s conclusion in the preceding paragraph), the domestic courts put the applicant at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention in the present case.",
