This omission is difficult to reconcile with the authorities\u2019 obligation to adequately investigate such complaints even in the face of an applicant\u2019s uncertainty when shown pictures of officers in a photo line-up. In that context, the Court notes that the Attorney General\u2019s Office did not accept that Officer N. had been unavailable for questioning on account of his ailment. Nevertheless, the Attorney General\u2019s Office went on reasoning to the effect that the officer in question could not be questioned either as a witness, because of the risk of self-incrimination, or as a suspect, in the absence of a well-founded suspicion of a crime (see paragraph\u00a017 above). The Court finds little force in this argument, rather circular in nature, which effectively barred the applicant from access to the only alleged perpetrator of whose identity he felt sure and thus deprived him of any opportunity to challenge the alleged perpetrator\u2019s version of the events (see, mutatis mutandis, Kmetty v.\u00a0Hungary, no.\u00a057967/00, \u00a7 42, 16\u00a0December 2003).",
