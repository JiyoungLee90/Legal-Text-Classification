As the Minister of State for Justice had pointed out, Mr. Berrehab no longer satisfied the condition upon which the grant of his residence permit depended; consequently, the refusal appealed against could be justified under section 11(5). As for Mr. Berrehab\u2019s obligations to his daughter, the Raad van State held that the fulfilment thereof did not serve any vital national interest and that those obligations subsisted independently of his place of residence. It added that four meetings a week were not sufficient to constitute family life within the meaning of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention and that the impugned decision would, moreover, not necessarily entail a break in relations between the child and her father, as the latter could remain in contact with his daughter by agreement with his ex-wife.",

As stated in the judgment, he and the mother of his daughter had been married to each other, but they had been divorced by the time their child was born. They did not live together. The mother and the first applicant agreed that he should see his daughter frequently and regularly and it must be assumed that he did so during the relevant period. He was also formally appointed an auxiliary guardian of his daughter. Notwithstanding their contacts, which constituted family life, I nevertheless find, taking into account the circumstances that the applicants did not live in the same home and that the parents of the child were not married to each other at the relevant time, that on balance the first applicant\u2019s rights did not outweigh the respondent State\u2019s interests recognised in paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).

It should be noted that the second applicant was a young girl when her father had to leave the . The family life she had enjoyed with him was limited to what he had agreed with the mother. The child had hardly any voice on the scope of her contacts with her father and the respondent State could not alter that situation by any positive action on its part. Thus, her situation was very precarious. In my opinion, this is an argument in favour of the respondent State\u2019s position in this case. Taking into account the family situation already described, I have come to the conclusion that neither the rights of the second applicant, taken alone, or the combined rights of the two applicants can lead to a finding of a breach of Article 8 (art. 8).",
