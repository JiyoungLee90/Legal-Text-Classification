Firstly, the nonapplicability of the procedural guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention to proceedings in which re-opening of civil or criminal proceedings terminated by a final judicial decision is sought, finds its justification in, inter alia, the essential principle of legal certainty. However, that principle cannot be said to be applicable with the same force in the context of administrative proceedings.
