In determining whether a fair balance exists, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see, for example, AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24 October 1986, Series\u00a0A no. 108, \u00a7 52).
