However, where such courts do exist, the guarantees of Article 6 must be complied with, inter alia, by ensuring to litigants an effective access to the courts for the determination of their \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d (see, among many other authorities, Levages Prestations Services v. France, 23 October 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1544-45, \u00a7 44, and Poitrimol v. France, judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 277A, \u00a7 13-15). The Court reiterates that the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is an aspect, may be relied on by anyone who considers on arguable grounds that an interference with the exercise of his or her civil rights is unlawful and complains that no possibility was afforded to submit that claim to a court meeting the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, inter alia, Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2005-X). Nevertheless, the right to a court is not absolute and may be subject to limitations, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned, since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this matter (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 18; Garc\u00eda Manibardo v.

Where an individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; specifically, such limitations will only be compatible with Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 if they pursue a legitimate aim and there is a proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, \u00a7\u00a057, Series A no. 93).",

Serbia, no. 32299/08, \u00a7 50, 2 October 2012). This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature, given that their particularly strict interpretation may deprive an applicant of the right of access to a court (see B\u011ble\u0161 and others v. the Czech Republic, no. 47273/99, \u00a7 60, 12 November 2002, and Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, 12 November 2002). The Court\u2019s role in cases such as the present case is to determine whether the procedural rules were intended to ensure the proper administration of justice and compliance with, in particular, the principle of legal certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Efstathiou and Others v. Greece, no. 36998/02, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 27 July 2006, and Syngelidis v. Greece, no. 24895/07, \u00a7 41, 11 February 2010) and whether the applicant was able to count on a coherent system that struck a fair balance between the authorities\u2019 interests and his own interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Lay Lay Company Limited v. Malta, no. 30633/11, \u00a7 56, 23 July 2013).",

Serbia, no. 23103/07, \u00a7 31, 2 April 2013). The Court likewise observes that there appears to have been an inconsistency between the Constitutional Court\u2019s and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant wording of Article 491 \u00a7 4 (see paragraphs 28, 7, 14, 17, and 33, in that order). In that regard, the Court reiterates that the authorities should respect and apply domestic legislation in a foreseeable and consistent manner and that the prescribed elements should be sufficiently developed and transparent in practice in order to provide for legal and procedural certainty (see Jovanovi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 32299/08, \u00a7 50, 2 October 2012).",
