Next, they indicated the applicant\u2019s aggressive and provocative behaviour, his threats to kill a prison officer, his statement that he had been a boxer, and his attempted attack on prison officer M.B. The applicant\u2019s previous violent behaviour towards prison officers had been recorded. In the Government\u2019s submission, no more force than strictly necessary had been used.

Again with reference to the CPT\u2019s findings and the Latvian Government\u2019s comments to the CPT, the Court notes that the Investigation Unit of the central directorate of this institution had only three people in post in 2009, and that the remaining seventeen inspectors formed part of investigation divisions in prisons (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above). Moreover, all prison officers, irrespective of their place of work in one prison or another, are considered to be in the service of the Prisons Administration (see paragraph 47 above).

Notwithstanding the fact that the case file does not contain any specific indications of actual collusion or bias on the part of the investigators, the Court is of the view that neither of the investigators presented an appearance of independence; nor did it appear that there were sufficient guarantees against pressure from hierarchical superiors. The Court notes that lack of independence in investigations of ill-treatment by prison staff has been consistently highlighted by the CPT following its 2007, 2009 and 2011 visits to Latvian prisons, and that its recommendation that immediate steps be taken to remedy this situation has remained without implementation for a considerable period of time (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above).",
