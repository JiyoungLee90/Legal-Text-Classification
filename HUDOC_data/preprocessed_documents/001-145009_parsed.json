As a basis for the calculation of their pensions (in respect of the average remuneration of the last ten years), the INPS employed a theoretical remuneration (\u201cretribuzione teorica\u201d) instead of the real remuneration (\u201cretribuzione effettiva\u201d). The former resulted in a readjustment on the basis of the existing ratio between the contributions applied in Switzerland (8%) and in Italy (32.7%), which meant that the calculation had as its basis a pseudo-salary which according to the applicants amounted to approximately a quarter of the salary actually received by them and therefore led to a reduction in the pension itself.",

It considered that other opposing interests, which were also constitutionally protected and which related to the matter at issue, prevailed in the circumstances of the case. It followed that there existed compelling general interest reasons justifying a retroactive application of the law. Indeed, the effects of the new law were such as to avoid a welfare system which privileged some and was advantageous to others, guaranteeing the respect for the principles of equality and solidarity, which because of their founding nature, occupied a privileged position when weighed against other constitutional rights. The impugned law was inspired by the principles of equality and proportionality and took into account the fact that contributions paid in Switzerland were four times lower than those paid in Italy. It thus applied a direct recalculation which allowed pensions to be dispensed in proportion to the contributions paid, thus levelling out any inequalities and rendering the welfare system more sustainable for the benefit of all those making use of it. Indeed, even the ECHR had upheld such reasoning in the Maggio case in relation to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No., although it had not found such a reason to be sufficient to avoid a violation of Article 6. However, unlike the Court which is bound to examine complaints separately, the Constitutional Court had to take a global approach and evaluate a case on the basis of all the relevant constitutional guarantees. The claim of unconstitutionality was therefore unfounded. Indeed, to conclude otherwise would not only have consequences for the pension system but would also go against the spirit of the Court\u2019s judgment in Maggio, which had rejected the applicant\u2019s claims for their pension according to the previous calculation.",

It thus posed a serious problem of coherence in relation to the evaluation of periods worked in Switzerland, in so far as Swiss salaries were subject to a contribution of 8%, compared with 32% for Italian salaries. It followed that the pensions of Italian people who had worked in Switzerland were overvalued vis-\u00e0-vis both other Italian workers who had paid contributions only in Italy and also Swiss workers who had paid lower contributions but who also received smaller pensions. That is why the Government had enacted Law no. 296/2006, which provided that if contributions paid abroad were transferred to the Italian system in accordance with international agreements regarding social security, the remuneration of people having worked abroad, for the period during which they worked abroad, was to be determined by multiplying their paid-up contributions by one hundred and dividing that sum by the contribution rate applicable in Italy in the relevant period.

At that stage the State itself created a disparity which it tried to amend only twenty-four years later (and thirtyeight years after the enactment of the original legal provisions). Indeed, it does not appear that there had been any timely attempts at adjusting the system earlier, despite the fact that numerous pensioners who had worked in Switzerland were repeatedly winning their claims before the domestic courts. In this connection the Court notes that before the enactment of Law no. 296/2006 the domestic courts had repeatedly found in favour of people in the applicants\u2019 position, and that interpretation of the relevant legal provisions (as confirmed by the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 6 March 2004) had become the majority case-law. It follows that, given also that in the decades during which the application of the calculation concerned had been challenged in the domestic courts there had been a majority interpretation in favour of the claimants (save some first-instance decisions), in the present case, unlike in the above-mentioned cases, a legislative interference (shifting the balance in favour of one of the parties) was not foreseeable.",

Indeed, even accepting that the State was attempting to adjust a situation it had not originally intended to create, it could have done so perfectly well without resorting to a retrospective application of the law. Furthermore, the fact that the State waited twenty-four years before making such an adjustment, despite the fact that numerous pensioners who had worked in Switzerland were repeatedly winning their claims before the domestic courts, also creates doubts as to whether that really was the legislator\u2019s intention in 1982.",

In that case, the Court considered that the applicants could not claim to be in a relevant, similar position to Italian residents who have worked in Italy. It noted that, in comparison to Italian workers, the applicants, as persons who chose to work in Switzerland, paid much lower contributions into their social security schemes. Moreover, unlike persons who migrated temporarily to Switzerland, Italian nationals were not subject to the relevant international conventions and subsequent Italian legislative norms. It followed that the applicants and Italian residents who remained working in Italy their entire lives could not be considered to be in a comparable situation for the purposes of Article 14.",

The Court reiterated that in creating a scheme of benefits it is sometimes necessary to use cut-off points that apply to large groups of people and which may to a certain extent appear arbitrary (see Twizell v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a025379/02, \u00a7 24, 20 May 2008), an inevitable consequence of introducing new regulations to replace previous schemes. Bearing in mind the wide margin of appreciation afforded to States in the sphere of social policy, it considered that the impugned cut-off date arising out of Law no. 296/2006 could be deemed reasonably and objectively justified. The fact that the impugned cut-off date arose out of legislation enacted while proceedings were pending did not alter that conclusion for the purposes of the examination under Article 14, and there has therefore been no violation of the said provision (see Maggio and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 71-75).",

Whilst the Court cannot speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings had the position been otherwise, it does not find it unreasonable to regard the applicants as having suffered a loss of real opportunities (see Maggio and Others, cited above, \u00a7 80). However, given the many imponderables in evolving political and economic conditions that could affect future pension entitlements and calculations, an award based on future pensions would be largely hypothetical. The Court further notes that although the Government submitted that the payment should be limited to a specified time, they failed to explain why or to submit any calculations in that respect. Thus, bearing in mind the said considerations and the amount of the applicants\u2019 pensions (see annex) as well as the years each applicant worked in Switzerland, the Court awards the following amounts:",
