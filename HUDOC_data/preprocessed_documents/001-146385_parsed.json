It recalled that compared to other individuals, the limits of freedom of expression are wider in the case of MPs, as they are protected by parliamentary immunity. Nonetheless, to counterbalance this broad immunity, some of their conduct is subjected to disciplinary rules, for example in cases where they violate the rights and interests of a person or, in particular, of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. While such conduct does not attain a level of severity entailing criminal responsibility or civil law sanctions, it nevertheless necessitates remedies. Thus, the Speaker should have the necessary means to prevent abuses of freedom of expression by MPs. Furthermore, the orderly and proper conduct of committee sittings was a prerequisite for the implementation of Parliament\u2019s tasks; and the protection of the latter\u2019s authority could, therefore, serve as a limit on MPs\u2019 right to free speech. According to the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding, the impugned statutory provisions prescribed a gradual application of disciplinary sanctions, ensuring that they were proportionate to the gravity of the disciplinary misdemeanour in that the most severe sanctions, the exclusion of an MP or the reduction of his or her monthly remuneration, could only be imposed for \u201cparticularly offensive expressions\u201d or \u201cparticularly disturbing conduct\u201d. The Constitutional Court pointed out that parliamentary disciplinary law governs Parliament\u2019s internal business and primarily regulates MPs\u2019 conduct as parliamentarians, as opposed to the rights and obligations of citizens; hence, no obligation to secure a legal remedy against such decisions can be inferred from Article XXVIII(7) of the Fundamental Law (section 44 of decision no.\u00a03206/2013. (XI.18.) AB).",

Freedom of expression in Parliament must be understood not simply as the expression of personal views of a member but also that of the member\u2019s constituency.
