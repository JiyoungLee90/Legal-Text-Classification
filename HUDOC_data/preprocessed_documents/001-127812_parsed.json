The New York Convention establishes a cooperation procedure between the Contracting Parties by virtue of which the competent authorities, designated by the two Contracting Parties, undertake the necessary measures in order to assist the creditor in the recovery of maintenance. Each Contracting Party is responsible under the New York Convention for the consequences of the obligations undertaken on ratification of that convention, in particular, for the assistance it provides to the creditor in the recovery of maintenance through the appropriate measures, including those foreseen in its domestic law (see, Huc v.\u00a0Romania and Germany (dec.), no.\u00a07269/05, \u00a7 46, 1\u00a0December\u00a02009).",

The applicants pointed to certain delays in the procedure related to the recovery of maintenance due to the first applicant. However, the Court finds that even if certain delays could be attributed to the Polish authorities, they were not unreasonable in the light of the complexity of the procedure which required constant cooperation between the Transmitting and Receiving Agencies and the first applicant. Furthermore, the Court notes that the Transmitting Agency actively monitored the progress of the procedure with the Greek authorities and on numerous occasions solicited assistance of the Polish Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs and of the Polish Embassy in Athens. In conclusion, the Court finds that the measures undertaken by the Polish authorities with a view to recovering the maintenance payments due to the applicants were adequate and sufficient. It follows that the complaints against Poland are manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

As the whereabouts of the debtor had been unknown, the authorities had lodged an action for recognition of the judgment of 23\u00a0December\u00a02002 with the Thessaloniki Court of First Instance. The judgment, favourable to the applicant, had been given two years and six months later. Two hearings had been adjourned because of the need to obtain additional documents or information. Twice the Greek authorities had requested that a new hearing be scheduled. As the debtor had refused to pay, enforcement proceedings had been instituted. Numerous auctions had been organised but there had been no bidders. After consultation with the applicant the authorities had sought to sell the debtor\u2019s two apartments through an open sale. However, this had not been authorised since it was incompatible with the Greek Code of Civil Procedure.",
