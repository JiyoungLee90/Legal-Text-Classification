In the present case, the Court notes the representative doubled his fees due to the representation before an international court, which the Court finds unreasonable, since, for example, he was allowed to use the Slovenian language before the Court. The Court therefore considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of EUR 1,500 under this head.",
