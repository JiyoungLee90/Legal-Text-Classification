I went to Tomo's house. I was wearing underwear, tights, trousers and a T-shirt. I do not remember exactly when all this happened. When I arrived at Tomo's house I spent some time in his father Feri's workshop. Then Tomo came and took me to his flat. His wife Danijela and their son \u017deljko were there. Tomo told me straight away that we had to go into a room and that he was going to examine me. I did not want to go into the room and Tomo hit me twice with a wooden spoon on my hands and shoulder. His wife, Danijela, told him not to hit me and Tomo hit her hands with the spoon too. Tomo also hit his son, \u017deljko. Then he took me by the hand and led me to the room, where we were alone. He took off my trousers, tights and underwear and threw me on a bed. I was lying on my back and Tomo was touching me with his hand on the upper part of my body over my T-shirt. Afterwards he also touched my genitals, and he did that for some time. Then he told me that I should not tell anyone about it. I cannot say how long it lasted. Tomo then told me to get dressed, which I did, and then we left the room and went back to the kitchen, where we joined Danijela and \u017deljko. Tomo had touched my genitals with his hand, but he had not put his finger inside me. When we returned to the kitchen, Tomo gave me some money and told me to buy myself something and go home. He also said that he would not give me the cigarettes because I might lose them on my way home. Then I went back home on my parents' bike. When I got back home my parents asked me if I wanted to have dinner but I refused and went to bed. I did not tell my parents anything [about what had happened to me] that evening or the next day. The next day when I was at school my mother and Tomo came to take me out of school. My mother took me to the police station to make a statement about what had happened at Tomo's. I told the police that Tomo had touched me because that was what had really happened. I attend fifth grade of a special school and am a very good pupil. I cannot read or write but I can count to ten. At first I did not tell my parents what happened at Tomo's, because I was afraid of them and I did not dare tell them about it.\u201d",

Furthermore, although he had been informed of his right to be legally represented, the applicant had chosen to represent himself. Thus, his defence rights had been adequately protected. In support of their arguments, the Government cited the parts of the Virovitica County Court's judgment of 26 June 2003 referring to the veracity of M.V.'s statements and her mental capacity to give a reliable account of the events in question.

At that hearing it had only been stated, namely by the trial judge, that M.V. upheld the statement she had made before the investigating judge. M.V. had not repeated that statement at the trial, nor it had been read out. M.V. had then made her additional statement concerning the events of that same morning. This additional statement had been made without the applicant being present and had only been read to him by the trial judge. The applicant questioned the veracity of the additional statement, but was not able to comment on M.V.'s previous statement before the investigating judge because it had not been read to him. He further argued that he had not been able to understand the information given to him by the trial judge concerning his right to question the witnesses, the presumption of innocence and his right to defend himself due to his poor education and the complexity and formalism of criminal proceedings. Therefore, the domestic authorities should have appointed him a legal representative at the outset of the proceedings.

This does not mean, however, that the statement of a witness must always be made in court and in public if it is to be admitted in evidence; in particular, this may prove impossible in certain cases (see Asch\u00a0v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0203, p.\u00a010, \u00a7\u00a0 27).",

As a rule these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no.\u00a0194-A, p. 12, \u00a7 34; and Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, ECHR 2001-II).",

In this respect, the Court has had regard to the special features of criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences. Such proceedings are often conceived of as an ordeal by the victim, in particular when the latter is unwillingly confronted with the defendant. These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, the victim's interest must be taken into account. The Court therefore accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence. In securing the rights of the defence, the judicial authorities may be required to take measures which counterbalance the handicaps under which the defence labours (see S.N.\u00a0v. , no.\u00a034209/96, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2002V with further references).",

As to the Government's argument that the applicant had been summoned to a hearing before the investigating judge at which M.V. gave evidence, it is to be noted that although the Government produced a copy of the summons sent to the applicant, they failed to show that the applicant had actually received the summons. Furthermore, the transcript of that hearing does not contain any comments as to the reasons for the applicant's absence or whether he had been duly summoned. M.V.'s testimony was recorded in writing. However, it is to be noted that the language of the written transcript of her statement is very formal and contains elaborate sentences which could not possibly correspond to her actual manner of expression. The report drawn up by the psychologist notes that M.V. was a mentally challenged child who expressed herself with difficulty, could not read, write or count and barely remembered the event in question; in this connection, she simply repeatedly stated that the applicant had hit her with a wooden spoon with which he had also hit his son. Therefore, M.V.'s statement had obviously been worded by the investigating judge, as the  confirmed in its judgment of 26 June 2003.",

What is more, her previous testimony was not reproduced before the trial judge in any manner. It was simply recorded that M.V. upheld the statement she had made at the investigation stage of the proceedings. The Court notes that this must also have been worded by the trial judge, since M.V. was certainly not capable of such comprehension of the criminal proceedings or formal legal expression. Therefore, the Government's submission that the first part of M.V.'s testimony, referring to the events in question, had been given in the applicant's presence cannot be sustained. M.V. did not give her statement in the applicant's presence and she made no statement before the trial court which referred to the events in question. She only made an additional statement before the trial judge which, however, did not refer to the offence that the applicant was charged with. In any case, even this additional statement was made in the applicant's absence.",

The Court notes that the applicant was not provided with an opportunity to observe the manner in which the child was questioned by the investigating judge. This could have been arranged, for instance, by the applicant watching M.V. giving her statement in another room via technical devices. Furthermore, because M.V.'s statement to the investigating judge was not recorded on videotape, neither the applicant nor the trial court judges were able to observe her demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of her reliability (see Bocos-Cuesta v. the , no.\u00a054789/00, \u00a7 71, 10 November 2005). The applicant was not at any stage of the proceedings provided with an opportunity to have questions put to her. Thus, he was not given any opportunity to contest her statement. Nor can it be said that the trial court undertook a careful examination of the statement taken from M.V. since this statement was not read before the trial court with or without the applicant being present. The only evidence concerning M.V.'s testimony about the event in question was a written transcript of her statement before the investigating judge. However, as stated above, this transcript is not an authentic version of her testimony in her own words, but a version worded by the investigating judge in language which could not possibly reflect M.V.'s manner of expressing herself, and therefore could not have provided a complete and truthful picture to the trial judge or the appellate court judges who later examined the case.",

However, the absence of any explanation by the domestic courts in response to the applicant's argument that he had not been given any opportunity to question M.V. about her statement concerning the critical event cannot but be regarded as a denial of the applicant's defence rights.",
