Concerning the alleged lack of reasoning in the domestic judicial rulings, as the Section\u2019s judgment points out (paragraph\u00a025), Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not require the courts to answer the parties\u2019 arguments in any specific detail. Indeed, cases such as the present one dealing with minor administrative offences can certainly be adequately adjudicated in oral proceedings, hearing the parties\u2019 claims, stating the facts as found, deciding the case and citing the applicable norms in a summary judgment. This was the procedure followed by the Soroca District Court. Moreover, the B\u0103l\u0163i Court of Appeal subsequently delivered a longer judgment, which provided an analysis of the applicant\u2019s complaint (paragraph 15).",

                        "content": "The present dissent refers, therefore, to the Section\u2019s ruling on the merits of this case. But I also strongly question whether the Court should have ruled on the merits in the first place. The Section posed the question as to whether the applicant\u2019s complaints were inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(b) of the Convention concerning the absence of any significant disadvantage to the applicant. The Section was certainly justified in posing that question in view of the reduced amount of the fine imposed, as well as the fact that the issue raised by the applicant has been amply dealt with by the Court. But the Section decided in favour of admission because it concluded that the question as to whether the case had been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (provided for under Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention) was closely related to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a06. In my opinion, this approach, which equates an examination of the existence of due consideration by a domestic tribunal with the examination of the Article 6 requisites for a fair trial, is contrary to the very terms of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b). In accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law in Holub v. the  ((dec.), no.\u00a024880/05, 14 December 2010), the requirement of having been \u201cduly considered\u201d should not be interpreted as strictly as the requirements of a fair trial. Thus the Section\u2019s interpretation voids the content of Article\u00a035 \u00a7 3 (b), which represents a reflection of the principle of subsidiarity, and the guarantee that the Court shall examine any complaint brought before it which has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal. Therefore, it would have been preferable to have declared this case inadmissible by virtue of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b).",
