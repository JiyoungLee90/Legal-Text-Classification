The case originated in six applications against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Russian nationals and Mr Globinko, who is a national of Uzbekistan. The application numbers, the dates of the lodging of the applications and the dates of their communication, the applicants’ names, their personal details and the names of their legal representatives are set out in the appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
The applicants each alleged that they had not been provided with a legal-aid lawyer during the appeal proceedings in respect of their criminal cases.
Mr Dubrovskiy (application no. 45690/05) also complained that he had not been able to present his oral arguments effectively at the appeal proceedings because he had participated in them via a video link. Mr Chernenko (application no. 51264/07) also complained that that he had not had sufficient time to review the appeal statement of his co-defendant after the proceedings in respect of his case had been reopened and that the legal fees incurred in respect of his representation during the trial had been recovered from him.
The facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.
On various dates between 2004 and 2008 the applicants were criminally prosecuted for and convicted of various offences under the Russian legislation then in force. All of the applicants appealed, but their cases were examined by the appeal courts in the absence of their respective counsel. The appeal courts upheld their convictions.
In the case of Mr Chernenko (application no. 51264/07) the firstinstance court ordered him to pay the legal fees incurred in respect of his representation in the criminal proceedings against him. On 6 November 2012 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed the order of the first-instance court and waived the legal fees that Mr Chernenko had been ordered to reimburse.
Following the communication of the applications, the prosecutor lodged requests for supervisory review of the criminal cases of Ms Ichetovkina and Mr Dubrovskiy (applications nos. 12584/05 and 45690/05).
Following the communication of the other four applications (nos. 45075/05, 11343/06, 51264/07 and 59378/08), the prosecutor lodged a request for supervisory review of the judgment of the appeal courts. The domestic courts examined his request and expressly acknowledged that these four applicants’ right to legal assistance in the appeal proceedings in respect of their cases had been breached. The applicants’ cases were remitted for re-examination by the same appeal courts. The Court requested additional observations from the Government in respect of these four cases regarding the conformity of the second set of appeal proceedings with the requirements of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention. When the applicants’ cases were heard and re-examined by the appeal courts, they were represented by lawyers, and they participated in the respective proceedings via video link.
The details of the applicants’ cases are set out in the appendix.
The relevant domestic law governing the presence of lawyers in appeal proceedings in respect of criminal cases at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Sakhnovskiy v. Russia [GC], no. 21272/03, §§ 31-39, 2 November 2010, Shumikhin v. Russia, no. 7848/06, § 17, 16 July 2015, Volkov and Adamskiy v. Russia, nos. 7614/09 and 30863/10, §§ 21-26, 26 March 2015, Eduard Rozhkov v. Russia, no. 11469/05, §§ 11-13, 31 October 2013, and Nefedov v. Russia, no. 40962/04, § 17, 13 March 2012.
