Greece, judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, \u00a7 52).

It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts' interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see, among other authorities, Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

The subsequent Travel Order from 1954 abandoned the general requirement that travel to and within Greenland necessitated a special permission, but introduced a provision according to which access to defence areas in Greenland was made conditional on a prior special permission from the Prime Minister's Office or from the Governor of Greenland under the authority of the Prime Minister's Office, in addition to permission from the relevant military authority if required. The Travel Order from 1967 simply repeated that in order to obtain access to the defence areas in Greenland, persons (other than certain military personnel) had to obtain permission for each trip from the Ministry for Greenland or \u2013 subject to the latter's authorisation \u2013 from other  authorities, in addition to permission from the relevant military authority if required.

That was not the case, however, when in 2001 new restrictions on travel to and within Greenland were imposed, namely as regards expedition activities in Greenland, which limited the freedom that had been in force since 1954.

The Court observes that the applicants were in possession of an official map, namely a Saga map, which was a photographic reproduction of the official \u201cSheet no. 76.V.1, , scale 1:250:000\u201d produced by the Danish Geodetical Survey. Both maps indicated, among other things, the  peninsula and the airfield. There was no indication of the Thule Air\u00a0Base, the builtup part of the base, the Thule Radar, the shelters or the road leading from the airfield to the builtup part of the base. Moreover, leaving aside the origin of and reasons for the line drawn on the annex map which allegedly demarcated the defence area, the map in question was an annex to a report published in December 1994 and entitled \u201cReport on the relocation of the Thule Tribe in 1953\u201d. Accordingly, in the Court's view, the applicants could not have been expected to obtain this map in preference to or in addition to the official map of the area they already possessed.",

Thus, the applicants indisputably had the intention of approaching the Thule Radar and the air base. The applicants were arrested at shelter 7, situated on a road, 10.7\u00a0km to the east of the builtup part of the Thule Air Base and 7.2\u00a0km west of the Thule Radar. In the Court's view it must have been clear to the applicants that the Thule Radar and the emergency shelters built along the road, running 18 km in length from the build-up part of the base to the Thule Radar, were part of the defence area. That they were aware of having entered the base area is furthermore confirmed by the fact that the applicants, who had made thorough planning of their trip, had a GPS device, that the Greenpeace website at the relevant time stated: \u201cBut still inside, two days into the Thule Peace Trek are three other activists, who have been walking and camping in Arctic conditions since Monday, and so far remain undetected\u201d, and finally by the photos taken by the applicants showing them holding banners with some of the military facilities of the Thule Air Base visible in the background.",
