Article 329 \u00a7 1, first sentence, of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not only aim at preventing a defendant from delaying proceedings against him by his absence, but also at securing his presence at the hearing, which was both a right and a duty. It was based on the understanding that a court only complied with its duty to establish the truth and to fix a fair penalty if it had seen the defendant in person and had heard his defence. Both under Article\u00a014 \u00a7 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and under the European Convention on Human Rights the right to defend oneself entailed the right to be present. That right secured an unrestrained defence, but was at the same time a duty aimed at establishing the truth, for which the defendant\u2019s conduct and his submissions or even his silence could be helpful.

In particular, in some of the cases decided by the European Court of Human Rights the defendant had not been heard with legal arguments which, in a German criminal trial, as a rule, had to be examined by the courts ex officio. In any event, Article 329 \u00a7\u00a01, first sentence, of the Code of Criminal Procedure complied with Article\u00a06 of the Convention. It only concerned the defendant\u2019s absence at his trial before the appellate court. The fact that his case was not dealt with anew on the merits was a result of his own decision not to attend the hearing without sufficient excuse and did not breach his rights under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(c) if, as was the rule, a trial at first instance had been held in his presence. If an arrest warrant had been issued against him for different charges, it was up to the defendant to resolve the conflict this entailed for him as he deemed best. It was not imperative to resolve this conflict for him by authorising him to be represented by his defence counsel at the trial on his appeal. Furthermore, the fact that defence counsel could not claim a hearing in such a case did not breach the principle of \u201cequality of arms\u201d. This principle applied to a hearing on the merits, which was not held in cases covered by Article 329 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The said provision also did not deprive the defendant of legal assistance within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c). Counsel could claim in court that the requirements of Article 329 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not met. Otherwise, trials in absentia would in fact be authorised.",

Given that the German criminal courts, in a hearing on appeal, had to establish the relevant facts anew, in the same way as the court of first instance, there were no convincing grounds for authorising restrictions on the rights of the defence in the appeal proceedings which were not permitted at first instance. The courts\u2019 duty to verify on their own motion whether the formal requirements for conducting criminal proceedings were met and whether there were bars to such proceedings applied to proceedings at first instance and on appeal in the same way. The rights of the defence, including the right to apply for evidence to be taken and witnesses to be examined through one\u2019s defence counsel and not in person, had to be respected irrespective of, and in addition to, the courts\u2019 said duty.",

It stressed in this respect that, nevertheless, the fact remained that counsel\u2019s assistance was indispensable for resolving conflicts and his role was necessary in order for the rights of the defence to be exercised (ibid., \u00a7 35). Similarly, the Court considered in the case of Krombach that the domestic court should have given the applicant\u2019s lawyers an opportunity to put forward their arguments relating to a point of law (an estoppel per rem judicatam and the non bis in idem rule \u2013 further bars to criminal proceedings) which it had had jurisdiction to examine (ibid., \u00a7 90). It follows, therefore, that according to its case-law it has been decisive that the applicants\u2019 lawyers had been unable to put forward their arguments in the applicants\u2019 defence, including legal reasoning relating, for instance, to bars to the proceedings, irrespective of the question whether the domestic courts had to examine them already on their own motion.",

The other side of the coin, however, is that the accused must listen, not only to the questions put to him, but also to the charges, the witnesses\u2019 and experts\u2019 statements and \u2013 in particular \u2013 to the victim\u2019s report of his or her suffering. A personal confrontation with and awareness of the public discussion on the defendant\u2019s crime and guilt must be seen as a precondition for effective rehabilitation and reintegration into society, which is the basic aim of punishment. Although the lawyer is able to advance arguments in defence of the accused at the trial, he cannot replace his client. If the accused does not attend the trial, where all the questions of fact and law are discussed, the trial loses its main purpose.",

The legislature must accordingly be able to discourage unjustified absences\u201d (see Poitrimol v. , 23 November 1993, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 277A).",

This would mean failing to distinguish the right to legal assistance from the right to be absent from trial. It is undisputed that, had the accused been present at his trial, he would have had the right to defend himself \u201cthrough legal assistance\u201d. Thus, we do not share the Court\u2019s view that the accused would lose his right to be defended by a lawyer as guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention. He is merely denied the right to be replaced by a lawyer, a right which is not guaranteed by the Convention.",

It is difficult to imagine how the repetition of a full examination of the facts and law of a case at second instance, without the presence of the accused, could better serve the purpose of establishing the truth and fixing a fair penalty than the same examination at first instance, in the presence of the accused.",
