The court stated that the custody dispute had to be decided primarily on the basis of the best interest of the child. It noted that according to the report of the psychologists, the child had suffered distress as a result of her separation from her mother but had stabilised with the passage of time. She loved her mother, did not express negative attitudes towards her and it was in her interest to see her more often and to restore normal contacts with her. However, the child felt safe and well in her current environment, where her father and her grandparents looked after her. She developed well and was offered good living conditions. A new change of environment would have a negative effect on the child's development. The court further took into consideration that the child had repeatedly expressed her preference for staying with her father. The court rejected as unproven the applicant's allegation that the father had been aggressive and had prevented the applicant from seeing her daughter. The main obstacle to the contacts between the applicant and her daughter had been the extremely tense relations between the parents who had filed numerous complaints against each other. That atmosphere was harmful for the child.",

The interests of the child are paramount. The child should not be coerced but should be prepared for the change so as to avoid psychological trauma. Each case must be treated on an individual basis, with due regard to the child's age, personal circumstances and emotional links with his or her parents. All possible methods of persuasion must be exhausted. Parents should be warned that refusal to co-operate may result in a modification of custody and contact orders. Police assistance should be used as a last resort, and only where the interests of the child require immediate execution. In exceptional cases, where the custody order has not been enforced for a long time and the relevant circumstances have changed, the enforcement judge may adjourn the case and propose to the competent court to re-examine the custody order. In cases where a parent's refusal to comply constitutes a criminal offence, the matter should be referred to the prosecution authorities.",

The nature and extent of such preparation will depend on the circumstances of each case, but the understanding and cooperation of all concerned is always an important ingredient. Whilst national authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests as well as the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see, Kosmopoulou v.\u00a0Greece, no. 60457/00, \u00a7 45, 5 February 2004). Furthermore, a change of relevant circumstances, in so far that it was not brought about by events imputable to the State, may exceptionally justify the non-enforcement of a final child custody order (see Sylvester v. , nos. 36812/97 and 40104/98, \u00a7 63, 24 April 2003).",

The authorities took into account, inter alia, the fact that the circumstances had changed since April 2001, that the transfer of custody would be harmful for the child in the conditions of animosity between the parents, that the child developed well in the environment where she lived, that the father offered better living conditions and that the child had formed an opinion in favour of staying with him (see paragraphs 67 and 68 above).",

It has not been shown either that the child was in danger or the authorities failed to protect her (see paragraphs 19, 27, 30, 34 and 68 above). The Court also notes that the applicant herself invited journalists to the hearing on 29\u00a0November 2001 and filed numerous unfounded complaints to various institutions which prompted the repeated contacts of the authorities with her daughter (see paragraphs 24, 33 and 42 above).",

Austria, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 77). At all events, the assessment whether a separate examination is called for must be done on the basis of the specific circumstances of each case (see Pini and Others v.
