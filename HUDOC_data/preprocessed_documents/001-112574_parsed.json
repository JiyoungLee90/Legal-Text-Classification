It notes that, despite the substantial number of investigative measures taken, the investigation was criticised by the national authorities themselves for a lack of efficiency (see paragraph 26 above). Furthermore, the criminal proceedings in question were marked by numerous referrals for additional investigation caused, inter alia, by the investigator\u2019s failure to follow the instructions of the supervisory authorities (ibid). The police also had been aware from the outset of the fact that the defendants in the case permanently resided abroad and their availability for the investigative actions at the later stage could be therefore problematic, which required from the investigators to act with particular diligence at the initial stage of the proceedings. The behaviour by the investigating authorities, however, was incompatible with the State\u2019s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into suspicious deaths. Furthermore, the Court is reinforced in this view by the fact that the applicants were not involved, appropriately, in the investigation and only found out about some of the procedural decisions from reading the Government\u2019s submissions to this Court (see paragraph 48 above).",
