Cap. 148 constituted a justified limitation on the right to freedom of expression since its provisions aimed to protect the reputation of another. The limits on freedom of expression had to be directly connected with the aim that rendered them legitimate and the necessity requiring the protection of that aim. Whenever there appeared to be conflict between two rights, the courts should take into account in their balancing exercise that fundamental rights were of equal importance. Reputation was considered to be an integral and important part of the dignity of an individual which, once besmirched by unfounded allegations, could be damaged forever. Its protection was vital for the protection of the rights of individuals and was in the public interest. Hence, the provisions of Cap. 148 did not run counter to the Constitutional protection of freedom of expression.",

Hence, the nature of such an exemption from the ordinary requirement of prior verification of defamatory statements of fact is such that, in order to apply it in a manner consistent with the case-law of this Court, the domestic courts have to exercise a degree of discretion after taking into account the particular circumstances of the case under consideration.",

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which a value judgment may be excessive (see, inter alia, Lindon and Others v. France [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a055). The applicants relied on the defence of fair comment, which required them to prove the alleged factual basis on which their statements had been based. The Court considers that it is not, in principle, incompatible with Article 10 to place the onus of proving, to the civil standard, the truth of the factual basis on which a value judgment was based.",

This is consistent with the Court\u2019s case-law concerning the circumstances in which a defendant in libel proceedings may be exempted from its ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory (see paragraph 49 above). However, the Court does not accept that a defendant in libel proceedings who has failed, because he acted with malice, to establish that his publication was privileged should be exempted from showing the accuracy of such statements in trial. Hence, the obligation on the applicants, who failed to establish that their publications were privileged and relied on the defence of justification, to prove that the allegations made in their articles were substantially true on the balance of probabilities, constituted a justified restriction on their right to freedom of expression under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, with the aim of protecting Mr Aloneftis\u2019s right to his reputation.",
