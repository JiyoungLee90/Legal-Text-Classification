With regard to the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, it observed that the Assize Court had had to rule on a plurality of serious crimes (concours mat\u00e9riel de crimes) within the meaning of Article 62 of the Criminal Code and not a single act constituting several different offences (d\u00e9lit collectif) within the meaning of Article 65, which required a unity of intent, and that the parties had agreed to the wording of the questions put to the jury. The Court of Cassation pointed out that Article 6 of the Convention did not require the court to be made up solely of professional judges, lawyers or experts and that the applicant had not adduced any specific evidence to justify her fear that the jury might not be impartial. Furthermore, the wording of the jury\u2019s guilty verdict in the form of a simple \u201cyes/no\u201d answer was prescribed by Article 348 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. With regard to the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility, the Court of Cassation held that the Assize Court\u2019s judgment had indicated why the conditions for the application of the Social Protection Act were not satisfied:",

It further held that public display of a criminal conviction did not attain the minimum level of severity required by Article 3 of the Convention.

In these circumstances, Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for his conviction. Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced, and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based or sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury\u2019s answers (ibid.; see also Papon, cited above).

In short, it must ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair. Furthermore, in cases arising from individual applications the Court\u2019s task is not to review the relevant legislation in the abstract. Instead, it must confine itself, as far as possible, to examining the issues raised by the case before it (see Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84). As explained in Taxquet (ibid., \u00a7 92), in circumstances similar to those of the present case Article 6 requires an assessment of whether sufficient safeguards were in place to avoid any risk of arbitrariness and to enable the accused to understand the reasons for the conviction. Regard must also be had to any avenues of appeal open to the accused.",

France, no. 53406/10, \u00a7\u00a061, 10\u00a0January 2013). This is especially true as Article 6 of the Convention encompasses the need to understand the reasons why the members of the jury \u2013 as opposed to the bodies responsible for sending the case to the Assize Court \u2013 have decided in the course of the deliberations, after hearing the arguments submitted during the trial, that the accused is guilty. In the present case, the Court observes that the indictment mentioned the offence with which the applicant was charged, gave a detailed reconstruction of the events and quoted extensively from the various expert psychological and psychiatric reports that had been produced. Nevertheless, as to the findings of fact set out in the indictment and their value in assisting an understanding of the verdict against the applicant, the Court cannot speculate as to whether such findings influenced the Assize Court\u2019s deliberations and the judgment it ultimately delivered (see Legillon, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Voica v. France, no. 60995/09, \u00a7 49, 10 January 2013).",

The last question concerned the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility (question no.\u00a05). The Court considers that the questions might not in themselves have enabled the applicant to ascertain which factors, among all those discussed at the trial, had ultimately caused the jury to conclude that she was criminally responsible for her actions (see, to similar effect, Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a097, and Castellino v. Belgium, no. 504/08, \u00a7 38, 25 July 2013). However, it considers it necessary to look at the proceedings as a whole, including the subsequent court decisions which clarified the reasons for the jury\u2019s verdict. Thus, it notes that the Assize Court, composed of three professional judges and the jury, stated in its sentencing judgment that the circumstances relied upon by the applicant, in particular her \u201cmental fragility, depression and character\u201d, could not explain the acts she had committed and did not even constitute mitigating factors (see paragraph 17 above). The Court of Cassation, for its part, gave an explicit indication of the grounds on which the Assize Court had found that the applicant had not been incapable of controlling her actions at the material time (see paragraph 19 above). The Court therefore considers that the applicant could have understood from a combined reading of the judgments of the Assize Court and the Court of Cassation why the jury had rejected her defence of a lack of criminal responsibility at the time of the events and had found, on the contrary, that she was capable of controlling her actions.",

The Assize Court judges therefore contributed to drafting a statement of reasons which partly concerned a decision reached during deliberations at which they had not been present. The Court considers, however, that that fact cannot render those reasons invalid in terms of the right to a fair trial. Since the judges joined the jury in deliberating on the sentence and on the reasons for the decision taken in that regard, they were able to ascertain directly from the jurors the grounds on which they had found the applicant guilty, and together they must have agreed on a line of reasoning which self-evidently had to be consistent with the grounds underlying the guilty verdict. The fact that the Court of Cassation subsequently explained how the sentencing judgment was to be understood in the light of the guilty verdict cannot attract criticism. In a system in which certain decisions are subject to appeal, it is only to be expected that the lower court\u2019s decision should be construed according to the higher court\u2019s interpretation of it, where applicable.",

The Court further observes that the applicant had the opportunity to appeal on points of law against the Assize Court\u2019s sentencing judgment, and made use of that opportunity. In this connection, the Court has held on a number of occasions that the fact that the review conducted by a supreme court is restricted to questions of law is not in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Taxquet (Chamber), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-84, and the references cited therein).

Lastly, the reasoning subsequently provided by the Court of Cassation likewise did not enable the applicant to understand why she had been found criminally responsible for the acts committed (III.).

The members of the jury alone decide on the issue of criminal responsibility, following deliberations at which the judges have not been present (see paragraph 32 of the judgment). Secondly, while it is true that the Assize Court briefly discussed the manner in which the crime had been committed, those observations \u2013 even when read in the light of the fifth question put to the jury \u2013 did not enable the applicant to discern the reasons why the conclusions of the psychiatric reports had been disregarded.",

Accordingly, the Court of Cassation did not provide adequate clarification of the reasons why the jury found the applicant to have been criminally responsible (see Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 99). Secondly, in the light of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrospective explanation does not appear sufficient to rule out the risk of arbitrariness. The reasons for a decision must enable the parties to make effective use of any existing right of appeal (see, among other authorities, Hirvisaari v.\u00a0Finland, no. 49684/99, \u00a7 30, 27\u00a0September 2001, and Hansen v.
