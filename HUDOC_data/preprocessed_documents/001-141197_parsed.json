The Constitutional Court reiterated its established case-law according to which, by virtue of the constitutionally guaranteed principle of the presumption of innocence, no measures effectively amounting to a penalty could be taken against an accused without his guilt having been established beforehand in the course of a fair trial. Furthermore, that finding of guilt had to become final before it could be held against the person concerned.

The principle of the presumption of innocence is closely linked to the right of a person charged with a criminal offence to defend him or herself in the course of a fair trial. By virtue of that principle, no measures effectively amounting to a penalty may be taken against a defendant without his guilt having been established beforehand at a proper trial. The principle further requires that guilt be proved according to law before it can be held against the person concerned. A finding of guilt will accordingly not be legitimate for this purpose unless it is pronounced at the close of a trial which has reached the stage at which a verdict can be given.",

Turning to its related case-law, the Court reiterates that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among others, Daktaras v. Lithuania, no\u00a042095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000-X; Janosevic v. Sweden, no 34619/97, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2002-VII; and Yassar Hussain v. the United Kingdom, no 8866/04, \u00a7\u00a019, ECHR 2006-III). In its recent judgment of Allen v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 25424/09, ECHR 2013), the Grand Chamber reiterated that, viewed as a procedural guarantee in the context of a criminal trial, \u201cthe presumption of innocence imposes requirements in respect of, inter alia, ... premature expressions by the trial court or by other public officials of a defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 93). The Court has previously held in this context that Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 aims at preventing the undermining of a fair criminal trial by prejudicial statements made in close connection with the proceedings. It not only prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law, but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty (see, among other authorities, Minelli, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037; Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035; Butkevi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a048297/99, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2002II (extracts); Lavents v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a058442/00, \u00a7\u00a0125 et seq., 28\u00a0November 2002; and Borovsk\u00fd, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 et seq., 2 June 2009). The Court has held in this context that there may be a breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence on account of prejudicial comments relating to a suspect\u2019s involvement in the commission of an offence made by public officials at a time when judicial investigations were pending against the suspect but before he had been formally charged with the offence in issue (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above). The Court has further specified that Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 may apply where a court decision rendered in proceedings that had not been directed against the applicant in his capacity as \u201caccused\u201d but nevertheless concerned and had a link with criminal proceedings simultaneously pending against him, implied a premature assessment of his guilt (see B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no.\u00a037568/97, \u00a7\u00a067, 3 October 2002, and Diamantides v. Greece (no. 2), no.\u00a071563/01, \u00a7\u00a035, 19 May 2005).",

It reiterates in this context that the object and purpose of the Convention, as an instrument for the protection of human beings, requires that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective. The Court has expressly stated that this also applies to the right enshrined in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 (see, for example, Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 35; Lavents, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126; and Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a092).",

Slovenia, no. 19611/04, \u00a7 62, 18 January 2007). The relevant passages in the judgment concerned his involvement in the fraudulent use of the donated funds that was also the subject of the parallel criminal investigations instituted against him and consequently had a direct link with those proceedings. The Court finds that such statements, notwithstanding the fact that they are not binding with respect to the applicant, may have a prejudicial effect on the proceedings pending against him in the same way as a premature expression of a suspect\u2019s guilt made by any other public authority in close connection with pending criminal proceedings (compare Diamantides, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). The Court considers it relevant to note in this context that in a situation like the one underlying the instant application, an accused being prosecuted separately, who is thus not a party to the proceedings against his co-accused, is indeed deprived of any possibility of contesting allegations made during those proceedings that he was involved in the crime.",

This was the usual approach applied by the criminal courts in complex proceedings involving several suspects in which it was hardly ever possible to conduct and terminate the proceedings against all the accused simultaneously. For instance, when determining the guilt of suspects charged in separate proceedings with having instigated or aided and abetted a crime (Anstifter oder Gehilfen) the trial court was obliged to establish that the crime itself had actually been committed; a mere assumption was not sufficient in this regard. That approach further complied with the principle enshrined in the rule of law that criminal proceedings had to be conducted expeditiously, in particular where they involved an accused\u2019s pre-trial detention, as had been the case with respect to the applicant\u2019s co-suspects in the present case.",

A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. In this connection the Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; B\u00f6hmer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054 and 56; Ne\u0161\u0165\u00e1k v.

While the use of language is of critical importance in this respect, the Court has further pointed out that whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a043; Y.B. and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a048173/99 and 48319/99, \u00a7 44, 28 October 2004; A.L. v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a072758/01, \u00a7\u00a031, 28 April 2005; and Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0125 and 126). Even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126).",

Criminal courts are bound to establish the facts of the case relevant for the assessment of the legal responsibility of the accused as accurately and precisely as possible, and they cannot present established facts as mere allegations or suspicions. This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third persons. However, if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those persons who are accused in the trial before it.",

It is more important to note that, by referring to the applicant throughout the judgment as \u201cseparately prosecuted\u201d, the court underlined the fact that it was not called upon to determine the applicant\u2019s guilt but, in line with the provisions of domestic law on criminal procedure, was only concerned with assessing the criminal responsibility of those accused within the scope of the proceedings in issue.
