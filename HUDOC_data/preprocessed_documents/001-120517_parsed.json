Russia, no. 59498/00, ECHR 2002III). It has been the Court\u2019s consistent position that a person who has obtained a judgment against the State may not be expected to bring separate enforcement proceedings (see Metaxas v.\u00a0Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a7 19, 27 May 2004). In such cases, the defendant State authority will have been duly noti\ufb01ed of the judgment and is thus well placed to take all necessary measures to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for execution. This is particularly relevant in a situation where, in view of the complexities and possible overlapping of the execution and enforcement processes, an applicant may have reasonable doubts about which authority is responsible for the execution or enforcement of the judgment (see Akashev v. Russia, no.\u00a030616/05, \u00a7 21, 12 June 2008, and Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 68). Consequently, the Court has held that the burden of ensuring compliance with a judgment against the State lies primarily with the State authorities, starting from the date on which the judgment becomes binding and enforceable (Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 69).",

Russia, no. 69306/01, \u00a7 32, 20 October 2005). Accordingly, it is not unreasonable for the authorities to ask a creditor to produce additional documents, such as bank details, to allow or speed up the execution of a judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Kosmidis and Kosmidou v. Greece, no. 32141/04, \u00a7 24, 8 November 2007, and Burdov\u00a0(no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 69). The creditor\u2019s uncooperative behaviour may be an obstacle to timely enforcement of a judgment, thus alleviating the authorities\u2019 responsibility for delays (see Belayev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a036020/02, 22 March 2011). The Court has found, for example, that the authorities should not have been held responsible for the applicants\u2019 unexplained failure to follow the domestic enforcement procedure and, notably, for their deliberate and persistent refusal to provide the writs of enforcement (see Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v. Russia, nos. 10511/08 and\u00a05866/09, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31, 31 January 2012). It should be recalled, however, that the requirement of the creditor\u2019s cooperation must not go beyond what is strictly necessary and, in any event, does not relieve the authorities of their obligation under the Convention to take timely action of their own motion, on the basis of the information available to them, with a view to honouring the judgment against the State (see Akashev, cited above, \u00a7 22, and Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 69).",

Even assuming that the failure to resubmit the writ of enforcement to the Federal Treasury Department for the Chechen Republic at the present stage may constitute a legal obstacle to the enforcement of the judgment, the delays that should thus be attributed to the applicants appear insignificant compared to those for which the authorities remain totally responsible. Contrary to what the Government\u2019s argument may suggest, the present situation should be distinguished from the rare cases where the applicants\u2019 uncooperative behaviour was the central obstacle making it legally or practically impossible for the authorities to comply with the domestic judgments in a timely manner (see Belayev, and Gadzhikhanov and Saukov, cited above).",

The Court further notes from the Government\u2019s submissions that the prospects for enforcement of that judgment are somewhat compromised at the present stage. In accordance with its established case-law, the most appropriate form of redress in respect of the violations found would be to put the applicants as far as possible in the position they would have been if the Convention requirements had not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7\u00a012, Series A no. 85). The Court therefore finds it appropriate to grant the applicants the equivalent of the judicial awards made in their favour by the judgment of 1 November 2005, namely EUR 14,015 to the first applicant and EUR 8,468 to the second applicant. The Court finds at the same time that the applicants\u2019 claim for interest on those amounts was not supported by any detailed calculations and decides to reject that claim. Lastly, the Court reiterates that no compensation can be granted in respect of the alleged awards of 10 May 2006, since the applicants were found to have abused their right of individual petition in relation to that complaint.",

While the damage sustained was inevitably heightened by the very long delay in enforcement of the judgment of 1\u00a0November 2005 and the Government\u2019s failure to settle the case in accordance with the pilot judgment (see paragraphs 4 and 5 above), the Court\u2019s assessment under Article 41 should also take account of the fact that the other part of the application was dismissed as an abuse of the right of individual petition.
