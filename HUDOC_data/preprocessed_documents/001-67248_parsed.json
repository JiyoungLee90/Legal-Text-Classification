Having found a violation of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, the Court concludes that, although the correct application of the law is undeniably a \u201cpublic interest\u201d, in the circumstances of the present case it was pursued in violation of the fundamental principles of legal certainty and access to court. Therefore, this argument must be dismissed. In so far as the Government submit that the payment of the State's debt to the applicant under the quashed judgment would endanger the social programmes of local government, the Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Burdov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7 35, ECHR 2002III).
