Above all, the legislature had no alternative but to have recourse to such a definition because to date no more satisfactory definition of medicinal product had been established. The only other solution - the drawing up of exhaustive lists - was not practicable because in this field there were thousands of different products and their number varied on an almost daily basis. A list would therefore never correspond to the reality. Indeed this explained why in its Directive 65/65 the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community had adopted the French approach, a solution for which the majority of the States of the European Union had subsequently opted.

As the Court has already had occasion to note, it is a logical consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application that the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, among other authorities, the Kokkinakis v.  judgment of 25 May 1993, Series A no. 260-A, p. 19, para. 40).",

Like many statutory definitions, that of \"medicinal product\" contained in Article L. 511 of the Public Health Code is rather general (see paragraph 18 above). When the legislative technique of categorisation is used, there will often be grey areas at the fringes of the definition. This penumbra of doubt in relation to borderline facts does not in itself make a provision incompatible with Article 7 (art. 7), provided that it proves to be sufficiently clear in the large majority of cases. The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain, taking into account the changes in everyday practice.",

It has never upheld a decision by a lower court finding that such a product fell outside the notion of medicinal product (see paragraph 21 above). Thus, well before the events in the present case, the Court of Cassation had adopted a clear position on this matter, which with the passing of time became even more firmly established.",

Switzerland judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 26, para. 68). A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, p. 71, para. 37).
