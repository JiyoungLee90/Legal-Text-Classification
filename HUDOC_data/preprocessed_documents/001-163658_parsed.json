It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see Dinchev v.

In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant could not be expected to wait for the extinction of criminal liability of the alleged perpetrator of the offence to which she was victim, many years after making her original civil-party claim and after the impugned events, to bring a fresh action before the civil courts (see\u00a0Anagnostopoulos, \u00a7 32, and Dinchev, \u00a7 50, both cited above). In the circumstances of the current case and notwithstanding the consideration of principle made by the Bucharest District Court (see paragraph 29 above), such an action lodged more than six years after the accident would have been unlikely to succeed since it would have been outside the three-year statutory limitation period.

Once she opted for that remedy, she was entitled to have her claim considered and was not required to have tried, for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the other avenue of redress available under national law (see Dinchev, cited above, \u00a7 51). The Court notes in addition that, even if civil proceedings had initially been instituted, they would have been stayed until the conclusion of the criminal investigation (see paragraph 30 above) \u2013 which in the present case was six years after the accident and, as noted also by the domestic courts, failed to clarify important elements of fact.
