The applicant complained that pending another set of administrative proceedings against the Municipality regarding a competition announced in the same newspaper on 30 March 1997 for 49 posts, the Municipality had announced this new competition, through which it was aiming to fill the available posts, rendering impossible the enforcement of the court judgments in favour of the dismissed employees, including his client.

The court noted that there was no dispute that, inter alia, the municipality headed by Mr Bing\u00f6l had failed to execute certain court judgments.
