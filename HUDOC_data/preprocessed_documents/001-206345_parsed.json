Such contact is essential both in order to learn more about the applicant\u2019s particular situation and to confirm the applicant\u2019s continuing interest in pursuing the examination of his or her application (see\u00a0V.M. and Others v.\u00a0Belgium\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a060125/11, \u00a7 35, 17 November 2016).

Moreover, her description of the events (her head being hit against the pavement; receiving multiple blows while on the ground; see paragraph 9 above) did not correspond to the findings in that medical report (only one haematoma on her leg). The applicant\u2019s explanation of the origin of the haematoma given to the doctor cast further doubt on the veracity of her allegation of ill-treatment (see paragraph 11 above). The psychological report from the Memoria centre (see paragraph 13 above) had been delivered two months after the events and had resulted in relatively vague conclusions about possible head trauma and psychological stress. None of this had proved with sufficient certainty that force had been used against the applicant or that such force, if it had been used, had been serious enough as to make Article 3 of the Convention applicable.",

The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 2010; and Svinarenko and Slyadnev v. Russia [GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, \u00a7\u00a0114, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). Further factors include the purpose for which the ill-treatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it (compare, inter alia, Aksoy v.

However, the delay in the applicant\u2019s actions has to be seen in the broader context of the events in which she found herself.

It is to be noted that some of these arrests of young people, during a period of several days after the unrest had ended, were shown on television and on social media and were thus known to the public. In such circumstances, after allegedly having been through a traumatic experience following her arrest on 7 April 2009 and in view of the continued arrests, it is understandable that the applicant waited a few days before visiting a medical specialist so as to avoid potentially attracting attention to herself again (see, mutatis mutandis, Taraburca v.

While the degree of public scrutiny may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (see, for instance, Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 137, and Krsmanovi\u0107 v.

The use of masks by those 200\u00a0officers obviously was an obstacle to identifying their individual roles, in the absence of a system allowing identification, after the fact, of each individual by special signs or otherwise.

It is true that the applicant did not submit a copy of the psychological report to the authorities and was not immediately reachable after she had made her complaint. However, from her interview of 1 May 2009 with a judge and a prosecutor (see paragraph 14 above), it must have been clear to the authorities that the applicant was alleging that she had been subjected to ill-treatment. The Court reiterates in this context that, even when strictly speaking no complaint has been made, an investigation into allegations of ill-treatment must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that ill-treatment has been used (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a033097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2004IV (extracts)).
