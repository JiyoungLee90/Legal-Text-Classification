The Court notes in this connection that the applicant and an co-accused had attempted to disrupt the process of taking evidence (see paragraph 16 above). It agrees that the applicant\u2019s attempt to obstruct justice justified keeping him in custody in the initial stages of the proceedings. However, this ground gradually lost its relevance as the trial proceeded and the witnesses and co-accused were heard. Moreover, given the absence of any further attempt on the part of the applicant to induce witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way, it is difficult to accept that a single attempt at collusion justified keeping him in custody for the entire period of almost five years.",
