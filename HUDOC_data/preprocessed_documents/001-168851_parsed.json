In that case, it was noted that, despite the difference in the formal outcome of the proceedings concerning similar compensation claims brought by the applicant, the domestic courts had based their approach on the argument that compensation for late payment of salary pursuant to Article 117 of the Labour Code could have been claimed only in respect of the period before a dispute concerning claims for salary arrears had been determined. For the Court, that interpretation of the substantive provisions of the Labour Code had not appeared arbitrary or unfair, and the procedural limitations on the applicant\u2019s access to the courts had not been applied disproportionately. The Court does not see any reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case, as the domestic courts\u2019 position was the same \u2013 Article 117 of the Labour Code provided for an entitlement to compensation in respect of delays in payment of salary arrears taking place before their amount had been determined, which in the applicant\u2019s case was on 6 June 1997. None of the decisions relied on by her \u2013 the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 22\u00a0February 2012 and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions taken in arguably similar cases from about five to seven years after the proceedings had ended \u2013 demonstrate that the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation at issue was deficient or manifestly unreasonable (see paragraphs 26 and 50 above). Moreover, it has not been demonstrated that the present case concerns a situation of divergent domestic case-law potentially capable of placing an applicant in a state of uncertainty as regards his or her claimed entitlement to compensation. Accordingly, the Court holds that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention with respect to the applicant\u2019s complaint of lack of access to a court.",
