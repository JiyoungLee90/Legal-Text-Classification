Accordingly, it noted that from the beginning of the investigation the second applicant and the witnesses had given contradictory descriptions of the aggressor in their various statements and considered that some of the witnesses had been dishonest and that the victim\u2019s father had tried to influence several individuals to testify against P.E. The court also considered that the police line up had not been carried out properly, as the persons chosen to stand with P.E. had differed in physical appearance, in particular their height, length of hair, and posture. It also noted that only one family from the whole block of flats had heard the child screaming. The court was concerned by the fact that despite the alleged physical evidence of abuse (blood stains for example) and other odd occurrences around the house (missing food, moved furniture), the parents had waited a long time before reporting the alleged abuse to the police. Lastly, it noted that his psychological profile indicated that the first applicant was prone to exterior influence and fantasizing, and considered that he might have \u201cput his parents on a false track, either because he did not know who the aggressor was or because he wanted to hide the latter\u2019s identity\u201d.",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. In cases under Articles 2 and\u00a03 of the Convention where the effectiveness of the official investigation has been at issue, the Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time. Consideration has been given to the opening of investigations, delays in taking statements and to the length of time taken for the initial investigation (see Denis Vasilyev, cited above, \u00a7 100 with further references; and Stoica v. , no. 42722/02, \u00a7 67, 4 March 2008).",
