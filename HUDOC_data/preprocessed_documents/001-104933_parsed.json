Firstly, imposing a fine for contempt of court was prescribed by the Civil Procedure Act and was possible exclusively within the context of civil proceedings. This fine was not correlated with the fines imposed under the Criminal Code. Secondly, the contempt of court, for which the applicant was fined, did not constitute a criminal offence under Croatian law, nor was the perpetrator\u2019s guilt being determined according to the criteria of criminal law. Also, the purpose of imposing a fine for contempt of court was not the same as the purpose of imposing sanctions under the Criminal Code, because it was a disciplinary measure against disorderly conduct in court proceedings. Thirdly, the law stipulated that the fine imposed on the applicant could range from HRK 500 to HRK 5,000. The applicant had been fined with the lowest possible fine of HRK 500. The fine was to be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Enforcement Act, and the possibility of converting the fine into a prison sentence was not provided. This sanction was not being entered into any records, and the applicant, apart from paying the fine, had not suffered any other consequences.",

Such rules and sanctions derive from the indispensable power of a court to ensure the proper and orderly functioning of its own proceedings. Measures ordered by courts under such rules are more akin to the exercise of disciplinary powers than to the imposition of a punishment for commission of a criminal offence. The kind of proscribed conduct for which the applicant in the present case was fined in principle falls outside the ambit of Article 6 of the Convention. The courts may need to respond to such conduct even if it is neither necessary nor practicable to bring a criminal charge against the person concerned (see Ravnsborg, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034; Putz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033; Kubli, cited above; Jur\u00edk, cited above; R.T. v.\u00a0Austria, cited above, \u00a7 79; and Veriter, cited above, p. 102).

In the Court\u2019s view, neither the relatively small fine imposed nor the possible amount of the fine attain a level that would make it a \u201ccriminal\u201d sanction (see, mutatis mutandis, Ravnsborg, loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a035; Kubli, cited above). As already noted above (see paragraph 65), unlike ordinary fines, the one at issue is not entered in the criminal record (see, mutatis mutandis, Ravnsborg, loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a035; Putz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037; Kubli, cited above; and Veriter, cited above, p.\u00a0102). Furthermore, section 10(7) of the Civil Procedure Act, as in force at the relevant time, did not provide for the possibility of converting a fine imposed under section 110(1) of the same Act into a prison term (see paragraph 19 above, and mutatis mutandis, Jur\u00edk, cited above; and Veriter, cited above, p. 102). This possibility was introduced with the entry into force of the 2008\u00a0Amendments to the Civil Procedure Act on 1 October 2008 (see paragraph 20 above). However, even then the fine was not convertible into imprisonment on default (see, mutatis mutandis, Balyuk, cited above) since it could be converted into a prison sentence only in limited circumstances, namely if the fine was not paid and the Tax Authority could not collect it in tax enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 20 above, and mutatis mutandis, Putz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037, and Kubli, cited above). In this connection the Court notes that in the applicant\u2019s case it is most unlikely that the conditions for converting the fine into a prison sentence would ever materialise, because the authorities, with a view to collecting the fine, issued a writ of execution by garnishment of a part of the applicant\u2019s pension (see paragraph 17 above), that is, a stable source of income certainly sufficient to cover the amount of the fine. Lastly, according to the practice of domestic courts, a decision to convert the fine into a prison sentence could only be taken after hearing the applicant who would also have the right to appeal against such a decision (see paragraph\u00a023 above, and Ravnsborg, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035; see also, by converse implication, T. v.
