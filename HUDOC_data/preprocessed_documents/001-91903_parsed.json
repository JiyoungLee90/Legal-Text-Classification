[GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 1999II). For the Court, it would be inconceivable that Article\u00a013 provided the right to have a remedy, and for it to be effective, without protecting the implementation of the remedies afforded. To hold the contrary would lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, by analogy, Hornsby v.

However, the Court notes that the enforcement proceedings are still pending. Therefore, the Government\u2019s explanation cannot be considered decisive in the present case. In particular, as already found above, the compensation awarded to the applicant was insufficient. While it is true that this factor alone does not normally render the remedy ineffective, the Court notes that in the present case it was reinforced by the failure of the competent court to execute the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision in a timely fashion; it being understood that the cessation of an ongoing violation is for the Court an important element of the right to an effective remedy (see, implicitly, Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074).",

As the applicant\u2019s case before the Constitutional Court was essentially aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, these domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7 284, ECHR 2006...) while the claim for the costs related to the other domestic proceedings is to be rejected since these proceedings were not aimed at remedying the violations alleged before the Court. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant a sum of EUR 50 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the . As to the Convention proceedings, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, the sum of EUR 500.",
