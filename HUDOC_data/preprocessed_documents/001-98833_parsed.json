In this respect even appearances may be of a certain importance. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public, including the accused.

However, whether such misgivings should be treated as objectively justified depends on the circumstances of each particular case. The mere fact that a judge has already taken other decisions on appeal cannot in itself be regarded as justifying anxieties as to his impartiality (see Castillo Algar v.
