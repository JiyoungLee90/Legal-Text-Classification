Because the early elections could not be held until the Bundestag (German Federal Parliament) had been dissolved \u2013 a process which could only take place by order of Federal President of Germany after a motion of confidence in the Federal Chancellor had been defeated \u2013 Chancellor Schr\u00f6der called a vote of confidence on 1 July 2005 and lost it, with 148 of the 304 members of parliament from the parties making up his government abstaining as requested by the Chancellor. On 21 July 2005 Federal President Horst K\u00f6hler dissolved the Bundestag. This means of securing the dissolution of Parliament prompted discussions in public and among members of parliament, and was also the subject of appeals to the Federal Constitutional Court, which, by a majority, dismissed them and ruled that the disputed procedure was in conformity with the Basic Law (see in particular the decision of 25 August 2005, nos. 2 BvE 4/05 and 7/05).",

It pointed out that there had been sufficient connecting factors in this regard. For example, the applicant company could have contacted the consortium in Switzerland, Mr Schr\u00f6der himself or one of his team to find out when the post for the former Chancellor had been planned or created, when he had discovered the existence of the post and when and by whom the post had been offered to him. The Court of Appeal added that the fact that other media outlets had reported on similar suspicions could not release the applicant company from its duties. Moreover, the company had not asked Mr Schr\u00f6der for his views. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion, irrespective of whether the views of the person concerned should always be sought when suspicions were being reported, the press had a duty in any event, in order to satisfy the requirements of journalistic rigour, to contact the person concerned when publishing speculation relating to that person\u2019s motives, provided that the person could be reached for comment.

The daily newspaper published by the applicant company had not sought to find an answer to Mr Thiele\u2019s question, but rather to convey his view that Mr Schr\u00f6der\u2019s envisaged move to the private sector might have been a decisive factor in triggering early elections.

As in Pedersen and Baadsgaard (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a074-76), through its use of the sentence after the impugned statement by Mr Thiele (\u201cthe early election gambit must now be seen in a new light\u201d), the daily newspaper Bild had ultimately left readers with only one possible interpretation: that the former Chancellor had engineered the elections for his own self-interested purposes. The Government added that while the Court had criticised the applicants in the Pedersen and Baadsgaard case for not carrying out more detailed research and not verifying the statements made by the witness, the applicant company in the present case had quite simply carried out no research at all.

The applicant company, however, asserted that one of its journalists had attempted to contact the government\u2019s deputy spokesperson, S., on three occasions following the announcement that Mr Schr\u00f6der had accepted the new post, and that it had contended as much in the civil courts. The Government simply observed, without providing any further explanation, that the applicant company\u2019s requests to the deputy spokesperson for information had merely related to the NEGP consortium in general and had not been linked to the particular suspicion raised by Mr Thiele.",
