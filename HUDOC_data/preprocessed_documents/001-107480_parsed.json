Interim Resolution 2007 (106) of the Committee of Ministers, to which the Chamber refers in justification of its decision (\u00a7 94), suspended (underlined by me \u2013 A.K.) the examination of the Ila\u015fcu judgment, intending \u201cto resume it after the final determination of the new application\u201d by the Court.

I do not wish to repeat all my arguments in the dissenting opinion in the Ila\u015fcu judgment \u2013 unfortunately they are still relevant for me as the Chamber again applied the Loizidou test in a very different situation. I wish only to say that the presentation of the facts on which the Chamber based its conclusions on the merits is even more selective and subjective than in the Ila\u015fcu case. For example, in the interpretation of the Court\u2019s judgment of 8 July 2004 by the present text one can read: \u201cThe Court noted that until 2001, the Moldovan authorities had taken various measures aimed at obtaining the applicant\u2019s release and that as a result, Mr. Ila\u015fcu was released in May 2001\u201d (\u00a7 10). What is more interesting is that in the Ila\u015fcu judgment it is written in black and white: \u201cAfter Mr. Ila\u015fcu\u2019s release the representative of Mr. Le\u015fco submitted in a letter received by the Court on 1 June 2001 that the release had been prompted by the Russian authorities\u2019 intercession with the Transdniestrian authorities\u201d (see, for more details, \u00a7 283 of the Ila\u015fcu judgment). Moreover, \u201cAt the hearing on 6 June 2001 the Moldovan Government thanked those who had contributed to Mr. Ila\u015fcu\u2019s release, in particular the Russian Federation\u201d (\u00a7 284).",

The Chamber even reiterates the Ila\u015fcu judgment\u2019s speculations about the possibilities of \u201ca power such as the Russian Federation\u201d and the \u201clittle that  could do\u201d (\u00a7 108)! The measures of the Moldovan authorities as presented by the Moldovan Government were limited essentially to sending letters (\u00a7 24). That was quite enough to convince the Chamber that there has been no failure on the part of  to secure the rights guaranteed by the Convention (\u00a7 111). Ironically, on the day of the adoption of the present judgment the mass media all over the world announced the liberation of the soldier G. Shalit thanks to over five years of efforts by the State of Israel to secure his liberation, using all possible means.",
