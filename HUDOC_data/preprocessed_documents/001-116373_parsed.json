However, the paternity had meanwhile been acknowledged by Mr P. and the child had been adopted by Mrs\u00a0P. Therefore, the child\u2019s legal status was settled and, according to the evidence obtained by the custody authorities, including a home visit and interviews, she was being raised in a loving family atmosphere and it was not in her interest to be removed from that environment for the sole purpose of establishing the biological paternity by medical tests. The court added that if the fiction of paternity were successfully challenged, the \u2018status of father\u2019 would necessarily fall vacant, but the applicant\u2019s declaration of paternity would not take full effect in the absence of the mother\u2019s consent.

Relevant factors which may determine the real existence in practice of close personal ties in these cases include the nature of the relationship between the natural parents and a demonstrable interest in and commitment by the father to the child both before and after the birth (see Anayo v.

It cannot satisfactorily assess whether these reasons were \u201csufficient\u201d without at the same time determining whether the decision-making process, seen as a whole, was fair and provided the applicant with the requisite protection of his interests safeguarded by Article 8 (see, inter alia, Kautzor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81). Consideration of what lies in the best interest of the child concerned is of paramount importance in every case of this kind; depending on their nature and seriousness, the child\u2019s best interests may override those of the parents (see G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v. , no. 74969/01, \u00a7 43, 26 February 2004).",

It recalls that it has already held that such discretionary powers in this field are not as such irreconcilable with the guarantees contained in Article 8 (see R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski, cited above, \u00a7 75). In this context, the Court emphasises that the present case can be distinguished from the above-mentioned R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ski case in that the domestic authorities refused to bring a paternity action on behalf of Mr T\u00f3th not only because of the mere fact that Mr P. had already legal recognised the child; those authorities also carried out a careful weighing of the child\u2019s best interests and the applicant was involved in this procedure.",

That court concluded (see paragraph 12 above) that the child had developed emotional ties with, and was integrated into, a family which provided her with the necessary care and support. It also observed in this connection that the establishment of the applicant\u2019s paternity would have deprived the child of her existing loving family and social environment, potentially causing such damage to her that this could not be outweighed by the putative father\u2019s interest in having a biological fact established.",
