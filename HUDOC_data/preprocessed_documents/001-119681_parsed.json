Moreover, such an opportunity had been clearly provided by the domestic legislation for this type of dispute (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). It remains to be examined whether, as the Government have suggested, national legislation was so clear on the disputed issue that any attempts by the applicant to challenge the refusal of the Registration Office before the domestic courts would clearly be futile. In this connection, the Court notes that at the time of the events which gave rise to the present application Ukrainian legislation had been recently amended and the provisions of the new Civil Code and Family Code had limited the possibility for changing the patronymic to situations in which the father of the person concerned had changed his forename from which that patronymic derived. In this connection, it should be pointed out that the relevant decree and resolution of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers respectively (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) which allowed such change without demanding change of the father\u2019s forename as precondition remained valid for another three years after the disputed refusal, and even the provision of Article 149 of the Family Code was not considered to impose such restriction. In this connection, the Court takes note of the commentary published by a drafter of the new Family Code, who considered that the said Article did not regulate situations such as that of the applicant and believed that a solution could be found in such circumstances by using the analogy of law or statute (see paragraph\u00a019 above). These findings are sufficient to satisfy the Court that at the material time the regulation of the impugned matter in question, namely the possibility for an individual to change his or her patronymic without a change of forename by his or her father, was not set out with sufficient clarity to indicate to a person concerned that recourse to the domestic courts against the refusal of an application to change patronymic would be completely futile.",

If the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition, the applicable principles are nonetheless similar.

Ukrainian legislation recognises, however, that when individuals become mature enough to make their own decisions concerning their names they may keep or change the name given to them at birth. It is particularly noteworthy, that a person may preserve his or her patronymic, even when his or her father no longer holds the forename from which that patronymic derives. In this way, a possible rupture of the traditional link between the person\u2019s patronymic and the forename of his or her father is recognised. The new Civil Code enacted on 1\u00a0January 2004 provides that an individual can change the patronymic if his or her father has changed his forename. The domestic authorities interpreted that provision as a clear indication that the change of name by his or her father was the only ground possible for changing the patronymic by the person concerned. The applicant argued that the impugned provision did not prohibit a change of patronymic in other situations and that the other normative acts (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) did not contain similar limitations. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, such refusal had, in any event, been unjustified and was an unnecessary restriction to her right to a name, as a part of her personal and family identity.",

At the relevant time various provisions (see paragraphs 17, 20, 21 and 24 above) were in existence, which suggests that the issue of change of patronymic had not been formulated with enough clarity. Even if there is a controversy about the right interpretation of the law, it is undisputed that the right of the individual to keep his or her name is recognised in Ukrainian legislation, as well as the right to change it. It should be observed that the Ukrainian system of changing names appears to be rather flexible and a person can change his or her name through following a special procedure with only minor restrictions, which are applicable in very specific circumstances, mainly related to criminal justice considerations (see paragraph 22 above). At the same time, no broader considerations, like an accurate population registration or linking the bearers of a given name to a family, seem to be advanced by the authorities to pose restrictions on the change of name by an individual. In this situation of almost complete liberty of a person in changing his or her forename or surname, the restrictions on changing the patronymic do not appear to be properly and sufficiently reasoned by the domestic law. Furthermore, no justification for denying the applicant her right to decide on this important aspect of her private and family life was given by the domestic authorities and no such justification has otherwise been established. As the authorities have not balanced the relevant interests at stake (see paragraph 38 above) they have not fulfilled their positive obligation of securing the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her private life. Accordingly, the Court considers that in the present case there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",
