He went on to state that such threats and abductions had been carried out in Bing\u00f6lKarl\u0131ova and \u015e\u0131rnak-Cizre. Various people, identifying themselves as members of the security forces, had raided houses in Karl\u0131ova and detained Mustafa Boylu, Mehmet \u00d6zen, Remzi Gen\u00e7 and Selahattin Oge. B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fahin added that, subsequent to his detention, Selahattin Oge had been found lying in a coma next to a school. Following applications made to the prosecutors by the detainees\u2019 relatives, the authorities had acknowledged these detentions. He further said that Mehmet Dilsiz, chairman of the HADEP\u2019s Cizre branch, had been threatened, arrested and detained by the Gendarmerie Command on the basis of fake documents and without any evidence. Mr B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fahin stressed that the life of Mehmet Dilsiz, who had been threatened by the \u015e\u0131rnak Gendarme Brigade Colonel L.E, was in danger. Mr\u00a0B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fahin speculated as to whether those who were currently threatening Mehmet Dilsiz were the same persons as those who had caused  and Deniz to disappear. Alleging that the commander was threatening Mehmet Dilsiz, just as he had previously threatened , he asked what L.E.\u2019s role had been in the disappearances of the HADEP\u2019s Silopi members. Mr\u00a0B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fahin condemned these incidents and called on the authorities to take up the victim\u2019s cause and reveal the truth.\u201d",
