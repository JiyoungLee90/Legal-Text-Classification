The reasoning should show that the alleged errors in the first-instance court\u2019s decision had been understood and why the appeal clearly would not succeed. This meant that it would be insufficient, as had been done previously, to state the grounds for appeal and paraphrase the statutory requirement for refusing admission of an appeal.

The Supreme Court\u2019s competence to review the High Court procedure encompassed questions of whether a breach had occurred of expressly stated rules of procedure. The Supreme Court was empowered to fully examine the application of the law and the assessment of the evidence in relation to questions of procedure and, if necessary, determine whether an error of procedure had materialised (see NOU 2001:32 p. 777, Rt. 2008 p.\u00a01317; Rt. 2009 p. 222 and Rt. 2009 p. 411).

Article 1-1\u00a0(1), setting out the Code\u2019s general purpose to guarantee a fair hearing, and Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This also covered whether in the light of the points of law raised in the case was justifiable for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal (Rt. 2002 p.\u00a01032). The Supreme Court could in addition review whether the state of the evidence before the High Court suggested that the subject matter could be adequately dealt with on the basis of the written case-file in a simplified procedure. The majority further emphasised that, in assessing whether in view of the points of law raised in the case was justifiable for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal, regard could be had to whether the case raised issues of constitutional law or questions regarding Norway\u2019s international legal obligations or whether the High Court should have admitted the appeal in the interest of legal unity, clarification or development of the law, with a possibility for lodging an ordinary appeal to the Supreme Court.

Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2007II; and K.T. v.\u00a0Norway, no. 26664/03, \u00a7 82, 25 September 2008). The dispute was genuine and serious; it related not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (ibid.). The Court further observes that the City Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claim on the ground that the company had derived his rights from the applicant\u2019s former wife and that the City Court had previously ruled in her favour in its 2001 judgment. The City Court\u2019s 2008 judgment must be considered to have determined the dispute since, following the High Court\u2019s refusal to admit the appeal, the result of these proceedings seen as a whole was directly decisive for the right in question (ibid.). Article 6 \u00a7 1 was accordingly applicable to those proceedings. In reaching this conclusion, the Court is aware that, as noted in Valchev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.) nos. 47450/11, 26659/12 and 53966/12, 21 January 2014), there have been cases in which such proceedings were found not to involve a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights\u201d and the provision was therefore considered inapplicable (ibid., \u00a7 72). However, the prevailing approach seems to be that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable also to leave-to-appeal proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06971; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 115; and Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 53-55, ECHR 2006-VI), and that the manner of its application depends on the special features of the proceedings involved, account being taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein (Monnell and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

This requirement implied a high degree of certainty that the outcome would remain unaltered after an ordinary appeal hearing. It was not a condition for refusing admission of an appeal that the High Court agreed with the City Court\u2019s reasoning or was of the view that its reasoning would stand after the High Court\u2019s review of the case. It was sufficient that the High Court found it clear that the outcome would be maintained, possibly on the basis of a different reasoning than that given by the City Court. It was moreover a condition that the three judges taking part in the decision to refuse admission of an appeal unanimously found that the appeal would not succeed (see paragraph 29 above). A decision to refuse admission of an appeal was taken at the preparatory stage of the proceedings (Article 29-14) and, once final, had the effect that the lower court\u2019s judgment gained legal force (see paragraph 28 above).",

In a number of previous cases the Court has had to examine each type of situations and, without drawing any such distinction, has found that reasoning such as here did not give rise to a breach of the Article 6 fair hearing guarantee (as examples of the first type, see for instance, Immeubles\u00a0Groupe Kosser; Burg and Others; and Sale, all cited above; as examples of the second situation, see Sawoniuk, Nerva and Others; and E.M., all cited above).

The Court is not convinced in the concrete circumstances that the High Court\u2019s reasoning in its decision of 12 June 2008 did address the essence of the issue to be decided by it (compare, mutatis mutandis, Helle, cited above, \u00a7 60) in a manner that adequately reflected its role at the relevant procedural stage as an appellate court entrusted with full jurisdiction and that it did so with due regard to the applicant\u2019s interests (see Monnell and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

Whilst the latter\u2019s jurisdiction did not extend to the merits of the applicant\u2019s appeal to the High Court or of the latter\u2019s refusal to admit his appeal (compare Hadjianastassiou, cited above, \u00a7 33; and Hirvisaari, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031-32), its review did encompass the High Court\u2019s application of the law and assessment of the evidence in as much as it related to points of procedure. It could also review whether in the light of the High Court procedure, seen as a whole, it was justifiable from a fair hearing point of view, notably the guarantees in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, for the High Court to refuse admission of the appeal. This review included whether the subject matter could be adequately dealt with on the basis of the written case-file in a simplified procedure (see paragraph 38 above). Against this background, the Court cannot but welcome the developments in national judicial practice (see paragraph 44 and also paragraph 35 above) and the legislative changes (see paragraphs 45 to 46 above) in this area after the impugned proceedings. Thus, while the said review would be based on the same case-material as before the High Court (see paragraph 39 above), the Court is not persuaded that the reasons stated by the High Court for refusing to admit his appeal made it possible for the applicant to exercise effectively his right to appeal (see Hadjianastassiou, cited above, \u00a7 33; Hirvisaari, cited above, \u00a7\u00a030) against the High Court\u2019s procedure to the Supreme Court, for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Firstly, there has been uncertainty in the case-law of the Convention organs as to whether Article 6 is applicable at all to leave-to-appeal proceedings and similar filtering processes. As noted in Valchev\u00a0and\u00a0Others v. Bulgaria (dec.) nos. 47450/11, 26659/12 and 53966/12, \u00a7 72, 21\u00a0January 2014, there have been cases in which such proceedings were found not to involve a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights\u201d. In Valchev the Court decided to leave the issue open as the applicants\u2019 complaint was in any event inadmissible (ibid. \u00a7 73). For my part, I share the view expressed in the present judgment (see paragraph 55) that the prevailing approach seems to be that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable also to filtering proceedings. However, the above-mentioned discrepancy in the case-law on the applicability of Article 6 to filtering proceedings, and the fact that the Court as recently as in early 2014 decided to describe the two trends without finding it necessary to rule on the matter, illustrate the Court\u2019s prudence in this field.",

According to our case-law, the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases, concerning civil rights and obligations, than when dealing with criminal cases (see Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27\u00a0October 1993, \u00a7\u00a019, Series A no. 274).",

Under these circumstances I certainly agree with the judgment (see paragraph 76) that the City Court did not transgress the normal discretion enjoyed by national courts in assessing the admissibility and relevance of evidence. In view of the fact that the applicant had received the City Court\u2019s inadmissibility decision and judgment, both of which explained the legal situation and that his evidence challenging the 2001 judgment was irrelevant, I do not agree that the High Court needed to elaborate its reasons in order for him to exercise his right to appeal efficiently.

At the same time, it should be borne in mind that Helle did not concern a filtering process but ordinary appeal proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court which \u2013 without an oral hearing \u2013 simply appended the reasons of the first-instance court without commenting on them. As correctly stated in the present judgment (see paragraphs 73 and 74) the manner of application of Article 6 depends on the special features of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein, and the provision does not require that the rejection of leave to appeal be subject itself to a requirement to give detailed reasons.

The contested issues in the domestic proceedings were straightforward and the applicant mainly insisted on arguments which had already been discussed and rejected at previous instances (and in 2001). The Appeals Leave Committee, which had available the same case-material as the High Court, was empowered to fully examine the application of the law and the assessment of the evidence in relation to questions of procedure; and to review whether the procedure, seen as a whole, had been justifiable and in conformity with, inter alia, Article 6 \u00a7 1, which is incorporated into Norwegian law and has precedence in the event of conflict (see paragraph\u00a032 of the judgment).",

It is clear (see paragraph 71) that the Convention does not compel the Contracting States to set up courts of appeal or of cassation, and it does not guarantee a right to appeal as such in civil cases, but persons are to enjoy the fundamental guarantees of Article 6 before such appellate courts. The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the appropriate means to ensure that their judicial systems comply with the requirements of Article 6.",

Specific reasoning may be required in some systems and more stereotyped reasoning may be permissible in others. I am not aware that there is any consensus about the extent to which reasons ought to be given when an appellate court refuses leave to appeal or performs other kinds of filtering. More generally, it is established case-law that the manner of regulation of the right to access to a court, including access to a court of appeal, is a matter in respect of which the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see Berger v.\u00a0France, no. 48221/99, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2002X (extracts), with further references).",

One should not underestimate the need for foreseeability in connection with the organisation of national judicial systems. Furthermore, the specific requirement to give reasons at the appeal levels may also be linked to the allocation of resources and prioritisation of the most important substantive stages of the judicial process, the aim being to ensure that proceedings are conducted fairly and are concluded within a reasonable time.",
