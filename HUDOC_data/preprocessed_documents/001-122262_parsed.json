The time to watch TV programs for prisoners is determined not more than 4 hours in working days and 6 hours in day-off and holidays as a daily rule subject to compulsory implementation. If necessary, this term may be extended one more hour by the administration. It should be noted that the prisoners are allowed to freely watch TV programs of the channels they want. At present, the prisoners watch TV programs in prison from 1800 to 2200. In accordance with the daily rule, during a day until 1800, the prisoners are taken out for a walk, given possibility to take a shower, to pass medical treatment and to see administration. During this time measures are also carried out to ensure security, to search prohibited items, etc. In the future, when a new establishment is in operation, the extension of TV watching time for inmates may be reviewed again because their walking and taking a shower will be directly provided through the cells which will not require additional time.",

In this connection, the Court notes that it is true that during this period the applicant continued to enjoy the rights granted to other life prisoners, such as to watch TV, to have a radio set in his cell, to receive and to send correspondence and parcels, to have access to a library and to receive visits from his lawyer and his family and he cannot be considered to have been in complete sensory isolation or to have been totally isolated from social contact, and that his isolation was partial and relative (see, mutatis mutandis, Rohde, cited above, \u00a7 97, and Cs\u00fcll\u00f6g v. , no. 30042/08, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, 7 June 2011). However, even such a partial and relative isolation aggravated the conditions of his detention involving for him less human contact than other life prisoners sharing their cell with other inmates. For the applicant, human contacts were practically limited to conversations with fellow prisoners during the one-hour walk and occasional dealings with prison staff (see Iorgov v. , no. 40653/98, \u00a7 82, 11 March 2004).",

Moreover, solitary confinement, even in cases entailing only relative isolation, cannot be imposed on a prisoner indefinitely and should be based on genuine grounds, ordered only exceptionally with the necessary procedural safeguards and after every precaution has been taken (see Onoufriou v. , no. 24407/04, \u00a7 70, 7 January 2010, and Ramirez\u00a0Sanchez, cited above, \u00a7 139).",

The Court reiterates in this respect that the solitary confinement should not be applied as a punishment for sending complaints to various authorities and the latter action of the applicant cannot be a substantive reason for his placement in solitary confinement. Nothing indicates in the domestic law that solitary confinement may be imposed when a prisoner sends complaints to domestic authorities. Furthermore, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the Government did not convincingly show why it was necessary to separate the applicant from other prisoners.",

In these circumstances, it is not possible to establish on which ground and by which decision the applicant was placed and detained alone in a cell from 14 February to 25 July 2008. The Court also observes that the prison authority reviewed its decision of 25 July 2008 for the first time only on 4 August 2009, more than one year later. During this period, the applicant was deprived of the opportunity to benefit from the procedural safeguard providing for a regular review of his solitary confinement, taking into consideration the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, situation and behaviour.",
