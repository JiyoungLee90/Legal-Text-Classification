In our opinion, the majority has assumed a function going beyond the competence of this Court. In this case, the Latvian courts duly assessed the behaviour \u2013 including the (lack of) cooperation with both the Australian and Latvian authorities by the applicant herself \u2013 and the personal circumstances of the parties, the relevant provisions of national and Australian law and the foreseeable consequences that returning to Australia would have on the child, as well as the position of the applicant if she likewise decided to return to Australia, with regard to her freedom of movement, employment and social benefits. We believe that the reasoning of the Latvian courts, based on a direct examination of the facts of the case, cannot be considered insufficient or unsatisfactory merely because the majority has a different opinion as to what should have been the relative weight and importance of the different factors comprising the Latvian courts\u2019 conclusions.",

Although it is surprising that the Australian courts should have prohibited the mother from speaking Latvian to her child, the Latvian courts cannot be blamed for a decision issued by an Australian court long after the child had returned to .",
