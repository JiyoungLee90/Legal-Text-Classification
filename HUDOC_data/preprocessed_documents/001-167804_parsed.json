In addition, the FSS denied any involvement in the matter; only through court proceedings was the second applicant able to establish the FSS\u2019s responsibility for the imposition of the measure (see paragraph 11 above). Furthermore, the domestic judgments upholding the exclusion order made no mention of the factual grounds on which that decision was taken. From the documents submitted it transpires that the domestic courts confined the scope of their examination to ascertaining that the FSS had acted within its administrative competence in issuing the exclusion order without carrying out an independent review of whether the conclusion that the first applicant constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact. The courts rested their rulings solely on uncorroborated information provided by the FSS and did not examine any other pieces of evidence to confirm or refute the allegations against the first applicant. The courts thus failed to examine a critical aspect of the case, namely whether the state authority was able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the first applicant presented a national security risk. These elements lead the Court to conclude that the national courts confined themselves to a purely formal examination of the decision concerning the first applicant\u2019s exclusion from Russia (see, for similar reasoning, Nolan and K. v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2512/04, \u00a7\u00a7 71 and 72, 12 February 2009, and Liu\u00a0(no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 89).",
