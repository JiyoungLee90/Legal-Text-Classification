In the course of that examination the applicant was X-rayed on 15, 18 and 19 November 2004. According to him, that was his first X-ray since the incident of 9 June 2004. The experts discovered (in addition to some changes in the applicant's lungs characteristic of chronic tuberculosis) that he had a closed blunt chest injury and fractures of two ribs estimated to be of medium gravity and no older than two months. The possible date of the fractures was established on the basis of the appearance of the broken bones' edges on the X-ray film, which were only to a slight extent covered by callus (a connective tissue emerging on a bone at the site of a fracture and transforming into normal bone in approximately one year). The fractures had resulted from blows with blunt objects. As regards the X-ray film of 9\u00a0June 2004, which was among the applicant's medical documents, three radiographers participating in the examination concluded that it was impossible to identify it as belonging to the applicant, given that it was of low quality and did not mention his name.",

Having regard to the statements given by the applicant's cellmates A. and O., the applicant's consistent complaints of pain in the left part of his chest and the nature of those complaints, as well as the poor quality of the applicant's X-ray film of 9\u00a0June\u00a02004, it was not ruled out that the applicant could have sustained the fractures on 9 June 2004. As to the medical report of 29\u00a0November\u00a02004, according to which those fractures could not have been inflicted more than two months before the last X-ray (15 and 18\u00a0November\u00a02004), that conclusion was based on an assumption that a regular recovery process was being analysed, while the coalescence in the applicant's case could well have been retarded by his chronic tuberculosis (from which he was suffering, as was obvious from his X-rays), as well as by the fact that the prison conditions were not the most favourable for a quick recovery. In other words, the expert found it possible that while indeed under the normal circumstances the callus on the edges of the broken ribs had the appearance of being two months old, in the applicant's case it could have in fact been older (several months). Lastly, as regards the fact that the prison doctors who had examined the applicant shortly after the incident of 9 June 2004 had not seen any visible injuries on his body, the expert noted that it could have been explained by the \u201cdepth\u201d of the haematomas, which could have become apparent with a delay.",

The fact is that this is not yet the case, since economic problems are preventing it from meeting prisoners' basic needs. In the circumstances, the grounds for the restrictions should be reviewed. Indeed, some countries faced with a similar situation have granted prisoners the right to receive an unlimited number of parcels.",

That being so, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V).

Having regard to the findings of the medical report of 29 November 2004 and the prosecutor's conclusions in the decision of 2 April 2005 (see respectively paragraphs 20 and 27 above), the Court does not accept the Government's assertion that the applicant was X-rayed immediately after the incident of 9\u00a0June\u00a02004. According to the documentary evidence, it was not until November\u00a02004 when he was X-rayed for the first time after the mentioned incident, which is with a delay of five months (or three months if calculated from 25\u00a0August\u00a02004). As is stated in a later expert report of 10\u00a0September\u00a02009, which was produced at the request of the applicant's lawyer and was not disputed by the Government (see paragraph 36 above), such a delay undermined the ability of the investigation to establish with precision the date of the applicant's injuries, which was essential in the present case.

In both cases the investigation was criticised for its failure to duly examine other inmates in the prison whose statements might shed light on the events of 9 June 2004. It is true that subsequently the investigator questioned two inmates with whom the applicant had been sharing the cell as of 9 June 2004 and later (A. and O.), and both of whom corroborated his account of the events. The investigation however dismissed the statements of A. with the sole explanation that it was \u201capparently aimed at discrediting the prison administration\u201d, while it disregarded without even commenting the statement of the other inmate (see paragraphs 21 and 33 above). At the same time, the statements given by the prison wardens were accepted as accurate and reliable.

In March 2002 the applicant denied being sick with tuberculosis at all, although he continued to receive medical treatment (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Later on, after his disease was confirmed in April\u00a02006, he was transferred for more than a year (from 4\u00a0December\u00a02006 to 21\u00a0February\u00a02008) to the Kherson no.\u00a061 Prison for specialised treatment (see paragraph 42 above), and he did not complain in his application about the nutrition in that prison. Lastly, the Government provided documentary evidence that after his return to Zhytomyr no. 8 Prison in February\u00a02008, the applicant received a special diet in the framework of the recurrence prevention programme on a regular basis in 2008 and 2009 (see paragraph\u00a050 above).
