Finally, the Assembly held that the findings of the Sivas Military Hospital regarding the applicant's skin lesion and the haematuria found in his urine demonstrated that he had sustained a trauma and that this trauma could have been the result of a direct contact with a hard and blunt object, but it would not be possible medically to establish the exact time of this trauma.",

In this connection, the court dismissed the applicant's parents' testimony as unreliable due to their kinship with the applicant and to the fact that it was not likely that police officers would commit a serious crime like torture in front of first-degree relatives. Moreover, as to the other symptoms recorded in the medical report of 28 February 2001, the court noted, firstly, that the applicant had been medically examined on 23 February 2001 and that no such findings were recorded. Secondly, it noted that the haematuria had been found in the applicant's urine five days after he had been transferred to the army. Finally, it took into account that it was not possible to pinpoint the date when the applicant had suffered the trauma which led to haematuria. It therefore considered that this trauma could have occurred after the end of the applicant's detention. Taking into account the principle \u201cin dubio pro reo\u201d, the court considered that the evidence in the case file did not suffice to convict the accused police officers of torture.",

It further reiterates that, where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured by the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused and to produce evidence casting doubt on the victim's allegations, particularly if those allegations were corroborated by medical reports. Failing which, a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999-V, and Ribitsch v.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention.

Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and as a general rule it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, 22\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 269). Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see ibid., \u00a7 30, and Selim Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a056154/00, \u00a7 59, 19 October 2006).

In this connection, the Court notes that, according to the medical opinion of the Plenary Assembly of the Forensic Medicine Institute, while the exact time of the trauma could not be established, it was opined that this injury was the result of direct contact with a hard, blunt object, which would be consistent at the very least in the Court's opinion with the applicant's allegations of having being hit by an object resembling a truncheon on various parts of his body (see\u00a0paragraph 31 above). In reaching this conclusion, the Court has had regard to the very particular location of the applicant's injury, making it unlikely to be selfinflicted, for example, in a detention cell, and to the fact that the applicant, between 21 February and 28 February 2001, was held in detention first in police custody and subsequently by the army. It\u00a0also attaches significant importance to the fact that the applicant had already informed the public prosecutor that he had blood in his urine at the end of his police custody on 23 February 2001 (see paragraph 12 above). Consequently, despite the fact that, no such injury is mentioned in any of the previous medical reports (see paragraphs 9, 11, 14 and 15 above), and that a red patch of 10x15cm on the back of the applicant was noted only for the first time by the doctor at the at the Sivas Military Hospital on 28\u00a0February 2001, the Court does not find convincing the domestic court's assessment that this trauma occurred after the applicant's discharge from police custody.",
