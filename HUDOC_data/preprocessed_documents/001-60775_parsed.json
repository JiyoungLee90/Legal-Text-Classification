Furthermore, in May 2000 when her husband had withdrawn his main appeal, the order of 26 June 2000 had become final. In both sets of proceedings the delays between finalising the case and obtaining a hearing date in the Brussels Court of Appeal had been due to a temporary backlog of cases before that court.

Italy [GC], no. 335158/96, \u00a7 18, ECHR 1999-I). According to the Court's established case-law, a chronic backlog of cases in a court's list is not a valid explanation (see Probstmeier v.
