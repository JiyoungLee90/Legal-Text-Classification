Under Finnish law his opinion was not seen as a testimony and he could not therefore be regarded as a witness for the purposes of Article 6. The opinion had been communicated to the courts and to the parties, who had presented their counter-arguments. The applicants had the possibility to request an opinion from another legal expert and they could have requested Professor M.C. to be heard before the District Court, but they did not do so. Nor did they call him in the Court of Appeal. The mere fact that the District Court had drawn, to a large extent, the same conclusions on questions of law as Professor M.C. did not mean that the opinion had been treated as evidence in the proceedings. Since legal opinions were not comparable with observations on questions of fact, legal experts were not heard as witnesses before the courts. A written opinion by a legal expert and its relevance as evidence can be compared to academic commentaries on legal issues. In the present case the courts were attentive to the fact that the opinion had been given on the basis of certain facts presented to Professor M.C. by the police, thus weakening its probative value. If a legal expert were to go beyond the legal expertise required, the probative courts were to attach no weight to the expert\u2019s opinion. Under Finnish law it was not even possible to hear witnesses on the content or interpretation of law.",

Although \u201cwitness\u201d has an autonomous meaning within the Convention system, the Court notes that the role of Professor M.C. in the proceedings was not that of someone who had made observations as to the facts of the case but that of a legal expert. In any event, the Court would recall that the guarantees contained in Article 6 \u00a7 3 are constituent elements, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial set forth in Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, inter alia, Artico v.

It is for the national courts to assess the evidence they have obtained and the relevance of any evidence that a party wishes to have produced. The Court has nevertheless to ascertain whether the proceedings considered as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was taken, were fair as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Schenk v.
