When the presiding judge asked her in November\u00a02003 whether she wished proceedings to be resumed, the applicant objected and insisted that the suspension order be formally revoked. While the applicant\u2019s conduct did not dispense the Court of Appeal from resuming proceedings on its own motion (see paragraph 86 below), the Court finds that the applicant herself was in a position to accelerate considerably the proceedings by filing a simple request to the Court of Appeal, which she did not do. The applicant\u2019s conduct might indicate that she lost interest in the proceedings following the sale of the plot of land by compulsory auction.

On 27 November 2001 that same Court, in separate proceedings, rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint against the compulsory sale of the plot to M. However, the Court of Appeal did not resume proceedings in the present case before 14 January 2005. The Court notes in this respect that the applicant did not inform the Court of Appeal about the outcome of the auction proceedings and did not formally apply for proceedings to be resumed (see paragraph 81 above). It appears questionable that this has been necessary as the Court of Appeal \u2013 from having passed the decision of 27 November 2001 \u2013 ex officio knew about it. The Court considers that German civil proceedings are governed by the principle of the parties\u2019 responsibility for the proceedings (Parteimaxime). However, this principle does not dispense the courts from ensuring compliance with the requirements of Article 6 as regards the \u201creasonabletime\u201d requirement (see, among other authorities, Volkwein v. , no. 45181/99, \u00a7 36, 4 April 2002).

She argued, in particular, that she would have won the law-suit if the Court of Appeal had not suspended proceedings in July 1998. She referred, in particular, to the favourable assessment of her claims in the judge rapporteur\u2019s reports of 12 December 1997 and 25\u00a0May\u00a01998 and in an undated handwritten statement. Following the compulsory sale of the land, her motion lacked any prospect of success. The applicant considered that the satisfaction of her claims would have put her in a position to acquire the plot of land during the compulsory sale. \nThe applicant further sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage, arguing that the length of the proceedings had caused her permanent anxiety and fear of injustice and of losing her property. She further sought just satisfaction for the emotional burden she suffered before the  and this Court by not being represented by a lawyer, which was further enhanced by the Government\u2019s allegedly wrong submissions before this Court.

It further notes that there is insufficient proof of any causal connection between the excessive duration of the proceedings as such and the pecuniary damage allegedly sustained by the applicant. \nThe rapporteur\u2019s reports and any handwritten notes that may have been made by the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal are only to be regarded as internal means to prepare the relevant hearing.
