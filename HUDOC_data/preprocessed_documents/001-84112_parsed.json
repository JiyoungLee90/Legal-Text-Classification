They spotted at a distance Mr Nikolov, aged sixtytwo at the time, and Mr N.R., who were testing a homemade metal detector. The leader of the team, lieutenant I.I., assumed that the two were treasurehunters and sent a party to verify his suspicion. Two police officers approached Mr N.R., while two others, chief sergeants B.I. and H.T., moved towards Mr Nikolov. None of the officers was in uniform. Chief sergeants B.I. and H.T. reached Mr Nikolov as he was trying to hide a hoe in nearby bushes. Surprised by the sudden appearance of the two men, Mr Nikolov did not throw the hoe away, but held it in front of him, taking a defensive posture. Chief sergeant B.I. brusquely pulled it out of his hands and threw it to a safe distance. Each of the officers then proceeded to deliver blows to Mr\u00a0Nikolov's head. They then brought him to the ground, handcuffed him, and took him to their colleagues. A car was called and Mr Nikolov and Mr\u00a0N.R., who had also been apprehended, were taken to the premises of the Shumen Regional Police Department. At about 3 p.m., while waiting to be questioned on the precinct premises, Mr Nikolov fainted. An ambulance was subsequently called and he was taken to hospital, where it was found that he had slipped into a coma.",

He also concluded that the two officers who had arrested Mr N.R. should be tried for inflicting light bodily harm on him. He noted, inter alia, that all of the officers had denied any wrongdoing, in spite of the evidence to the contrary, had drawn no lessons from their act and had shown no signs of remorse. He also noted that chief sergeant B.I. and one of the officers who had assaulted Mr N.R. had been charged with inflicting light bodily harm on another person on 18 April 1994, only a few months before the act in issue in the proceedings. Reflecting on the conditions which had led to the perpetration of the alleged offences, the investigator expressed the opinion that these were \u201cthe recent increase in crime which ha[d] led lawenforcement officers to suspect a criminal intent in all citizens until proven otherwise; the physicality of their training at the [police officers' school in the town of Pazardzhik], where, year after year, they [we]re instructed in how to deal with violent resistance but [we]re inadequately trained on the legal aspects of law enforcement, a practice that ha[d] been maintained within the newlyformed rapid response force centre in Shumen, as evidenced by the curriculum attached to the case file: it abound[ed] in physical training classes and lack[ed] any classes in legal training; the sense of authority that the law-enforcement officers ha[d] over the public, who [were] expected to show unconditional submission with no regard to their own rights and interests and with no regard to their dignity and inviolability as citizens; the sense of impunity; the absence of any eyewitnesses to the two offences, committed in a forested area out of the public's sight, and the hope that all [would] be covered up\u201d.",

The possibility of obtaining compensation for the death of a person constituted in principle sufficient redress for an alleged violation of Article 2 of the Convention. Not only had the applicants been awarded the compensation they had asked for in full, but the authorities had charged and convicted the police officers responsible for Mr Nikolov's death. Concerning the officers' penalties, the national courts had had regard to the gravity of their offence, their motives for committing it, and all other aggravating and mitigating circumstances. All levels of jurisdiction had given full reasons for their rulings on this point. The penalties were adequate if compared to the constant practice of the domestic courts in respect of such offences, where the average sentence was three years and two months, as could be seen from the published caselaw of the Supreme Court of Cassation. The sentences meted out to the officers could thus not be considered unduly lenient.",

The investigation of this beating, after initially resulting in a conclusion on 12 May 1995 that the accused should be committed to trial, had then been halted and renewed only on 12 January 1998, after the applicants' numerous complaints to all possible bodies. The criminal proceedings had lasted almost eight years overall and, had it not been for the applicants' persistent complaints, would probably never have resulted in a trial. The State had thus not effectively enforced the laws preserving the right to life and the prohibition of illtreatment. The sentence imposed on the police officers was not sufficiently effective and did not amount to full redress for the illtreatment and death of Mr Nikolov.",

It does not seem that they were prevented from doing so, since by the time the examination of the tort action was resumed they were already aware of the amounts awarded in the criminal proceedings and, in all probability, became aware of the impossibility to recover these amounts while the case against the police department was still pending before the firstinstance court (see paragraphs 29, 31, 33, 34 and 35 above).",

It notes that Mr Nikolov was beaten on 27 September 1994 and died on 1\u00a0October 1994. The investigation was opened on the next day, 2 October 1994, and at first proceeded at a good pace: the officers were charged, the witnesses were interviewed, a number of reports were drawn up, and it was concluded that the officers should be committed to trial. However, after June 1995, when the case was transferred to the military prosecution authorities, the proceedings ground to a halt. While this delay was explained by staffing and backlog problems, it should be noted that the proceedings did not resume until January 1998 \u2013 two and a half years later \u2013 and only after the applicants' repeated complaints. Further delays accumulated later, with the result that those responsible were brought to trial only in the autumn of 1999 and finally convicted and sentenced in 2002, more than seven years after their wrongful act (see paragraphs 1220 and 24, 26 and 28 above). This manner of proceeding appears unacceptable to the Court, considering that the case concerned a serious instance of police violence and thus required a swift reaction by the authorities (see T\u00fcrkmen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 5457). Moreover, the inordinate delay in the proceedings, entirely attributable to the authorities, was relied on by the trial court as an argument for imposing suspended, and not effective, sentences (see paragraph 24 above).",

However, under Article 19 of the Convention and under the principle that the Convention is intended to guarantee not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective rights (see paragraph 49 above), the Court has to ensure that a State's obligation to protect the rights of those under its jurisdiction is adequately discharged. In cases of deaths occurring as a result of the use of excessive force, it must in particular verify whether the State has complied with its duty under Article 2 to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminallaw provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by lawenforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions, and by not allowing lifeendangering offences to go unpunished (see paragraph 57 above). Moreover, as noted in Scordino (no. 1) (see paragraph 49 above), in determining an applicant's continuing victim status the Court must have regard to the result obtained from using domestic remedies.",

They also specified the grounds for imposing the minimum term of imprisonment allowed by law and for opting to suspend it (see paragraphs 24, 26 and 28 above). It is not the Court's task to verify whether their judgments correctly applied domestic criminal law; what is in issue in the present proceedings is not the individual criminallaw liability of the officers, but the internationallaw responsibility of the State (see Tanl\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 26129/95, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2001III (extracts)). However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, while the Bulgarian Criminal Code of 1968 gave the domestic courts the possibility of meting out up to twelve years' imprisonment for the offence committed by the officers (see paragraph 37 above), they chose to impose the minimum penalty allowed by law \u2013 three years' imprisonment \u2013, and further to suspend it. In this context, it should also be noted that no disciplinary measures were taken against the officers (see paragraph 23 above). What is more, until 1999, well after the beginning of the criminal proceedings against them, both officers were still serving in the police, and one of them had even been promoted (he stopped being on the force only because he later chose to resign) (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above), whereas the Court's caselaw says that where State agents have been charged with crimes involving illtreatment, it is important that they be suspended from duty while being investigated or tried and be dismissed if convicted (see Abd\u00fclsamet Yaman v. Turkey, no. 32446/96, \u00a7\u00a055, 2 November 2004; and T\u00fcrkmen, cited above, \u00a7 53). In the Court's view, such a reaction to a serious instance of deliberate police illtreatment which resulted in death cannot be considered adequate. By punishing the officers with suspended terms of imprisonment, more than seven years after their wrongful act, and never disciplining them, the State in effect fostered the lawenforcement officers' \u201csense of impunity\u201d and their \u201chope that all [would] be covered up\u201d, noted by the investigator in charge of the case (see paragraph 14 above).",

Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 127, ECHR 1999IV; and Salman, cited above, \u00a7 137). The Court has found that the authorities were liable under Article 2 of the Convention for the death of the applicants' husband and father. In these circumstances, there was a causal link between the violation of Article 2 and the loss by his widow, Ms\u00a0Nikolova, of the financial support which he provided for her. Concerning the amount of that loss, the Court notes that the applicants have not presented an actuarial report or other documents. It is therefore obliged to deal with the claim on an equitable basis (see Velikova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102). Ruling in equity, the Court awards Ms Nikolova 7,000 euros (EUR), to reflect the loss of income due to her husband's death. As regards Mr\u00a0Nikolov's daughter, Ms Velichkova, it does not appear that at the time of his death she was financially dependent on him; there is therefore no reason to award her any sum under that head.",
