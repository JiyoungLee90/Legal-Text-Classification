The applicant did not apply for bonds in due time and, as a result, she forwent the opportunity to obtain at least between 15% and 25% of the value of the flat, as that was the rate at which bonds were traded until the end of 2004 (see Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 226-228). The fact that bond prices rose at the end of 2004 or that the applicable law was amended in 2006 and provided for payment of the bonds at face value cannot lead to the conclusion that the authorities would have secured adequate compensation for the applicant. Indeed, the applicant could not have foreseen bond prices or legislative amendments and the Court cannot speculate whether she would have waited four or more years before cashing her bonds. Furthermore, the legislation on compensation changed frequently and was not foreseeable (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 191 and 226).",
