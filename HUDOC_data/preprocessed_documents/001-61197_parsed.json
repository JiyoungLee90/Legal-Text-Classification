Consequently, owners should not be required to bring a further action in the court of first instance to obtain a fresh assessment of whether they, as adjoining owners, had derived benefit, since that issue had already been finally determined by the domestic courts.

Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, \u00a7 69). Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. That Article does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of \u201cpublic interest\u201d may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 34-35, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71).",

Indeed, the presumption still exists and the courts that determine the amount of compensation do not take into account the nature of the work carried out or whether it benefits the owners. Instead, the system now in place requires owners who consider themselves to have been prejudiced by such work to make a fresh application to the civil courts in order to prove that their property has in fact been adversely affected. Furthermore, those proceedings may be prolonged if one of the parties decides to make use of the remedies available to it, in which case they will be conducted in addition to the proceedings for the assessment of the unit amount of compensation, which themselves comprise three stages: assessment of the provisional unit amount, assessment of the final amount, and determination of those entitled to the compensation.",
