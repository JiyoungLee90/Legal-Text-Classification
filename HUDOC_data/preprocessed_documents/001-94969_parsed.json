The Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I). In the present case, the applicant lodged his application with the Court within six months of the delivery of the final decision in the case given by the Court of Cassation.

The period to be taken into consideration is therefore five years and eleven months. During this time, the domestic courts constantly extended the applicant's detention using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence and the state of the evidence\u201d. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, At\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey, no.\u00a019735/02, 10 May 2007; Dereci v. Turkey, no.\u00a077845/01, 24\u00a0May 2005). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the length of the first applicant's pre-trial detention contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.

It has thus lasted six years and four months for two levels of jurisdiction.\u00a0The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case and the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).",
