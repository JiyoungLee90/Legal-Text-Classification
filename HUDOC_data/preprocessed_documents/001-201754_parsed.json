The applicant requested that the court select an alternative preventive measure, having indicated, in particular, that he had no criminal record, he was a disabled person suffering from a mental disorder (schizophrenia) and was not fit for detention. He also alleged that he had been living with his family at his address, was supervised by a psychiatric medical institution and was receiving his disability pension at that address; he was unable to obstruct the investigation because the witnesses had already been questioned. He contested the information relied on by the investigator that he had sufficient means to flee as false and unlawfully obtained. The applicant asked for an alternative preventive measure, in particular for release on bail, or under a personal guarantee by two prominent human rights activists, or for house arrest. The court examined the file and extended the applicant\u2019s detention. It held that the nature of the crime which had been committed gave sufficient grounds to presume that the applicant might reoffend, influence and threaten witnesses and other participants in the criminal proceedings, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the proper administration of justice. The extension was granted, as requested, until 6\u00a0November 2012.",

The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention, that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate, and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis. The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through. Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole.

In particular, it found no violation of that provision in relation to a three-year period of detention in a regular facility where the applicant had been examined by a psychiatrist once a month, which appeared appropriate for his condition, and there was no indication that the deterioration in his condition, leading to suicide attempts, could be linked to a lack of medical care (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 95-99, ECHR 2000XI). On the other hand, detention for several years in a facility which, according to the domestic medical specialists, was unsuitable in view of the applicant\u2019s mental condition, and where moreover the inmates suffered from overcrowding, was found to have been in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Claes v. Belgium, no. 43418/09, \u00a7 100, 10 January 2013). Likewise, the cumulative effects of the inadequate medical care and poor conditions of detention for three and a half years, which could be linked with the applicant\u2019s attempted suicide, constituted inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (see Rivi\u00e8re v. France, no. 33834/03, \u00a7\u00a076, 11 July 2006; S\u0142awomir Musia\u0142 v. Poland, no. 28300/06, \u00a7 97, 20 January 2009; and G. v.

In that case, six months\u2019 detention in the temporary detention facility without psychiatric treatment, pending the applicant\u2019s transfer to a high-security medical institution with intensive supervision, was not found to be contrary to Article 3 of the Convention because it had not led to a significant deterioration in his health, and because there had been no known risk of suicide (ibid.).",

On 5 July 2012 he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was referred for a specialist consultation with a psychiatrist, which took place on 6 July 2012 and confirmed the diagnosis. In the course of the following three months the applicant had four psychiatric consultations. The records of those consultations stated that his physical and mental condition was satisfactory, he had no depressive or suicidal thoughts, and his health remained adequate and stable, although at the latest consultation he was observed as being emotionally subdued and irritable. Whenever medical treatment was prescribed to him, it was adapted to his current condition (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In the meantime, on 24 July 2012, an expert commission found the applicant\u2019s mental state such as to render him incapable of understanding the nature of the criminal proceedings against him and to warrant his placement in a psychiatric institution for inpatient treatment because of the risk he posed to himself and others. The expert report did not indicate that it was urgent. The transfer to the medical ward of IZ-77/2 took place on 31 October 2012, which was reasonably soon in view of the continued routine supervision and treatment and the absence of any signs of serious deterioration in the applicant\u2019s mental health. As regards the complaint that the applicant had not been supplied with the prescribed medication unless he complained about disruption to his treatment, he did not provide any details about the specific instances when that had occurred, or any supporting documents.",

Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the applicant\u2019s allegation that his condition had significantly deteriorated as a result. Accordingly, this treatment did not reach the minimum level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court notes that the applicant did not complain about his subsequent detention and treatment after his transfer to IZ-77/2, or his subsequent placement in a psychiatric institution where he underwent successful treatment following the termination of the criminal proceedings against him, which resulted in his being discharged from the hospital (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above).",

The Court reiterates that while Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings, Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention.

The court on 10 July 2013 rejected the request to secure the applicant\u2019s right to family visits without consideration, in particular without finding out why the applicant had had no visits for the eight previous months, and without indicating how his right could be secured through other procedures. The court\u2019s refusal to examine the matter is particularly striking, given that the applicant\u2019s sister was his legal guardian. The Government\u2019s submission that the applicant and his sister could have obtained a meeting and did so relates to a later period, in October and November 2013 (see paragraph 28 above), and therefore cannot be taken into account.",

It further reiterates that the refusal of leave to attend a relative\u2019s funeral constitutes an interference with the right to respect for family life (see Schemkamper v. France, no. , \u00a7 31, 18 October 2005; Lind v. Russia, no. , \u00a7 92, 6 December 2007; and Feldman v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 2), no. , \u00a7 32, 12 January 2012). Whereas Article 8 does not guarantee an unconditional right to leave to attend a relative\u2019s funeral, and even though a detainee by the very nature of his situation may be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Lind, \u00a7 94, and Feldman, \u00a7 34, both cited above). The authorities can refuse an individual the right to attend the funeral of his parents only if there are compelling reasons for such refusal and if no alternative solution can be found (see P\u0142oski v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 37, 12 November 2002, and Guimon v. France, no. 48798/14, \u00a7\u00a7 44-51, 11\u00a0April 2019).",
