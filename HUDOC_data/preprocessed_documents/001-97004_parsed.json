As the applicant\u2019s request before the County Court and the appeal before the Supreme Court were essentially aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, the costs incurred in respect of those remedies may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7 284; and Medi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 50). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant a sum of EUR 1,030 for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and EUR 905 in respect of the proceedings before the Court, both plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on that amount.",
