The case originated in an application (no. 66921/16) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Oleg Leonidovich Lipayev (“the applicant”), on 10 November 2016.
The applicant was represented by Mr K. Terekhov, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 18 January 2017 the complaint concerning alleged failure of the domestic courts to examine speedily the applicant’s appeals against detention orders was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1975 and was detained in Vladivostok at the relevant time.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 18 April 2016 the applicant was arrested on charges of fraud. Four days later the Pervorechensky District Court of Vladivostok authorised his pre-trial detention. The detention was further extended on 15 June and 14 September 2016.
On 25 April, 20 June and 16 September 2016 the applicant appealed against the detention orders of 22 April, 15 June and 14 September 2016. The Primorye Regional Court dismissed the appeals on 1 June, 5 July and 25 October 2016, respectively.
