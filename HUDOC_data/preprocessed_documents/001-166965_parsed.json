However, the cost of this treatment, which was in the range of 16,000 United States dollars per course, put it beyond the reach of the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians. The State had adopted a number of programmes and taken a number of steps in an attempt to combat hepatitis and extend access to treatment, but a lack of funding meant that in practice access to treatment had been extremely limited: currently the State provided funding for the treatment of only 2,000 of the 44,000 patients in the general population who needed it. According to the All-Ukrainian Network, no HCV treatment had been provided in the prisons of the State Correctional Service during the years 2013-2015.",

The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through. Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole. Nevertheless, this does not mean that every detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Blokhin v.
