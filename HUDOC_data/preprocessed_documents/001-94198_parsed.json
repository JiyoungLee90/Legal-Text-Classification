The case had been referred back to a lower court twice. In the Government\u2019s view the procedural delays resulting from these referrals could not be attributed to the Government. As concerns the second applicant, the Government pointed out that the legal problem delaying the proceedings had been due to the offences committed by him as the legal status of the applicant company had been unclear. However, each court had considered the case as expeditiously as possible. As to the Article 13 complaint, the Government argued that the applicants did not have an arguable claim under Article 13.",
