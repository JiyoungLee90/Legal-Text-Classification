In particular, between 5\u00a0January and 10 February 2000 the Forensic Medical Examination Centre of the Russian Ministry of Health had carried out a new forensic examination, and between 19 September 2002 and 25 February 2003 the Forensic Examination Bureau of the Moscow City Health Department had carried out a comprehensive forensic examination. The Government argued that the applicant had contributed to the length of the above expert examinations, because she had objected to the examinations, refused to submit her medical file to experts, requested additional examinations and asked to put additional questions to experts. Furthermore, the applicant had failed to attend the hearings scheduled to take place on 25 April, 8 June and 29 June 2000, and later between 9 October and 3 December 2003. The Government further submitted that the case had been examined three times by the first-instance court, and each time had required determination both of the facts and the law. Furthermore, following the applicant's requests the case had twice been quashed by way of the supervisory review procedure. Throughout the proceedings the applicant had been able to exercise her procedural rights in full. Finally, the outcome of the proceedings had been successful for the applicant. As regards the conduct of the domestic authorities, the Government submitted that there had been no periods of inactivity attributable to them.",

The aggregate delay incurred amounted to less than three months, which is negligible in view of the overall duration of the proceedings. Besides, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that, in any event, the hearing of 3 December 2003 took place and the judgment was delivered in the applicant's absence. As regards the hearings which took place on 29 June 2000 and 9 October 2003, the parties' submissions are contradictory.",

As to the applicant's activity with regard to the appointment and conduct of forensic medical examinations, the Court reiterates that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by national law in the defence of her interests (see Sokolov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3734/02, \u00a7\u00a038, 22\u00a0September 2005). As to the applicant's failure to submit her medical file promptly to experts, the Court observes that the applicant asked the Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics to issue her with her medical documents as soon as the District Court put further questions to the Forensic Examination Bureau on 21 October 1998; however, her attempts proved futile. Later it took the District Court about nine months to obtain those documents on its own initiative. In any event, it does not follow from the parties' submissions as to the circumstances of the case that the Bureau ever answered the questions put by the District Court on 21 October 1998. Therefore, even if the applicant was at fault in not informing the District Court of the Institute's refusal to issue her with her medical file as soon as she knew about it, that is not in itself sufficient to explain the overall length of the proceedings.",

The Court notes that from 5\u00a0May 1998 to 9 October 2003 there was virtually no progress in the applicant's case. In particular, between 11 May and 31 October 2001 no hearings were listed or held, because the case was being transferred to another judge. As regards the remaining period, although it would seem that quite a number of different types of forensic medical examinations were ordered by the District Court, it appears that only two of them were actually conducted: the one that took place between 5\u00a0January and 10\u00a0February 2000 and another, which took much longer and was carried out between 19\u00a0September 2002 and 25 February 2003. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is not called upon to determine the reasons for the delay in preparation of the expert report, because Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. , no. 30546/96, \u00a7\u00a057, 3\u00a0October 2000). Furthermore, the Court observes that the principal responsibility for a delay caused by the expert examinations rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, \u00a7\u00a032).",
