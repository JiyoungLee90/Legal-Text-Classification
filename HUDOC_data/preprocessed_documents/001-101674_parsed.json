In particular, she pleaded that there had been no acknowledgment by the State as the domestic courts had convicted S. for negligence and forgery, but not for unintentional murder as charged initially, and further had exempted him from the punishments in view of the statutory limitation, while her daughter had been \u201changing between life and death\u201d. The latter, in her view, proved that the investigation had not been effective. In addition, the authorities had failed to take any steps to remedy the after-effects of the accident (for example, further treatment, rehabilitation and re-socialisation for her daughter) and the domestic courts had dismissed her claim to that end. Lastly, she maintained that the award, after having become final, had still not been enforced.",

This positive obligation entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life. However, the obligations deriving from Article 2 do not end there. Where lives have been lost in circumstances potentially engaging the responsibility of the State, that provision entails a duty for the State to ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response \u2013 judicial or otherwise \u2013 so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see, for example, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

In particular, they submitted that the authorities had carried out twenty-three forensic examinations and interrogated more than six hundred witnesses. The criminal limb of the proceedings had been also complicated by civil actions brought by the victims, numbering in total up to twelve persons. The civil limb of the proceedings had been complicated by the claimants, including the applicant, who had enjoyed their procedural rights (for example, modified their claims, inter alia, indicating new defendants to the case whose number on different stages of the proceedings ranged from four to eight, appealed against court decisions, lodged various requests, etc.). On several occasions the parties had requested the hearings be adjourned and had failed to appear before the courts, which according to the Government had delayed the progress of the proceedings for eleven months. The domestic authorities, on the other hand, had caused no delays and a fortiori had taken measures to speed up the proceedings. Accordingly, the Government concluded that there had been no violation of Article 6 of the Convention in the present case.",

Hence, it is incumbent upon it to prevent disturbances which could lead to violent incidents\u201d. Similar reasoning could be applicable in the present case, as the tragedy appears to have been a consequence of improper planning of the event. Educational authorities organized a mass event \u2013 an excursion to the cinema \u2013 for a large number of teenagers. The second group of teenagers was let into the auditorium before the previous showing ended, they wanted to choose better places while the first group wanted to finish watching a movie, and that is how a scuffle ensued and a peaceful cultural event degenerated into violence. The role of the school authorities - organisers of the event - who were responsible for the children and had the duty to prevent the riot or at least to react immediately to its first signs, went uninvestigated, as well as appropriate regulatory framework and its effective functioning. The conviction of the cinema's director for negligence does not cast full light upon the planning and conduct of the mass event, which resulted in a loss of lives.",

But in the present case we are talking about teenagers who were\u00a0very excited to see the famous blockbuster in a poorly equipped and secured cinema with fewer seats than expected (as was shown in the domestic proceedings) and whose behaviour was quite predictable. In these circumstances the tragedy was foreseeable and avoidable; and I regret that the majority refused to examine if there had been failure on the part of the authorities to safeguard the right to life of the applicant's daughter in consequence of lack of adequate planning of the event.",
