When the personal space available to a detainee falls below 3 sq. m. of floor space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prisons, the lack of personal space is considered so severe that a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 arises (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim. In the absence of such explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them.

Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s unsupported assertion that the applicant was provided with dry rations on the days when he was transported to the court (see paragraph\u00a0140 above and, mutatis mutandis, Denisenko and Bogdanchikov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3811/02, \u00a7\u00a0108, 12 February 2009). It notes that the Government did not comment on the applicant\u2019s argument that the documentation on the catering arrangements related to the period of time from 2010 to 2011 should have been available to them. The Court would have expected the Government to provide such documentation in order to discharge the burden of proof in this respect. In the absence of any such information submitted by the Government, the Court considers that on hearing days the applicant was left without adequate food and water. In connection with its above findings, the Court would emphasise that it finds it unacceptable for a person to be detained in conditions where no provision is made for meeting his or her basic needs (see Riad and Idiab v. Belgium, nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, \u00a7\u00a0106, 24 January 2008, and Denisenko and Bogdanchikov v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108).",

Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law.
