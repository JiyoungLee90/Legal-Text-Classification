These factors, in turn, require consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source (ibid.), whether the newspaper conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, \u00a7 37), whether the newspaper presented the story in a reasonably balanced manner (Bergens Tidende and Others v. Norway, no. 26132/95, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2000IV) and whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (ibid., \u00a7 58). Hence, the nature of such an exemption from the ordinary requirement of verification of defamatory statements of fact is such that, in order to apply it in a manner consistent with the caselaw of this Court, the domestic courts have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case under consideration. If the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists\u2019 professional conduct, they could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings, not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova v.

The Court finds this conclusion rather strained. Firstly, the reference to the supposed \u201csmall wholesale business\u201d was of too general a nature to infer from it that Mr Fedorov held a paid post elsewhere. Secondly, it appears from the context of the article that such an inference was not the applicant\u2019s intention and was one that was unlikely to have been made by an average reader.",
