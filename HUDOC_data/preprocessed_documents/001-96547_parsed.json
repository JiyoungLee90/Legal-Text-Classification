He alleged that following his return to prison on 21 September 2003 he was confined in a cold, damp cell of a maximum of five square meters without food, water or suitable clothing. The cell had no external window and the window of the cell door was considerably smaller than the Government had indicated. The applicant was excessively restricted in his ability to use the toilet or have a shower: for the first four days of his solitary confinement he was forced to use an empty water bottle to urinate and nylon bags for other needs. These were provided to him by a prison officer through the small window in the cell door. Due to the cold, his arm and shoulder had frozen and he suffered from pain but the doctor was not allowed by the prison authorities to provide him with painkillers. He was nevertheless given an anti-inflammatory gel by the doctor using her own funds. Relying on the prison logbook submitted to the Court by the Government, the applicant stated that he had not been allowed to go to the toilet prior to 24 September 2003 or to have food or the opportunity to shower before 25 September 2003, although he was given bottled water and an apple from time to time through his small cell window by a prison officer. He had no access to newspapers, books or television. Further, he was not regularly seen by a doctor and he was not allowed regularly to exit his cell for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon, as required by the relevant regulations.",

He had no contact with his family in the prison during the period of his solitary confinement and no contact was possible during his court visits. In particular, when he attended hearings at the district court in Limassol, he was kept at the Limassol central police station\u2019s cells.

It was, at the relevant time, composed of twelve members drawn from both the public and private sectors, including representatives of non-governmental organisations and the Cyprus Bar Association. Its chairman was the Director-General of the Ministry of Justice. The Prisons Board had the power to hear and investigate complaints submitted to it by prisoners, including complaints as to their treatment, and to investigate prisoners\u2019 living conditions. For this purpose, its members were afforded the right of free entry at all times to all areas of the prison, of free communication with prisoners outside the presence of prison officers, of inspection of prison records and of the conduct of any investigation in the prison which they considered necessary. Under the Prison Regulations, letters could be addressed to the Prisons Board without any monitoring of their content by the prison authorities.

In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that the relevant decision did not constitute an \u201cadministrative act\u201d enabling the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Finally, the Court highlights that the Government have not referred to any decisions or judgments of the Supreme Court in which any decision of the nature in issue in the present case has been successfully challenged by way of an Article 146 recourse (see Apostol, cited above, \u00a7 38).

Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the individual in question and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3.

However, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.

No formal record of the decision authorising the solitary confinement or any extension has been provided; indeed, the Government have not made any submissions regarding the manner in which the decision was made. The justification for the confinement provided for by the prison authorities following the Ombudsman\u2019s investigation was that the applicant was placed in solitary confinement in order to ensure his own protection. However, the Court does not consider that this reason can justify the applicant\u2019s detention in solitary confinement (see, mutatis mutandis, Leli\u00e8vre v. , no.\u00a011287/03, \u00a7\u00a0104, 8\u00a0November 2007). Moreover, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s subsequent explanation of the reasons for the applicant being placed in solitary confinement \u2013 namely, for the preservation of discipline and order, the protection of the interests of the applicant himself and of other prisoners and discipline \u2013 given that this explanation was first advanced in their observations to the Court. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicant was detained in solitary confinement for reasons which are unclear and which were never explained to him. The Court observes in this regard that a solitary confinement measure is one of the most serious measures which can be imposed within a prison. Despite the gravity of the measure, there is no evidence that the authorities assessed all the relevant factors in the applicant\u2019s case before placing him in solitary confinement (see Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, cited above, \u00a7 83). It is also of significance that although instructions were given on 31 October 2003 to release the applicant from solitary confinement, the instructions were misplaced and as a consequence the applicant spent a further seven days in solitary confinement after his release had been ordered.",

Accordingly, the applicant was required to ask the prison guards to allow him to go to the toilet. The Court\u2019s examination of the prison logbook shows that on a number of occasions the applicant only used the toilet once in the course of the day, which would appear to confirm his assertion that during certain periods of his detention he had to use water bottles and nylon bags for his needs.

In its report on , the CPT did not comment on the physical conditions of cells in Nicosia Central Prison, except to say that material conditions in cells used for administrative separation or disciplinary purposes in block 8 were adequate.

It also criticised the lack of opportunity for detainees to leave their cells and to benefit from outdoor exercise, highlighting the applicant\u2019s case which it concluded was unacceptable. It is clear from the prison logbook that the time spent by the applicant outside his cell was limited. Although, according to the prison logbook, he visited court on seven occasions, for the remainder of his solitary confinement he rarely left his cell. Most days, the cell was opened only for a brief period to allow him to use the shower or toilet or to collect his food. In this regard, the Court notes that in Cenbauer v. Croatia (cited above, \u00a7 49) it considered that the period of the applicant\u2019s confinement to his cell, between 7p.m. and 7a.m. and for several hours during the day, was \u201csubstantial\u201d. Furthermore, it is also clear from the prison logbook that human contact was mostly limited to the applicant\u2019s dealings with prison staff and his visits to court.

In the present case, the prison authorities did not explain to the applicant at the time of the interference with his correspondence why these letters were sent for further inspection before being forwarded to their intended recipients. The applicant did not receive a reasoned decision specifying the grounds on which the referral had been made. Before this Court, the Government argued that the measure was intended to protect the rights of the applicant, the Ombudsman and other State authorities. They contended that the inspection and consequent delay was necessary in order to ensure that officials did not receive excessive number of letters from prisoners on subjects over which they had no competence, which were insulting or which were improper. However, the Court notes that the Government do not explain why it was considered that the applicant\u2019s letters potentially fell within the categories outlined in regulation 115(7), such that their further inspection by the Ministry of Justice was thought necessary. The Court considers it relevant, in assessing the appropriateness of the prison authorities\u2019 approach, that all of the letters concerned were eventually sent to the addressees.",

In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasises that where measures interfering with prisoners\u2019 correspondence are taken, it is essential that reasons be given for the interference, such that the applicant and/or his advisers can satisfy themselves that the law has been correctly applied to him and that decisions taken in his case are not unreasonable or arbitrary. \u00a0The Court further emphasises the Ombudsman\u2019s role as a guardian of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the importance of respect for the confidentiality of correspondence of prisoners with the Ombudsman since it could \u2013 and in this case did \u2013 concern allegations against the prison authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, \u00a7 62, Series A no. 233).
