The investigation had continued after 1 May 2003, when the new Code of Criminal Procedure had entered into force. Those circumstances had led her to believe that the charges in the case were being pursued by the public prosecutor. Given that the public prosecutor had waited for two years before informing the applicant that he would not be prosecuting J.H.L., his position was difficult to understand. As far as the applicant was concerned, such a decision was in breach of the principle that criminal offences should be investigated promptly and that the perpetrator should receive a fair punishment.

It ratified the Optional Protocol to the CEDAW on 5 August 2004. On 8 January 2008, the CEDAW Committee issued concluding observations on the State. The Committee noted the various efforts undertaken by Lithuania to combat violence against women, including domestic violence, including the adoption of the National Strategy for Combating Violence against Women, a number of amendments to the Criminal Code, the establishment of a network of crisis centres providing support to victims of violence and the extension of a specialized assistance by telephone for battered women countrywide to a continuous (24 hours a day) service in 2008. However, it remained concerned at the high prevalence of violence against women in , in particular domestic violence, and at the absence of a specific law on domestic violence. The Committee was also concerned that this may lead to such violence being considered a private matter, in which case the consequences of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator are not fully understood by police and health officers, the relevant authorities and society at large. The Committee thus urged  to ensure that comprehensive legal and other measures are in place to address all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence. It also recommended that Lithuania elaborate and introduce without delay a specific law on domestic violence against women that provides for redress and protection, and set a time frame for its adoption (paragraphs 74 and 75 of the Concluding Observations).",

The applicant believed that the latter argument by the Government was nothing less than an attempt to diminish the State\u2019s responsibility for actual inaction in the sphere of domestic violence by suggesting alternative procedures that were only theoretically possible mechanisms for protecting victims\u2019 rights. If the State authorities failed to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework and criminal-law mechanisms affording protection against acts of violence, victims could not be held responsible for not looking to other means of punishing perpetrators and of ensuring just satisfaction. The responsibility to ensure accountability and safeguards against impunity lay with the State, not with the victim. Likewise, the fact that alternative procedures existed which could have been carried out against the perpetrator did not in any way eliminate the positive obligation on the State to investigate, prosecute and punish him in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

She submitted (without naming the source of such statistics) that in , women were the victims most frequently subjected to domestic violence, that is to say in more than 95% of all domestic violence incidents. Moreover, around twenty women were killed every year as a result of domestic violence; in 2006, 63.3% of women admitted having been subjected to domestic violence by their partners or husbands at least once; and more than 40,000 telephone calls to the police were registered each year regarding complaints of domestic violence.

In January 2002, that court had forwarded the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint to the Panev\u0117\u017eys district prosecutor, ordering him to pursue the case by way of a public prosecution. In June 2005, the prosecutor had taken the decision to discontinue the investigation, based on legislative amendments enacted two years prior to his decision. Finally, the case had been dismissed as time-barred. The applicant thus considered that the way the proceedings had been handled was a clear illustration that the State had failed to fulfil its positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. She maintained that a large number of women today remained affected by the failure of the State authorities to take domestic violence seriously as a real threat to life and by their unwillingness to prosecute and punish the perpetrators of domestic violence appropriately.",

The Government suggested that at least some of those injuries had not been properly documented. However, the Court does not share this view. Firstly, and contrary to the facts in Bevacqua and S. (cited above, \u00a7\u00a077), in the present case the forensic experts saw the applicant between one and three days after each incident (see paragraph 8 above). Secondly, those injuries had been considered to have been \u201cestablished\u201d by the prosecutor in his decision to close the criminal investigation on 10\u00a0June 2005 (see paragraph 21 above). The same conclusion appears to have been supported by the criminal court (see paragraph 27 above). Even though the Government argued that certain inconsistencies had been found in the investigator\u2019s decision of 21\u00a0January 2003, the prosecutor subsequently quashed that decision as superficial and the investigation was reopened (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). That being so, and without being able to rely on the final decision by the Lithuanian courts as to the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint about her ill-treatment, the Court cannot but conclude that she did sustain the injuries listed above.",

Neither can the Court rule on the credibility of the e-mail containing threats to the applicant (see paragraph 14 above), given that the contents of that e-mail were never drawn to the attention of the Lithuanian authorities.

On the other hand, it goes without saying that the obligation on the State under Article 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as requiring the State to guarantee through its legal system that inhuman or degrading treatment is never inflicted by one individual on another or that if it is, criminal proceedings should necessarily lead to a particular sanction. In order that a State may be held responsible it must, in the view of the Court, be shown that the domestic legal system, and in particular the criminal law applicable in the circumstances of the case, failed to provide practical and effective protection of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 (see Beganovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 71).",

The Court further observes that up to 1\u00a0May 2003 such crimes were amenable to investigation by the public prosecutor. After that date, criminal acts causing minor bodily harm are to be prosecuted only upon a complaint by the victim, who in turn becomes the private prosecutor. Even so, a public prosecutor retains the right to open a criminal investigation into acts causing minor bodily harm, if the crime is of public importance or the victim is not able to protect his or her interests (see paragraphs 33, 35 and 36 above). The Court is thus satisfied that at the time relevant to the instant case Lithuanian law provided a sufficient regulatory framework to pursue the crimes attributed by the applicant to J.H.L.",

On the basis of forensic reports produced soon after each incident of violence, she claimed that J.H.L. had ill-treated her on five separate occasions, describing each incident in detail. She gave the names and addresses of five witnesses whom she wanted to call in the case. She alleged that the acts of violence against her constituted a crime mentioned in Article 116 of the old Criminal Code, that is to say, acts which had caused her minor bodily harm. She provided the domestic court with relevant medical documentation in support of her allegations. The Court thus concludes that the Lithuanian authorities received sufficient information from the applicant to raise a suspicion that a crime had been committed.

In this connection the Court observes that the prosecutor\u2019s decision was upheld by a higher prosecutor and then by a court, despite the applicant\u2019s pleas that this would risk J.H.L. enjoying impunity given that the statutory time-limit to prosecute him was approaching. The Court also finds it noteworthy that, as it appears from the reading of Article 409 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, even after the reform of 1\u00a0May 2003 the investigation of acts causing minor bodily harm may still be pursued by a public prosecutor, provided that it is in the public interest.

Thus, and inasmuch as it concerns the circumstances of the instant case, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the applicant\u2019s criminal complaint should have been pursued by the public prosecutor, or by a way of private prosecution, although the Government\u2019s argument suggests the former (see paragraph 62 above). Be that as it may, the fact remains that the circumstances of the case were never established by a competent court of law. In this connection the Court notes that one of the purposes of imposing criminal sanctions is to restrain and deter the offender from causing further harm. However, these aims can hardly be achieved without having the facts of the case established by a competent criminal court. The Court thus cannot accept that the purpose of effective protection against acts of ill-treatment is achieved where the criminal proceedings are discontinued owing to the fact that the prosecution has become time-barred and where this has occurred, as is shown above, as a result of the flaws in the actions of the relevant State authorities (see Beganovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a085).",

In 1984 the U.N. Economic and Social Council passed Resolution 1984/14 on violence in the family. Based on this resolution, the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 40/36 on domestic violence one year later, inviting States to take specific action urgently in order to prevent domestic violence and to render the appropriate assistance to the victims thereof. In 1990, the UNGA passed Resolution 45/114, addressing the public and if necessary criminal response to domestic violence. In 1993 the UNGA Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women defined violence against women as including any public or private act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and enjoined States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons. For the very first time, an international instrument referred to violence against women as a human rights violation and formally enshrined the due diligence clause as the applicable standard for the prevention and protection of the right of women to physical integrity and psychological well-being. In the same year, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (the Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention), which sets out States\u2019 duties relating to the eradication of gender-based violence. In\u00a01995 the Fourth World Conference on Women made the elimination of violence against women one of its twelve strategic objectives and suggested concrete actions to be taken by States and non-State actors. In 2000 the Human Rights Committee General Comment no. 28 on Equality of Rights Between Men and Women interpreted Article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as requiring proactive conduct by States to ensure to men and women equally the enjoyment of all rights provided for in the Covenant in both the public and the private sectors and, in order to assess compliance with Articles 7 and 24 of the Covenant, enjoined States parties to provide information on national laws and practice with regard to domestic and other types of violence against women. The same year, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued General Recommendation no. 25 on gender-related dimensions of racial discrimination, admitting that certain forms of racial discrimination affect women more intensely than men. In 2002, in its First World Report on Violence and Health, the World Health Organization discussed the health and economic consequences of and the responses to domestic violence as a human rights violation. In 2003 an Additional Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights on the Rights of Women was approved, including new structural or economic forms of violence against women, such as unequal rights in marriage, polygamy, negative media campaigns, and traditional and religious practices which treat women as second-class citizens. In 2005 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued General Comment no. 16 on The Equal Right of Men and Women to the Enjoyment of All Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, stating that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality, and that States parties must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women and act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors, as well as provide victims of domestic violence, who are primarily female, with access to safe housing, remedies and redress for physical, mental and emotional damage. In her third report, of 20 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women Yakin Ert\u00fcrk considered that there is a rule of customary international law that \u201cobliges States to prevent and respond to acts of violence against women with due diligence\u201d. In 2008 the Council of the European Union adopted the \u201cEU guidelines on violence against women and girls and combating all forms of discrimination against them\u201d. In her first report, of 23 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women Rashida Manjoo considered that the obligation to provide adequate reparations to the victims involves ensuring the rights of women to access to both criminal and civil remedies and the establishment of effective protection, support and rehabilitation services for survivors of violence. Finally, in 2011 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, which not only distinguishes both concepts, but includes among the victims of domestic violence any natural person who is subjected to the violent conduct. The due diligence clause is designed as an obligation of means, not of result.",

                        "content": "Against the backdrop of these developments in international law, which are supported by the findings of modern psychology, it can be concluded that domestic violence has emerged as an autonomous human rights violation consisting in the commission of physical, sexual or psychological harm, or the threat or attempt thereof, in private or public life, by an intimate partner, an ex-partner, a member of the household, or an \nex-member of the household. Yet a human rights litigation approach to domestic violence faces three strong conceptual obstacles, all of them very well entrenched in the history of democratic societies: respect for privacy, tolerance vis-a-vis different cultures and the upholding of the rights of defendants. The classical human rights approach focuses on violations occurring in the public arena, which clearly disadvantages victims of domestic violence since this frequently occurs in the hidden private sphere of the family or other forms of intimate relationship. In regard to some ethnic groups that disadvantage is compounded by a pretentious cultural relativism, according to which certain traditional practices should be tolerated in the name of respect for different cultures, even though those practices may constitute forms of discrimination and even ill-treatment. Moreover, courts and scholars are traditionally more attentive to ensuring the effectiveness of the defendant\u2019s rights than to protecting those of the victims, the common belief being that the former should always be prioritised over the latter. These obstacles can only be overcome by breaking the classical public-private divide and acknowledging the State\u2019s positive obligation to act against domestic violence. States have the obligation not only to bring to justice the alleged offenders and empower the victims of domestic violence with an active role in the criminal proceedings, but also to prevent private actors from committing or reiterating the offence and provide elementary social support measures to victims, such as post-traumatic care and shelter. Such an international positive obligation must be acknowledged, in view of the broad and long-lasting consensus mentioned above, as a principle of customary international law, binding on all States. This is a fortiori true in the case of violence against women. Domestic violence is basically violence against women. All the available data shows worldwide that domestic violence is in the vast majority of cases violence perpetrated by men against women, and violence by women against men accounts for a very small percentage of domestic violence.",

In that light, it is self-evident that the very act of domestic violence has an inherent humiliating and debasing character for the victim, which is exactly what the offender aims at. Physical pain is but one of the intended effects. A kick, a slap or a spit is also aimed at belittling the dignity of the partner, conveying a message of humiliation and degradation. It is precisely this intrinsic element of humiliation that attracts the applicability of Article 3 of the Convention. The imputation of an Article 8 violation would fall short of the real and full meaning of violence in the domestic context, and would thus fail to qualify as a \u201cgendered understanding of violence\u201d.",

                        "content": "One of the most problematic aspects of the State\u2019s positive obligation is the definition of the exact ambit of its duty to prevent and protect. The Court has developed the so-called Osman test, which normally assesses if the authorities knew, or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. Put simply, the State answers for the wrongful conduct of non-State actors when their conduct was foreseeable and avoidable by the exercise of State powers. The heart of the dispute in the current case lies in the adequateness of this standard to the particular situation of domestic violence. Realistically speaking, at the stage of an \u201cimmediate risk\u201d to the victim it is often too late for the State to intervene. In addition, the recurrence and escalation inherent in most cases of domestic violence makes it somehow artificial, even deleterious, to require an immediacy of the risk. Even though the risk might not be imminent, it is already a serious risk when it is present. A more rigorous standard of diligence is especially necessary in the context of certain societies, like Lithuanian society, which are faced with a serious, long-lasting and widespread problem of domestic violence. Thus, the emerging due diligence standard in domestic violence cases is stricter than the classical Osman test, in as much as the duty to act arises for public authorities when the risk is already present, although not imminent. If a State knows or ought to know that a segment of its population, such as women, is subject to repeated violence and fails to prevent harm from befalling the members of that group of people when they face a present (but not yet imminent) risk, the State can be found responsible by omission for the resulting human rights violations. The constructive anticipated duty to prevent and protect is the reverse side of the context of widespread abuse and violence already known to the State authorities.",

The Court has already rejected the suggestion that the Convention right to physical integrity could only be secured with public prosecution in all cases of domestic violence, but it was not satisfied either with a Bulgarian law that allowed room for public prosecution of domestic violence only in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d. In fact, both the new Council of Europe Convention on domestic violence, Article 55, and the previous Recommendation Rec (2002), paragraphs 38 and 39, as well as the CEDAW General Recommendation No. 28 on the core obligations of States parties under Article 2 of the Convention, paragraph\u00a034, establish the preference for a public prosecutable offence which is not entirely dependent on the will of the victim, in regard either to the initiation of the proceedings or to the withdrawal of the complaint. The reason is crystal-clear: in most cases, to place the victim of domestic violence in the unbearable quandary of having to decide for herself whether she wants to harm the family/intimate relationship through private prosecution is to perpetuate the subordinate position of the victim, and therefore, the violence itself, because she is evidently not in a position of freedom to make that choice due to her state of dependency on the offender. In other words, the requirement of a victim to act as a private prosecutor, which reflects the misconception of violence between members of a family/intimate relationship as \u201cprivate business\u201d, is not compatible with the above-mentioned international obligation to protect.",

On all these occasions, she was also verbally abused with insults and threats. These facts, which undoubtedly constitute a breach of the applicant\u2019s physical integrity and psychological well-being, attained per se the level of seriousness required for Article 3 of the Convention, since the violent episodes endured by the applicant violated not only her right to privacy but also her Convention right not to be ill-treated, abused and humiliated.",

In fact, at least on 7\u00a0January, 15 January and 4 February 2001, the applicant told the police that she had been verbally abused by her partner and had been obstructed when entering her apartment. Repeated verbal abuse like insults and threats is a sufficient cause to trigger the positive obligation to protect the applicant\u2019s physical and psychological integrity under Article 3. The lack of adequate reaction by the police authorities, who only took note of the incidents, leaves much to be desired, falling foul of the requirement to intervene \u201cin a proactive way in order to gather evidence\u201d of violence.",

In fact, the discontinuation decision was only taken on 10 June 2005, in spite of the fact that its ground was already apparent when the new criminal code entered into force in 2003. Although the applicant launched a private prosecution immediately after the district court confirmed the public prosecutor\u2019s discontinuation decision, the case was dismissed again on the basis of the applicable statute of limitations. In view of the obvious risk of prescription, the minimum the public interest commanded in June 2005 was that the prosecutor continue the proceedings.

En 2002, dans son premier rapport mondial sur la violence et la sant\u00e9, l\u2019Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9 a discut\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences \u00e9conomiques et sanitaires et des r\u00e9ponses aux violences domestiques en tant que violation des droits de l\u2019Homme. En 2003, le Protocole additionnel \u00e0 la Charte africaine des droits de l\u2019Homme et des peuples sur les droits des femmes a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9, incluant de nouvelles formes de violences structurelles ou \u00e9conomiques envers les femmes, telles que l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de droits dans le mariage, la polygamie, les campagnes m\u00e9diatiques n\u00e9gatives et les pratiques traditionnelles et religieuses qui traitent les femmes comme des citoyens de seconde classe. En 2005, le Comit\u00e9 des droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels, a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019Observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale no16 sur l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des droits des hommes et des femmes dans la jouissance de tous les droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels, \u00e9non\u00e7ant que \u00ab\u00a0la violence sexiste est une forme de discrimination qui emp\u00eache l\u2019exercice des droits et libert\u00e9s, notamment des droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels, dans des conditions d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9. Les \u00c9tats parties doivent prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9radiquer la violence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des hommes et des femmes et intervenir avec la diligence due afin de pr\u00e9venir les actes de violence commis par des particuliers, enqu\u00eater sur ces actes, mettre en \u0153uvre une m\u00e9diation, punir les auteurs et accorder r\u00e9paration aux victimes\u00a0\u00bb. Ils doivent \u00e9galement, \u00ab\u00a0garantir aux victimes de la violence domestique, qui sont principalement des femmes, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un logement s\u00fbr et \u00e0 des voies de recours et de r\u00e9paration pour pr\u00e9judices physiques, psychologiques et \u00e9motionnels\u00a0\u00bb. Dans son troisi\u00e8me rapport du 20 janvier 2006, le rapporteur sp\u00e9cial sur les violences envers les femmes, Yakin Erturk, a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe une r\u00e8gle coutumi\u00e8re en droit international \u00ab\u00a0qui fait obligation aux \u00c9tats d\u2019agir avec la diligence voulue pour pr\u00e9venir et poursuivre les actes de violence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes\u00a0\u00bb. En 2008, le Conseil de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne a adopt\u00e9 les \u00ab\u00a0Lignes directrices de l\u2019UE sur les violences contre les femmes et la lutte contre toutes les formes de discrimination \u00e0 leur encontre\u00a0\u00bb. Dans son premier rapport, en avril 2003, le rapporteur sp\u00e9cial sur la violence contre les femmes, Raschida Manjoo, a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de fournir une r\u00e9paration ad\u00e9quate aux victimes implique d\u2019assurer aux femmes un droit d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux recours civils et p\u00e9naux et d\u2019\u00e9tablir des services effectifs de soutien et de r\u00e9habilitation pour les survivants de ces violences. Finalement, en 2011, le Comit\u00e9 des Ministres du Conseil de l\u2019Europe a adopt\u00e9 la Convention du Conseil de l\u2019Europe sur la pr\u00e9vention et la lutte contre la violence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes et la violence domestique, qui ne distingue pas seulement les deux concepts, mais inclut parmi les victimes de violences domestiques toute personne physique soumise \u00e0 une conduite violente. Le devoir de due diligence est con\u00e7u comme une obligation de moyen, et non de r\u00e9sultat.",

                        "content": "En arri\u00e8re-plan de ces d\u00e9veloppements en droit international, encourag\u00e9s par les avanc\u00e9es de la psychologie moderne, il peut \u00eatre conclu que les violences domestiques ont \u00e9merg\u00e9 comme une violation autonome des droits de l\u2019homme consistant en la commission d\u2019une atteinte physique, sexuelle ou psychologique, ou la menace ou la tentative d\u2019une telle atteinte, dans la sph\u00e8re publique ou priv\u00e9e, par un partenaire intime, un ex-partenaire, un membre du foyer, ou un ex-membre du foyer. Pourtant, une approche contentieuse des violences domestiques fait face \u00e0 trois obstacles conceptuels solides, tous trois bien enracin\u00e9s dans l\u2019histoire des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9mocratiques\u00a0: le respect pour la vie priv\u00e9e, la tol\u00e9rance vis-\u00e0-vis d\u2019autres cultures et le maintien des droits des d\u00e9fendeurs. L\u2019approche classique des droits de l\u2019homme se concentre sur les violations survenant dans la sph\u00e8re publique, ce qui d\u00e9savantage clairement les victimes de violences domestiques qui se d\u00e9roulent souvent dans le secret de la sph\u00e8re priv\u00e9e de la famille ou des autres formes de relations intimes. \u00c0 propos de certains groupes, ce d\u00e9savantage est aggrav\u00e9 par un relativisme culturel pr\u00e9tentieux, selon lequel certaines pratiques traditionnelles devraient \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9es au nom du respect des diff\u00e9rentes cultures, m\u00eame si ces pratiques constituent une forme de discrimination voire de mauvais traitement. De plus, les juridictions comme la doctrine sont traditionnellement plus attentives \u00e0 assurer l\u2019effectivit\u00e9 des droits du d\u00e9fendeur plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 la protection de ceux de la victime, la croyance commune \u00e9tant que la premi\u00e8re devrait toujours \u00eatre prioritaire sur la seconde. Ces obstacles peuvent seulement \u00eatre surmont\u00e9s en abolissant la distinction classique entre public et priv\u00e9 et en reconnaissant l\u2019obligation positive de l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019agir contre les violences domestiques. Les \u00c9tats ont l\u2019obligation non seulement de traduire en justice les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s coupables et de conf\u00e9rer aux victimes un r\u00f4le actif dans les proc\u00e9dures p\u00e9nales, mais aussi de pr\u00e9venir la commission de tels actes par des acteurs priv\u00e9s et de fournir des mesures de soutien social \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire aux victimes, telles que des soins et un accueil post-traumatique. Une telle obligation positive internationale doit \u00eatre reconnue, au regard du consensus ancien et \u00e9tendu mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, en tant que principe de droit coutumier international, obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les \u00c9tats. Cela \u00e0 plus forte raison dans les cas de violences envers les femmes. Les violences domestiques sont essentiellement des violences envers les femmes. Toutes les donn\u00e9es disponibles montrent que les violences domestiques sont majoritairement des cas de violences commises par des hommes sur des femmes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle mondiale, et que les violences commises par des femmes sur des hommes ne repr\u00e9sentent qu\u2019un tr\u00e8s faible pourcentage de ces violences domestiques.",

En ce sens, il est \u00e9vident que les actes de violence domestique ont un caract\u00e8re intrins\u00e8quement humiliant et rabaissant pour la victime, qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le but de leur auteur. La souffrance physique n\u2019est que l\u2019un des effets escompt\u00e9s. Un coup, une gifle ou un crachat vise \u00e9galement \u00e0 diminuer la dignit\u00e9 du partenaire et porte un message d\u2019humiliation et de d\u00e9gradation.

La Cour a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 le \u00ab\u00a0test Osman\u00a0\u00bb, qui permet de v\u00e9rifier si les autorit\u00e9s avaient connaissance ou auraient d\u00fb avoir connaissance d\u2019un risque r\u00e9el et imm\u00e9diat pour la vie d\u2019une personne du fait d\u2019un acte criminel commis par un tiers, et n\u2019ont pas pris les mesures raisonnables en leur pouvoir pour \u00e9viter ce risque. Plus simplement, il vise \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019\u00c9tat face aux actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles commis par des acteurs non \u00e9tatiques lorsque leur conduite pouvait \u00eatre anticip\u00e9e et \u00e9vit\u00e9e par l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs \u00e9tatiques. Le c\u0153ur de la discussion en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce r\u00e9side dans l\u2019ad\u00e9quation de ce standard \u00e0 la situation sp\u00e9cifique des violences domestiques. D\u2019un point de vue r\u00e9aliste, au stade d\u2019un \u00ab\u00a0risque imm\u00e9diat\u00a0\u00bb pour la victime, il est souvent trop tard pour que l\u2019\u00c9tat intervienne. En outre, la r\u00e9currence et l\u2019aggravation inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la plupart de ces cas rendent presque artificielle, voire d\u00e9l\u00e9t\u00e8re, l\u2019exigence d\u2019imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 du risque. Quand bien m\u00eame le risque ne serait pas imminent, un risque s\u00e9rieux est d\u00e9j\u00e0 caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il est pr\u00e9sent. Un standard plus rigoureux de diligence est n\u00e9cessaire dans le contexte de certaines soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, telles que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 lituanienne, qui font face \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes de violences domestiques s\u00e9rieux, r\u00e9currents et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s. Ainsi, le standard \u00e9mergeant de due diligence dans les cas de violences domestiques est plus strict que le \u00ab\u00a0test Osman\u00a0\u00bb classique, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le devoir de l\u2019\u00c9tat existe d\u00e8s lors que le risque est pr\u00e9sent, bien que non imminent. Si un \u00c9tat avait connaissance ou aurait d\u00fb avoir connaissance qu\u2019une partie de sa population, telle que les femmes, est soumise \u00e0 des violences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, et qu\u2019il s\u2019abstient de pr\u00e9venir la survenue de ce type d\u2019atteinte lorsque les membres du groupe font face \u00e0 un risque pr\u00e9sent (mais non imminent), il peut \u00eatre reconnu responsable par omission des violations qui en r\u00e9sultent. La construction d\u2019un devoir de pr\u00e9venir et de prot\u00e9ger en amont est la cons\u00e9quence d\u2019un contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 d\u2019abus et de violence connu des autorit\u00e9s nationales.",

La Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9 la suggestion selon laquelle le droit \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Convention ne pouvait qu\u2019\u00eatre assur\u00e9 par des poursuites publiques dans tous les cas de violences domestiques, mais elle n\u2019avait pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite d\u2019une loi bulgare qui n\u2019autorisait les poursuites contre ce type de violence que dans des \u00ab\u00a0cas exceptionnels\u00a0\u00bb.

La raison en est \u00e9vidente\u00a0: dans la plupart des cas, placer la victime de violences domestiques dans une situation dans laquelle elle doit d\u00e9cider elle-m\u00eame de porter atteinte \u00e0 la famille ou \u00e0 la relation intime est insupportable \u2013 puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas dans une position de libert\u00e9 de choix compte tenu de sa d\u00e9pendance envers l\u2019auteur des violences \u2013 et perp\u00e9tue la subordination de la victime et donc la violence elle-m\u00eame. En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019exigence selon laquelle la victime doit agir comme un procureur priv\u00e9, qui refl\u00e8te une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension des violences au sein de la famille ou dans la sph\u00e8re intime comme \u00e9tant des \u00ab\u00a0affaires priv\u00e9es\u00a0\u00bb, n\u2019est pas compatible avec l\u2019obligation internationale de protection mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus.",

The Committee of Ministers also recommended, in particular, that member States should penalise serious violence against women, and recommended that the member States classify all forms of violence within the family as criminal offences and envisage the possibility of taking measures in order, inter alia, to enable the judiciary to adopt interim measures aimed at protecting victims, by banning the perpetrator from contacting, communicating with or approaching the victim, or residing in or entering defined areas, to penalise all breaches of the measures imposed on the perpetrator and to establish a compulsory protocol so that the police and the medical and social services follow a set procedure.",
