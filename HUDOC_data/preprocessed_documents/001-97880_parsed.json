Child protection measures will, generally, cause parents distress and on occasion humiliation, if they are suspected of failing, in some way, in their parental responsibilities. However, given the responsibility of the authorities under Article 3 to protect children from serious abuse, whether mental or physical, it would be somewhat contradictory to the effective protection of children's rights to hold that authorities were automatically liable to parents under this provision whenever they erred, reasonably or otherwise, in their execution of their duties. As mentioned above, there must be a factor apart from the normal implementation of those duties which brings the matter within the scope of Article 3 (see R.K. and A.K. v. the , no. 38000/05, 30\u00a0September 2008).",

It was well established that a final decision to revoke a legal aid certificate could be challenged by judicial review (see R (Martin) v Legal Services Commission [2007] EWHC 1786 (Admin), in which the claimant challenged the discharge of a legal aid certificate in educational negligence proceedings). In principle, therefore, judicial review offered an effective route of challenge in meritorious cases. Without commenting on the merits of such an application, the Government submitted that the second applicant could have challenged the decision of the Legal Services Commission on the ground that it failed to take into account the novelty of her claim. If a judicial review application had been unsuccessful, it would have been possible for the second applicant to appeal to the Court of Appeal and (with leave) to the House of Lords.",

The right is not, however, absolute and it may be subject to limitations (Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v.\u00a0Spain, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1998, 1998-I, \u00a7\u00a034 and Garcia Manibardo v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a038695/97, \u00a7\u00a036), but these limitations must not restrict or reduce access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. In this regard the Court recalls that the rights guaranteed under the Convention must be practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (Airey v.\u00a0Ireland, cited above, at \u00a7 24; McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2002III). Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (Ashingdane v\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 28\u00a0May 1985, Series A no.\u00a093, p.\u00a024, \u00a7 57; Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a042527/98, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2001 \u2013 VIII, mutatis mutandis).",

This view would appear to have been supported by the Independent Review Panel, which found that Dr W. could not be blamed for initially misdiagnosing the bruising. Moreover, while it must have been frustrating for the first applicant and his wife when the information about the bicycle accident was apparently ignored, the Court finds that the continued suspicions of the local authority were justified in the circumstances. First, as the parents were themselves under suspicion, any explanation that they provided understandably had to be treated with caution. Secondly, the bicycle accident only accounted for one of the second applicant's apparent injuries. Even if Dr W. had accepted the mother's account, the bruising remained unexplained and abuse could therefore not be ruled out.",

The Government, on the other hand, have submitted that some guidelines indicate that contact with suspected victims of child abuse should be kept to a minimum. It is not for the Court to state which approach doctors and social workers should employ when dealing with such cases and, in the circumstances of this case, it is not necessary for it to do so. In the absence of a medical diagnosis for the bruising, it is unlikely that any denial by the second applicant would have been, or indeed could have been, taken at face value. It is therefore unlikely that interviewing the second applicant would have allowed the doctors and social workers to rule out abuse as a possible cause of her injuries at an earlier stage.",

Without underestimating the distress that the nine-year old second applicant undoubtedly experienced, the Court observes that the intervention in the present case was not as invasive as the interventions in Y.F. and Glass.
