In its view it was not possible under the 1979 Act to afford compensation for the alleged damage. The Act provided that the owners of plots of special value covered by a consolidation scheme should in principle be compensated by the allocation of land of the same type. As regards the building land claimed by the Wiesingers, the Board noted that the provisional transfer of the plots precluded altering their allocation for the time being. However, the provisional transfer did not prejudge the consolidation scheme which would determine definitively the question of land of special value. Furthermore, the building plots were referred to only in the area zoning plan for Hartkirchen and there was therefore an inseparable link between that plan and the question of statutory compensation for land of special value. Accordingly, the area zoning, which was the responsibility of the municipal authorities and not the agricultural authorities, was a precondition. The municipal council of Hartkirchen had announced that it proposed to convert into building land certain of the compensatory plots allocated to the applicants, but their area and location had not yet been fixed. The Provincial Board concluded that it could not rule on the merits of the question until an appeal had been filed concerning the consolidation scheme, once the latter had been adopted and published.",

It noted in the first place that the applicants had themselves obtained the plots which they had wished and whose designation as agricultural land had not been changed. They had thus suffered no temporary disadvantage for which they could claim financial compensation. It was true that the area zoning plan had reclassified a part of their former land after its provisional transfer. However, the consolidation scheme, which was to fix the statutory compensation, would have to take into account any changes in the value of the land occurring in the course of the proceedings, for example following a new area zoning plan as in this instance.

Furthermore, a substantial part of the file had had to remain for several months with the Provincial Board in connection with appeal proceedings instituted by a landowner; likewise, the Wiesingers\u2019 application of 23 August 1983 had required the file to be sent to the Provincial Board, then to the Supreme Board and to the Administrative Court, and had therefore prevented a decision from being taken during this period. The District Authority could have adopted and published the consolidation scheme in 1983 if further consideration, inquiries and interviews had not been necessary following the alteration to the Hartkirchen area zoning plan.

In the present case it had not been suggested that the applicants\u2019 conduct had been in any way reprehensible, nor could the failure to comply with the statutory three-year time-limit be blamed on the District Authority. Throughout the consolidation proceedings, it had to take account of the area zoning plans and any amendments thereto. It was therefore impossible, and indeed contrary to the principles of efficient administration, to adopt a consolidation scheme where no final land-development plan or area zoning plan existed, and where negotiations for the adoption of such plan were in progress. Even before the Wiesingers\u2019 appeal had been filed, the competent authority had conducted further inspections of the land and had had contacts with the Hartkirchen municipal council, which was considering the possibility of converting some of the plots allocated to them into building land. In those circumstances, there was no justification for adopting a consolidation scheme which would probably have been defective as from its adoption, if the municipal authority subsequently fixed an amended area zoning plan. The finalisation of such a plan in fact constituted a precondition for the adoption of the consolidation scheme. For all these reasons, the District Authority had been right to stay the proceedings pending the final decision of the municipal council and was not responsible for the delay in the consolidation proceedings.",

Their second action, seeking to accelerate the adoption of the scheme, concluded with the \u2019s decision of 8 April 1986, holding that the applicants\u2019 complaints concerned the question of statutory compensation, which would be dealt with by the scheme (see paragraph 23 above).

This measure, which gave rise to the \"dispute\" on 10 August 1982, upset the balance which had been struck between the different landowners at the time of the provisional transfer and which had then had their general approval. Since the enhancement in value of the applicants\u2019 former plots had, under Austrian law, to be taken into account in determining which compensatory parcels should be allotted to them in the consolidation scheme (see paragraph 37 above), the agricultural authorities had to re-examine the land allocations contemplated in the draft plan (see paragraphs 10 and 24 above). Moreover, the grant of building permits to the provisional owners by the municipal council aggravated the situation.",

Incidentally, it is also to be noted that when the applicants for their part requested authorisation to construct two animal feed silos on their compensatory plots the authorities refused on the ground that they were provisionally owners of the land in question (paragraph 29).",
