It found that it could be established with certainty, on the basis of precise and concurring physical evidence, that the applicant had indeed used various false names and aliases which had come up in the course of the investigations, a fact the court described as \u201cbeyond doubt and indisputable\u201d. With regard to the GIA\u2019s funding the court, having noted the prosecution\u2019s claims that the applicant had funded the GIA groups which carried out the attacks in France during the second half of 1995, examined the factual evidence in the case file at length and in detail. It observed in particular that, according to one witness who was a GIA member, the organisation\u2019s groups had different specialisations depending on their location, with the London group being responsible for sending funds. The court further noted that the applicant had transferred GBP 5,000 on 16 October 1995, two days before the attack of 17 October 1995. This was established by the statements of the British police officers tasked with keeping the applicant under surveillance and of the staff of the Western Union branch where the transfer had been made, and also by the discovery of the applicant\u2019s fingerprints on the transfer slip kept by the Western Union branch. The court also observed that one of the perpetrators of the attacks, B.B., had stated that the money used in preparing the various attacks had always been supplied by the applicant from London. The court inferred that the facts as a whole \u201cdemonstrate[d] that Rachid Ramda was indeed responsible for funding terrorist groups on French soil\u201d. Furthermore, in response to the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions concerning the applicant\u2019s role in disseminating GIA propaganda, the first-instance court also considered the various items of factual evidence before it, and in particular the wealth of correspondence and propaganda documents relating to the GIA\u2019s views and actions that had been found during the searches of the various premises used by the applicant, as well as the statements by a GIA member confirming the applicant\u2019s role as a member of the team publishing the magazine Al Ansar, which was the GIA outlet used in particular to claim responsibility for attacks. It also noted the presence at the applicant\u2019s home of pamphlets promoting terrorism and killing with specific reference to France. The court concluded that the applicant had played a part in disseminating GIA propaganda and ideas.",

All the members had either been directly involved or had played an indirect role by aiding and abetting and providing resources, and all of them were either known activists or claimed to be activists within the GIA. The court found that the applicant\u2019s contacts with the various members of these networks, who had the shared goal of carrying out attacks, were sufficient to establish his conscious and deliberate participation in a conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts on French soil. In its judgment the court set out, among other findings, the facts showing the existence of links to eight members of three groups forming a support network for the GIA.",

First of all, the Court of Appeal gave further details concerning the evolution and operation of the GIA. It also specified that the case before it concerned \u201cthe series of attacks carried out in France in the summer and autumn of 1995\u201d, and that \u201cthe facts of the case at hand concern[ed] the preparation of the attacks and the actions enabling the attacks, which started in France in July 1995, to be carried out\u201d. The Court of Appeal went on to list the eight attacks carried out between 25 July and 17 October 1995. With particular reference to the evidence of the existence of an information hub based in London which the applicant had allegedly managed, it found this to be established on the basis of the telephone calls made on the day after the killing of the imam S. in Paris; two days before the attack on the Saint-Michel suburban rail station; on the day of that attack and the day after the attempted attack on the ParisLyon high-speed railway line at Cailloux-sur-Fontaines; on 12\u00a0September 1995, a few days after the attack of 3 September on Boulevard Richard Lenoir in Paris, the attempted attack of 4 September on Place Charles Vallin in Paris and the attack of 7 September in rue Jean-Claude Vivand in Villeurbanne; the day after the shooting at the Col de Maleval and the arrest of three people; five days before the attack of 6\u00a0October and two days after it; on 16 October 1995, in other words just before the attack of 17 October; and, finally, on 1 November 1995, immediately after a telephone conversation between B.B. and S.A.B. concerning preparations for an attack on the Wazemmes market in Lille, with B.B. stating that the purpose of the call was to report to the applicant on the \u201cfinal preparations\u201d for the Lille attack.",

Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2010; Agnelet v. France, no. 61198/08, \u00a7 56, 10 January 2013; and Lhermitte v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. 34238/09, \u00a7 66, ECHR\u00a02016), in proceedings conducted before professional judges, the accused\u2019s understanding of his conviction stems primarily from the reasons given in judicial decisions. In such cases the national courts must indicate with sufficient clarity the grounds on which they base their decisions (see Hadjianastassiou v.\u00a0Greece, no. 12945/87, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 252, and Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 91). Reasoned decisions also serve the purpose of demonstrating to the parties that they have been heard, thereby contributing to a more willing acceptance of the decision on their part. In addition, they oblige judges to base their reasoning on objective arguments, and also preserve the rights of the defence. However, even for professional judges the extent of the duty to give reasons varies according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 303A, and Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 91). While courts are not obliged to give a detailed answer to every argument raised (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, \u00a7\u00a061, Series A no. 288), it must be clear from the decision that the essential issues of the case have been addressed (see Boldea v. Romania, no. 19997/02, \u00a7\u00a030, 15 February 2007).",

As the Court has often noted, the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power are principles underlying the Convention (see Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 90, and Lhermitte, cited above, \u00a7 67). In the judicial sphere, those principles serve to foster public confidence in an objective and transparent justice system, one of the foundations of a democratic society (see Suominen v.

Such procedural safeguards may include, for example, directions or guidance provided by the presiding judge to the jurors on the legal issues arising or the evidence adduced, and precise, unequivocal questions put to the jury by the judge, forming a framework on which the verdict is based and sufficiently offsetting the fact that no reasons are given for the jury\u2019s answers. Regard must also be had to any avenues of appeal open to the accused (see Papon v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 54210/00, ECHR 2001-XII; Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a069; and Lhermitte, cited above, \u00a7 68). In this regard the Court must bear in mind that it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7 93; Lhermitte, cited above, \u00a7 69; and Simeonovi v.

The Court notes that the Paris Court of Appeal went on to list the items of factual evidence pointing to the applicant\u2019s involvement as the supervisor of a structure set up to fund the GIA\u2019s activities in France. It referred to the funds sent by the applicant on 16 October 1995 under a false name and received by B.B.; the payment by the applicant of GBP 5,000 and FRF\u00a050,000; and statements from several individuals concerning services offered in return for payment, fundraising and money transfers (see paragraph 24 above). The Court of Appeal also referred to a series of facts demonstrating, firstly, that the applicant had been the main contact person in organising and carrying out the GIA\u2019s activities in Europe, as was clear in particular from a telephone conversation of 2 December 1995, from the statements of a witness who was a GIA member, and from the detailed content of several documents seized in London (press statements, authorisations to conduct the jihad, documents on the management of funds, articles and handwritten notes on the activities of Islamist groups in Europe and anti-terrorist activities, notes on military weapons and the handling of explosives, and so on); secondly, that he had been the GIA\u2019s main propaganda agent outside Algeria (in view of his role on the magazine Al Ansar as established by documents seized at the applicant\u2019s London address, namely a note on how to make the magazine more dynamic, a letter explaining the means of distributing it, a piece of computer equipment which the applicant would have been unable to afford, letters from readers and GIA sympathisers, a large number of magazines detailing the GIA\u2019s ideas and violent actions, a substantial amount of correspondence relating to Algerian and Islamic issues, some testimonies, and a list of post-office boxes in numerous countries, used by the magazine\u2019s subscribers); thirdly, that he had been at the centre of the London cell which also served as a rallying point for young recruits passing through; and fourthly, that he had been a leader with a strategic role in the GIA\u2019s external organisation, as demonstrated by his links to members and correspondents of other Islamist terrorist groups worldwide (see paragraph 25 above).",

In its judgment of 3 August 2001 concerning the attack of 25 July 1995, the Investigation Division stressed that a call had been made to the applicant\u2019s English mobile phone two days before the attack from a public payphone in Paris close to B.B.\u2019s home which had also been used to contact another GIA member in France. The day before the attack and then on the day itself, the applicant had received calls from France on his various numbers, including from a payphone close to the previous one, concerning his role as an intermediary between the perpetrators of the attacks and the person masterminding them in Algeria. Furthermore, the applicant had on 2 and 20\u00a0July 1995 sent sums of GBP 5,000 and GBP 6,945 respectively which were directly linked to the attack carried out on 25 July 1995 (see paragraph\u00a033 above). Finally, in its judgment of 27 November 2001 concerning the attack of 6 October 1995, the Investigation Division noted that the instructions issued by the GIA concerning the campaign of attacks, which had been accompanied by advice on the manufacture of explosives, had been transmitted via the applicant, who had been required to account for the use of the sums he had provided and had also been kept informed of the progress of the attacks, and in particular of the attack of 6 October 1995 by means of a telephone call of 8 October 1995 (see paragraph 34 above). The Assize Court went on to find that he had knowingly assisted in the manufacture or possession of explosive devices and issued instructions to that effect, in the context of the attacks of 25 July and 6 and 17 October 1995, and had knowingly incited others to manufacture or possess such devices in the context of the attacks of 25 July and 17 October 1995 (see paragraph 41 above).",

In particular, it considers that although the transfer of GBP 5,000 referred to by the applicant (see paragraph 76 above) was mentioned both in the Court of Appeal judgment and in the judgments of the Investigation Division, that circumstance does not amount to a decisive similarity. As to the transfer of a sum of GBP 6,945 and the telephone calls on which the applicant relied, the Court observes \u2013 as did the applicant himself \u2013 that none of these features in both the Court of Appeal judgment convicting him and any of the Investigation Division\u2019s judgments committing him for trial. On this point, it is not persuaded by the applicant\u2019s claims that the transfer of funds should be regarded as being encompassed in the facts of the judgment of 18 December 2006 and that the telephone calls were inextricably linked to other calls dealt with in that judgment (see paragraphs 76 to 78 above). In any event, irrespective of these aspects referred to by the applicant in his observations, it appears that the three judgments delivered in 2001 committing the applicant for trial not only disregarded numerous factual elements raised in the criminal court proceedings, but above all concerned conduct and were based on facts that had not been referred to in the first set of proceedings.",

Moreover, the applicant was convicted by the Assize Court not just on the basis of facts that differed from those for which he had been convicted in the first set of proceedings, but also for the crimes of aiding and abetting murder and attempted murder. The Court emphasises that these offences constitute serious violations of fundamental rights under Article 2 of the Convention, whose perpetrators States are required to prosecute and punish (see, mutatis mutandis, Margu\u0161 v.\u00a0Croatia [GC], no. 4455/10, \u00a7\u00a7 127-28, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), provided that the procedural guarantees of the persons concerned are complied with (compare, in particular and mutatis mutandis, Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, \u00a7 252, ECHR 2016), as they were in the applicant\u2019s case.",
