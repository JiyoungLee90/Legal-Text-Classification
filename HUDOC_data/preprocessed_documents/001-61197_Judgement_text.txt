The case originated in an application (no. 55794/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek national, Ms Anastasia Efstathiou, and the company Michailidis & Co. Motel Amerika (“the applicants”) on 7 March 2000.
The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr K. Horomidis, of the Salonika Bar. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent's Delegates, Mr M. Apessos, Senior Adviser, State Legal Council, and Ms V. Pelekou, Legal Assistant, State Legal Council.
The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, inter alia, that it had been impossible for them to obtain full compensation for the expropriation of parts of their land.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).
By a decision of 30 April 2002 the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.
The applicants, but not the Government, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). They submitted claims for just satisfaction and the Government submitted observations in reply.
The first applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Salonika. The second applicant is a commercial partnership with its registered office in Pieria (northern ).
On 7 July 1994, by means of a joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Public Works (no. 1078361/4744/0010), the  expropriated property covering a total surface area of 455,024 sq. m, with a view to improving certain sections of the main road between the towns of Platamonas and Katerini in Pieria. The expropriation affected 2,455.12 sq. m of land belonging to the first applicant and 2,401 sq. m belonging to the second (entered in the land register as plots nos. 64 and 214 respectively). The administrative authorities decided that the applicants should not receive any compensation in respect of 716.40 sq. m of plot no. 64 and 490 sq. m of plot no. 214, as they were deemed to have derived benefit from the construction of the road.
On 7 June 1995 the State applied to the Katerini Court of First Instance for an assessment of the provisional unit amount of compensation per square metre. The first applicant was not summoned to appear in court.
On 14 June 1996 the court determined the provisional amount of compensation for plot no. 214. It also assessed the amount of special compensation for the unexpropriated parcels of land at 100,000,000 drachmas (GRD) (judgment no. 118/1996).
The applicants subsequently applied to the Salonika Court of Appeal for the assessment of the final amount of compensation for the expropriation. In their observations, they submitted that the irrebuttable presumption in law that owners of property fronting a public highway derived benefit from the expansion of the highway was contrary to Article 17 of the Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
In an interlocutory decision of 18 June 1997 the Court of Appeal observed that, in assessing the unit amount of compensation for property expropriated with a view to building a main road, the court merely determined the amount, without considering whether and to what extent the adjoining owners had an obligation to contribute to the expropriation costs pursuant to section 1 of Law no. 653/1977. It ordered an expert assessment of the real value of the expropriated property (judgment no. 2380/1997).
On 29 September 1999 the Court of Appeal assessed the final unit amount of compensation for the expropriation of plots nos. 64 and 214 at GRD 8,000 per square metre. It also assessed the final amount of special compensation for the unexpropriated parcels of plot no. 64 at GRD 45,142,390 (judgment no. 2741/1999).
On 18 March 2000 the applicants appealed on points of law. They argued that the fact that the Court of Appeal had merely determined the amount of compensation for the expropriation, without considering whether and to what extent the adjoining owners had an obligation to contribute to the expropriation costs, was contrary to Article 17 of the Constitution, Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
In a judgment of 23 March 2001 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, at least in so far as it concerned the present case (judgment no. 480/2001).
Article 17 of the Constitution provides:
“1.  Property shall be protected by the State; rights deriving therefrom, however, may not be exercised contrary to the public interest.
No one may be deprived of his property unless it is for the public benefit, which must be duly proved, in the circumstances and manner laid down by law and only after full compensation corresponding to the value of the expropriated property at the time of the court hearing on the provisional determination of compensation. In cases in which an application is made for immediate final assessment of compensation, regard shall be had to the value of the expropriated property at the time of the court hearing of the application ...”
Legislative Decree no. 797/1971 of 30 December 1970 and 1 January 1971 is the main legislative provision governing expropriations. It applies the principles set out in the constitutional provisions. By Article 13 § 1, compensation is calculated by reference to the real value of the expropriated property on the date of publication of the decision giving notice of the expropriation.
Paragraph 4 of that Article provides:
“Where part of a property is expropriated and the part remaining in the owner's possession suffers substantial depreciation in value or is rendered unusable, the judgment in which compensation is assessed shall also include a determination of the special compensation for that part. This special compensation shall be paid to the owner together with the compensation for the expropriated part.”
The relevant provisions of section 1 of Law no. 653/1977 of 25 July and 5 August 1977 on the obligations of adjoining owners where major roads are built are worded as follows:
“(1)  Where a major road up to thirty metres wide is built in an area not covered by a town development plan, adjoining owners who derive a benefit shall be required to pay for an area fifteen metres wide, thus contributing to the cost of expropriating the properties bordering the road. However, the area to which this obligation applies shall not exceed half the surface area of the property concerned.
...
(3)  For the purposes of this section, adjoining owners whose properties front the roads that have been built shall be deemed to have derived benefit.
(4)  Where those entitled to compensation on account of an expropriation are themselves liable for payment of part of that expropriation, there shall be a set-off between rights and obligations.”
For a long time, this presumption that the benefit derived from road improvements amounted to sufficient compensation was regarded as irrebuttable. Following the Court's judgments in Katikaridis and Others v. Greece, Tsomtsos and Others v. Greece (judgments of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V) and Papachelas v. Greece ([GC], no. 31423/96, § 49, ECHR 1999-II), the national courts now accept that the presumption is no longer irrebuttable. Consequently, the owners concerned may apply to the civil courts for a declaration that they have not derived benefit within the meaning of the law cited above and, where appropriate, for additional compensation (see judgment no. 10737/1998 of the Athens Court of Appeal, which, ruling on a similar application in another case, ordered an expert assessment of whether the applicants, as adjoining owners, had actually derived any benefit from the expropriation of their property).
