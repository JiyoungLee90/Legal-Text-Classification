In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Tekin v.\u00a0Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53, Reports 1998IV, and Assenov and Others cited above, \u00a7 94).",

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account (see, for instance, V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999IX, and Raninen v.

However, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. In such cases the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government (see Orhan v. , no.\u00a025656/94, \u00a7 274, 18 June 2002).",

Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on.

Medical evidence confirmed that she had suffered concussion, multiple contusions of the soft tissues of the head, multiple bruises on her arms, legs, right hemiabdomen, and a scratch on her back which had been inflicted by blows with a blunt object, possibly at the indicated time. Consequently, the State was under an obligation to carry out an effective official investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment.",

Moreover, following her arrest and detention she was seen by three doctors. On 28 July 2004, the night of her arrest, the applicant was sent to a public drugs clinic so that her blood alcohol level could be tested. The following day her injuries were examined by a forensic doctor and she was further examined by a neurologist on 2\u00a0August 2004.",
