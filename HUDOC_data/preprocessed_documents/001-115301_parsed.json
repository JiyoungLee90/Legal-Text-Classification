According to the applicant it was theoretically possible that a complaint about the conditions of detention as an action of a public authority (the administration of the prison) could be amenable to review in the administrative courts. However, the Government had failed to prove that this remedy was accessible to the applicant. None of the State institutions to which the applicant had submitted complaints (the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, and the National Human Rights Office) had informed him that he could complain to the administrative courts. Instead, the Ministry of Justice, in a letter sent to the applicant on 20\u00a0April 2005, had informed him that complaints about possible violations of Article 3 had to be addressed to public prosecutors.

Even in the context of complaints of inadequate medical assistance in prisons the required speed of response will vary considerably, depending on the nature of the health problem requiring medical intervention. As an illustration of the MADEKKI\u2019s practice the Court notes the following recent cases. The problems with eyesight and hearing that the applicant experienced in the above-cited Da\u0123is case did not mandate the MADEKKI to act with much more expedition than the three months their review took in 2001 (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02223). Along the same lines, a MADEKKI assessment that took less than twenty days could be considered a satisfactorily timely response to a complaint from a prisoner suffering from chronic bronchial asthma (see Van Deilena v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a050950/06, \u00a7\u00a041, 15\u00a0May 2012). Lastly, in a situation where the applicant had a large arachnoid cyst in his head (see Krivo\u0161ejs v. , no.\u00a045517/04, 17\u00a0January 2012), the MADEKKI reviews that lasted for approximately one month (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a042, 44, and 46) and, on one occasion, slightly less than two months (\u00a7\u00a047) were also sufficiently timely, considering that the cyst had previously been found not to be lifethreatening (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a033 and 76).",

Tuberculosis is certainly one of the diseases whose treatment calls for particular care, since medical mismanagement can easily lead to the mutation of the ordinary tuberculosis bacillus into the exceptionally dangerous multi-drug resistant form (see Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075).",

Section\u00a064 of the Law of Administrative Procedure provided that a public authority had to reply to a request made to it within one month, and that \u201cfor objective reasons\u201d that term could be extended to four months. At the same time section\u00a08, paragraph\u00a01 of the Law on the Order of Examination of Complaints and Suggestions by State and Municipal Institutions (Iesniegumu, s\u016bdz\u012bbu un priek\u0161likumu izskat\u012b\u0161anas k\u0101rt\u012bba valsts un pa\u0161vald\u012bbu instit\u016bcij\u0101s) provided that normally a response had to be given within fifteen days, but that that term could be extended indefinitely so long as the person making the request was duly informed of the extension. Thus, even assuming that the most favourable rules were applicable to the applicant, the MADEKKI would be legally obliged to give a response within fifteen days to four months. In a different context the Court has previously criticised the above-cited timelimits as being overly long and incompatible with the requirement of the timeliness of a response (see Vikulov and Others v. Latvia (dec.), cited above). That conclusion is all the more true in the context of health care, where in certain cases having to wait fifteen days for adequate treatment might result in irreparable damage to one\u2019s health.",

Therefore, in the present case the applicant did not need to make use of that remedy prior to petitioning the Court. In the light of that conclusion the Court does not need to examine whether a complaint to the MADEKKI could potentially lead to an improvement in the quality of medical care which could be deemed to be sufficiently \u201cdirect\u201d, although it does have some doubts that the Government\u2019s suggestion that the MADEKKI could order the closing of a hospital could be deemed such a direct improvement.

[GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7\u00a075, 6\u00a0January 2011, and Leja, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047). The Court cannot but note that only six months after the alleged incident in the Central Prison the applicant made a complaint to the Administrative District Court about a virtually identical incident in Jelgava Prison. A year later that court declared unlawful the opening of correspondence between the applicant and, among other institutions, the Court. In addition, although the applicant had not requested compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by the opening of the letter from the Court, he had a right to do so pursuant to the Law of Administrative Procedure (see Meln\u012btis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a026). The Court therefore accepts that recourse to the administrative courts is an effective domestic remedy with regard to complaints about monitoring of a prisoner\u2019s correspondence by prison staff. In these circumstances it was incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate that he had in fact used the remedy in question, or that it was inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Leja, cited above, \u00a7 48, with further references). The applicant has not argued that this is the case, and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. Accordingly the applicant\u2019s complaint about the opening of his correspondence on 20\u00a0January 2006, in so far as it pertains to Article 8 of the Convention, is inadmissible because of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 4 of the Convention.",

The applicant has never suggested or implied that the prison guard on 20\u00a0January 2006 read or attempted to read the letter originating from the Court. In such circumstances the risk of reprisals by prison staff against the prisoner was very limited (contrast with Mechenkov v. , no.\u00a035421/05, \u00a7\u00a0125, 7\u00a0February 2008). It is significant to note in this context that the incident under review is a single and isolated one, not forming part of any systematic practice of intimidating applicants to the Court (compare with Cooke v. , no. 25878/94, \u00a7\u00a048, 8 February 2000). The Court recognises that the opening of the letter might have caused some concerns to the applicant. It also takes note of the fact that the opening of correspondence originating from the Court is clearly prohibited under the domestic law. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the incident of 20\u00a0January 2006 has remained an isolated one, and that the contents of the Court\u2019s letter were not read by the prison guard in question. Taking into account the above considerations, and also keeping in mind its conclusion with regard to the complaint under Article\u00a08, the Court finds that the Latvian Government in the present case has not failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention.",
