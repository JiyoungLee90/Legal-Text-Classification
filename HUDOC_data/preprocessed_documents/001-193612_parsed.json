In this regard, it is important to consider, for instance, whether there is a danger that the person concerned might abscond or cause injury or damage (see Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2006XV (extracts). In the present case, the forensic medical report merely mentioned the existence of signs and the fact that they had been caused by impact of a blunt object (mbreht\u00ebs) on the applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s body. However, the authorities did not carry out any further examination to establish whether the applicant\u2019s brother had been subjected to any form of ill-treatment (see paragraph 17 above). Furthermore, no further investigations were conducted in this respect. Hence, the Court finds that the domestic authorities did not undertake sufficient investigative measures to establish beyond any reasonable doubt if the bruises on the applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s wrists were caused by treatment contrary to Article\u00a03 of the Convention.
