According to that court, the 's interpretation of the applicant's statement and the evaluation of her behaviour were compatible with the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 5 of the Basic Law. Having regard to the context and the circumstances of the case, the Regional Court had comprehensively and coherently refuted the applicant's allegations that she had not participated in a campaign which had been organised by the PKK with the aim to hamper the criminal prosecution of breaches of the ban by provoking a massive quantity of criminal investigations, but that she had merely intended to express her opinion on the ban. This was demonstrated by the fact that the applicant and the other campaigners did not address themselves to the Federal Interior Ministry, which would have been competent for lifting the ban, but addressed a massive quantity of collected individually signed declarations to the public prosecutor's office. \nThe applicant's unwillingness to abide by the ban was further demonstrated by the fact that she had been previously convicted of a similar offence and that she had flouted the ban in another, separate way by financially supporting a sub-organisation of the PKK.",

The Court further observes that the domestic courts expressly acknowledged the applicant's right to call for a lifting of the prohibition order imposed on the PKK in 1993. It was not disputed by the parties that the prohibition order was subject to review and could be lifted by the Interior Ministry. It follows that the applicant remained free to address herself \u2013 also in a public way \u2013 to the competent authority and to demand the lifting of the prohibition order in view of the alleged change of circumstances. It follows that the applicant would have been in a position effectively to work towards a lifting of the prohibition order without risking criminal prosecution.",

Furthermore, they took into account that the applicant had undisputedly contravened the prohibition order in a separate way by making a donation to a \nsub-organisation of the PKK which had also been subjected to the ban. \nBy way of conclusion, the German courts ruled out that the declaration could be interpreted in a different way which did not call for criminal liability.

The Federal Court of Justice found on appeal that the court below had \u201csufficiently weighed the importance of the applicant's right to freedom of expression\u201d. Like in several similar cases (see page 4 of the Observations of the Applicant), the Federal Constitutional Court was of the view that the applicant's statements fell within the ambit of the applicant's right to freedom of expression (\u00a7 22). It considered that in the context of the criminal courts' examination, \u201cfreedom of expression took second place without a weighing being required in the individual case\u201d (\u00a7 24).
