Under Article 135 \u00a7 1 of the 1974 Code, during the preliminary investigation a search-and-seizure operation could only be carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge of the competent first-instance court. The warrant was to be issued in ex parte proceedings, without notification of or participation by the individuals concerned. An exception to the warrant requirement was only possible in pressing circumstances, in which case a record of the search had to be produced for approval before a judge within twenty-four hours (Article 135 \u00a7 2 of the\u00a01974 Code). If search and seizure concerned computer systems and programs, it had to be carried out in the presence of a person with technical expertise (Article 136 \u00a7 5 of the 1974 Code). The authorities could not undertake measures that went beyond the aim of the search-and-seizure operation (Article 137 \u00a7 4 of the 1974\u00a0Code).

The first applicant had not been diligent in conducting his business, as was evident from the fact that he had already been warned by the police once and could have predicted the consequences of his behaviour. The Government went on to argue that the interference had the legitimate aim of prevention of crime and maintenance of fair competition. They claimed that the interference was also proportionate: the officers who had carried out the search and seizure had known where to search and what to search for, and the operation had been conducted in the presence of the applicants, a technician and two certifying witnesses. Also, the authorities had carefully listed the seized computers in the search-and-seizure record, retained the computers in accordance with the law and in connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings, and the content of the computers had not been made public. Furthermore, the approval of the record by the court had been an important safeguard and had served as a guarantee for the justification of the measure. Lastly, the Government pointed out that unlike the cases of Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria (no. 65755/01, 22 May 2008), Kopp\u00a0v. Switzerland (25 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II) and Heino v.

In their view, the operation had been unlawful because the circumstances had not been pressing: the authorities had planned the operation carefully and could have sought judicial approval beforehand. The subsequent judicial review had been formalistic and had failed to provide any safeguards against abuse, and the applicants had been unable to present their arguments. Also, it had not been necessary for the authorities to seize the computers; they could have seized only the computer products by recording them on paper or by some other means.

The wording of that provision allowed the police authorities to carry out searches without a prior judicial warrant and essentially gave them the discretion to decide whether the circumstances were pressing. The Court, however, doubts whether the circumstances in the present case were really pressing, given that the prosecutor ordered the said operation three weeks before it was conducted. The authorities received information about the illegal distribution of computer products on 31 January, yet the operation was scheduled for 21 February 2005. Therefore the authorities had enough time to collect more information regarding the alleged criminal conduct, to open criminal proceedings and to submit a prior request to the court.",

The Court observes that the scope of a search-and-seizure operation is a relevant factor to be taken into account when deciding whether the impugned measure met the requirements of Article 8 (see Iliya Stefanov, cited above, \u00a7 38). The Court cannot speculate on the existence of personal information on the computers but notes that on no occasion did the domestic authorities take account of the applicants\u2019 complaint in this connection: the court that approved the measure did not consider the scope of the operation and did not make a distinction between information which had been necessary for the investigation and information which had not been relevant; during the investigation the applicants requested the return of the computers, arguing that they contained personal information, but neither the prosecutor nor the relevant courts scrutinised that assertion (see paragraphs 22-24 above). While the Court accepts that, as a matter of principle, the retention of the computers for the duration of the criminal proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of securing physical evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Atanasov and Ovcharov v. Bulgaria, no. 61596/00, \u00a7 70, 17 January 2008), the lack of any consideration of the relevance of the seized information for the investigation and of the applicants\u2019 complaint regarding the personal character of some of the information stored on the computers rendered the judicial review formalistic and deprived the applicants of sufficient safeguards against abuse.",

Moreover, while it is true, as the Government pointed out, that the applicants did not enter any objections in the searchand-seizure record, such an omission on their part did not relieve the domestic court from its obligation to provide a meaningful judicial scrutiny of the search and seizure, especially when subsequently the applicants made numerous complaints concerning the personal character of parts of the retained information.
