Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all Articles of the Convention (see the Amuur v. France judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 850-51, \u00a7 50) and entails a duty on the part of the State to comply with all judicial as well as other decisions rendered against it (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby\u00a0v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997II, p. 511, \u00a7 41). It follows that the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights (see the Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p.\u00a026, \u00a7 69) becomes relevant only if and when it has been established that the interference in question has satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary (see Iatridis\u00a0v.  [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 1999II).",

Secondly, in 1995 the Serbian Parliament adopted amendments to the Housing Act, postponing all such repossessions until 31\u00a0December 2000 (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above). Thirdly, on 3\u00a0March\u00a02004 the respondent State ratified Protocol No. 1, meaning that the impugned non-enforcement has thus been within this Court's competence ratione temporis for a period of three years and six months. Fourthly, the domestic courts have themselves held that the Municipality of Palilula was not only under a legal obligation to enforce the order at issue but also had had sufficient funds and available flats in order to provide the applicant's protected tenant with adequate alternative accommodation (see paragraphs 21, 27 and 31 above).

Further, as of 31\u00a0December\u00a02000, when the said deadline had expired and no other had been provided, the respondent State's interference has clearly been in breach of the relevant domestic legislation and, as such, it is incompatible with the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. Finally, the Court notes that this conclusion makes it unnecessary to ascertain whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community, on the one hand, and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights on the other (see Iatridis\u00a0v.
