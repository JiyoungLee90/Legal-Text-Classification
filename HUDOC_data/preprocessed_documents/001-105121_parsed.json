In the court\u2019s view, the prosecution\u2019s assessment cannot be sustained in any way. It has to be noted that the [prosecutor\u2019s] application does not contain any reasons for giving such a legal classification to the suspect\u2019s act. It cannot be maintained that the reports presented by experts Z.R. and A.B. point to a possibility of charging Miros\u0142aw Garlicki with homicide committed with conditional intent (\u201czamiar ewentualny\u201d). Moreover, the prosecutor assumes such legal classification of the charge in isolation from the established case-law (...) Taking into account, as stated above that the charge [of\u00a0homicide] is groundless, it evidently could not serve as a ground to grant the [prosecutor\u2019s] application.",

The suspect Miros\u0142aw Garlicki is also no longer the superior of those persons and it cannot be said that there is any hierarchical relationship between them. It is further difficult to assume in the circumstances of the case that the suspect will return to the post he held before. Similarly, it cannot be said that the suspect may influence the actions of the authority conducting the proceedings aimed at securing medical documentation and the preparation of a cardiac surgery expert report.

Consequently, he should have availed himself of an appeal against his arrest (za\u017calenie\u00a0na\u00a0zatrzymanie) as provided for in Article 246 of the CCP, which would have subjected his arrest to a comprehensive judicial review.

It transpired from the record of the applicant\u2019s arrest that he had been informed of the right to bring such an appeal. The Government argued that this remedy was effective and should have been exhausted, referring to the Convention case-law (Berli\u0144ski v.

However, the Court notes that the domestic courts kept that issue under close scrutiny. The  in its decision of 7\u00a0May 2007 found the charge of homicide entirely unsustainable. In the same decision the  established that there was no longer a risk that the applicant would interfere with the proper conduct of the proceedings in respect of the bribery charges since a significant volume of evidence related to those charges had already been gathered. Having regard to the change in the circumstances of the investigation against the applicant, the  held that the applicant would be released if he put up bail. On 18 May 2007 the Warsaw Court of Appeal amended the decision to release the applicant on bail by imposing certain other preventive measures (see paragraph 25 above). The applicant complied with all those conditions and was released on the same day. Having regard to the above, the Court is satisfied that the domestic courts applied a proportionality test to the applicant\u2019s detention falling under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) and did consider, having regard to the progress of the investigation, whether his detention on remand was strictly necessary to ensure his presence at the trial and whether other, less stringent, measures could have been sufficient for that purpose (see\u00a0Ambruszkiewicz v.

These two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked (see\u00a0T.W. v.

In the present case the Court is concerned solely with the initial stage under the first limb (the arrest period). With regard to this initial stage the Court\u2019s case-law establishes that there must be protection of an individual arrested or detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence through judicial control. The judicial control must satisfy the requirements of promptness, the automatic nature of the review and the characteristics and powers of the judicial officer. The judicial officer must offer the requisite guarantees of independence from the executive and the parties and he or she must have the power to order release, after hearing the individual and reviewing the lawfulness of, and justification for, the arrest and detention (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 146, and McKay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035).",

The first such condition is independence from the executive and the parties (see Schiesser v. , 4 December 1979, \u00a7\u00a031, Series A no. 34).

Furthermore, the Court also notes the spectacular manner of the applicant\u2019s arrest and the authorities\u2019 actions aimed at attracting as much media attention as possible to his case. All the above circumstances, and in particular the Minister of Justice \u2013 Prosecutor General\u2019s personal involvement in the case, could be seen as capable of undermining further the independence of the assessor A.M..

The Court does not accept this argument. It is true that in the context of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention the possibility exists that a higher or the highest court might, in some circumstances, make reparation for defects that took place in the first-instance proceedings (see\u00a0De Cubber v.

However, the Court finds that the doctrine of rectification of defects which occurred at the first-instance level does not apply to the judicial control of a person\u2019s arrest or detention on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The logic and the rationale of the Article 5 \u00a7 3 review requires that it is the judicial officer who has to satisfy the various conditions as defined in the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, in particular he must offer the requisite guarantees of independence from the executive and the parties (see Schiesser v.

The Court finds it opportune to recall that the presumption of innocence will be violated if a\u00a0judicial decision or a statement by a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the official regards the accused as guilty (see, among other authorities, Allenet\u00a0de Ribemont v.\u00a0France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no.\u00a0308, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-36; Daktaras v.

Furthermore, a distinction should be made between statements which reflect the opinion that the person concerned is guilty and statements which merely describe \u201ca state of suspicion\u201d. The former infringe the presumption of innocence, whereas the latter have been regarded as unobjectionable in various situations examined by the Court (see, inter alia, Lutz v. Germany, judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no.\u00a0123, p. 25, \u00a7 62, and Leutscher v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26\u00a0March 1996, Reports 1996II, p. 436, \u00a7\u00a031).",

The Court has however emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence. It has also asserted the importance of respect for the presumption of innocence during press conferences by state officials or in their interviews with the press (see Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, ECHR 2002II (extracts), which concerned statements to the press by the Prosecutor General and the Speaker of Parliament on criminal proceedings against a minister; Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7 127, 28\u00a0November 2002; and Y.B. and Others v. Turkey, nos. 48173/99 and 48319/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045, 28 October 2004). In any event, the opinions expressed must not amount to declarations by a public official of the applicant\u2019s guilt which would encourage the public to believe him or her guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Butkevi\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 53). In the present case the alleged violation resulted from the statement of Mr Z. Ziobro, the then Minister of Justice \u2013 Prosecutor General, that \u201cno-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man\u201d, which was delivered at the widely broadcast press conference held directly after the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.",

It notes in this connection that in the civil proceedings brought by the applicant the domestic courts expressly stated that Mr Z. Ziobro\u2019s statement \u201cno-one else will ever again be deprived of life by this man\u201d had harmed the applicant\u2019s reputation. In arriving at that conclusion both the  and the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal emphasised that the impugned statement was in breach of the constitutional and statutory principle of the presumption of innocence (see paragraphs 45 and 52 above). Furthermore, the Regional Court made explicit reference to the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 6 \u00a7 2 and observed that in order to respect the presumption of innocence the authorities were required to act with all due discretion and circumspection when informing the public about criminal investigations in progress. Having analysed the impugned statement of the Minister of Justice \u2013 Prosecutor General, the  found that it clearly fell foul of the obligation incumbent on the public officials in the light of the above-mentioned jurisprudence. It observed that the Minister of Justice Prosecutor General did not confine himself to reporting on the proceedings but made an \u201cemotional, exaggerated, unbalanced and judgmental statement\u201d (see paragraph 45 above). The Court of Appeal fully confirmed the findings of the first-instance court. It further emphasised that the principle of the presumption of innocence imposed on the Minister the duty of \u201cexceptional care and diligence in formulating publicly any statements\u201d as regards the charges brought against the applicant. The Court fully agrees with the position adopted by the domestic courts. It wishes to emphasise that it is the duty of the highest-ranking State officials, in particular those with responsibility for the prosecution authorities and administration of justice, to respect the presumption of innocence, one of the fundamental principles of the legal order, and to exercise particular caution when formulating any statements in relation to ongoing criminal proceedings. The Court considers that any statement of a high-ranking State official disregarding the principle of presumption of innocence is even more objectionable as it may be seen as a direction addressed to subordinate officials (see, mutatis mutandis, B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2007VI). In view of the above considerations, the Court is fully satisfied that the domestic courts, having due regard to its relevant jurisprudence, acknowledged expressly and in an unequivocal manner that the statement of the Minister of Justice \u2013 Prosecutor General had damaged the applicant\u2019s reputation and entailed a breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence.",

The applicant argued that the apology and compensation did not provide him with adequate redress. As regards the text of the apology, the Court notes that this issue was thoroughly examined by the domestic courts, which found it to constitute sufficient non-pecuniary redress to remove the consequences of the infringement at issue. The Court does not discern any reason to contest the domestic courts\u2019 decision in this respect. The applicant further took issue with the form in which the apology had been published by the defendant (the size and colour of the letters and the background, the length of the broadcast, the lack of prior notification). However, the Court observes that the applicant had ample opportunities to plead before the domestic courts for the particular form of apology and related modalities he deemed appropriate.",

Taking into account the overall context, the Court does not share the applicant\u2019s argument that the compensation for non-pecuniary damage was inadequate. The applicant sought PLN 70,000 (EUR 17,500) and the  awarded him PLN 7,000 (EUR 1,750), having found that the applicant had not demonstrated the particular impact of the statement on his private life. On the applicant\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal, having regard to the adverse publicity which the statement had attracted and the degree of the applicant\u2019s moral suffering, increased the award to PLN\u00a030,000 (EUR 7,500). Thus, when assessing the amount to be awarded the courts carefully considered all the pertinent circumstances, such as the degree of intensity of the harm, the nature of the infringement and its consequences for the applicant. The Court further notes that the courts justified their decisions by sufficient reasons. In those circumstances, the Court does not see any grounds to challenge the domestic courts\u2019 findings with regard to the amount of compensation awarded.",

He also suffered from mild depression and shunned public places, being afraid of malicious comments.

In addition, those claims were highly speculative and no direct link had been established between the applicant\u2019s detention and the impossibility to find a new job. They were also excessive and premature. As regards the claims for nonpecuniary damage, the Government considered them exorbitant and, in respect of the alleged breach of the presumption of innocence, they submitted that that issue had been examined by the domestic courts.

The Court notes that the invoices were not signed and did not specify what legal assistance was provided. Moreover, only the last of the invoices was issued following the lodging of the application with the Court. It appears that the two earlier invoices relate to the costs of legal assistance provided to the applicant in the context of the domestic proceedings against him. In respect of the legal costs incurred in connection with the submissions made by the applicant\u2019s second lawyer, the Court observes that they mainly concerned the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 2 which was eventually declared inadmissible by the Court.
