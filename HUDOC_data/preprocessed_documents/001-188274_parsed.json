Information about the incident had already been disseminated in the media before the applicant intervened. In particular, the public had been informed that a suspect was caught red-handed while accepting the money. Apparently, the suspect was not himself in a position to order a release from prison, and thus he would either have pocketed the money without having done what he promised to do for the detainee in question, or intended to share the money with someone who was in a position to take such decisions. No wonder that the incident, a clear harbinger of a high-profile corruption case, attracted public attention. Consequently, some kind of official communication to the public regarding the incident was a matter of course. The press release issued by the applicant contained a mention that the suspect had told the detainee in question that part of the money was to go to the \u201cmagistrates, judges and prosecutors responsible for the conditional release of detainees\u201d. It was not asserted that this statement by the suspect was reliable. The TV news programme which interviewed the applicant added its own comment to the official communication. It alluded to one specific judge (who had until then chaired the commission for conditional release), raising speculation as to whether the ending of her assignment to the prison in question was (not) related to the alleged criminal activity. The allusion was most inappropriate and unprofessional, because it was based on inaccurate information that, indisputably, was not provided to the programme by the applicant. The judge\u2019s name, however, was not revealed in that programme. Nonetheless, as is often the case, such secrets remain unknown for but a short time.",
