Russia, no. 30280/03, \u00a7 80, 11 February 2010), the Government submitted that the domestic authorities should have a wide discretion in matters of economic or social strategy and that favouring expenditure on pressing social issues to the detriment of claims of a purely pecuniary nature was a legitimate aim in the public interest. They further claimed that the applicants had not suffered any loss of property because they could have taken advantage of the buy-back or exchange scheme in 1992. According to the Savings Bank, the total value of bonds placed before 1 January 1992 in the Russian territory had been SUR 9\u00a0billion, while the buy-back operation in 1992 to 1995 had resulted in the purchase or exchange of bonds with a total value of 12.1 billion \u201cnew\u201d Russian roubles (RUR). The excess was accounted for by the inflow of bonds from newly independent States outside Russia. As the series and numbers of bonds had not been recorded at the time of initial placement, it was no longer possible to establish when and where they had been purchased and by whom initially. Lastly, the Government submitted that Russia\u2019s obligations to the holders of 1982 premium bonds were maintained. The relevant laws and regulations had been suspended because of the limited resources of the federal budget. Redeeming the bonds at the present time would prevent the State from fulfilling its social commitments to Russian citizens and developing the Russian economy.",

That operation would have allowed them to establish the exact quantity of unredeemed bonds and the amount of funds required for their redemption and to find a proper balance between that and other priority expenses. However, no such conversion had ever been carried out and the Russian authorities had adopted a passive\u00a0approach to implementation of the entitlement of the bondholders. The applicants pointed out that the Government had incorrectly calculated the outcome of the buy-back operation. They had not taken into account that the bonds had been redeemed at 1.6 times their nominal value. If the total amount of redeemable bonds had been RUR 14.4 billion (the initial value of SUR 9 billion multiplied by 1.6) and the actual redeemed amount had been RUR 12.1 billion, the remainder of the outstanding bonds was equal to RUR 2.3 billion at the redemption price or RUR 1.44 billion (RUR 2.3 billion divided by 1.6) at the nominal value. The outstanding amount was but a small fraction of Russia\u2019s federal budget of approximately 14 trillion Russian roubles (RUB) or the combined value of the National Wealth and Reserve Funds of 10.9 trillion (2017). As to the Government\u2019s argument about limited resources, the applicants pointed out that since 2000 the Russian State had run a budget surplus thanks to high oil prices. However, instead of settling their debt to internal creditors, such as the applicants, the authorities had used money to buy foreign bonds or finance expensive high-level sports events.",

Even though Russia has achieved relative prosperity and wealth in subsequent years, the Court has agreed that defining budgetary priorities in terms of favouring expenditure on pressing social issues to the detriment of claims of a purely pecuniary nature was a legitimate aim in the public interest (see Malysh and Others, \u00a7\u00a080, and Yuriy Lobanov, \u00a7 50, both cited above).",

The Court has found that those principles mandated the Russian State to fulfil in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner, the legislative promises it had made in respect of claims arising out of the 1982 premium bonds. In particular, it was incumbent on the authorities to legislate on the conditions for implementation of the bondholders\u2019 entitlement, with a view to satisfying the undertaking that had been created through the enactment of the Savings Protection Act and follow-up legislation (see Malysh and Others, \u00a7\u00a082, and Yuriy Lobanov, \u00a7\u00a051, both cited above).",

Those acts laid down a legislative framework for settlement of bondholders\u2019 entitlement which had been continuously recognised as part of the State\u2019s internal debt. In early 2000, the Russian Government issued a regulation on the conversion procedure (ibid., \u00a7 21). However, for reasons that remain unclear to the Court, as no explanation has been put forward by the Government, from 2003 the implementation of the existing legal framework governing redemption of the 1982 premium bonds has remained continuously suspended, year after year (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022 and 52).",

In fact, as the applicants in the present case pointed out, no such assessment could have been possible in the absence of key indicators, such as the quantity and total valuation of the outstanding bonds. That information has not been, and could not have been, obtained because the stamping of the outstanding bonds and entering their details into the Ministry of Finance register, as provided for in the Conversion Procedure Act and Government Regulation no. 82 (ibid., \u00a7 21), has never been completed. While the radical reform of Russia\u2019s political and economic system in the 1990s, as well as the state of the country\u2019s finances, may have once justified stringent financial limitations on rights of a purely pecuniary nature, it is currently the case that the Russian Government have been unable to put forward a satisfactory justification for their continuous failure, over a period of more than fifteen years, to implement an entitlement conferred on the applicants by Russian legislation (see Malysh and Others, \u00a7\u00a083, and Yuriy Lobanov, \u00a7\u00a052, both cited above).",

A period of stability in the USSR when the bonds were used as a money substitute at nominal value was followed by rampant inflation and a sharp depreciation of the national currency in the newly independent Russia. The legitimate expectation that the enactment of the Savings Protection Act gave the bondholders in 1995 was later frustrated by its continuous suspension after 2003. Those developments must have affected the value of the bonds and the amount to be awarded to the applicants for the loss actually sustained (damnum emergens). The situation of applicants who acquired bonds in the Soviet times at full value must accordingly be distinguished from those who bought them in the later period on account of differences in their respective financial exposure. With a view to determining the value of the actual damage the applicants sustained, the Court asked each of them to specify the time and manner of acquisition of the 1982 bonds in their possession, and the purchase price, if any, they had paid.

Serbia, no. 15112/07, \u00a7 67, 12 June 2012, and Vasilevski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a022653/08, \u00a7 66, 28 April 2016). Admittedly, with the passage of time some documents may have been lost or misplaced, but such unusual wealth should have left at least some written traces which the applicants should have been able to produce to lend credibility to their claims. Lastly, the Court notes that Mr\u00a0Karagezov produced several lists of serial numbers of bonds. The lists ended with a figure representing the total value of bonds and a name next to it which was different from his name. Since Mr\u00a0Karagezov did not clarify the matter of bonds\u2019 ownership in his submissions, or, for that matter, include any pecuniary damage in his statement of claim under Article 41 of the Convention, the Court makes no award to him under this head.",

This conclusion echoes the Court\u2019s findings in the series of similar cases listed in paragraph 20 above. The first three of those cases concerned a different type of bonds which had also been recognised as part of the State\u2019s internal debt. Implementation of the federal legislation governing their buyout had been suspended between 2003 and 2009. In July 2009 a federal law governing the buyout procedure had been adopted. It was followed, in September 2009, by a Government regulation setting out the procedure for making payments in exchange for bonds (see Tronin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 29-31). The Court noted, in respect of that type of bonds, that it was open to the applicants to apply to the competent domestic authorities for their redemption (ibid., \u00a7 67). The matter was thus resolved and no general measures were required for the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments concerning that type of bonds.",

The Russian Government reported to the Committee of Ministers that they had distributed a Russian translation of the judgment to various authorities and established an interagency commission for \u201cpre-reform\u201d (that is to say, Soviet-time) savings under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance (see DH-DD(2012)31 - Communication from the Russian authorities dated 30 November 2011, and DH-DD(2013)379 - Communication from the Russian authorities dated 25\u00a0March 2013). The work of the interagency commission did not result in any draft legislation being proposed or discussed in Parliament. As the Court has found above, an inventory of the outstanding bonds has never been completed and their current amount cannot be known. The obligation to offer some kind of settlement to the holders of 1982 premium bonds continues to exist in domestic law; it has not been extinguished or annulled but merely postponed or suspended by successive laws, most recently for a three-year period starting from 1\u00a0January\u00a02017 (see paragraph 12 above). The Court therefore concludes that there exists a structural problem stemming from the authorities\u2019 continued failure to implement the entitlement of the bondholders to some form of compensation and to execute its earlier judgments concerning the same issue, which amounts to a practice incompatible with the Convention.",
