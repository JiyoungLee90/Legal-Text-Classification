It further refers to its settled case-law to the effect that when an applicant has suffered an infringement of his rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, he should, as far as possible, be put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of that provision not been disregarded, and that the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a046221/99, \u00a7 210 in fine, ECHR\u00a02005IV, and Popov v. Russia, no.\u00a026853/04, \u00a7 263, 13 July 2006).
