In 2011 the Constitutional Court rejected his appeal applying the pre-Zolotukhin case-law. Its approach had since evolved (see paragraph 18 above). The Court further notes that the definition of the minor offence under section 3(1)(2) of the Public Order Act 2000 does not, as such, include inflicting bodily harm, whereas that element is crucial for the criminal offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under Article 177 of the 1998 Criminal Code. However, in its decision, the Minor Offences Court expressly stated that the applicant was guilty of, inter alia, slapping M.P. and of punching her about her entire body. The physical attack on M.P. thus constituted an element of the minor offence of which the applicant was found guilty (in this connection, see Maresti, cited above, \u00a7 63). In the criminal proceedings before the Municipal Court the applicant was again found guilty of, inter alia, hitting M.P.
