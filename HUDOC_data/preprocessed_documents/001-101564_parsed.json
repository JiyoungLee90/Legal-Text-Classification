In doing so, they relied on specific examples of recent case-law showing that the remedy was both slow in its effect and generally resulted in awards not capable of offering sufficient just satisfaction. The Government did not rely on any other case-law to counter these arguments, but only stated in a general manner that the applicants could not prove the alleged inefficiency of the remedy under examination without first attempting to use it. The Court considers that the awards made by the domestic courts in similar cases (see paragraph 63 above) were small in comparison to what the Court has awarded in its own judgments in respect of Moldova (see, for instance, David v. , no. 41578/05, \u00a7 47, 27 November 2007, and Hyde Park and Others v.

They therefore sought a finding that an entire class of cases should not be dealt with by the domestic courts but rather by the Court directly. The Court considers that it would need to be presented with clear evidence of systematic denial of sufficient just satisfaction to victims of Article 5 violations before accepting such an argument. It finds that the applicants did not submit sufficient evidence in this respect. It notes that in at least one case the Moldovan courts awarded an applicant a substantial amount of compensation, exceeding EUR 10,000 (see Duca v.  (striking out), no. 1579/02, \u00a7 13, 10 June 2008). The Court is aware of the differences between that case and the present one: the Duca case concerned a criminal prosecution, rather than administrative arrest as in the present case; the unlawful deprivation of liberty in that case lasted for a much longer period of time and the award made included compensation for violations of Article 3 of the Convention.

In respect of the length of the investigation, the applicant submitted that by November 2006 most of the evidence in the case had been collected, and subsequent evidence-gathering measures were sporadic. For over three years the investigation was limited to hearing the few witnesses and obtaining a couple of medical reports. Moreover, the investigation was formally discontinued for 18 months during that period.

Moreover, when the prosecutor decided to order a new medical expert report concerning the injuries caused to the first applicant, the latter was not informed, nor given the opportunity to exercise his rights under Article 145 of the CCP (see paragraphs 30 and 61 above). On certain occasions the prosecutor refused to allow the first applicant access to the materials of the case, including those which could not be considered confidential since they concerned evidence obtained from the first applicant himself (see paragraphs 28, 30 and 80 above).",

In any event, access to materials could only be given on the basis of written requests and the first applicant had made none. The Court notes that the Government did not submit evidence that the first applicant had been informed, as required by law, of all the important decisions taken, while the content of some of the first applicant's complaints suggests that he was not informed (see, for instance, paragraph 33 above). Moreover, it must be emphasised that the first applicant was the victim of an alleged crime. He therefore needed to be kept informed of the course of the events and cannot be held responsible for asking the prosecution to update him only occasionally and not on a constant basis. It appears from the materials in the file that he was often unaware of the course of the proceedings and reacted each time he found out about new decisions taken, each time obtaining the annulment of the relevant decision.",
