The prosecutor had sought a court order blocking access to a particular website, two pages of which contained documentation of a prohibited political party, by means of \u201cadding filter rules for the website\u2019s IP address to the area border router\u201d. The lower courts at two instances had dismissed the prosecutor\u2019s claim, having found that the ISP had no technical means of blocking access to individual pages of the website and that there were no legal grounds for blocking access to the entire website. The Supreme Court disagreed. It held that the ISP was bound, under section 10(6) of the Information Act, to block the dissemination of extremist content. In so far as it had a technical possibility to enforce the wholesale blocking of the website\u2019s IP address by defining filter rules at the area border router, the ISP should have used that method to block access to the website.",

From that time, the Russian courts had used the formula in a large number of cases to block access to the IP addresses of entire websites, even where the prohibited material was located on just one or two pages of the websites (see paragraph 13 above). That formula flouted the distinction between the website as a whole and a particular page of a website, in disregard of the definitions in section 2 of the Information Act. On textual reading, the courts ordered the blocking of access to particular webpages which contained extremist material. As the scope of the order was ostensibly limited to illicit content, they were not bound to consider whether it affected the accessibility of the website\u2019s legitimate content. However, the court-mandated technical means of implementing a blocking order \u2013 blocking access to the website\u2019s IP address \u2013 inevitably resulted in blocking access to the entire website, because only websites had IP addresses whereas their individual webpages did not. To the applicant\u2019s knowledge, there had been only one instance in which the courts had correctly acknowledged that blocking access to one page by way of the website\u2019s IP address would have the collateral effect of blocking the whole website (see paragraph 14 above). Incidentally, that judgment had been upheld by the same Rostov Regional Court which, two months later, had reached the opposite conclusion in the applicant\u2019s case. The applicant concluded that the judicial practice, which had developed following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and of which his case was but one example, failed to meet the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement. It disregarded the distinction between a \u201cwebsite\u201d and a \u201cwebpage\u201d and allowed courts to block access to an entire website on the grounds that one of its pages contained problematic content. It also removed the need for considering how that form of blocking affected legitimate content. For the applicant, that manner of proceedings was tantamount to holding that \u201caccess to hearing room 5 should be restricted by blocking the main entrance to the courthouse\u201d.",

States frequently adopted anti-extremism laws that were so broad as to give authorities excessive discretion to restrict online expression, contrary to the lawfulness requirement. Such legislation prioritised restrictions on, rather than protection of, free expression as the primary State responsibility and failed to define precisely limitations on online expression and justifications for those limitations. The wholesale blocking of websites rarely, if ever, satisfied the criteria for permissible limitations on freedom of expression, taking into account that permissible restrictions should be content-specific and should not target websites solely because they were critical of the government or political system.",

In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention, and indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v.

That provision allowed the authorities to block any content, dissemination of which was punishable under administrative or criminal law. The e-book fell within the scope of that provision. It had been previously categorised as extremist material. Such material may not be distributed or transmitted over public communication networks (see Mariya Alekhina and Others v. Russia, no. 38004/12, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, 17 July 2018) and its mass dissemination constitutes an offence under Article 20.29 of the Code of Administrative Offences. It follows that, in so far as the District Court\u2019s decision targeted the e-book, the interference can be said to have been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d.",

The District Court also determined the method of implementation of the blocking measure. To that end, it borrowed the formula from the application lodged by the prosecutor, who had requested that access to the extremist content be blocked by means of \u201cadding filter rules for the website\u2019s IP address to the area border router\u201d. In layman\u2019s terms, that formula requires the ISP to apply filtering technology capable of preventing users from connecting to the website located at the specified numerical network address (IP address). In other words, the District Court ordered the blocking of access to the offending content by means of blocking access to the entire website, because only websites, but not their individual pages or sections, have IP\u00a0addresses. The applicant speculated that behind the use of that formula had been a lack of technical expertise on the part of the judges, which had prevented them from distinguishing a particular page of the website from the website as a whole. The unsettled case-law of the Russian courts may lend support to his hypothesis. There have been cases in which lower courts correctly determined that blocking access to a website\u2019s IP address would lead to arbitrary blocking of legitimate content on the same website. Some such decisions were overturned on appeal, whereas others were upheld (see paragraphs 12 to 14 above). The fact however remains that this blocking method has been used in thousands of cases (see paragraph 15 above).",

Such a measure deliberately disregards the distinction between the legal and illegal information the website may contain, and renders inaccessible large amounts of content which has not been designated as illegal. Blocking access to a website\u2019s IP address has the practical effect of extending the scope of the blocking order far beyond the illegal content which had originally been targeted (compare Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7 63). Such an extension did not have a legal basis in the circumstances of the present case. Section 10 of the Information Act allowed the authorities to target content that was proscribed under administrative or criminal law, rather than an entire website. The blocking formula employed by the District Court did not feature in any primary legislation or implementing regulations. The Government, in their observations, did not point to any legal provision on which the method of implementation chosen by the District Court could have been based.",

The ISP has no vested interest in the outcome of the proceedings.

Nor did they consider whether the same result could be achieved with less intrusive means or carry out an impact assessment of the blocking measure to ensure that it strictly targets the illegal content and has no arbitrary or excessive effects, including those resulting from the method chosen to implement it. As regards the transparency requirement, the Information Act makes no provision for communicating the decision taken under section 10(6) to the owner of the targeted website. In the present case, the applicant had been unaware of the blocking order until he discovered that access to his website had been blocked (see paragraph 4 above).",
