The case originated in an application (no. 10535/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Russian nationals: Ms Nadezhda Viktorovna Inderkina, Mr Igor Aleksandrovich Inderkin, Mr Aleksandr Igorevich Inderkin, and Mr Andrey Igorevich Inderkin.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 23 February 2011 the non-enforcement complaint was communicated to the Government.
The applicants are a family. They were born in 1971, 1968, 1992, 1995, and live in Samara.
On 26 April 2004 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Samara (“the Oktyabrskiy District Court”) ordered, inter alia, the management of the State unitary enterprise “16th Military Plant” (“the company”) to provide the applicants with a suitable dwelling, while keeping their names on the list of persons awaiting housing.
On 11 May 2004 the judgment came into force.
On 28 May 2004 the Department of the Bailiffs’ Service for Oktyabrskiy District of Samara opened the enforcement proceedings.
On 22 December 2004 the enforcement proceedings were terminated as the company had no available residential accommodation.
On 1 October 2007, due to the reorganisation of the company (see paragraph 16 below), the enforcement file was sent to the Department of the Bailiffs’ Service for the Engelsskiy District of Saratov Region.
On 21 April 2008 the bailiffs ruled that it was impossible to enforce the judgment in the part relating to the housing, as the new debtor, FGUP 9 TSARZ (see paragraph 16 below), had no available accommodation. The enforcement proceedings were terminated.
On 26 August 2009 the Engelsskiy District Court of Saratov Region, following the bailiffs’ application, replaced the debtor in the enforcement proceedings from FGUP 9 TSARZ to OAO 9 TSARZ (see paragraph 17 below).
On 14 October 2009 the Oktyabrskiy District Court clarified the judgment of 26 April 2004 stating that the applicants should be provided with an apartment in Samara.
Several times in 2004-2011 the parties applied to the Oktyabrskiy District Court for changing the mode of enforcement of the judgment. Each time the courts rejected the applications finding that a payment of the amount representing the cost of an apartment would be equal to modifying the original judgment.
The judgment of 26 April 2004 remained unenforced.
The company was incorporated as a municipal unitary enterprise. According to its articles of association, the company’s aim was to produce goods and render services for the Ministry of Defense of Russia, as well as for meeting other public needs and making a profit.
Under the Order of the Federal Agency for State Property Management dated 22 September 2005 the company was joined to FGUP 9 TSARZ (FGUP 9 Tsentralnyy Avtomobilnyy Remontnyy Zavod – ФГУП 9 ЦАРЗ or ФГУП 9 Центральный Автомобильный Ремонтный Завод). The reorganisation was completed on 13 February 2007, and the latter company became the universal successor of the company.
In accordance with the Decree of the President of Russia of 15 September 2008 and the Decree of the Russian Government of 22 November 2008, FGUP 9 TSARZ was further reorganized into OAO 9 TSARZ, a publicly-traded private open joint-stock company incorporated under the laws of Russia.
