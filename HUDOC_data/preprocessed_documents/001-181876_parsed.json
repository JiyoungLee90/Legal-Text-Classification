Historically, the purported \u2018protective function\u2019 of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning \u2018State secrets\u2019. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of \u2018State secrets\u2019 became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that \u2018the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of \u2018State secrets\u2019...\u201d",

However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants\u2019 freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr\u00a0Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr\u00a0Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr\u00a0Litavrin and Mr\u00a0Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko\u2019s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants\u2019 safety. A string of references to the Court\u2019s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim.",

Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr\u00a0Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no.\u00a025664/05, \u00a7\u00a096, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother\u2019s poor health was \u201cof no legal significance\u201d (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual\u2019s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, with further references).",

The Court reiterates at the outset that \u2013 unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 \u00a7\u00a03 (d) or Article 11 \u00a7\u00a02 \u2013 Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos.\u00a052562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a048420/10 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a083 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued.",

The Government\u2019s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for \u2013 as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, \u00a7 51) \u2013 Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants\u2019 own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual\u2019s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, \u00a7 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, \u00a7 51).

As regards Russia\u2019s commitment to cease to restrict international travel of persons aware of State secrets, the Government submitted that \u201cthe intention did not imply a full repeal of the restrictions, especially since the \u2018generally accepted\u2019 restrictions are not set out in any document\u201d. At present, it could only be expected that the measures for the protection of State interests would be proportionate to the aim pursued and that the national law would be further developed with a possibility of gradually repealing such restrictions at some future point in time. Lastly, the Government pointed out that on 22 June 2011 the Interagency Commission had established a working group to explore common approaches to problematic issues relating to travel restrictions on individuals aware of State secrets. Its task was to develop methodology for determining the specific duration of the restriction, taking into account the extent of their awareness of State secrets and the exhaustive list of criteria for restricting the right to travel abroad. The working group had drafted two federal laws, one Presidential decree and two Government resolutions which were in the process of being approved by the executive authorities.",

The situation had not changed after the adoption by the Russian Constitutional Court of judgment no. 14-P, dated 7\u00a0June 2012, which had upheld the validity of the travel ban. The applicants emphasised that the accession commitments were considered as conditions sine qua non for Russia\u2019s membership of the Council of Europe and that the Parliamentary Assembly regarded the travel restrictions as incompatible with the status of a member State. For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition. Under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party could not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and Russia had to abide by its commitments.",

The Parliamentary Assembly\u2019s Opinion on Russia\u2019s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 60 above). The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia\u2019s accession request of Russia\u2019s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, \u00a7 50). The Russian Federation became a member State of the Council of Europe on 28\u00a0February 1996.

On 10\u00a0February 2011 the Court reiterated its findings in the similar case of Soltysyak v. Russia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46-54). It pointed out that Russia was the only member State that had retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of State secrets (\u00a7 51). In June 2012 the Russian Constitutional Court also considered a challenge to the restriction brought by one of the applicants in the instant case, Mr Ilchenko. Although it held that it was generally compatible with the Russian Constitution, it called for a departure from the purely formalistic approach and for the adoption of a more nuanced approach tailored to the requirements of the specific situation (see paragraph\u00a028 above).",
