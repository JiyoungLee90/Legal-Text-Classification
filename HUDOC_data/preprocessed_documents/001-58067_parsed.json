Mrs Ankerl had been heard only for information purposes because as she was the wife of one of the parties, she was not in law allowed to take the oath. The \"financial loyalty\" binding Mr Linder to the plaintiff company that owned the building was, however, no less strong than matrimonial loyalty in a society in which family ties had weakened. By nonetheless attaching an exclusive \"probative value\" to Mr Linder\u2019s testimony, the court had clearly put the applicant at a disadvantage, infringed the principle of equality of arms and consequently breached his right to a fair hearing.",

In the Netherlands courts the onus had been on the applicant company to establish that there had been an oral agreement between it and a bank concerning the extension of certain credit facilities. Two people had attended the meeting at which the agreement had allegedly been concluded: the representative of the applicant company and the representative of the bank. Only the latter had been allowed to give evidence as a witness; the judge had refused to call the company\u2019s representative as a witness on the ground that he was identified with the Dombo Beheer B.V. company. Having noted that during the negotiations the two protagonists had acted on an equal footing, each of them being empowered to negotiate on behalf of his party, the Court had concluded that the company had been placed at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis its opponent. In the instant case, on the other hand, Mr Linder had been only the director of the company appointed as agent to manage the plaintiff company\u2019s building; he did not belong to the plaintiff company, was not empowered to enter into a lease without its specific agreement and was not a party to the court proceedings. There had therefore been nothing to prevent the Court of First Instance hearing him as a witness. If a third party had been present at the interview in issue, Mr Ankerl could similarly have had that person give evidence under oath.",

The applicant had lost his case therefore not because his wife\u2019s statements - which the court had in any case taken into account - had not been taken on oath but because they had conflicted with irrefutable evidence.

Several factors led it to distinguish the instant case from the Dombo Beheer B.V. case, namely: it was a feature of many legal systems that parties in civil proceedings and persons closely related to them could not be heard as witnesses under oath; the Court of First Instance had based its judgment on other evidence besides Mr Linder\u2019s testimony; and Mrs Ankerl\u2019s statement had been vague and inconclusive.",

The Court\u2019s task is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were \"fair\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). It reiterates in this connection that the requirement of \"equality of arms\", in the sense of a \"fair balance\" between the parties, applies also to litigation in which private interests are opposed; in such instances \"equality of arms\" implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case - including his evidence -under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see the Dombo Beheer B.V. judgment previously cited, p. 19, paras. 32-33). A difference of treatment in respect of the hearing of the parties\u2019 witnesses may therefore be such as to infringe the principle in question.",

In the exercise of its power freely to assess the evidence the court was entitled not to regard Mrs Ankerl\u2019s statements as decisive in regard to the conclusion of an unwritten agreement to enter into a lease; the Government pointed out, without being contradicted, that under cantonal law the court freely assesses the results of the \"measures taken to obtain evidence\" (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, it does not appear from the judgment that the court attached any particular weight to Mr\u00a0Linder\u2019s testimony on account of his having given evidence on oath (see paragraph 19 above). Lastly, the court relied on evidence other than just the statements in issue.",

Accordingly, the circumstances of the case, unlike those of the Dombo Beheer B.V. case, lead it to find that the difference of treatment in respect of the hearing of the parties\u2019 witnesses by the Court of First Instance did not place the applicant at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent.",
