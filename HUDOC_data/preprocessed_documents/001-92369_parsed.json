The shepherd told them that he had discovered this site on 5 February 2003. The applicant saw a hole measuring approximately 1.5 m. in diameter and 1 m. in depth, with small fragments of a human body all around. The remains looked as though the body had been torn apart by an explosion. The applicant examined the hole and found several pieces of bone, a lock of hair and the lower part of a right leg with a woollen sock, a striped cotton sock and a burnt boot on it. He identified the socks and the boot as belonging to his son, Murad Khachukayev. The other fragments of the corpse of the applicant\u2019s son, who had weighed 120 kg when he was alive, were too small and therefore unidentifiable. Some time later the applicant found out that a number of residents of Urus-Martan and the nearby villages had heard the explosion on the night of his son\u2019s abduction.",

There had been military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The armed men who had abducted Murad Khachukayev spoke unaccented Russian, had been armed with sniper rifles, and were wearing camouflage uniform. The group had consisted of at least fourteen men. According to some witnesses, the men had arrived at the applicant\u2019s house in UAZ vehicles, of a type normally used only by federal forces. Because of the curfew, such a large group of armed men could not have moved freely around the area between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. unless they had obtained the permission of federal forces or were military servicemen. The men had stated that they had arrived to do a passport check and had acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. The abductors had not taken away another son of the applicant, Mr S.Kh., as the latter was an officer of a local enforcement agency and had a service gun; if the abductors had been members of illegal armed groups, they would have rather attacked Mr S.Kh. in retaliation for his work. The abductors had driven away in the direction of the Russian military checkpoint. Murad Khachukayev had not been seen alive since his abduction. His remains had been discovered in the orchard where blown-up corpses of other abducted men had previously been found. The body of Murad Khachukayev had been blown up only about 20 metres from the road, which demonstrated that only Russian federal servicemen could have openly acted in such close proximity to the road without fear of arrest.

The Court observes that the applicant, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged the actions or omissions of investigating authorities before a court (see paragraphs 46, 51 and 54 above). Furthermore, the investigation was resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times owing to the need to take additional investigative steps (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above) or after the local court had granted the applicant\u2019s complaint in that respect (see paragraph 54 above). However, the prosecutor\u2019s office still failed to investigate the applicant\u2019s allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.\u00a0Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy relied on by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
