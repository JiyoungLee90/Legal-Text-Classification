Mrs Apostolou referred, in particular, to the incompatibility between the office of a member of parliament and the fact that the applicant was practising as a lawyer. This incompatibility had been enshrined in the Constitution for the first time on the occasion of a constitutional revision in 2001. The new Article 57 of the Constitution now states that the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with all professional activity, although it does provide for the introduction of exceptions through legislation. However, the implementing legislation was never enacted, since, according to information submitted by the applicant, the Chamber of Deputies voted against the draft law in February 2003. Article 115 \u00a7 7 of the revised Constitution indicated that the rule on disqualification in question would come into force once the implementing legislation provided for in Article 57 had been enacted and, at the latest, on 1 January 2003 (see paragraph 16 below).",

He also claimed that the disqualification could not be applied to members of parliament who had been elected prior to the revision of the Constitution. Submitting several documents in evidence, he added that he had ceased receiving fees as of 1\u00a0January 2003 and that he was carrying out his activities free of charge, with the result that he could not be deemed to be practising a profession within the meaning of Article 57.",

At the same time, the Constitution delegated to Parliament the power to introduce exceptions to the [general] rule of professional disqualification, in other words, the power to list those professional activities which would be compatible with the duties of a member of parliament ... In addition, [the same provisions state that] the rule establishing the incompatibility between the duties of a member of parliament and the practising of any profession was to come into force, at the latest, on 1 January 2003 ..., even if the law indicating the professional activities that are compatible with the duties of a member of parliament had not been enacted by that date ... The only consequence of the failure to enact this legislation ... is that the rule on disqualification for members of parliament is applicable, without exception, from 1\u00a0January 2003 ... Further, the argument put forward by the applicant in his submissions to the effect that the disqualification is not applicable to members of the current Chamber of Deputies, since this would be contrary to the constitutional principle of legitimate expectation, must be dismissed as unfounded, especially since a constitutional provision cannot be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to another provision or principle of the same Constitution.

In particular, he complained that the impugned disqualification had been interpreted by the Special Supreme Court in the widest possible manner, thus disregarding the intentions of the constitutional revision body and of the ordinary legislature, which had clearly ruled, in both 2001 and 2003, in favour of a non-absolute professional disqualification. In this connection, the applicant noted that in February 2003 the draft implementing Law for the new Article 57 \u2013 a bill which provided for an absolute professional disqualification \u2013 had been dismissed by the Chamber of Deputies. He submitted that this was an unprecedented event in \u2019s parliamentary annals, particularly since the ruling party then enjoyed an absolute majority in Parliament. The applicant considered that, given that the Chamber which threw out this bill was the same as that which, two years previously, had enacted the new Article 57, the real intent behind that Article had thus been the adoption of a partial professional disqualification, the exact limits of which were to be established by the ordinary legislature.",

No one could seriously contest this two-fold aim, the pursuit of which undoubtedly fell within the Contracting States\u2019 margin of appreciation. However, he considered that the means used to achieve that aim had exceeded the level of what was tolerable in a democratic society.

He argued that a simple reading of the official records showed that the disqualification in question had been proposed by the then government for the first time in January 2001, to general surprise. During the brief debate which had preceded its enactment, many voices had been raised against it. It was therefore clear that, at the time of his election for a four-year term of office, neither the applicant nor his constituents had been able to foresee that he would lose his seat before the end of the parliamentary term for which he stood. In deciding that the disqualification in question also concerned members of parliament who had been elected before its enactment, the Special Supreme Court had thus breached the principle of legitimate expectation with regard not only to the applicant, but also those who had freely voted for him.",

In this connection, the Government emphasised that the risk of unlawful influence on a member of parliament through his or her professional activities increased where the parliamentarian concerned was not paid for that work, since the client-constituent would feel obliged to thank the member of parliament by voting for him or her in subsequent elections.

The Government added that between the constitutional revision in April 2001, introducing the disqualification, and the latter\u2019s entry into force in January 2003, members of parliament had had approximately twenty-one months to assess the situation and to choose between their profession and their duties as members of parliament.",

As proof, the Government noted that, with the exception of the applicant and one other member of parliament, the other members of the 2000-04 legislature chose to exercise their duties as members of parliament and that the implementation of the disqualification did not prevent citizens from standing for election in the parliamentary elections of March 2004.

However, having regard to the preparatory work to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election (see, among many other authorities, Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.

In any event, neither the parliamentary commission\u2019s report of 30 March 1998 nor, even less, that of 23 October 2000 referred to the introduction of an absolute professional disqualification (see paragraph 18 above).

I would also add that the judgment in question did not have sufficient legal basis. It was supposed to be an application of Article 57 of the Constitution, but such an application was evidently wrong because it is clear from the relevant provisions of that Article that it was only intended to be applied to parliamentarians elected after it came into force, not to those who had already been elected. Therefore, it was not applicable to parliamentarians like the applicant, who had been elected a year before the introduction of that provision. This is apparent from the fact that the Article prescribes a period of eight days after the election for the parliamentarians concerned to opt between their parliamentary mandate and their professional activities as follows:",

Furthermore, according to the Government, the rule would reinforce the authority and independence of parliamentarians and protect them from any pressure that may emanate from their private clients. However, there does not appear to have been any serious study of the advantages and disadvantages of such an absolute restriction before the rule was introduced; in particular, there has been no consideration of whether the aim pursued could have been achieved by a more qualified and less restrictive rule rather than the absolute one that was adopted. In this respect, it is important to underline that, according to the relevant constitutional provision which introduced the rule, legislation was to be brought in to specify the activities that could be considered compatible with parliamentary office. This legislation has, however, never been enacted and so this matter has been left in abeyance and undecided, although the legislature had already manifested through the provision in question an intention to qualify the rule on incompatibility.",

The result is that there has been an interference with the rights safeguarded by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. I also find quite pertinent the argument that in other States, such as the United Kingdom and , a similar objective to the one pursued by the rule in question has been attained by far less restrictive means.",
