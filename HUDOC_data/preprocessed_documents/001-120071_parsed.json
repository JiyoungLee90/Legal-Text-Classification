Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The disclosure of such data may seriously affect a person\u2019s private and family life, as well as their social and employment situation, by exposing them to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v. Finland, 25\u00a0February 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, Reports 1997-I). Respecting the confidentiality of health data is crucial not only for the protection of a patient\u2019s privacy but also for the maintenance of that person\u2019s confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from seeking appropriate treatment, thereby endangering their own health (see Z., cited above, \u00a7 95, and Biriuk v. Lithuania, no. 23373/03, \u00a7 43, 25 November 2008). Nevertheless, the interests of a patient and the community as a whole in protecting the confidentiality of medical data may be outweighed by the interest of investigating and prosecuting crime and in the publicity of court proceedings, where such interests are shown to be of even greater importance (see, Z., cited above, \u00a7 97).",

The medical facilities where the applicants underwent treatment did not report any instances of alleged criminal behaviour to the prosecutor\u2019s office. In particular, it was open to the medical professionals providing treatment to the second applicant, who was two years old at the time, to apply or to ask the prosecutor to apply for judicial authorisation for a blood transfusion if they believed her to be in a life-threatening situation. Likewise, there is nothing in the materials before the Court to suggest that the doctors who reported the fourth applicant\u2019s case to the District Prosecutor opined that her refusal of a blood transfusion was not an expression of her true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on her by other adherents of her religious beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, Jehovah\u2019s\u00a0Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 137-38).
