In the same vein, attesting witnesses present during the crime scene inspection and the applicant\u2019s medical examination on 22 May 2002 testified to the court that the applicant had not complained about the alleged ill-treatment in their presence. Furthermore, his submissions were contradicted by statements from independent witnesses A. and N., who had been arrested, brought to the police station and detained there together with the applicant, and who had testified to the court that nobody had beaten him up or threatened him in their presence. According to the forensic examination, the applicant\u2019s injuries had been sustained two to three days before his arrest. Furthermore, the court considered that he had waited for several months before complaining about the alleged ill-treatment and, when questioned about it by the court, made contradictory statements about the circumstances in which he had sustained the injuries. Thus, he alleged once that he could have sustained the ear injury in a scuffle with skinheads prior to his arrest, on another occasion he claimed that nobody had beaten him up. Moreover, witness V. testified to the Court that he had seen the applicant on 19 May 2002 sleeping under a bench at a subway station in a state of intoxication.",

At the same time, the Court cannot but note that the applicant waited for more than two months before complaining about the alleged ill-treatment. The Court has emphasised on several occasions that persons held in custody are often in a stressful situation and may be vulnerable to pressure (see Belevitskiy v. , no. 72967/01, \u00a7\u00a066, 1\u00a0March 2007, and Mammadov v. , no.\u00a034445/04, \u00a7\u00a074, 11 January 2007).

Inasmuch as the applicant submitted that the examination had been carried out only five months after the alleged ill-treatment, the Court points out that the applicant himself had waited for more than two months before raising the complaint and it cannot find that it took the investigator an unreasonable period of time to order, and the expert to carry out, the medical examination in the present case. Having examined the applicant\u2019s submissions, the testimonies by the police officers and the conclusions of the medical examination, the investigator decided on 20\u00a0September 2002 not to institute criminal proceedings against the officers.",

The trial court questioned the applicant on several occasions about the circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment and the way he had sustained the injuries. It also questioned all police officers allegedly involved in the applicant\u2019s beatings and independent witnesses N. and A. who had been arrested and brought to the police station together with the applicant, A. being the person on whose questioning the applicant had insisted to confirm his allegations of beatings. The court also heard the attesting witnesses who had been present during the applicant\u2019s medical examination on 21 May 2002 and the crime scene inspection on 23 May 2002 and who could have furnished further information on the alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 24 above). All the persons heard denied having seen the applicant being ill-treated or hearing him complain about beatings.

To assess this evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, but added that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a025, and Labita v.  [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0121, ECHR 2000IV). Where an individual is taken into police custody or arrives otherwise under the control of the authorities in good health and is found to be injured while in detention or under their control, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0241A; Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087; and Bursuc v. Romania, no.\u00a042066/98, \u00a7 80, 12 October 2004). The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its tasks and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention, as in the present case, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. , 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a032, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0336, and Akta\u015f v.

He found that the bruises to the applicant\u2019s ear and chest had been sustained two to three days prior to his arrest (see, by contrast, Tomasi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110). It is noted that the conclusions of the expert, who had specific knowledge in forensic medicine, were made on the basis of the examination of the applicant, regard being had to his allegations and the relevant medical records. The applicant did not allege that the expert was not qualified, impartial or was otherwise incapable of performing the examination, and the Court finds no evidence to that effect. In the same vein, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s reference to the encyclopaedic dictionary cannot call into question the findings in the expert report and considers that the case file contains no materials which would call into question those findings or add probative weight to the applicant\u2019s allegations (see Garbul v. , no.\u00a064447/01, \u00a7\u00a036, 19\u00a0July 2007).",

Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submission, the statement by A. contained no reference to the alleged ill-treatment or to the absence of any injuries on the applicant prior to his arrest. Neither is the Court persuaded by the applicant\u2019s argument with reference to the police station registration log because that document was deemed to reflect, and reflected in the applicant\u2019s case, only basic information concerning the arrested person, such as name, date of birth, address and phone number. Finally, the Court doubts that the three bruises noted in the medical record would correspond with the severe ill-treatment lasting for hours alleged by the applicant (see Ahmet Mete v.

Secondly, it seems peculiar to the Court that, the above documents being destroyed, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, on whose information the Government relied, was able to ascertain that the applicant had been detained at the relevant time in the temporary isolation ward of the Losinoostrovskiy police station, the Government being unable to indicate the source of that information (compare Sudarkov v. Russia, no. 3130/03, \u00a7\u00a042, 10 July 2008).",

The CPT found, in particular, that there had been no provision for supplying detainees with food and drinking water, that the cells had no equipment except a bench and the persons held there overnight had not been provided with mattresses and bedding. The CPT stated that such cells were totally unacceptable for periods of custody exceeding three hours (see paragraphs 45 and 46 above). In the present case the applicant was held for almost three days in a cell unfit for overnight stay, without food or drink or the opportunity to rest. In these circumstances the Court considers that the applicant was subjected to inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. There has accordingly been a violation of that Article.",

Neither did they contain any reference to the source of information on the basis of which the head of the remand centre was able to indicate the number of inmates which had been held together with the applicant.
