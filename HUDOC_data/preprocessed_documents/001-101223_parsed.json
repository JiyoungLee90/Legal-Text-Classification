Even though in some cases the Court has, on an exceptional basis, accepted unilateral declarations submitted by the respondent Government containing such contradictory wording (see, for example, Urt\u0101ns v. Latvia (dec.), no. 25623/04, \u00a7 16, 7\u00a0April 2009, and Da\u0123is v. Latvia (dec.), no. 7843/02, \u00a7 41, 30 June 2009), it cannot do so in the present case for the following reasons. Firstly, the amount of compensation proposed by the respondent Government in the present case is substantially less than what the Court would award in similar cases. Secondly, as noted in the above paragraph, the Court cannot fully ascertain the scope of the unilateral declaration and, therefore, cannot evaluate whether or not the Government's admissions contained in that declaration are sufficient to find that respect for human rights does not require it to examine the case further. The Court has not ruled on the conditions of detention for convicted persons in Latvian prisons and, accordingly, such issues have not been previously determined. For that reason, the Court cannot ascertain the nature and scope of any measures taken by the Latvian Government in the context of execution of judgments concerning the conditions of detention. In so far as the Latvian Government's undertaking \u201cto adopt all necessary measures in order to avoid similar infringements in future\u201d is concerned (see paragraph 45 above), the Court therefore considers such an assurance to be of too general a character without specifying any concrete measures to be taken in order to avoid similar infringements in future.",

The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see Remli\u00a0v. France, 23 April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999V; and, more recently, Scoppola v.

Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national authorities, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies only requires that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances (see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Dalia v. , 19 February 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports 1998I).",

Secondly, no such beating could have occurred at the time and in the circumstances described by the applicant, since it was clear from his personal file that his last disciplinary punishment in Jelgava prison had been imposed on 18 July 2000 and that he had left that prison on 22\u00a0November 2000. In other words, he could not have been \u201cbeaten in a disciplinary cell at the end of 2000\u201d. The Government submitted documents to the effect that within a two-month interval, in October and November 2000, the applicant had filed thirteen complaints with the Prosecutor's Office; however, allegedly none of them ever mentioned such episode of ill-treatment as described by the applicant. The Government wondered \u201cwhy the applicant could submit so many complaints in a very short period of time about issues of a minor importance but did not complain... about the above-mentioned abuses to his health\u201d. Likewise, the last complaint concerning alleged shortcomings in the applicant's medical treatment in Jelgava had been submitted to the Prison Administration in July 1999, and he had never raised similar issues again.

When introducing his complaint to the Court, he first alleged that he had been severely beaten by prison guards in Jelgava prison (see paragraph 23 above). Replying to the Government's observations, he alleged that he had in fact been beaten in the Central Prison Hospital in  (see paragraph 69 above). In neither set of submissions did he specify the date of the alleged events. Secondly, the medical synopsis submitted by the applicant did not mention traces of ill-treatment on the applicant's body, contrary to his submissions (see paragraph 23 above). The Court is aware of the lack of detail in that medical record. Nevertheless, it notes that there is no material in the case file which could call into question the content of that record or add probative weight to the applicant's allegations (see Sevgin and \u0130nce v.

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation (see Assenov and Others v.

In the present case the Court has concluded that the disciplinary penalties imposed on the applicant in Jelgava prison did not reach the level of severity required for Article 3 to apply (see paragraphs 72-73 above) and that the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment at the end of 2000 were unsubstantiated (see paragraphs 76-78 above). In such circumstances it cannot be said that the Latvian authorities were under a positive obligation to conduct an effective investigation into the applicant's allegations (see, by contrast, Arat v. Turkey, no. 10309/03, \u00a7\u00a042, 10 November 2009, where such an obligation was incumbent on the Turkish authorities due to a reasonable suspicion that the applicant's injuries documented by evidence in that case might have been caused by an excessive use of force).

Taking into account the fact that the Law on the Prosecutor's Office granted prosecutors extensive powers to deal with complaints brought, inter alia, by detainees, and that it guaranteed prosecutors' independence and made their orders binding on State authorities (see paragraph 41 above), such complaints constituted an effective remedy to be exhausted within the meaning of Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. Therefore, the Government considered the domestic remedies under sections 6, 9, 15, 16, 17 and 20 of that Law to be effective and accessible and to offer reasonable prospects of success. The same applied to the applicant's assertion that he had been obliged to strip naked every day and that the medical treatment provided to him had been unsatisfactory.

They have subsequently reiterated and specified various problems, including the problem of high occupancy levels in cells and overcrowding (see paragraph 37 above). Even more, as it appears from the case materials and in so far as the applicant is concerned \u2013 the Latvian prosecution authorities were aware of his situation in Daugavpils prison and, in particular, the problem of overpopulation and non-compliance with the minimum standards at the material time (see paragraph 83 above). Yet, the Government did not provide any material that would show that the prosecution authorities had exercised their powers under the Law on the Prosecutor's Office, which according to the Government were quite extensive, in so far as the applicant was concerned despite their apparent knowledge of the situation.",

The remainder of the applicant's submissions in this regard stand alone with no other proof. There is no evidence that daily full body searches were performed on the applicant (compare the CPT's findings as regards life-sentenced prisoners quoted in Savi\u010ds v.

Nor is there any evidence of a lack of adequate medical care or of traces of injuries on the applicant's body sustained while he was being kept in those disciplinary cells. Furthermore, there is nothing in the case-file to suggest that the disciplinary penalties imposed on the applicant in  prison have been arbitrary. Therefore, the evidence before it does not enable the Court to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the conditions of the applicant's detention or his treatment in disciplinary cells nos. 22 and 14 were contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.",

However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2000-XI, and Peers v.

The CPT observed in the report on its 2002 visit that cells were frequently overcrowded in that prison (see, for a similar reference to the CPT's observations on frequent overcrowding, Alver v. Estonia, no.\u00a064812/01, \u00a7 52, 8 November 2005), and that shortly before its visit in September 2002 the occupancy levels in cells had even been significantly higher. The Court is aware of the observation contained in the CPT's report to the effect that the capacity of Daugavpils prison had been increased from 543 to 800 places; however, that observation contradicts the information submitted by the Government to the Court (see paragraph 83 above) and to the CPT itself (see paragraph 38 above), according to which the capacity of the prison was 500-543 places. The Court finds it sufficient to note that, according to the evidence before it, in June 2001 and thereafter, that is, at the time when the applicant was held in  prison, the prison had a capacity of 500-543 places and held 800 people. The Court therefore finds it established to the standard of proof required under Article\u00a03 of the Convention that  prison was severely overcrowded beyond its design capacity at the material time. Such overcrowding in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Karalevi\u010dius v. , no.\u00a053254/99, \u00a7\u00a7 36-38, 7\u00a0April 2005). The Court points out that it already considered, in a case concerning the conditions in a short-term detention facility in Liep\u0101ja, that overpopulation to such an extent that four to five detainees were placed in a cell measuring 6 sq. m, of which 3.5 sq. m were taken up by a sleeping platform, in itself raised an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Kadi\u0137is v. Latvia (no. 2), no. 62393/00, \u00a7 52, 4 May 2006).",

It is inconceivable that the applicant could have been afforded more than 2.5\u00a0sq. m of personal space in  prison in the context of severe overcrowding. The Court finds it difficult to believe that even that amount of personal space could have been afforded to a prisoner in a severely overcrowded prison. However, since the Court does not have any evidence to the contrary, it will proceed on the assumption that during the applicant's stay in  prison he was afforded not more than 2.5\u00a0sq. m of personal space.",

While it stems from the Government's submissions that prisoners had access to a library, a chapel, a gym and a common room, the internal report on which they relied in support of their submission did not fully corroborate it. According to the report (see paragraph 102 above), prisoners had access only to a chapel and a library, whereas the gym and common room were reserved for prison staff. The CPT's reports do not disclose any possibility for prisoners to visit a gym before 2004 and, accordingly, the Court is not convinced that in 2001 the applicant had such an out-of-cell activity available to him. The Court regrets to note that the only activity with a rehabilitative purpose organised for prisoners at that time appears to have been a Latvian language course, and even that was discontinued in 2002.",

The Court considers that the absence of an adequate supply of such items may raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104). Unlike in Vala\u0161inas, in the present case the Court has sufficient evidence before it to establish that the applicant was deprived of such items in practice (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the ventilation system did not ensure enough fresh air in the cells and in some cells the access to natural light was hampered by the metal plates that covered the windows (see, for similar reasoning, Kadi\u0137is, cited above, \u00a7 53; Aleksandr Makarov v. Russia, no.\u00a015217/07, \u00a7 96, 12\u00a0March 2009; and Shilbergs v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a020075/03, \u00a7\u00a097, 17\u00a0December 2009). In addition, the Court observes that the applicant appears to have been treated for tuberculosis in the Central Prison Hospital in R\u012bga shortly after being released from  prison and before being placed in Gr\u012bva prison to continue serving his sentence. While it is not possible to conclude with a sufficient level of certainty and in the absence of any relevant medical records that the applicant was infected with tuberculosis while in Daugavpils prison, the Court considers this to be a characteristic element of the conditions of detention in that prison (see, for a similarly weighted argument, Alver, cited above, \u00a7\u00a054 and, as regards the problem of tuberculosis, the CPT report of its 1999 visit to Latvia, paragraph 35 above).",
