The decision stated that according to the applicant, at 9.15 p.m. on 28 February 2008 he received a phone call from a former colleague at the police station, Ms P., who told him that another former colleague from the same police station, Officer K., had some problems. Ms P. asked the applicant to call Officer K. The applicant called Officer K. The latter said that he had problems and asked the applicant to join him in Officer K.\u2019s car, parked outside the applicant\u2019s house, to go to South Ossetia. Officer K. also asked the applicant to take his passport with him. The applicant went outside and joined Officer K. and another man in camouflage uniform in a silver grey Niva-Chevrolet car. The applicant sat in the back seat and they drove off. As they were driving, Officer K. told the applicant that when he started his duty shift he had signed an entry in the register confirming that he had been issued with a sub-machine gun, but this had not actually been the case, as the gun had not been found. Officer K. asked the applicant to go with him to South Ossetia until everything had \u201ccleared up\u201d. Then Officer K. and the other man began contending that it was the applicant who had taken the sub-machine gun, because on the day the sub-machine gun had gone missing he had been at the police station; this was recorded on CCTV. The applicant protested against these allegations, and the man in the camouflage uniform started beating him, while Officer K. pretended to try to separate them. Then they drove to the town centre, stopped at the police station, and the man in the camouflage uniform left. Soon Officer G., the deputy head of criminal investigations and the applicant\u2019s former colleague, came out of the police station. The applicant expressed indignation about the police officers\u2019 allegations and assault. Officer G. replied that he did not suspect the applicant, but asked him to help them if he could. The applicant said that he could not help them. Then Officer G. left and Officer S. came out of the police station and told the applicant that Mr A.L., the applicant\u2019s cousin, would soon arrive. Mr A.L. arrived shortly afterwards, accompanied by officers of the police special unit (SOBR) and asked the applicant to help Officer K. because he was a close friend. The applicant responded that there were no grounds to suspect him and that he did not wish to continue this conversation. Officer S. then said that they had a video recording, and the applicant asked to see it. They went together to the office of the head of criminal investigations on the second floor of the police station, where Officer Z. showed the applicant a recording of him entering and leaving the police station. The applicant explained that during his entire visit to the police station he had been accompanied by police officers. After they left that office Officer S., Mr A.L., and another man, X., whom the applicant did not know, took him to Officer S.\u2019s office, where Mr A.L. again urged him to confess to stealing the sub-machine gun. Then they took him to a different office, where Officers K., D., Kas. and X. handcuffed him to a chair, taped his mouth, put wires against his ears and passed electric current through them. The applicant fell off the chair several times but they put him back and sent the current through the wires to his ears again. He managed to get rid of the tape and spit out the blood that had collected in his mouth. Officer K. started yelling at him, saying that he would receive no pity as the \u201cminister\u201d had personally ordered that he should be \u201clocked up\u201d. The applicant then realised that he would not be able to endure the torture and offered to confess in writing that he had thrown the sub-machine gun into the river. However, they were unhappy with this suggestion. Then they took him to Officer K.\u2019s office, where he and Officers D. and X. remained until 11 or 11.30 a.m. on 29 February 2008, when they let him go.",

In particular, Officer Kas. stated that he knew the applicant, as he had worked at the police station until 2005. On 27 February 2008 they had realised that a sub-machine gun was missing. Officer\u00a0M. had seen it last when he was on duty; he was subsequently dismissed from the police for its loss. When they tried to establish what had happened, they watched the CCTV records since 25 February 2008, this being the likely date of the sub-machine gun\u2019s disappearance. The recording showed the applicant entering the police station; in the film of him leaving he seemed to be holding an unidentified object under his jacket. As the applicant often visited the police station and went into its offices, including the office from which the sub-machine gun might have gone missing, it was decided to invite the applicant, show the recording to him, and ask him to return the weapon. Officer K., a relative of the applicant, was instructed to invite him. On the date in question Officer Kas. saw Officer K. and the applicant in the police station. The applicant did not have any visible injuries, seemed to be in a good mood and asked him how he was doing. An hour later he saw the applicant leaving the police station. Neither he nor any other police officers applied physical force to the applicant. However, Officer Kas. still suspected the applicant of stealing the sub-machine gun and believed that his allegations were an attempt to undermine any possible prosecution for the theft of the weapon. Officer Kas. believed that the applicant had caused the injuries stated in forensic report no. 521 himself, in order to corroborate his submissions.",

Officer K. went there by car alone and, when the applicant joined him, explained the situation to him and asked him to return the sub-machine gun, as otherwise Officer K. and his colleagues would have a lot of problems. The applicant denied being involved in the theft of the weapon, and agreed to go to the police station. On arrival they met Officer G., who also suggested that the applicant return the sub-machine gun. The applicant reiterated that he had nothing to do with its loss. Then Officer K. took him to the office of the head of criminal investigations and left him there with Officer Z. In an hour or an hour and a half he saw the applicant leaving the police station; he was sitting on a bench nearby with Officer Kas. He had not seen the applicant since. From Officer Z. he knew that the latter had shown the applicant the video recording and had asked him to return the sub-machine gun, but nobody had used physical force against him. Officer K. had no idea how the applicant had sustained the injuries or why he had accused the police officers of causing them; he maintained that those allegations were false.",

Officer Mir. stated, in particular, that at 8.30 a.m. on 28 February 2008 he had started his 24-hour duty shift at the police station. Because of the time that had passed since then, he could not remember whether the applicant had been delivered to the station during his duty hours, but he was positive that nobody had used physical force on him. Officer Z. stated that after the official weapon had gone missing from the police station it had appeared possible that the applicant had been involved in its theft, as he had been recorded leaving the police station with his arm pressed against his body. When the applicant was asked why he had held his arm in such a way he responded that that was how he walked. However, it was clear to Officer Z. that he was lying. He was then asked to tell everything he knew about the weapon\u2019s disappearance, but he said he knew nothing and left the office.

Mr\u00a0E.L. stated that during the evening of 28\u00a0February 2008 Officer K. had called him and asked to meet him. They met at a supermarket, where Officer K. told him that the applicant was suspected of stealing a submachine gun from the police station, and asked him to talk to the applicant.

In the office he was left alone with the applicant. When Mr\u00a0E.L. asked the applicant about the sub-machine gun, the latter replied in a rude manner. Mr\u00a0E.L. then pushed him and said that that was no way to talk to a relative. The applicant hit Mr\u00a0E.L. back and this started a fight. Then Officers K. and Dz. appeared and separated them.

On 12 October 2011 he met Officer K., who reminded him of those events and said that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him and other police officers in this respect. As Mr E.L. thus became aware that police officers \u201cwere suffering\u201d because of injuries he had caused the applicant, he decided to go to the police station and confess. Mr E.L. added that he had not told his relatives about the events of 28 February 2008, so as not to upset them. The applicant contested Mr E.L.\u2019s submissions and insisted on his account of the events. He said that he had no idea why Mr E.L. had contended that he had caused him injuries.",

At the same time, in a number of cases the Court has held that the applicants were exempted from using this remedy where a refusal to open an investigation had already been quashed by a higher prosecutor. It found that a requirement to appeal yet again against a subsequent refusal would be over-formalistic, and would place an excessive burden on the applicant (see, among others, Samoylov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 64398/01, \u00a7 45, 2 October 2008, and Georgiy Bykov v.

Taking into account also that the investigators responsible for handling the applicant\u2019s case were given precise instructions as to which investigative actions had to be taken in the course of the additional inquiry, in the Court\u2019s view an appeal to a court could only lead to a repetitive result.",

Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 62, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, and Ayd\u0131n v.\u00a0Turkey, 25 September 1997, \u00a7 81, Reports 1997VI). The Court further notes, as it has held on many occasions, that the authorities have an obligation to protect the physical integrity of persons in detention. Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to have injuries at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4\u00a0December 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 336; see also, mutatis mutandis, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch, cited above, \u00a7 34, and Salman, cited above, \u00a7 100).",

It appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. The Court has previously had before it cases in which it has found that there has been treatment which could only be described as torture (see, among others, Aksoy, cited above, p.\u00a02279, \u00a7 64; Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 105, ECHR 1999V; Bat\u0131 and Others v.

The Court also reiterates that, in respect of persons deprived of their liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by their own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099).",

In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a very grave violation of Article 5 (see, among other authorities, \u00c7i\u00e7ek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, \u00a7 164, 27 February 2001, and Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, \u00a7 122, ECHR 2006XIII (extracts)).",

The Court reiterates that in order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting point must be the actual situation of the individual concerned and account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a particular case, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The distinction between deprivation of, and a restriction upon, liberty is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or the other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task, in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 92 and 93, and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2004-IX). Article 5 of the Convention may apply to deprivations of liberty of even a very short length (see Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2010 (extracts); X. v. Austria, no.\u00a08278/78, Commission decision of 3 December 1979; Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a065755/01, \u00a7 71, 22 May 2008; and Creang\u0103 v.

However, although criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with the disappearance of the sub-machine gun, they were discontinued on 24 August 2008, and not only was the applicant never charged with the offence, he never even had the status of a suspect in the case (see paragraphs 48-49 above). His detention at the police station purportedly for questioning thus did not comply with the domestic procedural laws. It was neither acknowledged, nor logged in any custody records. In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee, as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7 371, 18\u00a0June 2002). Having regard to its findings in paragraphs 85-89 above, the Court also notes the authorities\u2019 failure to conduct a thorough and prompt investigation of the applicant\u2019s complaints in order to bring to accountability those responsible.",
