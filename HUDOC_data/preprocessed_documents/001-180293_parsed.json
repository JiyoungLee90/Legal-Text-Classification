The CJEU further ruled that Article\u00a06(2)(c) of Directive 98/44 excluded an invention from patentability where the technical teaching which is the subject-matter of the patent application would require the prior destruction of the human embryo. The Advocate General Yves Bot recalled in his opinion delivered on 10 March 2011 on that matter that \u201cDirective 98/44 prohibits the patentability of the human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, including germ cells\u201d and asserted that \u201chuman dignity is a principle which must be applied not only to an existing human person, to a child who has been born, but also to the human body from the first stage in its development, i.e. from fertilisation\u201d (\u00a7 96).",

It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s physical and social identity (see Mikuli\u0107\u00a0v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a053176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I). The concept of private life also encompasses the right to \u201cpersonal development\u201d or the right to self-determination (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2002III), and the right to respect for the decisions both to have and not to have a child (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a06339/05, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 2007-I, and A, B and C v.
