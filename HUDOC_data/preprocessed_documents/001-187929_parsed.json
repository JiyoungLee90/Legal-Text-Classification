This had been a clear violation of domestic norms. For eighty-seven days the applicant had been held in cell no. 50, where the personal space available to him had varied between 1.86 and 4.65 sq. m, and it had come close to a violation of domestic norms. The court further held that the presence of toilets in the applicant\u2019s cell had not corresponded to the requirements of domestic law, that the lighting had been insufficient and the temperature had been too low, and that the food provided had had insufficient energy value. The court noted that inmates could buy food and other necessities in the shops of the facility. The applicant\u2019s other complaints were dismissed as unsubstantiated. As regards the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player, the court held that the use of personal blankets was not allowed in accordance with domestic norms. As for music players, inmates could use television sets, computers, computer-game devices, discs that could not be rewritten, other memory cards of up to 4GB and bedding (except for a pillow, a mattress and a blanket) that could be given to them by their spouses, partners or close relatives. As regards long-stay and short visits, the court held that remand prisoners did not have a right to long-stay visits but he had a right to short visits of up to two hours. The applicant asked for a long-stay visit but on 20 January 2014 the prosecutor decided not to allow him such a visit. The court also held that inmates could be allowed to go home for up to five days in the event of the death or serious illness of a spouse, partner or close relative, or in the event of a natural disaster that had caused serious pecuniary damage to the inmate, his or her spouse, partner or close relatives. However, in his request of 31 January 2014 the applicant did not indicate any of those circumstances. As a result, the applicant was awarded 1,200 Lithuanian litai (LTL \u2013 approximately 348\u00a0euros (EUR)) in compensation for inadequate material conditions of detention for 222 days during the period between 9 July 2013 and 3 April 2014.",

The court accepted the argument of the \u0160iauliai Remand Prison that remand detainees had been held in prisons or correctional facilities for short periods of time and they were not in a similar situation to convicted inmates.

However, illustrating this position in the context of long-stay visits, the Government cited two examples of domestic case-law where claimants had obtained damages in a situation similar to the applicant\u2019s (see paragraph 16 above). These examples belong to quite recent domestic case-law, as they are both from 2016, while the present application was introduced on 15 June 2015 (see paragraph 1 above) and the applicant\u2019s claims at the domestic level were examined even before that date (see paragraphs 7-8 and 10-11 above). Moreover, there are other examples from domestic case-law where the Supreme Administrative Court held that remand detainees had no right to long-stay visits and, as a result, no compensations were awarded (see paragraph 17 above). The latter cases were examined when the judgment of Varnas (cited above) was already final; however, the Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention that judgment. The Court thus considers that there was no established case-law of the domestic courts on the application of the principles established in the judgment of Varnas (cited above) at the material time. In view of the above, it can be concluded from the information provided by the Government and from the case-law proving the contrary to what was stated by the Government that the remedy in question was not an effective one.",
