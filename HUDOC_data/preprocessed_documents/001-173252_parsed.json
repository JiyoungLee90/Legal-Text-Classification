In particular, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of individuals within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the version of events given by the victim. In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that those in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (ibid., \u00a7 83).",

In so deciding it relied on the police officers\u2019 and the investigator\u2019s statements. The Court finds it problematic that decisive weight was given to the statements of those who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant. The Court notes that their account of the applicant\u2019s selfharm \u2013 namely that he banged his head repeatedly against the bars of a cell and then against the wall while shouting threats against the police officers \u2013 was not based on any medical opinion as regards either its probability or the number of traumatic impacts from which the injuries including the fracture of the nose might have originated. Nor was it based on an examination of the scene of the alleged incident. Furthermore, the crucial evidence \u2013 namely the video recording from the camera installed at the scene of the alleged incident \u2013 was never obtained and examined by the investigating authority and was lost. Finally, investigator N.\u2019s statements denying signs of injury on the applicant \u2013 even though N. had seen the applicant immediately after the forensic medical expert had reported the visible injuries on the applicant\u2019s face \u2212 were not subjected to any critical assessment on the part of the investigating authority. The deficiencies in the inquiry identified by the Komi Supreme Court (see paragraph 20 above) were never rectified and the refusal to open a criminal case based on that inquiry was upheld by the domestic courts and relied on as grounds for rejecting the applicant\u2019s request to exclude his \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d from evidence at his trial.",
