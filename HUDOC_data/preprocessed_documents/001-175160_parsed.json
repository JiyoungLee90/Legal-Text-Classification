The Court considers that it is not necessary to make an assessment of facts in that respect, because in many other relevant and crucial points the facts of the applicants\u2019 cases are similar to those of the Huseynli and Others case. As in that case, the applicants in the present cases were arrested and convicted following an accelerated procedure under the CAO. They were held in police custody without any contact with the outside world and presented with charges without receiving copies of the administrative offence reports. None of the applicants was given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing at the pre-trial stage. In the cases where the applicants did not refuse assistance of a Statefunded lawyer, Mr M.J., representation by that lawyer was purely formalistic. Neither the first-instance courts nor the Court of Appeal took note of the applicants\u2019 arguments about political motives of the arrests. The courts failed to clarify the facts that were disputed between the parties: they merely accepted the police\u2019s versions of the facts and the charges as presented in the relevant police reports. In view of the similarities between the present cases and Huseynli and Others, the Court sees no particular circumstances that could compel it to deviate from its findings in that judgment, and finds that the administrative proceedings in the present cases, considered as a whole, were not in conformity with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see Huseynli and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 110-135; see also Huseynov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58).",
