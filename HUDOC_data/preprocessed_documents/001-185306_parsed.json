It appears from the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 24 March 2005 (see paragraph 41 below) that the Kranj District Court had ordered that the appeal be drafted in Russian after ascertaining that there were no Lithuanian interpreters registered in Slovenia and that translation from that language would therefore have required the assistance of the nearest Lithuanian Embassy.

It observed that the applicant\u2019s situation was an exceptional one, in that he was not required to properly exhaust remedies in respect of the Kranj District Court\u2019s decision. In its view, the applicant, who was detained at the time, could not have been expected to challenge the impugned decision by means of a standard appeal as he had stated that he could not understand the language in which the decision had been written. The Constitutional Court went on to examine the complaint on the merits, finding in favour of the applicant. It noted that the law afforded special protection to a defendant\u2019s right to use his or her own language and script after detention. The person\u2019s own language would in principle be his or her mother tongue but, if the person had a command of another language, the use of the latter could suffice for oral communication in the proceedings. However, the Constitutional Court rejected the District Court\u2019s view that a defendant who was in custody and who had used a certain language in oral proceedings should also submit written submissions in that language, finding that written communication required a higher level of language proficiency. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had been assisted by a Russian interpreter in the first-instance proceedings, which had mainly involved oral communication. After an appeal, proceedings were typically in writing and the accused no longer benefited from the assistance of court-appointed counsel. The Constitutional Court therefore found that the applicant, who had explained in his submissions to the Supreme Court that he could not write in Russian, should be allowed to submit them in his own language. It therefore concluded that the court below had violated the applicant\u2019s right to use his own language in the proceedings, as explicitly provided for by section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act and as guaranteed by Article 62 of the Constitution. It annulled the Kranj District Court\u2019s decision of 29 April 2003 (see paragraph 38 above) and remitted the applicant\u2019s application for the protection of legality for fresh consideration.",

When questioned by the investigating judge, the applicant had also been assisted by the Russian interpreter and his court-appointed counsel. The Supreme Court found that there was no indication in the file that the applicant had been informed of his right to use his own language in the proceedings, either by the investigating judge or by the Kranj District Court. It also found no indication that the applicant had given any statement concerning that right. However, the lack of such notification, did not, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, undermine the legality of the final judgment, because the applicant had been assisted by a Russian interpreter and by counsel. The record of the hearing had contained no indication that he did not understand Russian. Moreover, the court noted that neither the applicant nor his counsel had raised any issue of a lack of understanding of Russian.

It referred to the Resolution of the Council of 30\u00a0November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings and Directive 2010/64/EU (see paragraphs 52 to 57 above). In particular, the third party argued that the failure to make a complaint at national level should by no means be regarded as determinative. In determining whether the domestic authorities had been \u201cput on notice\u201d such as to trigger their responsibility for any oversight, the Court should take into account any factual situation arising in the context of the national proceedings, which should be such as to alert the courts as to a possible issue with the adequacy of interpretation. It pointed out that when interpretation was provided in a language other than that of the accused, this should automatically put the authorities on notice and trigger their obligation to verify the adequacy of the interpretation. The authorities would then have to establish that the accused person had a sufficient command of the interpreting language. In this connection, it was necessary to have regard to the elements taken into account by the Court in assessing the impact of not providing interpreting for people who did not have a perfect command of the language of the proceedings, such as their linguistic knowledge, literacy and personal situation, and the complexity of the case. The national authorities were required to determine whether the accused person had a sufficient command of the third language by conducting similar checks.",

An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he understands (see Hermi v.

In particular, it considered that the Italian authorities, which had been informed in an unequivocal manner of the applicant\u2019s lack of knowledge of Italian, \u201cshould have taken steps to comply with [his request for translation] ... unless they were in a position to establish that the applicant in fact had sufficient knowledge of Italian to understand from the notification the purport of the letter notifying him of the charges brought against him\u201d. Noting that there was no evidence in the file to indicate that the applicant had had sufficient knowledge of Italian, the Court found a violation of Article 6. Similarly, in Cuscani v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a032771/96, \u00a7 38, 24\u00a0September 2002), the Court took the view that after the authorities had been put on notice of the applicant\u2019s inability to understand the proceedings, the verification of his need for interpretation had become a matter for the judge to determine. The Court held that the onus had been on the judge to ascertain whether the absence of an interpreter at the hearing would have prejudiced the applicant\u2019s full involvement in a trial in which he had pleaded guilty. Furthermore, in Amer v. Turkey (no. 25720/02, \u00a7 83, 13\u00a0January 2009), the Court found no indication in the file as to the presence of an interpreter during the police\u2019s questioning of the applicant, who claimed to have only limited knowledge of Turkish, which was the language of the proceedings. Noting that crucial evidence had been gathered during that questioning, and referring to the subsequent proceedings before the domestic court, the Court found that \u201cthe verification of the applicant\u2019s need for interpretation facilities at the time of his questioning by the police should have been a matter for the domestic courts to adequately examine with a view to reassuring themselves that the absence of an interpreter [when the applicant was] in police custody would not have prejudiced the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial\u201d.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, this duty is not confined to situations where the foreign defendant makes an explicit request for interpreting. In view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 76, and Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37), it arises whenever there are reasons to suspect that the defendant is not proficient enough in the language of the proceedings, for example if he or she is neither a national nor a resident of the country in which the proceedings are being conducted. A similar duty arises when a third language is envisaged to be used for the interpreting. In such circumstances, the defendant\u2019s proficiency in the third language should be ascertained before the decision is taken to use it for the purposes of interpreting.",

It would add in this connection that the fact that the defendant has a basic command of the language of the proceedings or, as may be the case, a third language into which interpreting is readily available, should not by itself bar that individual from benefiting from interpreting into a language he or she understands well enough to fully exercise his or her defence rights. This follows from the requirement that the defendant be informed of the accusation in a language \u201cwhich he understands\u201d and from the requirement that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him and to defend himself (see paragraph 79 above). Recital 22 of the Preamble to Directive 2010/64/EU more specifically provides that the interpretation and translation should be provided either in the native language of defendants or in any other language that they speak or understand in order to allow them fully to exercise their right of defence, and in order to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings (see paragraph 53 above).",

It is therefore not for the Court to set out in any detail the precise measures that should be taken by domestic authorities with a view to verifying the linguistic knowledge of a defendant who is not sufficiently proficient in the language of the proceedings. Depending on different factors, such as the nature of the offence and the communications addressed to the defendant by the domestic authorities (see Hermi, cited above, \u00a7 71), a number of open-ended questions might be sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s language needs.

Furthermore, it is our opinion that the majority\u2019s assessment of some crucial circumstances of this case, namely of the applicant\u2019s level of proficiency in the Russian language and his consequent ability to participate actively in the criminal proceedings against him, is not supported by the documents submitted by the parties.

During his questioning by the investigating judge and throughout the whole of the first-instance proceedings, in the course of which the applicant was represented at all times by counsel, he used Russian and never gave any indication that he could not understand it sufficiently. Even in his notice of appeal and in the appeal proceedings the applicant did not raise any complaint regarding his understanding of the Russian interpreting. Only at a very late stage, in applying to the Supreme Court and subsequently to the Constitutional Court and to this Court, did the applicant assert that he had a limited understanding of Russian which was insufficient for an effective defence, and that he could not read Russian script. Against this background, it had to be examined whether the interpreting provided to the applicant by the national courts had been adequate.",

In examining those applications, the Court held that the national authorities were under a positive obligation not only to appoint an interpreter, but also to verify the adequacy of the interpreting, if they were put on notice in the particular circumstances that the accused lacked knowledge of the language in question or that the language assistance was inadequate for any other reason (see, among many other authorities, Kamasinski v.

Where neither of them did so, this has been an important factor in the Court\u2019s dismissal of the applicant\u2019s complaint. In a number of cases in which, before the Court, applicants essentially complained about the need for interpretation or the quality thereof, the Court dismissed the complaints, relying, inter alia, on the fact that they had not raised the issue during the trial and/or had not objected to the content of the record (see, for example, Berisha and Haljiti v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 18670, 10\u00a0April 2007; Hacioglu v.\u00a0Romania, no.\u00a02573/03, 11 January 2011; and Husain v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no.\u00a018913/03, 24\u00a0February 2005). In Horvath v. Belgium ((dec.), no.\u00a06224/07, 24 January 2012), the Court\u2019s finding that the complaint was manifestly ill-founded relied on the fact that the court\u2019s record did not mention any request for translation. In U\u00e7ak v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 44234/98, 24\u00a0January 2002), the Court declared the complaint inadmissible, finding that the alleged inadequacies and misconduct of the interpreter, beyond her alleged lack of independence, had never been brought to the attention of the trial or appeal courts. Furthermore, in Katritsch v. France (no. 22575/08, 4\u00a0November 2010), the Court, in finding no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (e) of the Convention, had regard to the fact that the applicant had made no request for an interpreter in the appeal proceedings. It is true that in the absence of a specific request or complaint by a defendant or his or her counsel to the national authorities, other circumstances may put a domestic court on notice that the defendant needs interpretation or that the existing assistance is inadequate. However, those circumstances must be sufficiently apparent to the national court conducting the proceedings in order to trigger any positive obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (e) of the Convention.",

In Brozicek v. Italy (19\u00a0December 1989, Series A no. 167), the Court found that after the applicant, a Czech national living in Germany, had notified the authorities that he was unable to understand a judicial notice in Italian, the authorities should have taken steps to comply with the request for translation unless they could establish that he knew enough Italian. The Court went on to examine whether the evidence at its disposal showed that he understood that language. In Cuscani v. the United Kingdom (no. 32771/96, 24 September 2002), the Court found that the domestic court had been put on clear notice that the applicant had problems of comprehension. The applicant\u2019s counsel had informed the court of his client\u2019s difficulties with English and requested that an interpreter be appointed. In Amer v. Turkey (no. 25720/02, 13\u00a0January 2009), the applicant, an Arabic speaker, had not had an interpreter or a lawyer when interviewed by the police and had signed a document containing an incriminating statement. Although the applicant explained that he had not understood the statement he had signed, the domestic court relied upon it. The Court found that \u201csufficient indication\u201d had been given to the domestic courts by the applicant and his lawyers as to his inability to read Turkish texts.",

In the view of the majority, the positive obligations in respect of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (e) are not confined to situations where a foreign defendant gives an indication that the language assistance provided is not adequate or sufficient, but also arise whenever there are reasons to suspect that the defendant is not proficient enough in the language of the proceedings or of the interpreting provided to him (see paragraph 81 of the judgment). In the majority\u2019s view this means that if it is envisaged to use a third language for the interpreting, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s proficiency in [that] language should be ascertained before the decision is taken to use it for the purposes of interpreting\u201d (ibid.). Not only must the defendant be notified of the right to an interpreter, his language skills also need to be \u201cexpressly verif[ied]\u201d (see paragraph 93 of the judgment) and any procedure used or decision taken with regard to the verification of interpreting needs must be placed on record (see paragraph 85 of the judgment).",

Without entering into an analysis as to whether and to what extent the introduction of such criteria and positive obligations could possibly represent a laudable step in the development of the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, we believe that such a departure from the existing case-law may only be undertaken by the Grand Chamber of this Court, as provided by Article 30 of the Convention.",

While EU law may, in a certain context, be used as a source of inspiration in the case-law of the Court, its task is not to assess whether the respondent State complied with it in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v. Belgium, nos.\u00a03989/07 and 38353/07, 20 September 2011). This notwithstanding, one should bear in mind that at the material time Slovenia was not yet a member of the EU. Furthermore, all the EU standards relied upon by the majority were adopted well after the events in question took place.

The records of the domestic court proceedings, which the judgment rightly finds to be quite detailed (see paragraph 99 of the judgment), do not contain any indication of a complaint regarding the interpreting or of any request for a Lithuanian interpreter or for translation of any of the documents into Lithuanian. Neither the applicant, nor his counsel at that time, nor any other participant in the proceedings, ever objected to the content of those records. On the contrary, both the applicant and his counsel signed them to confirm their accuracy. It is true that the applicant alleged, after his appeal had been rejected, that he had tried in vain to complain to the authorities about the interpreting language, but his submissions to the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and our Court on this point seem so inconsistent that they cannot be regarded as plausible. This is also implicitly acknowledged by the majority, who in paragraphs 99-101 of the judgment analyse the reasons for the lack of a complaint or a request for the appointment of a different interpreter during the trial. Since the applicant actively participated in the proceedings and was represented by counsel (see below, paragraphs 12 and 13 of this separate opinion), we do not see any other sign or circumstance that could possibly have alerted the domestic authorities to the applicant\u2019s alleged inability to understand the interpreting language.",

In particular, the Supreme Court \u2013 the first domestic authority to deal with the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint \u2013 considered the applicant\u2019s allegations that he did not understand Russian to be unsubstantiated and in this regard referred to particular elements in the file. The Constitutional Court, in its turn, accepted these findings, adding that the applicant had communicated successfully with his counsel in Russian. These conclusions represent findings of fact regarding the crucial circumstance of the present case. As the Court has emphasised on numerous occasions, it is not a court of fourth instance ruling on questions of fact and does not examine the accuracy of the findings of the domestic authorities. It may challenge those findings only if they can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see, for example, Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2)\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a022251/08, ECHR 2015).",

They see the (presumed) lack of cooperation by the applicant during the police procedure and during questioning by the investigating judge as a sign of his difficulties in expressing himself and in following proceedings in Russian. In their view, the statements that the applicant made during the proceedings were few and rather basic and cannot be regarded as sufficient to show that he was able to conduct his defence effectively (see paragraphs\u00a094 and 95 of the judgment). Furthermore, they consider the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding regarding the applicant\u2019s successful communication with his lawyer to be a mere assumption not based on evidence (see paragraph 96). They go on to conclude that \u201calthough the applicant appeared to have been able to speak and understand some Russian\u201d his proficiency in that language was not \u201csufficient to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 97).",

The applicant\u2019s conduct did not give rise to any doubts as to the adequacy of the interpretation provided. At the main hearing the applicant was asked whether he understood the charges against him and his rights that had been read to him, and he replied in the affirmative (see paragraph\u00a025 of the judgment). When questioned by the investigating judge and at the trial, he gave statements and answered questions in Russian (see paragraphs 13 and 26 of the judgment). The record does not reveal that the applicant had any difficulties in participating actively in those hearings. What is more, he put questions to some witnesses and the fact that he commented on their statements (see paragraph 27) can be reasonably taken to mean that he understood the interpreting of their content. Together with the other defendants, the applicant (through the interpreter) requested that witness statements taken at the investigation stage be translated into Russian (see paragraph 21). At the trial he gave his closing statement in Russian (see paragraph 29).",
