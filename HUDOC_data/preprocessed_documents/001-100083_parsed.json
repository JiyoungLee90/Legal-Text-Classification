She submitted that there was a direct link between the respondent municipal company's failure to repair her flat contrary to the domestic judgment and the above maintenance expenses. She furnished an estimate of the repair costs made by a local electricity provider. The latter certified that it would repair the flat at the applicant's expense. The applicant further claimed 1,000,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

It further notes that the Government explicitly acknowledged the authorities' responsibility for the failure to execute the domestic judicial decision in time. Therefore, the Court finds that the Government that should pay the applicant the equivalent in euros of the unpaid judgment debt in the amount claimed by the applicant. Furthermore, it is a common ground between the parties the judgment in the part ordering the repair of the flat had not been executed by the respondent company either. Turning to the applicant's claim in this respect, the Court notes a causal link between the claim submitted and the violation found. Given that the applicant substantiated her claim of RUB\u00a07,000 with a detailed estimate by the domestic electricity provider and that the Government had not challenged the method of calculation used by the applicant, the Court also grants her claim in this part. In sum, the Court considers it appropriate to allow the applicant's claims in respect of pecuniary damage in full and awards her EUR 1,448, plus any tax that may be chargeable, under this head.",
