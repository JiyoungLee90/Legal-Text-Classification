They noted, in particular, that during his questioning on 2 November 2002 the first applicant had not mentioned hearing the APCs at the time of Mr Ilias Sagayev\u2019s apprehension. It was only a considerable time later that he and other applicants had begun to contend that they had heard the noise. As regards the abduction of Mr Yunadi Sagayev, the fourth applicant had stated during questioning in the domestic investigation that the abductors had worn camouflage uniform and trainers. Trainers were not part of military uniform and servicemen could not, therefore, have been wearing them. The fourth applicant\u2019s allegation that the abductors contacted their vehicles by radio and had told her that her son would be released had not been corroborated by the findings of the domestic investigation. Furthermore, in the course of questioning the first and fourth applicants and other witnesses had stated that the abductors had left on foot and had not mentioned any vehicles. Camouflage uniform and arms could have been accessible to members of illegal armed groups, many of whom spoke Russian. Accordingly, none of the applicants\u2019 arguments could be considered to corroborate their allegations that servicemen had been involved in the abduction.

Furthermore, the Government have failed to provide any explanation of their disappearance and the official investigation into their abduction, which has gone on for over six years, has produced no tangible results.",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, \u00a7 64, Reports 1997III).",
