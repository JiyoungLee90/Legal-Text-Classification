All of them claimed that they would not be able to identify the perpetrators, in particular because they had been wearing masks. They further submitted that they knew the applicants because they were from the same village and were relatives but that they had never stated, during the identification procedure, that the applicants were responsible for the killing of Mr M.S.T. The court also took testimony from the police officers who had conducted the identification procedure and who stood by the content of the verbatim reports drawn up in that connection. On 12\u00a0December 1997 one of the judges, acting as rapporteur, examined the video footage of the re-enactment of events and submitted his report to the court. The applicants contested the report. On numerous occasions the applicants\u2019 lawyer requested their release stating, in particular, that, apart from statements obtained under duress and torture, there was no evidence to convict the applicants. At a hearing on 27 March 1998 the prosecutor submitted his observations on the merits in which he requested the applicants\u2019 conviction under Article 168 of the Criminal Code.

It observes, in this connection, that the applicants were examined by a doctor at the end of their police custody and the medical reports indicated that the first applicant had a small bruise on his lower lip and the second applicant two small scratches on his lower right knee and pain in his back. However, the Court considers that such indications are insufficient to substantiate the severe illtreatment described by the applicants in very brief and general terms in the application form (see\u00a0Ahmet Mete v.  (no. 2), no. 30465/02, \u00a7 33, 12 December 2006, and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v. Turkey (dec.), no. 436140/98, 22 June 2006). The Court reiterates that any ill-treatment inflicted in the way alleged by the applicants, particularly those indicated by the first applicant in his letter, would have left marks which would have been observed by the doctor who examined them on 28\u00a0November 1995, that is, five and ten days respectively after the end of their time in police custody (see Tanr\u0131kulu and Others, cited above). The Court is aware of the lack of details in the reports. Nevertheless, it notes that the applicants do not contest the findings of the medical reports and that there is no material in the case file which could call into question the findings in this report or add probative weight to the applicants\u2019 allegations.",

Despite the fact that the applicants did not provide any further details in the subsequent hearings, they nevertheless consistently repeated, including before the Court of Cassation, that they had been subjected to torture. Although the applicants\u2019 medical examinations of 28\u00a0November 1995 revealed that they had sustained injuries to various parts of their bodies, and despite the seriousness of their allegations before the judicial authorities, no attempts were made, save for the examination of the video footage of the re-enactment of events on 12 December 1997 (see paragraph\u00a017 above), to investigate their allegations. The Court reiterates that a public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged, under Article\u00a0153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time, to investigate the facts by conducting the inquiries necessary to identify the perpetrators. In this connection, it observes that it was not until Mr\u00a0G\u00f6k applied to the Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Grand National Assembly on 20 June 2000 that an investigation was finally prompted by the Fatih public prosecutor\u2019s office into the allegations of ill-treatment of that applicant. However, by that time, the statutory timelimit for prosecution of the offence had expired. The Court concludes therefore that the applicants\u2019 allegations of ill-treatment were not effectively investigated by the domestic authorities as required by Article 3 of the Convention.",
