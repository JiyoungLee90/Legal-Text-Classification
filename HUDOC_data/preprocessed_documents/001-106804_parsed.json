In assessing the conduct of the authorities, the Court has had regard to the number of remittals of the cases for fresh examination (see paragraphs 6 and 10 above) and the numerous adjournments of the hearings, other than those caused by the applicant (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above). Besides, it notes the lengthy periods of the examination of the applicant\u2019s appeals in cassation (see paragraps 7 and 11 above). Even though the legislative measures referred to by the Government were introduced in February 2007, those appeals in cassation were examined later. In light of the above, the Court concludes that the protracted length of the first and the second sets of proceedings has not been justified by any plausible explanation on the part of the State.",
