They questioned various persons, and ordered numerous additional medical examinations of the corpse of the deceased. At a certain point medical experts noted that the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s body had numerous fractures. The experts opined that all those fractures had been inflicted after the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death, possibly during the exhumation of the body. The applicant\u2019s husband informed the authorities that when he had seen his dead son in the barn, the corpse of his son had been in a sitting position and the rope loop had not been tightened. The applicant argued that it had not been suicide but a violent murder. She advanced different theories, suspecting notably: police security guards who had allegedly taken the applicant\u2019s son from a local bar, following which he had been found dead; a local police officer who had engaged in a dispute with the applicant\u2019s son; a woman who had been employed by the applicant\u2019s son in his textile business and her husband; the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s brothers-in-law; a business partner of the applicant\u2019s son; and people from a local gambling club (the applicant\u2019s son had been engaged in transporting money from the club to another town).",

It is notable that during that long period of time the authorities supervising the quality of the pre-investigation inquiries regularly found that the inquiries had not been thorough and ordered the case to be remitted for further inquiries to be made (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). The repetition of such remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency in criminal proceedings (see, in that regard and mutatis mutandis, Zubkova v.
