The case originated in an application (no. 46372/99) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by twenty-five Greek nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the list appended hereto, on 6 October 1998.
In a judgment delivered on 10 April 2003 (“the principal judgment”) the Court held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. More specifically, it held that no reasonable balance had been struck between the public interest and the requirements of the protection of the applicants’ rights (see Papastavrou and Others v. Greece, no. 46372/99, § 38, ECHR 2003-IV).
Under Article 41 of the Convention, the applicants had sought just satisfaction of several million euros for damage sustained and costs and expenses.
Since the question of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicants to submit, within three months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 46, and point 2 of the operative provisions).
The applicants and the Government each filed observations.
