However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001). Moreover, the Court notes that the domestic courts continued to rely on the risk that the applicant would interfere with the proper course of the proceedings even after the decision of 21 February 2001 in which the Court of Appeal considered such suggestion as arbitrary and unsubstantiated (see paragraph\u00a09 above).",

Consequently, as long as the domestic authorities continue the practice of marking the detainees\u2019 letters with the ocenzurowano stamp, the Court has no alternative but to presume that those letters have been opened and their contents read (see Matwiejczuk v.\u00a0Poland, no. 37641/97, \u00a7 99, 2\u00a0December 2003 and PiskPiskowski v.
