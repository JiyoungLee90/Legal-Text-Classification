An average reader would also place the word \u201cdeportation\u201d (Deportation) in the context of the historical events under the national-socialist regime which forcefully deported segregated groups of people to ghettos and camps to subject them to forced labour or extermination. The statement in question suggested that L.P. exercised her political function in a particularly despicable way, that she was indifferent to officials\u2019 criminal abuse of authority in relation to asylum seekers and that her actions were motivated by racist, sadistic, xenophobic and national-socialist attitudes. The publication of the statement had triggered considerable reaction from the media and the public. The applicant had been criticised as tactless and disrespectful. In response thereto, on 9 January 2007, the applicant published in a daily newspaper a reply in which he stated that his comments had been directed solely towards L.P. and he apologised to her family members, who were not responsible for the late Minister\u2019s inhumane policies.",

It found that the voicing of opinions by refugee associations criticising politicians and their legislative projects represented an important corrective element and that the limits of acceptable criticism were particularly widely drawn in the context of the present case. However, in the court\u2019s opinion, the published statement overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism. The legislative background to the amendment of the laws governing foreigners and asylum seekers and the fact that criticism was allowed to be shocking, still could not justify positioning L.P. in a national-socialist and racist context and suggesting that she had tolerated the intentional physical ill-treatment of detainees pending expulsion or \u201cdeportations\u201d. Such accusations against the then only recently passed away L.P \u2013 together with the acclamation of her death and the call on \u201cdecent\u201d people not to mourn her passing \u2013 clearly went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism in a democratic society.

Referring to the reasoning of the first-instance court, it conceded that the word \u201cdeportation\u201d nowadays had acquired the additional meaning of \u201cexpulsion or removal\u201d and was not only used in the context of the national-socialist regime, but also in the context of the forced expulsion of foreigners. However, the context of the word in which it had been used (\u201ca desk war criminal just like many others there have been in the atrocious history of this country\u201d) acted as a reminder of the national-socialist history of the country. Therefore, even though the statements at issue were political value judgments (\u201cpolitische Wertungen\u201d), the applicant had not produced any proof of a factual basis for his allegations. The applicant had further argued that, following the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and of the domestic courts with regard to Article 10, the impugned statement was covered by freedom of expression. The Court of Appeal, however, found that even such case-law did not provide carte blanche for the applicant to make comparisons with the national-socialist regime without any factual basis.",

It stated that the admittedly broad limits of tolerable criticism in the political discourse did not cover excessive value judgments without any factual basis. Statements made in even heated political conflicts needed to respect a minimum of decency and moderation. In the present case the Supreme Court found that the evaluation by the courts had rightly led to the conclusion that the text in question justified the limitation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. The value judgment suggesting criminal behaviour on the part of L.P. had no factual basis. The courts had not misjudged the considerable public interest in the discussion concerning migration and asylum policy. However, the applicant\u2019s statements had not contributed to that public discussion, since they were directed at defaming and discrediting the late Minister. The court further noted that the sanction imposed was, in view of the disrespectful statements and their temporal proximity to L.P.\u2019s death, appropriate and even moderate.",

In doing so, the domestic courts had interpreted the wording of the impugned statement in its overall context. They had also taken into account that the limits of acceptable criticism were drawn more widely with regard to politicians and that it had been the applicant\u2019s intention to contribute to a general debate on a subject of public interest, namely the rights and the protection of asylum seekers and the development of the law in this field. They had also considered the recent events and developments in the Austrian asylum and aliens\u2019 law relied on by the applicant in support of his allegations and had carefully weighed up the applicant\u2019s arguments. Moreover, they had taken account of the wording used by the applicant and the fact that the statement had been made immediately after the minister\u2019s death. Against this background, they concluded that the impugned passages amounted to an unjustified personal attack on the late minister herself. Lastly, the sanction imposed on him had been moderate, as an amount of only EUR 1,200 had been set by way of fine suspended on probation.",

The contents of the applicant\u2019s statement did not, essentially, concern the person of the deceased minister but rather the policy for which she had to be held liable. This was made clear by the reference to bureaucracy contaminated by racism. This value judgment had a factual basis, namely the constantly deteriorating situation of foreigners and asylum seekers in Austria. In the applicant\u2019s view, the deceased minister had represented an extremist position within Austrian society, especially in the eyes of people who fought for human rights, as she had combined cruelty with bonhomie and charm, as was often the case with Austrians who committed war crimes during World War II. Austrian society had closely observed the criminal proceedings against the applicant and had clearly understood that he was merely showing commitment and concern for a good cause.

Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7\u00a042, Series A no. 103). The right to protection of reputation is a right which is protected by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life. An attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v.

He first of all expressed satisfaction about her death, suggesting that no decent human should feel grief about her passing away, and then continuing by comparing her to high-ranking Nazi officials who had committed atrocities and war crimes during the Second World War by calling her a desk war criminal (\u201cSchreibtischt\u00e4terin\u201d). It is true that in the statement published on 9 January 2007 in the newspaper \u201cDer Standard\u201d the applicant apologised to the family of L.P. for his statement, but even before this Court he insisted that the comparison of L.P. to Nazi war criminals had been correct and justified. The Court, however, considers that, even if regarded as value judgements, such serious and particularly offensive comparisons immediately after L.P.s death demand a particularly solid factual basis. In this respect the Court considers that the applicant did not make any distinction between the person of L.P. and the politics she stood for from his point of view.",

However, the Court observes that the Vienna Court of Appeal carefully examined this argument and came to the conclusion that the Constitutional Court had confirmed the compatibility of almost all these legal provisions with the rights enshrined in both the Convention and the Federal Constitution. The applicant further argued that a factual basis for L.P.\u2019s alleged motives was apparent in a TV interview she gave after the conviction of four police officers who had been found guilty of the torture of a person being detained pending expulsion. The Vienna Court of Appeal evaluated this argument and found that L.P.\u2019s unwillingness to apologise in the Republic\u2019s name did not go to show that L.P. had ordered or at least tolerated the torture. Further evidence submitted by the applicant was of a general kind regarding the political situation in Austria as a whole and therefore did not provide a sufficient factual basis for the personal accusations against L.P. Lastly, the applicant submitted copies of press interviews with the heads of other NGOs and newspaper articles in order to show that his opinion that the situation of asylum seekers in Austria was constantly deteriorating was shared by others. Having examined these documents, the Court cannot identify a factual basis for the motives of L.P. as alleged by the applicant within these same documents.",
