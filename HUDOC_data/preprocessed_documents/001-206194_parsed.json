The court noted that the applicable provisions did not allow for an exception from the rules when a contractor did not know that a criminal case had been brought against him before he had entered into a procurement contract. According to that court, when it became apparent that a person was being prosecuted for charges relating to a procurement offence, the procurement authorities were obliged to annul the contract and keep the guarantee. As regards the applicant\u2019s argument that he had been unaware of the criminal charges against him before his participation in the procurement process, the court held that the applicant had been questioned by the police in the presence of a lawyer in relation to those charges prior to the bidding process and that therefore he could have acted prudently and refrained from participating in the tender. In that connection, it reasoned that the applicant, who was in the business of participating in public tenders frequently, could have taken into account the possibility that a criminal case could be brought against him.",

The Constitutional Court noted that the preventive measure pursued the legitimate aim of preserving public order and in particular ensuring the security and integrity of the procurement process. Having regard to the temporary nature of the administrative measure, which was equal to the duration of the criminal proceedings in question, the majority took the view that it was not disproportionately restrictive. One of the dissenting judges took the view that the preventive measure, while being characterised as an administrative measure, did not grant any discretion to the administration in its application since it was laid out by the legislature and therefore excluded its judicial review and for that reason was incompatible with the rule that all acts of the administration would be amenable to judicial review. Secondly, in view of the reality that criminal proceedings took a long time, it could not be said that the measure was proportionate. The other dissenting judge expressed the view that the measure was a penalty, which was attached to the fact that criminal proceedings had been lodged. In consequence it was, in his view, incompatible with the presumption of innocence.",

The fact that it had not been possible to detect the said acts or behaviour before the signing of the contract had not bestowed an acquired right on the contractors for the contract to be upheld. In a concurring opinion, one member of the Constitutional Court agreed with the bench\u2019s conclusion on separate grounds. According to him, the retention of the guarantee had not been unconstitutional as long as there had been a judicial decision showing that the participant had engaged in prohibited acts or behaviour. Subsequent to a judicial decision, and only as a consequence of conviction, keeping of the guarantee would be a consequence of conviction which was compatible with the general principles of criminal law.",

The General Assembly also dismissed the relevant authority\u2019s argument that the economic operator should have been aware of the criminal proceedings against him since he had been asked for a statement in the course of the criminal investigation because, in the General Assembly\u2019s reasoning, not all criminal investigations led to a suspect\u2019s being indicted.",

The Court has acknowledged in its case-law the existence of two aspects to the protection afforded by the presumption of innocence: a procedural aspect relating to the conduct of the criminal trial, and a second aspect which aims to ensure respect for the applicant\u2019s established innocence in the context of subsequent proceedings where there is a link with the criminal proceedings which have ended with a result other than a conviction (see, generally, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 25424/09, \u00a7\u00a7 93-94, ECHR 2013). Under its first aspect, the principle of presumption of innocence prohibits public officials from making premature statements about the defendant\u2019s guilt and acts as a procedural guarantee to ensure the fairness of the criminal trial itself. However, it is not limited to a procedural safeguard in criminal matters: its scope is broader and requires that no representative of the State should say that a person is guilty of an offence before his guilt has been established by a court (Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011). In that connection, the Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 2 applies where a court decision, rendered in proceedings which were not directed against the person concerned in his or her capacity as an \u201caccused\u201d but nevertheless concerned and had a link with criminal proceedings simultaneously pending against him or her, may have implied a premature assessment of the person\u2019s guilt (see El Kaada v. Germany, no. 2130/10, \u00a7 37, 12 November 2015 with further references).",

Following the notification of the criminal proceedings to the procurement authorities, the applicant\u2019s contract was annulled on the grounds that he had been indicted before the criminal courts for procurement-related offences. In the proceedings before the Trabzon Commercial Court in which the applicant sought to challenge the annulment of his contract and the retention of his guarantee, that court upheld the actions of the administration solely on the grounds that the applicant had been indicted. The domestic court itself questioned the compatibility of the applicable domestic law with the Constitution and in particular the principle of presumption of innocence which the applicant enjoyed as a result of being prosecuted. That being so, it upheld the annulment of the applicant\u2019s contract while the criminal proceedings were pending and in the absence of a final conviction. The Court therefore can assess under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention whether the applicant, without having been proved guilty according to law of the charges in the criminal proceedings, was regarded as guilty by the Trabzon Commercial Court in its impugned decision, including the reasoning and language used therein. As a result, Article 6 \u00a7 2 is applicable in the context of the civil proceedings at issue. The application is therefore not incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention.",

As it previously explained in the latter case concerning Article 8, since the question of applicability is an issue of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione materiae, as a general rule the relevant analysis should be carried out at the admissibility stage, unless there is a particular reason to join this question to the merits (ibid., \u00a7 93). As no such particular reason appears to exist in the present case, the Court will first examine under admissibility whether the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d, and if so, it will next examine whether the dispute can be characterised as a civil law dispute between private parties in order to determine the extent of State\u2019s responsibility in this matter.",

Under the terms of the procurement contract the applicant was jointly and severally responsible for finishing the construction project within the budget of TRY 5,924,905,58. He also gave an assurance that the contract would be carried out by giving a guarantee of TRY 160,000 (see paragraph 13 above). When the procurement authorities were informed of the criminal prosecution against the applicant, they annulled the contract and kept the guarantee. However, the Court observes that when the applicant was awarded the procurement contract, neither the procurement authority nor the applicant himself was aware of the criminal prosecution against the latter (the Court will come back to whether the notification of the indictment complied with domestic law below). Furthermore, after the signing of the contract, the applicant and his partner began developing the construction site and billed the administration for the progress they had made. This contract until its annulment by the contracting authority was sufficiently enforceable under domestic law and therefore constituted an asset protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It is true that the domestic courts subsequently upheld the annulment of the applicant\u2019s contract and the forfeiture of his guarantee; however, this fact is not decisive from the point of view of determining whether at the time the applicant signed the contract and lodged the guarantee he could entertain a legitimate expectation that his presumed entitlement to the contract would not be capable of being called into question retrospectively (see, mutatis mutandis, \u010cakarevi\u0107 v.

Croatia, no.\u00a039544/05, \u00a7 250, 12 December 2013, and case-law cited therein), that is because domestic court decisions in accordance with the rules of private law cannot be seen as an unjustified State interference with the property rights of one of the parties (see, for example, Balakchiev and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 65187/10, \u00a7 90, 18 June 2013). However, this does not mean that the Article in question is inapplicable to that type of dispute (see Vuku\u0161i\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 69735/11, \u00a7 39, 31 May 2016). A conclusion that the dispute concerns civil law rights between private parties could only affect the scope of the Court\u2019s review but does not exclude the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. If court decisions in such disputes are arbitrary or otherwise manifestly unreasonable they would constitute a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (ibid., and see also Dzirnis v. Latvia, no. 25082/05, \u00a7 55, 26\u00a0January 2017).

Turkey ((dec.), no.\u00a031138/96, 14 September 1999). In that case, the litigation concerned a succession dispute to which the State Treasury was a party as one of the contending heirs. The Court concluded that the Treasury\u2019s standing in these proceedings had been equal to that of an individual heir.

In other words, the dispute did not arise out of the interpretation of the contract in accordance with the principles of private law but was a direct consequence following from the applicant\u2019s being prosecuted for a procurement-related offence. It therefore follows that Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 applies to the dispute and the scope of the Court\u2019s review is not therefore limited only to whether the domestic court\u2019s judgments can be considered as arbitrary or otherwise manifestly unreasonable.",

Under the same directive, contracting authorities are given the discretion to exclude economic operators who have been proven to be unreliable, for instance, because of violations of competition rules, or other grave professional misconduct. Moreover, a right to terminate the contract is available to member States if it turns out that a contractor had been convicted in a final judgment for the reasons listed in Article 57 \u00a7 1 of the Directive at the time of the award of the contract. The Directive, like the OECD recommendation, advises procurement authorities to pay attention to the principle of proportionality in their use of discretion.",

Similarly, the domestic courts reviewing the impugned measure were prevented from carrying out an assessment of proportionality as they interpreted the domestic law provisions to leave no room for the discretion of the courts, ruling out any possibility for the consideration of alternative arrangements. It therefore follows that no assessment of proportionality as required by the Convention was carried out in the domestic proceedings.

First, it notes that when the invitation to tender was announced on 19\u00a0September 2006, an indictment accusing the applicant had already been filed with the criminal court on 10 July 2006, which was accepted by that court on 24 July 2006. Under normal circumstances and in accordance with section 59 of Law no. 4734, the applicant should never have been allowed to tender. Domestic law, in particular the relevant Circular, required the prosecution to inform the public procurement authorities without delay of any person who had been prosecuted in respect of a procurement-related offence (see paragraph 31 above). In the present case, this notice by the criminal court reached the authorities six months after the indictment had been deposited with the criminal court. Six months can hardly be considered swift in the procurement context, where time is of the essence. Thus, the Court notes that the authorities acted negligently in communicating crucial information that affected the qualification of participants in the procurement process.",

It seems to the Court therefore that the notification of the indictment to the legal aid lawyer whose authority at that point had been limited to assisting the applicant during his police questioning was not in accordance with the law. The Court is not therefore convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant was notified of the criminal proceedings against him. Furthermore, the absence of any proof of the applicant\u2019s having been aware of the proceedings against him when he participated in the tender leads the Court to conclude that the applicant cannot be accused of acting in bad faith when he participated in that process. Lastly, for the same reasons set out in the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions (see paragraph 32 above), the Court cannot subscribe to the reasoning that the applicant should have refrained from participating in the tender by anticipating that a criminal case could be lodged against him following his questioning by the police.",

Such a state of affairs creates difficulties not least at the domestic level, where the primary responsibility of ensuring compliance and respect for the protected Convention rights lies. For the Court itself, and for the effectiveness of the Convention system as a whole, the scope of the Court\u2019s substantive jurisdiction is a matter of potentially far-reaching implications.

In that case, the Court held that the applicant was to be regarded as having at least a legitimate expectation of exercising the option to renew [the existing contract of land lease] and that this might be regarded, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as attached to the property rights granted to him by Dorchester under the lease (see\u00a0Stretch\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a044277/98, \u00a7 35, 24 June 2003). What is essential is that, in Stretch, the original lease contract entailed that the complainant had to erect at his own expense several buildings for light industrial use on the leased land and he was entitled to sub-let them for rent. The reference to \u201cproperty rights granted\u201d thus contemplated the investment already made by the lessee in the buildings he had erected by virtue of the original lease, the extension of which was at issue.

This raises the question: what were the \u201cproperty rights\u201d granted under that particular contract?

The formulation used in the present judgment appears to make such an assumption. There is, however, no clear support for this position in the existing case-law. As already indicated above (see paragraph 6), the case of Stretch must be distinguished on the facts. The same appears to apply to other case-law dealing with contractual situations. In Fedorenko\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (no.\u00a025921/02, \u00a7 25, 1 June 2006), the context of the case was that the applicant had contracted to sell his house to the State, and the dispute concerned a clause regarding the determination of the price, which thus had a direct impact on the value of the applicant\u2019s existing property in the context of its sale. In Association of General Practitioners\u00a0v. Denmark ((dec.), no.\u00a012947/87, 12 July 1989), the dispute concerned the level of fees that doctors could charge for treating their patients under an existing framework agreement, but their actual entitlement to remuneration obviously remained contingent on the treatment provided to each patient. Accordingly, at issue were the amounts due upon actual performance. The Commission did \u201cnot exclude\u201d that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 might be applicable but declared the application inadmissible on other grounds. In Asito\u00a0v. Moldova (no.\u00a040663/98, \u00a7 60, 8\u00a0November 2005), the complaint concerned the annulment of a contract in circumstances where the applicant had already made a financial contribution to the other party under the contract. In Ceni\u00a0v. Italy (no.\u00a025376/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-44, 4 February 2014), the Court expressly stated that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were engaged in the context of a preliminary contract for the purchase of an apartment on the grounds that she had already paid the price and obtained possession. Furthermore, in Topallaj\u00a0v. Albania (no.\u00a032913/03, \u00a7\u00a095, 21 April 2016), the Court held that no \u201cpossession\u201d existed on the basis of contracts that were conditional on the fulfilment of events which never came to fruition. The circumstances in that case were particular, and did not address the present question as to whether a contract could in general be considered to constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d for the obligor, even to the extent that it has not yet been performed by the latter.",
