Against the payment of EUR\u00a031,100 the applicant and his family members undertook not to bring criminal proceedings and not to lodge any claims or complaints against the driver. It is unclear if this agreement was in conformity with national law. In any case, it is undisputed that the applicant\u2019s son-in-law received the money in question and that the obligation was discharged on the basis of the clear stipulation in the treaty that the payment could be made to any of the cosignatories (\u00a7 13). The applicant\u2019s reply that it was not he personally who received the money (\u00a7 14) is thus irrelevant. The complaint seeking the termination of the agreement and the recovery of the amounts paid was withdrawn for reasons unknown (\u00a7 31).",
