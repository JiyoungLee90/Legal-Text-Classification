The psychiatrists had concluded that the children were afraid of the applicant; they had openly told them that he had been beating them.

The psychologist assured the boys that the content of their testimony would be known only to the judge. The boys described the details of how the applicant had sexually abused them in 2009.

The psychologists, however, emphasised that the boys\u2019 testimony could have been affected by the long period of time \u2013 two years \u2013 that had elapsed since the events in question. Moreover, both parents exerted both direct and indirect sway over the children: V.K.\u2019s direct and indirect influence was illustrated by Ro.K.\u2019s statements that his mother would go to prison if he stayed silent (see paragraph 17 above), and the applicant\u2019s indirect impact on the children was illustrated by the fact that they feared physical violence.

The applicant questioned the two witnesses, Z.S. and V.F., the cross-examination of whom the prosecutor had refused earlier (see paragraphs 14 and 24 above). Other witnesses \u2013 Ra.K.\u2019s and Ro.K.\u2019s teachers and their guardians at the children\u2019s home \u2013 testified in court that the two boys were serious and honest. Those witnesses stated that the boys had told them that the applicant had been physically violent, but that they had not mentioned having been abused sexually. The applicant did not confess to committing sexual abuse. However, the court found him guilty on the basis of the testimony that Ra.K. and Ro.K. had given to the pre-trial investigation judge on 22\u00a0August 2011 (see paragraph 17 above). The trial court also gave weight to the testimony that the boys had given to the child psychologist and the child psychiatrist (see paragraph 19 above). The trial court noted that, according to those experts, Ra.K. and Ro.K. were not prone to fantasising; the children were also able to understand and remember the facts on which the charges of sexual assault against the applicant were based. The court\u2019s verdict was also based on the testimony of Z.S. and V.F. In reply to the applicant\u2019s argument that V.K. had pressured her sons to testify against him, the trial court noted that Z.S. and V.F. had been the first people the boys had told about the abuse; they had only told their mother later. There was no evidence in the file that V.K. had influenced the boys\u2019 testimony. Lastly, the trial court noted that the applicant had acknowledged having been physically violent towards his sons, which was confirmed by the earlier judgment under which the applicant had been convicted of acts of violence (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).",

The Court of Appeal considered that it could always come back to the applicant\u2019s request for the cross-examination of the experts in court, should it consider that those expert reports needed clarifying. As for the applicant\u2019s request that certain documents be added (see paragraph\u00a042 above), the appellate court stated that those concerned only V.K.\u2019s personality, and were therefore unrelated to the applicant\u2019s crime.

It observed that notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s and the appellate court\u2019s efforts to summon V.K. for questioning, she could not be located. Even so, the applicant\u2019s guilt was proved by other pieces of evidence in the case, all which were consistent with each other. According to the psychologists, Ra.K. and Ro.K. did not have a tendency to fantasise, which would have precluded them from accurately depicting the facts. When questioned by the pre-trial investigation judge and by forensic experts, the boys were mature enough to understand what had happened to them, given that they were then seven and nine years old. Even though the applicant asserted that Ra.K. and Ro.K. had been influenced by their mother, V.K., the applicant\u2019s power over them was equally strong. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s accusation that V.K. had had a motive for inciting the boys to accuse their father of sexual violence and for influencing their testimony. For the appellate court, even though V.K. had accompanied the boys to their questioning, she had not taken part either in the boys\u2019 questioning by the pre-trial investigation judge or in their questioning by the forensic experts. Likewise, although the pre-trial investigation had been opened on the basis of a complaint by V.K. in July\u00a02011, the charges against the applicant had been brought only after the boys\u2019 questioning in August 2011, when credibility of V.K.\u2019s complaint had been verified. Even so, the trial court had not relied on V.K.\u2019s testimony in finding the applicant guilty. The Court of Appeal also found that the statements given by the witnesses Z.S. and V.F. about what the applicant\u2019s children had told them were basically identical and consistent with other evidence, such as psychiatrists\u2019 reports; therefore, there was no reason not to believe those statements. Even though the applicant had tried to challenge those two witnesses as not being impartial, asserting that they were members of V.K. family, the appellate court found no objective basis for believing that those two witnesses had had any motive for incriminating the applicant. Moreover, neither of the two witnesses was a \u201cclose relative\u201d of V.K. within the meaning of that term under Lithuanian criminal law (see paragraph 69 below). Lastly, it was the court\u2019s prerogative to decide what evidence to take into account. As for the applicant\u2019s request that his neighbours, his sons\u2019 teachers and his work colleagues be questioned in order to prove that in 2009 he had worked long hours and had therefore had no practical opportunity to sexually abuse his children, the Court of Appeal deemed that there was no reason to believe that the testimony given by those people would outweigh the entirety of the rest of the incriminating evidence in the case, which for that court was consistent.",

As a result, V.K. had never been examined in the courtroom. The applicant also pointed out the fact that V.K. had only come to the police three months after she had learned about the alleged abuse of their children; later, she had abandoned their children immediately after they had been questioned by the authorities. The applicant reiterated his contention that his conviction had mainly been based on the testimony of witnesses who were V.K.\u2019s relatives.

The appellate court noted at the outset that certain provisions of the Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure applied to the applicant\u2019s civil claim (see paragraphs 72 and 73 below). The appellate court acknowledged that there had been no legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s spectacles being taken away. However, the court also pointed out that there was no information in the file to the effect that the spectacles which had been taken away during the applicant\u2019s search had been prescribed by a doctor. The court noted that, pursuant to Article 45 of the Law on the Execution of Pre-trial Detention (see paragraph 74 below), people in detention were entitled to the same level of medical care as those outside prison, and that healthcare services operated in remand facilities. Accordingly, if the applicant had had problems with his vision, he could have asked the authorities to have his eyesight checked, an opportunity of which he had not availed himself. In this connection the appellate court dismissed as unproven the applicant\u2019s argument that, in order to be seen by an ophthalmologist, he would have had to be transferred from a remand facility in Kaunas to Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison in Vilnius, and that the investigator had refused to send him there for examination. Moreover, it was clear from the criminal case file that he had been able to write during the period in detention that he spent without his spectacles. The court noted that on 9, 12, 20 and 27\u00a0December 2011 the applicant had submitted various requests to the pre-trial investigator. He also had corresponded with other persons. Having small handwriting, the applicant had successfully managed to write between the lines of a small-squared page. The court also underlined that the applicant\u2019s claim that his eyesight had become worse had not been substantiated by medical documents. Lastly, the duration of the time when the applicant had been without spectacles could have been significantly shorter had he acted in a proactive manner and asked the authorities to return them in a timely fashion. The court considered that there was no proof in the file that the applicant had asked for the return of his spectacles earlier than on 20\u00a0March 2012. In sum, since the inconvenience caused to the applicant could have been easily resolved had he shown some initiative, and given that his need for spectacles had not been proved, the appellate court considered that an acknowledgement that the spectacles had been taken away constituted sufficient compensation for the damage suffered.",

However, this does not automatically make the authorities responsible for a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court reiterates in this respect that illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. Previously the Commission has held that a few days spent in detention without glasses does not amount to illtreatment (see A.K. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a024774/94, 6\u00a0April 1995), and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with that. Therefore, if the glasses had been returned to the applicant quickly, no issue under Article 3 would have arisen (see Slyusarev v. Russia, no.\u00a060333/00, \u00a7\u00a034, 20\u00a0April 2010).",

During the domestic court proceedings the applicant alleged that this had resulted in a deterioration of his eyesight. However, the appellate court dismissed that complaint as unfounded, it not having been proved by medical evidence (see paragraphs\u00a062 and 66 above). While the case file contains no evidence to refute that finding, the Court nevertheless observes that the Vilnius Regional Court made no efforts to properly ascertain that fact by, for example, ordering that the applicant be examined by an ophthalmologist so that it could be established whether the applicant\u2019s condition necessitated his wearing spectacles and, if so, what the degree of his visual impairment was (see paragraph 66 above; see also Slyusarev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). Neither is the Court persuaded by the appellate court\u2019s argument that the applicant \u201csuccessfully managed to write between the lines of a small-squared page\u201d, for it is not clear whether and how much time or effort the applicant had to put in to achieve such written results. Lastly, as held by the first-instance court, taking away the applicant\u2019s spectacles caused him inconvenience in his private life, which in itself was a traumatic experience and \u201cdegraded the applicant\u2019s human dignity\u201d (see paragraph 63 above; compare and contrast Komarova v. Ukraine, no.\u00a013371/06, \u00a7\u00a067, 16\u00a0May 2013). The Court sees no convincing reason to hold otherwise. In this context it reiterates that any interference with human dignity strikes at the very essence of the Convention. For that reason any conduct by law-enforcement officers vis\u00e0vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Bouyid v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 89 and 101, ECHR 2015). The Court is thus ready to accept that the applicant\u2019s situation, in particular because of its considerable duration, was serious enough to fall within the scope of Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

The Court recalls that, indeed, in certain contexts the behaviour of the alleged victim may be taken into account in defining whether the authorities can be held responsible for the treatment complained of. As a rule, Article 3 prohibits ill-treatment irrespective of the circumstances and the victim\u2019s conduct (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2000-IV). That being so, if a prisoner does not receive requisite medical assistance from the authorities, it may entail the State\u2019s responsibility only if he made reasonable steps to avail himself of such assistance (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a0105, ECHR\u00a02001VIII, and Knyazev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a025948/05, \u00a7 103, 8\u00a0November 2007).

The Court thus finds that at least as of the latter date the applicant\u2019s request warranted appropriate action on the part of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Aksoy v\u00a0 Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a056, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; see also Slyusarev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041). Afterwards, it took the prosecutor three weeks to write to the applicant, informing him that the pre-trial investigation officer would resolve the issue (see paragraph 60 above). Apparently, the authorities still took no action, as the applicant had to repeat his request. Eventually, the spectacles were returned to the applicant only on 20\u00a0April 2012 (see paragraph 61 above). In the light of the above, the Court does not consider that the applicant remained passive.",

The applicant in the instant case, however, already owned spectacles, and it would have been sufficient for the authorities to simply return them to the applicant. To oblige the applicant in the instant case to undergo a medical examination, which, in the applicant\u2019s words and the applicant had not been contested on this point by the Government, had not been possible in the remand facility in Kaunas where he was held, and then, possibly, also make him bear the costs of a new pair of spectacles, was therefore completely unnecessary.",

He had lodged such requests both during the pre-trial investigation and while he was being tried before courts at two instances. The pre-trial investigation judge and the courts at two instances had dismissed some of the applicant\u2019s requests, but they had done so for sound reasons, because those people (teachers, medics, neighbours, the applicant\u2019s work colleagues) had had no significance in respect of the charges against the applicant. In particular, the applicant had been suspected of having sexually abused his children for a considerably long time; in the absence of direct witnesses, those people had not been in a position to confirm that the applicant had never been alone with his children, and therefore had never been in a position to carry out the alleged actions. The Government nevertheless pointed out that some of the applicant\u2019s requests for certain witnesses to be summoned and examined had been granted by the prosecutor or the courts, a fact which indicated that the authorities had not acted arbitrarily (see paragraph 36 above). The applicant had not had an unlimited right to call any witness of his choosing. Moreover, he had also had to demonstrate that the evidence of the witnesses he had wished to be summoned for examination was necessary in order to establish the facts relevant to his case, which the applicant had failed to do (the Government contrasted the applicant\u2019s situation with that examined in the case of Perna v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a048898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V).",

That notwithstanding, they considered that the applicant had still had a fair trial. Firstly, although the court of first instance and the appellate court had taken all the available measures in order to summon V.K. and to have her delivered to the hearing to testify, it had not been possible to determine her place of residence. Secondly, according to the Government, there had been justifiable reasons for V.K. not to attend the court hearings, given that during the pre-trial investigation she had made it clear that she was afraid of the applicant (the Government relied on AlKhawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a026766/05 and\u00a022228/06, \u00a7\u00a0123, ECHR 2011). Thirdly, and contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertion, his conviction had been based on other evidence, such as the testimony of the victims Ra.K. and Ro.K., the testimony of other witnesses, and forensic psychiatry reports, but not on V.K.\u2019s initial statements to the pre-trial investigator between July 2011 and February 2012 (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 12 above). In this respect the Government also pointed out that, as noted by the Court of Appeal, V.K. had not been present when Ra.K. and Ro.K. had been examined by the pre-trial investigation judge, nor had she been present during the children\u2019s questioning by the forensic experts. Accordingly, she could not have influenced the children\u2019s testimony, on which the applicant\u2019s conviction had rested. In fact, the domestic courts expressly ruled out the possibility that V.K. had exerted an influence on the children\u2019s testimony (see paragraphs 37 and 51 above).",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a09154/10, \u00a7\u00a0101, 15\u00a0December 2015 and Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no.\u00a0926/05, \u00a7\u00a084, 16\u00a0November 2010, with further references therein). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0101 and G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR\u00a02010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0118). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0162, and the references therein).",

Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a055287/10, \u00a7\u00a059, 31\u00a0March 2016).",

In the assessment of the question of whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Aigner v. Austria, no.\u00a028328/03, \u00a7\u00a037, 10\u00a0May 2012, with further references).

Both boys were interviewed by a psychologist at the police station, as directed by the prosecutor (see paragraph 17 above). Afterwards, when a judge ordered the boys\u2019 psychological forensic examination, they were also examined by a psychologist and a psychiatrist (see paragraph 19 above). Pursuant to their expert opinions it was not considered psychologically safe for the boys to take part in further pre-trial investigative actions or to be cross-examined at the trial (see paragraph 19 above). The prosecutor later refused the applicant\u2019s request for a confrontation to be held between him and the children, deeming that such a confrontation would be a traumatic experience for them (see paragraph 27 above). In this context the Court also recalls that in 2011 the applicant had already been convicted of an attempt to influence Ra.K. and Ro.K. and for having been physically abusive towards them (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). Considering the need to take specific measures for the purpose of protecting victims in criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences, particularly in cases involving minors (see S.N. v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047), the Court is ready to accept that in the present case there was good cause for not permitting the applicant to cross-examine Ra.K. and Ro.K., while still allowing their pre-trial statements to be admitted in evidence (see Aigner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, and Vronchenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058).",

Examining further, the Court thus has regard to the following. During the preliminary investigation Ra.K and Ro.K. were interviewed on two occasions: on 22\u00a0August 2011 and in the autumn of 2011 (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). As to the first examination, the Court notes that it was the boys\u2019 mother who had been obliged by the authorities to bring them for examination, and who accompanied them to that examination (see paragraphs 10, 16 and 17 above). It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that during the impugned examination of 22 August 2011 one of the boys, Ro.K., who at that time was seven years old, not only used such legal terms as \u201cperjury\u201d, but also openly stated that if he were to be silent, his mother would go to prison (see paragraph 17 above). Accordingly, and while being careful not to hold that V.K. instructed the boys what to say, the Court does not find preposterous the applicant\u2019s argument that V.K.\u2019s testimony had been pertinent in those criminal proceedings and that therefore V.K. should have been brought to the court for cross-examination. In fact, this initially was the view not only of the trial court, which had granted the applicant\u2019s request for V.K. to be summoned, but also that of the prosecutor and of the Court of Appeal, which also considered that fresh examination of evidence, with the participation of V.K., was indispensable (see paragraphs 34 and 43 above).",

Given the applicant\u2019s prior conviction for attempting to influence V.K. as a witness (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above), and V.K.\u2019s statements to the pre-trial investigator (see paragraph 21 above), the Court does not rule out this argument as implausible. Be that as it may, it observes that these arguments were not employed by the Court of Appeal when it decided to continue the examination of the case without V.K.\u2019s attendance (contrast Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0124). In fact, it transpires that the Court of Appeal simply satisfied itself with the mere fact that V.K. could not be located (see paragraph 49 above). In a situation like this, the Court reiterates its case-law to the effect that the fact that the domestic courts are unable to locate a witness is not sufficient in itself to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0117 and 119-121, with further references). In the present case, the Court also observes that although V.K. was in hiding, she continued to receive maternity benefits, thus maintaining a certain link with the State authorities (see paragraph 46 above). The Court therefore considers that the State authorities could have been more resourceful in their attempts to find her (see, mutatis mutandis, Seton, cited above, \u00a7 61\u00a0in fine).",

The Court observes, however, that the Court of Appeal essentially dismissed all the applicant\u2019s requests, such as: for the summons of the experts who had questioned the children, for the obtaining of materials from the applicant\u2019s earlier criminal file concerning the applicant\u2019s behaviour during the year 2009, when the applicant had allegedly sexually abused his children, for the addition to the case file of the documents from the child welfare authority, and for the Court of Appeal to examine the court documents establishing that V.K. had acted \u201cdishonestly\u201d (see paragraphs 41, 44 and 45 in fine above). On this last point the Court also is not ready to unreservedly accept the Court of Appeal\u2019s view that V.K.\u2019s character was manifestly irrelevant to the applicant\u2019s criminal case (see paragraph 44 above). The Court further notes that no corroborative evidence supporting Ra.K.\u2019s and Ro.K.\u2019s statements was adduced during the pre-trial investigation (compare Al-Khawaja and\u00a0Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0165, and Rosin v. Estonia, no.\u00a026540/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061 and 62, 19\u00a0December 2013). As regards the experts, the Court notes that, unlike in the case of D.T. v. the Netherlands, in the present case the experts who examined the children merely gave their opinions in writing without their being questioned at the court hearing (compare and contrast D.T. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a025307/10, \u00a7 51, 2\u00a0April 2013). Weighing, on the one hand, the applicant\u2019s defence rights \u2013 regard being had to the substantial prison sentence he faced \u2013 and, on the other hand, the zero impact there would have been on the children if the applicant\u2019s requests mentioned above had been granted, the Court considers that the investigating authorities and the courts should have paid due attention to the applicant\u2019s defence rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Rosin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062), and all the more so in the absence of direct witnesses as to the crime the applicant was charged with.",

Those other witnesses examined at the hearings only testified in respect of what the two boys had told them, or made more general statements about their behaviour (see paragraph 14 above; see also Vronchenko, \u00a7\u00a059, cited above). Indeed, even though Z.S. and V.F. testified to having learned from the two boys that the applicant had abused them sexually two years previously, the other witnesses, such as the boys\u2019 school teacher and social workers, testified that there had been nothing strange or sex-related in the behaviour of the children (see paragraphs 15 and 36 above).",

As such the boys\u2019 evidence was not hearsay \u2013 what was hearsay was the evidence of Z.S. and V.F., and these two were examined during the actual trial and crossexamined. Other witnesses gave evidence as to the boys\u2019 character and whether or not they had a tendency to fantasise. There was also the circumstantial evidence of the child pornographic material found in the possession of the applicant, and the fact that the children had told Z.S. and V.F. that the abuse they had suffered had been carried out as depicted in those videos. Whenever the domestic courts \u2013 leaving aside the prosecutor, because his decision could in many cases be overturned at some stage by the courts \u2013 rejected a request by the applicant, relevant and sufficient reasons were adduced in the decision, the most common ground for refusal of the applicant\u2019s requests being that the evidence he proposed to adduce lacked relevance. As regards V.K. \u2013 who, in any case, was never a witness to the sexual abuse, as she had become aware of it for the first time through Z.S. and V.F. \u2013 no evidence was heard from her at the appeal stage because it was impossible to find her.",
