France, 23 April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II; and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999V). Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7\u00a048, Series A no. 24, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports 1996IV). Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made \u2013 at least in substance \u2013 to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Cardot v. France, 19\u00a0March 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no.\u00a0200, and Selmouni, cited above).",

It can be seen from the documents before the Court that he was employed as an accountant, then as head accountant from 17\u00a0April\u00a01985, in the Kuwaiti embassy. The Court is of the opinion that the performance of such duties cannot, in itself, justify an exclusion based on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest, within the meaning of the above-cited Vilho Eskelinen judgment.",

In this connection the Court points out that Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies to disputes (contestations) concerning civil \u201crights\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, whether or not they are also protected by the Convention (see, in particular, Editions P\u00e9riscope v. France, 26\u00a0March\u00a01992, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 234B, and Zander v. Sweden, 25\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 279B). The dispute may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, \u00a7 40). The Court has thus previously found Article 6 applicable in respect of a civil servant in the employ of a secondary school who had been appointed as accountant and did not participate in the exercise of powers conferred by public law (see Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, \u00a7 30, ECHR\u00a02006...). The Court reached the same conclusion as regards a former employee of a foreign embassy who was seeking compensation for unfair dismissal (see Cudak, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

He also indicated that the French Court of Cassation did not regard as absolute the international-law principle of jurisdictional immunity of foreign States.

In its case-law, the Court of Cassation refuses to apply jurisdictional immunity in an absolute manner, taking the view that it is not applicable in the context of a dispute concerning an embassy employee who has no particular responsibility in the exercise of the public diplomatic service (see paragraph 25 above). That was the position it took, in particular, in a similar case, not concerning the restructuring of an embassy as in the present case, but the reorganisation by a State of its diplomatic mission. It found in that case that whilst the State enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction as to the assessment of the reasons for a decision to close a mission, the French courts retained the power to verify the reality of the closure and to rule on the consequences of any resulting redundancies (ibid.).",

Similarly, a certificate of employment dated 19\u00a0January\u00a02000 only indicates his post as head of the accounts department (see paragraph 9 above). Only a statement signed on 3 December 1999 by some twenty employees indicates that the applicant had also assumed another role, that of staff representative on an unofficial basis (see paragraph\u00a08 above). Neither the domestic courts nor the Government, which indicated for their part that they had no choice other than to refer to the findings of the Court of Appeal, as they had not been a party to the proceedings, have shown how these duties could objectively have been linked to the sovereign interests of the State of Kuwait.",
