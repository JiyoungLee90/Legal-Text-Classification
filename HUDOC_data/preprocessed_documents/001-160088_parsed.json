Before the last elections he disbanded the village election committee, selected people loyal to him as new members and submitted the list for approval to the district authorities five days after the legal deadline had passed. This election committee took an extra day for \u2018the counting\u2019 of the votes cast for M.L. and his chosen deputies. Subsequently he acted outrageously towards L.V. [full name given], a category one disabled citizen. Following a decision by the village council, his plot of land was taken away from him and ownership transferred to the carpenter who had constructed M.L.\u2019s summer kitchen. The Kosivskyy District Council (headed by M.Kh. [full name given]) knows about these shocking examples of corruption; however, it has never found the time to redress them. Meanwhile, it wasted no time in agreeing on the restitution to M.L. of a house which had been confiscated from his father-in-law (who had once committed aggravated embezzlement of State property) and of which ownership had since been transferred to the Yablunivka village hospital. It is such a shame that some of the officials in the Kosivskyy District are not true servants of the people, but leeches and traitors of their countrymen, consciously undermining the authority of the young State in the eyes of the population. As in the olden days with respect to the feudal lords, today there is no redress against them; that is why they act so daringly and with impunity. It is because of such fortuitous and corrupt \u2018rulers\u2019 that the independent  cannot rise on its feet.\u201d",

The applicant maintained, in particular, that the final three sentences challenged by the mayor had been his value judgments concerning unnamed public officials and could not have been deemed defamatory to the mayor. He further maintained that he could not afford to pay the damages. Moreover, whether M.L. had actually suffered any damage had never been established. In particular, the District Administration had received four hundred and fifty out of five hundred copies of the book, which had been in its possession since the day the action had been lodged. The District Administration had later distributed some of those books to the public, in breach of the court order of 5 October 2000 requiring it to return them to the publishing house for reprinting. Nevertheless, the disputed statements had not reached the public, as employees of the District Administration had cut out the controversial pages, in breach of the authors\u2019 copyright. What had become of the other fifty copies of the book had never been established. Even if members of the public had obtained access to the disputed statements, this could not have affected the mayor\u2019s reputation in any significant way, since the applicant had only recapitulated and reported information that had already been common public knowledge. In support of this allegation, the applicant submitted copies of numerous newspaper articles criticising the mayor and statements by individuals claiming that they had been offended by him in various ways. The applicant maintained that these documents served as sufficient evidence that his statements had been true, and that he could not understand how to draft a retraction of the true statements.",

This obligation is an essential procedural safeguard under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, as it demonstrates to the parties that their arguments have been heard, affords them the possibility of objecting to or appealing against the decision, and also serves to justify the reasons for a judicial decision to the public (see, e.g., Suominen v. Finland, no.\u00a037801/97, \u00a7\u00a7 3637, 1 July 2003; and Boldea v. Romania, no.\u00a019997/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a032-33, 15 February 2007). The principle of fairness enshrined in Article\u00a06 of the Convention would be disturbed where domestic courts ignore a specific, pertinent and important point made by an applicant (see, e.g., Pronina v. Ukraine, no.\u00a063566/00, \u00a7\u00a025, 18\u00a0July\u00a02006, and Mala v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a04436/07, \u00a7\u00a048, 3\u00a0July\u00a02014).

The Court finds that this message was as such inherently damaging to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and accepts that once the book, in which it was published, entered public domain, it was a daunting task to establish the circle of its actual and potential readership or to quantify the real impact this message would have on them over the period of its circulation. In this connection, the Court can also not accept the applicant\u2019s assertion that the readers would have necessarily been aware of the factual background of the views he had sought to convey. Overall, there is nothing in the case file to warrant a finding that a more detailed analysis of the actual scope of dissemination of the disputed passage or its actual impact on the diminishment of the plaintiff\u2019s prestige could have materially affected the general conclusions reached by the domestic courts as to whether or not the defamation offence had taken place.",

In the Court\u2019s view, an assessment of the District Administration\u2019s role could have been of importance in the applicant\u2019s defamation proceedings, had there been a question of excluding his own responsibility in view of this role. However, the applicant being the author of the disputed text published with his consent in a book intended for distribution to the public, the Court finds no arbitrariness in the fact that his responsibility in its dissemination was found to be engaged regardless of how many books he had personally distributed to the end readers. Based on the materials at hand, the Court cannot speculate either as to whether the role of the District Administration was accounted for in the determination of the amount of damages levied against the applicant, particularly, as the applicant himself failed to provide a clear and consistent information concerning his own role in the actual distribution of the book (see paragraphs 16 and 18 and 62 above).",

The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts, but rather to review whether the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and whether in this context, they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no.\u00a029183/95, \u00a7\u00a045, ECHR 1999-I; News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no.\u00a031457/96, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR\u00a02000-I; and Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia, a. s. v.

The Court must also ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between, on the one hand, the protection of freedom of expression as enshrined in Article\u00a010, and, on the other, the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegations have been made, a right which, as an aspect of private life, is protected by Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Chauvy and Others\u00a0v.

In addition, the fairness of the proceedings, the procedural guarantees afforded and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference (see Kwiecie\u0144 v.

The Court agrees that the subject of the applicant\u2019s communication as such related to a legitimate matter of public concern.

The Court notes that these accusations, phrased as direct allegations of potentially criminal misconduct, were quite serious. It further reiterates that where allegations are made about the conduct of a third party, it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between assertions of fact and value judgments (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099). Nevertheless, even a value judgment may be excessive if it has no factual basis to support it (ibid). Accordingly, the Court finds no issue with the fact that the domestic courts required the applicant to substantiate the factual allegations underlying the views he expressed which, in the absence of sufficient proof, could be regarded as defamatory. It is also notable that the applicant himself treated the above factual allegations as \u201ctrue\u201d in his submissions to the domestic judicial authorities and to the Court and presented various documents which, in his view, showed that his statements were accurate. While some sentences of the disputed text (namely the first sentence, where M.L.\u2019s conduct was compared to that of a \u201cfeudal prince\u201d and the final sentences, where the applicant expressed a general opinion about corrupt officials) clearly constituted value judgments, the Court finds that they were so deeply intertwined with the overall factual message that the very fact that the domestic courts had not addressed them separately in their judgments does not of itself raise an issue in the present case.",

From the material before it, the Court does not consider that the domestic courts took an arbitrary decision or overstepped their margin of appreciation in finding that the applicant had insufficiently substantiated his factual conclusions, and that his statements concerning M.L.\u2019s misconduct had accordingly been defamatory.",

It further recalls that it is not evident that the applicant did or is likely to suffer any adverse consequences for not having paid for the publication of the retraction to date. While he complained that the District Administration had failed to return the books to the publishing house and that M.L. had published, at his own expense, a humiliating \u201cpseudo-retraction\u201d, the Court does not see any direct causal connection between these events and the wording of the disputed court order. In view of the above, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the court order to pay for publishing of a retraction is not substantiated.",

It is also noteworthy that he in fact paid his judgment debt in monthly instalments amounting to 20% of his retirement pension over an extended period of time. In the absence of any more detailed information as to how this payment affected the applicant\u2019s everyday life, the Court cannot conclude that he suffered an excessive and disproportionate financial burden.",

Moreover, none of the judgments given by the domestic courts in the applicant\u2019s case included express language indicating that they had acknowledged the existence of the conflicting rights to reputation and freedom of expression in the case at issue, which required striking a fair balance between them (see, e.g., Aksu v. Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a04149/04; and 41029/05, \u00a7 66, ECHR 2012). In this connection, the Court would reiterate the importance of an obligation to provide reasons for decisions concerning a restriction of the right to freedom of expression, which offers an important procedural safeguard against arbitrary interferences with this right (see, mutatis mutandis, Boldea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061; Nur Radyo ve Televizyon Yay\u0131nc\u0131l\u0131\u011f\u0131 A.\u015e. v.

Slovakia (no. 2), no.\u00a021666/09, \u00a7\u00a053, 7\u00a0January\u00a02014). However, in the particular circumstances of the present case, having established that the substantive conclusions reached by the domestic courts concerning the defamatory nature of the statements submitted by the applicant for publication had not been arbitrary and the penalties imposed on him had not been excessive, the Court finds that the absence of a more detailed reasoning for the above conclusions alone cannot justify a finding that the interference was \u201cnot necessary\u201d.",
