In the majority of the Council of Europe\u2019s member States, the law itself does not define the nature of the legal relationship between a religious community and its clergy. The religious community may conclude an employment contract with its ministers, but is not under any obligation to do so, and in most cases does not. However, even where there is no employment contract, members of the clergy are often entitled to welfare benefits under the same conditions as other beneficiaries of the social-security system. In a minority of States, the relationship is governed by the applicable labour law, although members of the clergy are required to observe a heightened duty of loyalty towards the religious community that employs them. Lastly, in other States the domestic courts determine on the basis of the individual circumstances whether or not the employment relationship can be classified as contractual.",

Thus, the State made a total of 12,765 assistance payments to the Orthodox Church, the amounts of which varied between 163 and 364 euros, while the Church paid 1,005 priests and 1,408 lay employees entirely from its own funds. As regards the affiliation of priests and other Church employees to the State social-insurance scheme, the Government submitted that this was the choice of the national Parliament, which enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in such matters; however, their affiliation did not affect their status and did not make them State officials.",

Under the bishop\u2019s leadership and supervision, they carry out the tasks assigned to them; besides performing liturgical rites and maintaining contact with parishioners, these tasks include teaching and the management of parish assets; members of the clergy are also responsible for the sale of liturgical items (see paragraph 44 above).

The Romanian Orthodox Church pays employer\u2019s contributions on the wages paid to its clergy, and priests pay income tax, contribute to the national social security scheme and are entitled to all the welfare benefits available to ordinary employees, such as health insurance, a pension on reaching the statutory retirement age, or unemployment insurance.",

The County Court concluded, endorsing the reasons put forward by the Archdiocese of Craiova, that if it were to authorise the establishment of the trade union, the consultative and deliberative bodies provided for by the Church\u2019s Statute would be replaced by or obliged to work together with a new body \u2013 the trade union \u2013 not bound by the traditions of the Church and the rules of canon law governing consultation and decision-making. The review undertaken by the court thus confirmed that the risk alleged by the Church authorities was plausible and substantial, that the reasons they put forward did not serve any other purpose unrelated to the exercise of the autonomy of the religious community in question, and that the refusal to register the applicant union did not go beyond what was necessary to eliminate that risk.",

Furthermore, when asking the religious community to entrust him with the mission of a member of the clergy, the person concerned freely undertakes to abide by the internal regulations issued by the community. Thus, the ecclesiastical members of the applicant union freely undertook, among other things, not to form a trade union without the blessing of their bishop.

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the exceptions provided for in Article 11 \u00a7 2 must be strictly construed. Only convincing and compelling reasons can justify restricting freedom of association (see Demir and Baykara v. Turkey, no. 34503/97, \u00a7\u00a7 96 et seq., ECHR 2008). This right certainly includes the right to form trade unions. In this connection it should be noted that Article 7 of ILO Convention No. 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise provides that the acquisition of legal personality by workers\u2019 organisations cannot be subject to conditions that would undermine that right.",

The County Court thus endorsed the position of the appellant, the Archdiocese of Craiova, based on the absence of permission from the bishop to form the trade union and the freedom of religious denominations to organise themselves (see paragraph 18).",

We can accept, as the majority of the Grand Chamber did, that the County Court\u2019s decision was based on existing law and pursued a legitimate aim. We do not agree, however, with the assertion that its decision was a proportionate or necessary measure for preserving the autonomy of the Romanian Orthodox Church. In the circumstances of the case, the County Court, by unreservedly adopting the Archdiocese\u2019s position, did not take into account the competing interests and did not perform a balancing exercise to assess the proportionality of the adopted measure in relation to the applicant union\u2019s rights. We consider that such an exercise would have concluded that the autonomy of the Romanian Orthodox Church and its freedom from any external or internal interference would not have been jeopardised by the recognition of the applicant union, with respect to either its doctrine (principles and beliefs) or its organisational operations.",

However, the union\u2019s programme clearly indicates that its sole purpose would have been to defend the interests of its members, proposing a series of measures in that regard and not claiming any decision-making powers within the Church. The programme sought to represent the union within certain Church bodies. And the union\u2019s proclaimed objectives were not to replace Church authorities with union ones, but rather to present and defend proposals before those authorities on behalf of union members, on no account assuming Church functions.",

But this is a different question from the Romanian authorities\u2019 registration of the union, since it addresses the union\u2019s possible future conduct. Indeed, this argument, which did not form part of the national courts\u2019 assessment of the applicant union\u2019s application for registration, is highly speculative. The drastic measure of refusing to register a trade union solely on the basis of part of its programme can only be justified in cases of serious threats or if the programme\u2019s goals are incompatible with democratic principles or are manifestly unlawful (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I; Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, \u00a7\u00a7 107 et seq., ECHR 2003-II; and Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 103, ECHR 2004-I). Furthermore, even after registration, the union\u2019s members would still have remained within the administrative structure of the Church and subject to its internal regulations, which imposed special duties on them as members of the clergy. Nor would the Church or national authorities have been powerless to deal with any activities of the union contravening those special duties. Measures compatible with Article 11 \u00a7 2 of the Convention could certainly have been applied. Specifically, to address the perceived dangers alluded to by the Romanian Government regarding the applicant union\u2019s potential right to strike \u2013 although this is certainly one of the most important union rights \u2013 the Grand Chamber judgment should have taken into account two aspects of the Court\u2019s case-law: (a) the right to strike is not an absolute right (see Schmidt and Dahlstr\u00f6m v. Sweden, 6 February 1976, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 21, and Dilek and Others v. Turkey, nos. 74611/01, 26876/02 and 27628/02, \u00a7\u00a068, 17 July 2007), and (b) limitations on the right to strike may under certain circumstances be permissible in a democratic society (see UNISON v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 53574/99, ECHR 2002-I; Federation of Offshore Workers\u2019 Trade Unions and Others v. Norway (dec.), no.\u00a038190/97, ECHR 2002-VI; and Enerji Yap\u0131-Yol Sen v. Turkey, no.\u00a068959/01, \u00a7 32, 21 April 2009).",

And there is no indication, either in the Government\u2019s observations or in the information available to the Court, that the existence of these two unions has in any way undermined the autonomous operations of the Romanian Orthodox Church.",

In some countries, they are even expressly afforded that right (see paragraph 61 of the judgment).",
