The panel also took note of the previous expert report in which the accident had been reconstructed. The panel could not conclusively determine which driver had caused the chain accident but noted that whoever had violated the rules on overtaking had been 8/8 at fault for causing the accident. The fact that the place of impact had been on the left shoulder of the highway in the direction of \u0130zmir was an indication of who could be at blame for incorrect overtaking.

Accordingly, the panel held that the way the damage had occurred on the cars implied that the applicant and \u015e.Y. had been travelling from \u0130zmir and that it was in fact M.B. who was going in the direction of \u0130zmir. They explained that M.B. must have crossed over to the opposite lane and hit \u015e.Y.\u2019s rear left side with his car\u2019s front left side. The impact of the accident had made M.B. lose control of his car, which had ended up in a vertical position on the road and had then been hit by the applicant\u2019s on its right side. The panel accordingly concluded that the entire fault rested with M.B. and that the other drivers could not be attributed any fault in the accident.",

Turkey, nos. 7942/05 and 24838/05, \u00a7 77, 4 March 2014). The possibility for parties to take part in proceedings flows from the objectives and purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, taken as a whole. The general concept of a fair trial, encompassing also the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial (see Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain, 23 June 1993, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 262), requires that all parties to civil proceedings should have the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Lobo Machado v. Portugal, 20\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 31, Reports of Judgments and Decision 1996-I). Above all, that presupposes that the person against whom proceedings have been initiated should be informed of that fact (see Dilipak and Karakaya v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077). If court documents, including summonses to hearings, are not served in person, then an applicant might be prevented from defending himself in the proceedings (see A\u017edaji\u0107 v. Slovenia, no.\u00a071872/12, \u00a7 48, 8 October 2015).",

Accordingly, in cases such as the present one where civil proceedings had been conducted without the participation of the applicants, the Court verifies (i) whether the authorities had been diligent in informing the applicants of the proceedings, and whether the applicants could be considered to have waived their right to appear before the courts and to defend themselves; and (ii) whether domestic law provided the applicants with the appropriate means to secure a fresh adversarial hearing, once they had learnt of the default judgments against them (see Dilipak and Karakaya, \u00a7 80; A\u017edaji\u0107, \u00a7 53; Gyuleva, \u00a7 38; and Gakharia, \u00a7 49, all cited above).

In that connection, when the trial court sought assistance from the relevant Security Directorate to determine the applicant\u2019s current address after the first failed attempt to deliver the summons to the applicant, the Court observes that the Security Directorate replied to the trial court with two possible addresses where the applicant could be found: the address that was given to the Civil Court by the plaintiff where delivery had already been attempted but failed; and another address declared as his work address by the applicant when he had registered the car, where no delivery had so far been attempted by the trial court. While in those circumstances it would have been more appropriate and reasonable to try the work address of the applicant, the Civil Court chose to send the summons again to the applicant\u2019s old home address even though it was obviously futile to do so. The trial court\u2019s final step, which was to post the summons at the entrance of the building of the applicant\u2019s old address and deem it to be served, could hardly qualify as making reasonable efforts to appraise a defendant of the proceedings against him. In the light of the foregoing, the Court holds that the trial court\u2019s efforts to locate the applicant were not Convention-compliant. In that connection the submission that the national courts served the decision in accordance with the domestic legal provisions is not sufficient in itself to relieve the State of its obligations under Article 6 of the Convention.",

That being so, there are no references in those documents to the names of the parties in the civil proceedings, a consideration which is important since there were more than two drivers implicated in the traffic accident, several injured passengers and two insurance companies. While the Court agrees with the Government that the applicant could have suspected that the civil proceedings in question concerned him, his lack of diligence is not sufficient for the Court to hold that it amounted to an explicit and unequivocal waiver of the right to participate in the civil proceedings. The same holds true as regards the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s lack of diligence in updating his address with the traffic Registry should be taken as a waiver. The Court reiterates in that respect that the main precondition for waiving a right is that the person concerned is aware of the existence of the right in question, and therefore also aware of the related proceedings (see Dilipak and Karakaya, \u00a7 87; A\u017edaji\u0107, \u00a7 58; and Gyuleva, \u00a7 42, all cited above).

On that point however the Court observes that the Court of Cassation did not examine the applicant\u2019s submission that the impugned proceedings had been conducted in his absence. The Court of Cassation only confined its examination to the substantive arguments of the applicant and upheld the trial court\u2019s decision on the grounds that a civil court could arrive at a conclusion different from a criminal court on the basis of the same facts. The Court also observes that the Court of Cassation decided to examine on its own motion the criminal case file within the scope of its appeal review.",

The Court would note at this juncture that in similar cases involving default judgments in civil proceedings, it has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because, inter alia, none of the applicants seeking to secure a fresh adversarial hearing were given leave to reinstate the proceedings either because such a remedy was not available (see Gyuleva, cited above, \u00a7 45) or because the domestic courts\u2019 approach had been overly formalistic (see Gakharia, cited above, \u00a7 49) or because the higher court did not give a reason why it refused the request (see Dilipak and Karakaya, cited above, \u00a7 37).",

While its powers of review on points of law was unlimited, the same cannot be said for its review on facts since it did not have full jurisdiction with respect to establishing the facts of the case, such as re-examining evidence or hearing of witnesses, that task being exclusively reserved for the trial courts upon remittal. In the case at hand, the applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal involved procedural issues and contested facts. In that respect the applicant complained that he would have been able to raise objections to the findings of the expert opinion submitted to the Civil Court had he had an opportunity to participate in the civil proceedings and moreover present to the Civil Court the opposite conclusions reached in the criminal proceedings. The Court of Cassation did not examine the applicant\u2019s complaint about his involuntary non-participation in the proceedings, and limited its review to the general principle that a civil court was not bound by the conclusions of the criminal courts. The reasoning given by the Court of Cassation therefore implies that it reviewed the case solely on points of law even though the shortcoming complained of by the applicant entailed his non-participation in the proceedings and the lost opportunity to submit evidence and arguments to the trial court concerning the facts. As regards the applicant\u2019s submission concerning the procedural defect in the proceedings, namely that he was not notified of the proceedings, the Court observes that the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision contains no reasons for dismissing the claim. As regards the applicant\u2019s submissions concerning the facts of his case, the Court of Cassation held that the Civil Court had assessed the case correctly on the basis of the expert report taken out in the proceedings; however, for the Court, this assessment on its own was not sufficient to redress the applicant\u2019s non-participation in the proceedings since the Court of Cassation\u2019s limited scope of review on facts prevented it from assessing in the trial court\u2019s place, the factual arguments submitted by the applicant. For the same reason, the Court considers that the fact that the Court of Cassation examined the Criminal Court case-file during its appeal review had no bearing since it could not allow it to change the verdict of the civil court on the basis of facts which had not been examined by that court. The Court notes that the Court of Cassation, by not setting aside the trial court\u2019s judgment in the circumstances of the present case, failed to remedy the applicant\u2019s non-participation in the first-instance proceedings, as the applicant was not provided with a fresh adversarial hearing.",
