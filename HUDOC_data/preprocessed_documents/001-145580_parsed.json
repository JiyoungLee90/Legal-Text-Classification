Upon his arrival at the police station, they took him to the basement and continued beating him. They also made him smoke a cigarette while wearing a gas mask and applied electric current to his naked body. The district prosecutor\u2019s office further noted that the applicant\u2019s version of events was full of inconsistencies and wholly improbable. For instance, contrary to his allegations, it was physically impossible to smoke a cigarette in a gas mask without burning one\u2019s face, which had not happened. In addition, the police officers could not possibly have tortured him in the basement, since the building at issue had no basement. They further noted that the applicant\u2019s inconsistent conduct after arrest and his further submissions concerning ill-treatment might have been affected by his psychiatric diagnosis.",

He noted that following his arrest he had been very vulnerable and had not been in a position to file complaints or demand an independent medical examination.

Although the applicant had first complained of his ill-treatment on 14 December 2004, during his questioning in court, the first forensic assessment of his injuries had been carried out only in September 2005, when it had no longer been possible to trace any injuries. There was, however, indirect evidence of his ill-treatment. In particular, on 18 August 2006 he had been acquitted of the offence he had confessed to having committed in June 2004 as a result of his ill-treatment. In its judgment, the trial court had acknowledged that the applicant\u2019s legal-aid lawyer had not been active in representing his interests and that it had not been possible to exclude the possibility that the applicant had given a false confession. The applicant also presented a copy of a handwritten statement signed by V.F., a family acquaintance, on 13 January 2013. According to this statement, on 8 June 2004 V.F. had driven the applicant\u2019s father to the Leninskiy Police station and on their way they had bought analgesic medicines purportedly requested for the applicant by the police. Lastly, he submitted that in contesting his allegations of ill-treatment as improbable, the authorities had distorted the facts. For instance, the police station was constructed in the 19th century. All buildings of that period had been constructed according to typical projects, which had mandatory basement floors. Moreover, when referring to \u201csmoking\u201d in a gas mask, the applicant had meant that he had been forced to inhale cigarette smoke while wearing a gas mask, rather than that he had been forced to smoke a cigarette.",

Moreover, the case file shows that once the new lawyer had been admitted in the proceedings, the applicant retracted his confessional statements and complained of ill-treatment in July 2004 (see paragraphs 14-15 above). This information is inconsistent with that contained in the applicant\u2019s observations, in which he maintained that he had first informed the authorities of his purported ill-treatment in December 2004 only. The Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s description of his purported ill-treatment is couched in very general terms. Neither in his initial submissions, nor in his observations in response to those of the Government, did the applicant indicate the details concerning the ill-treatment complained about, including the exact timing of his arrest and the appointment of the legal-aid lawyer; the role of individual officers or the manner, in which they applied particular ill-treatment techniques to specific parts of his body.
