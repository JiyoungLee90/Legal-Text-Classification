The three rules are not, however, \u2018distinct\u2019 in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule\u201d (see Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, \u00a7 62, 11 January 2007).",
