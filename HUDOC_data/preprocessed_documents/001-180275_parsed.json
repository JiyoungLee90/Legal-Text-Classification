The Court has earlier held in this respect that liquidation proceedings against a State organ cannot absolve the State of its responsibility to enforce a final judgment. To conclude otherwise would allow the State to use this avenue to avoid payment of the debts of its organs, especially taking into account that changing needs force the State to make frequent changes in its organisational structure, including by forming new organs and liquidating old ones (see Kuksa v. Russia, no. 35259/04, \u00a7 26, 15 June 2006; and Nikitina v. Russia, no. 47486/07, \u00a7 19, 15 July 2010).",

The Court has already established, including in the context of Bulgarian cases before it, that the prolonged failure of State bodies to enforce a final judgment in accordance with which they owed the payment of a sum of money breached both Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Mancheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62 and \u00a7\u00a7 66\u201368; Sirmanov v.

The Court accordingly finds in the present case that, by failing for years to comply with the enforceable judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour, the domestic authorities prevented him from receiving an amount of money he could reasonably have expected to receive and deprived the provision of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of all useful effect.",
