The proceedings pending examination on procedural issues lasted before the court of appeal instance and cassation nearly two years (from 10 November 2009 until 5 October 2011). It should be noted that pursuant to the relevant provision of the Civil Code of Procedure of Ukraine (see paragraphs 13 to 14 above), the consideration of the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of 10 November 2009 could have resulted in this decision being quashed and the case being remitted to the first-instance court for further examination. Therefore, the way pursued by the applicant could have proved to be decisive for the outcome of the dispute in her case.",
