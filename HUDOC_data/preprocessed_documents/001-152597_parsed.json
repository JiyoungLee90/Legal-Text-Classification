It entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life. This obligation indisputably applies in the particular context of dangerous activities, where, in addition, special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. Those regulations must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089-90).",

The Court has observed that the ability to conduct one\u2019s life in a manner of one\u2019s own choosing may also include the opportunity to pursue activities perceived to be of a physically or morally harmful or dangerous nature for the individual concerned, and improper State interference with this freedom of personal choice may give rise to an issue under the Convention (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a060 and 61, ECHR 2002III).",

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For the Court, and having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge.

The team\u2019s performance thus depended on both the resolution of the intellectual assignments and the manner in which it travelled between the destination points. As to the second aspect, it is not in dispute that the participants of the game had to abide by the traffic regulations established by the State, even though they were travelling by car with a specific entertainment purpose. The observance of the traffic regulations was ensured by legislative measures providing various sanctions, including criminal ones.

Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see \u0160ilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7\u00a0195, 9 April 2009). Moreover, with the lapse of time the prospects that any effective investigation can be undertaken will increasingly diminish.",

However, there is nothing to suggest that the duration of the criminal investigations and the further proceedings before the courts was justified. The Government did not argue that this case was different from a common traffic accident which should have been concluded speedily. In that regard the Court notes that following the prolonged proceedings before the first-instance court the judicial authorities requested that the court accelerate the proceedings, as they were concerned with the unjustified delays in the case (see paragraph 15 above). More than five years and three months after the proceedings were opened, the Court of Appeal remitted the case for additional investigation, considering that the facts had not been established properly and that further investigative measures were required. In reaching that conclusion the Court of Appeal referred, among other things, to the witness statements which had been available at the pre-trial investigation stage (see paragraph 19 above).",
