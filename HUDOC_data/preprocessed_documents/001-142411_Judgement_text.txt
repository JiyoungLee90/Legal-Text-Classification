The case originated in an application (no. 60459/12) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Károly Kvacskay (“the applicant”), on 9 September 2012.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 17 October 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Budapest.
In a real estate dispute, on 19 May 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Tapolca District Court.
After two remittals, the District Court gave judgment on 9 June 2011, which was partly reversed by the Veszprém County Regional Court on 28 February 2012 (service: 14 March 2012). On 22 May 2012 the proceedings were finally terminated, by way of a rectification order.
