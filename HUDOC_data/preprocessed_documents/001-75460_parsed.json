Regardless of this fact, the proceedings continued for approximately two years and two months. Admittedly, the Court notes that the proceedings were prolonged due to a number of co-accused who wanted to benefit from Law no. 341 and, as a result, the court had to undertake various procedural decisions to secure their additional submissions (see\u00a0paragraph 16). However, it appears from the case-file that the additional submissions of these coaccused did not serve any purpose in clarifying other facts of the criminal case before it, since in respect of the co-accused, including the applicant, who did not request the application of Law no. 341, the public prosecutor, on 30 October 1996, relied on his previous observations on the merits (see paragraph 19). In fact, it appears from the case-file that no evidence was admitted into the case-file in respect of the applicant after 28 December 1994.

Greece, no.\u00a041354/98, \u00a7 26, 12 April 2001), the Court considers that the domestic court could have applied stricter measures to speed up the proceedings. In particular, it could have decided to sever the proceedings in respect of those co-accused who wanted to benefit from Law\u00a0no. 341 from the remaining coaccused pursuant to Articles 2 and 4 of the Code on Criminal Procedure.
