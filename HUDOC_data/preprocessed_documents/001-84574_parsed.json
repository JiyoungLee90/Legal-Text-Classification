There was a serious threat that the applicant would go into hiding after his release from custody, as he had been living in hiding before the investigation and was arrested following the arrest warrant issued by the police. The court also made reference to the activities previously carried out and gave a precise indication of the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was indispensable to separate the applicant from the other suspects, the witnesses and the evidence which had not yet been secured. The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the penalty he faced. No special circumstances dictated the lifting of the detention.",

It was necessary to examine the files of the relevant inquires, to obtain new pieces of evidence, expert opinions and documents, and to take further investigatory measures. A need had arisen to take evidence from further witnesses and persons involved in the activities of the criminal gang, and from police officers in the criminals' pay.

The Court notes that detention pending trial was imposed on the applicant in view of the severity of the charges against him, the fact that he had been a member of a criminal gang and the resulting risk that he would obstruct the proceedings. Thus, it was a classic example of a case relating to organised crime, by definition presenting more difficulties for the investigating authorities and, later, for the courts in determining the facts and the degree of responsibility of each member of the gang. It is obvious that in cases of this kind, continuous control and limitation of the defendants' contact with each other and with other persons may be essential to avoid their absconding, tampering with evidence and, most importantly of all, influencing, or even threatening, witnesses. Accordingly, longer periods of detention than in other cases may be reasonable (see B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 56).",

Furthermore, the Government stated that the particular complexity of the case, since it concerned organised crime, was an additional justification for the applicant's detention.",

In this regard, it would observe that that the proceedings were of a considerable complexity, regard being had to the number of defendants, the need to separate them during the extensive evidentiary proceedings and to implement special measures on account of the connections between the criminal gangs. Nevertheless, the hearings in the applicant's case were held regularly and at short intervals. The first-instance court held 60 hearings and examined 59 co-accused. The witnesses gave evidence on at least 100 occasions and a considerable number of other investigatory measures were taken.",
