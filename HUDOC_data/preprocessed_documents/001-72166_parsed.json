In the present case the Court notes firstly that the judgment of 30\u00a0November 2005 is not yet final, and may be reversed on appeal. Secondly, although the fact of ill-treatment was recognised by the first-instance court, the applicant has not been afforded any redress in this respect. Thirdly, the judgment of 30 November 2005 dealt only with the ill-treatment itself and did not examine the alleged flaws in the investigation, which is one of the main concerns of the applicant in the present case. Therefore, although that judgment should be regarded as an integral part of the investigative process, it does not, in the circumstances of the case, affect the applicant\u2019s victim status in respect of the violations alleged by him.",

On 26 September 2002 V explained to the applicant\u2019s representatives that someone introducing himself as an investigator had in fact telephoned him once and explained that he needed to question him.

According to the applicant, although MR had not been present in the room where the applicant had been tortured with electrodes, he had not reacted to the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment. Moreover, when the applicant refused to confess to the alleged murder of MS, MR had returned the applicant to the police officers who, according to the applicant, had tortured him. Furthermore, although it was known that MR had participated in the questioning of 19 September 1998, and had allegedly failed to react to the applicant\u2019s complaints of ill-treatment, the investigation of the case was referred to the prosecutor\u2019s office for the Leninskiy District of Nizhniy Novgorod, which came directly under the regional prosecutor\u2019s office where MR occupied an important position. In the years that followed, the investigation remained in the hands of the same district prosecutor\u2019s office, despite being closed and reopened on numerous occasions. Only in 2004 was the case forwarded to the department dealing with investigations into cases of particular importance; however, it still remained within the jurisdiction of the regional prosecutor\u2019s office.",

Consequently, there is a causal link between the violation found and the reduction in the applicant\u2019s earnings and his future medical expenses (see, by contrast, Berktay v. Turkey, \nno. 22493/93, \u00a7 215, 1 March 2001, where no casual link between the ill-treatment and the current psychological problems of the applicant was established by the Court).",

An award may still be made notwithstanding the large number of imponderables involved in the assessment of future losses, though the greater the lapse of time involved the more uncertain the link between the breach and the damage becomes (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, \u00a7 426 et seq., 18 June 2002). The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of either past or future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award to an applicant, and is to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (former Article 50), judgment of 6 November 1989, Series A no.\u00a038, p. 9, \u00a7\u00a015, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom (Article 41), nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, ECHR 2000).",
