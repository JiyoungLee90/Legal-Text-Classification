The case originated in an application (no. 8982/10) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Ms Borbála Ware (“the applicant”), on 6 February 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr B. Lehner, a lawyer practising in Veszprém. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 3 January 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Hegyesd.
In a trespass dispute, on 15 April 2001 the applicant brought an action before the Tapolca District Court.
After a second-instance decision by the Veszprém County Regional Court and a remittal, the final judgment in the case was adopted by the Supreme Court and served on the applicant’s lawyer on 12 August 2009.
