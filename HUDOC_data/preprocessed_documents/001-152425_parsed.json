The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot, therefore, be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere: a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the object and purpose of Article 11. Like Article\u00a08, Article\u00a011 sometimes requires positive measures to be taken, even in the sphere of relations between individuals, if need be (see, Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v.

Unlike in Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d (cited above) where eggs and clumps of grass were thrown at the applicants, the applicants in the present case were punched and kicked and sprayed with tear gas. Some of the participants in the demonstration, including the third applicant, suffered injuries as a result of the clash with the attackers and needed medical treatment. The incident took place in front of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, a building guarded by the police. A police patrol in a car parked not far from the place of the event was observing the incident but did not intervene. Some of the participants in the demonstration called the police immediately after the beginning of the attack, but it took the police one and a half hours to arrive.",

According to the Government, the applicants had acted in breach of Section 10 of the Assemblies Act by giving notice of the demonstration only one day in advance. The Court is not persuaded by this argument and notes that \u2012 according to Section 12 of the Assemblies Act \u2012 the applicants were not under a legal obligation to give notification of the demonstration because there were fewer than fifty participants. Indeed, had it been otherwise, the applicants would have been held responsible under Article\u00a067 of the Code of Administrative Offences, which was not the case.",
