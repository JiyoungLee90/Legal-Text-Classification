However, as it happened, the District Court did not undertake an independent assessment of proportionality but essentially reiterated the contents of the investigator\u2019s application. It did not mention that the applicant was charged with non-violent offences or that he had not entered an insanity or diminished responsibility plea or claimed being unable to stand trial. Even though the court acknowledged that the applicant had submitted voluntarily to an outpatient psychiatric assessment which returned inconclusive findings, it did not hear the experts who had been in charge of that assessment or afford the applicant an opportunity to cross-examine those experts. Nor did it consider the effect of separation of the applicant from his elderly mother whose sole guardian he was or weigh the needs of the investigation against her well-being.

It has reiterated that the national authorities must have regard to the defendant\u2019s wishes as to his or her choice of legal representation, but may override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice. Where such grounds are lacking, a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel would entail a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 together with paragraph 3 (c) if it adversely affected the applicant\u2019s defence, regard being had to the proceedings as a whole (ibid., \u00a7 79).",

The forensic psychiatrists concluded to the applicant\u2019s sanity and he did not claim otherwise. It does not therefore appear that the expert report was in any way prejudicial for his line of defence.

However, its excessive duration could be sufficient, on its own, to reach the conclusion that it was disproportionate to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve (see Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 96; Rosengren, cited above, \u00a7 38; Luordo v.

The length of the impugned restriction in the instant case was longer than that in the cases in which it had not given rise, in combination with other elements particular to those cases, to the finding of a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Antonenkov and Others v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 14183/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-67, 22\u00a0November 2005, and Fedorov and\u00a0Fedorova, cited above). However, the distinguishing feature of the present case is that the applicant lived in Moscow but he was required to stay in Novosibirsk where the offences had been allegedly committed. Novosibirsk is located more than 3,300 kilometres by road or approximately four hours by airplane from the area of the applicant\u2019s ordinary residence and he was not allowed to go back even for a short period of time (compare with Mia\u017cd\u017cyk v. Poland, no.\u00a023592/07, \u00a7\u00a7 39 and 41, 24\u00a0January 2012, where the applicant was forced to stay more than five years outside his country of habitual residence). Being required to stay so long and so far from the place where he had previously lived must have considerably disrupted the applicant\u2019s life and exposed him to financial hardship, yet there is no indication that the domestic authorities had taken any account of that fact.",

The Russian law did not require that the impugned measure be reviewed at regular intervals by the investigator or by the courts. The judicial challenges to the restriction that the applicant mounted were invariably dismissed by reference to the same facts that had justified the initial application of the measure (see paragraph 9 above). However, the Court reiterates that the necessity for maintaining the restriction will inevitably diminish with the passage of time, especially where no further evidence of the applicant\u2019s intention to abscond is uncovered during the course of the investigation (see Luordo, \u00a7 96, and Rosengren, \u00a7\u00a039, both cited above).",

When he asked for the restriction to be lifted and committed himself to attending all hearings and interviews, the Regional Court confined its analysis to the affirmation that the investigation would suffer if the applicant were to leave Novosibirsk, without explaining why it believed that his undertaking to appear was insufficient to guarantee his attendance (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant\u2019s arguments relating to the needs of his dependent mother were not addressed by the domestic courts in any form.",
