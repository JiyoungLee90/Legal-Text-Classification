He maintained that for the period from 21 October 2005 (that is, the date when the suspension allegedly became unlawful) until 30 April 2006 (that is, the date of termination of his appointment) he was entitled to a fee for his services, which corresponded to the service allowance set out in his appointment letter. He thus sought enforcement of the contract. Alternatively, he based his claim on sections 318(1) and 339(1) of the [old] Civil Code and on the breach by the Church of its contractual obligations under the agency contract. He argued that by not paying him the allowance due for the period between 21 October 2005 and 30 April 2006, the Church had failed to fulfil its contractual obligations. He thus claimed damages, amounting to the loss of service allowances to which he would have been entitled under the contract for the above-mentioned period.",

As a secondary claim, he sought damages under sections 318(1) and 339(1) of the Civil Code for breach of contractual obligations. Those proceedings were pursued up to the Supreme Court.

(The fact that the applicant was removed from service allegedly for, inter alia, telling the media that State subsidies had been paid unlawfully to a Church establishment, could merit separate consideration, but the applicant raised this issue neither before the domestic courts nor before this Court.) The removal was upheld by the ecclesiastical court of second instance, which terminated the applicant\u2019s service more than ten months after the disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against him. Even prior to the removal, the applicant\u2019s service had been suspended pending a decision on the merits, for a maximum of sixty days, and the applicant had been informed that he was entitled to only a half of his service allowance during the period of his suspension.",

This time, therefore, the applicant based his case not on labour but civil legislation. Again, the claim was dismissed by the court of first instance on the grounds that, in that court\u2019s view, no contractual relationship had been established between the parties under civil law. The appellate court upheld that dismissal, adding that the Calvinist Church had no standing in the proceedings, since the applicant had been appointed by the local parish.\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court quashed that judgment, however, and discontinued the civil proceedings on the basis that the applicant could not pursue his claims in the State courts, but could do so in the ecclesiastical courts.",

It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified\u201d (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.

Respect for the autonomy of religious communities precludes any discretionary power on the part of the State to determine whether religious beliefs or the means used to express such beliefs are legitimate (see Hasan and Chaush v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 78, ECHR 2000XI), to oblige a religious community to admit or exclude an individual or to entrust someone with a particular religious duty (see Svyato-Mykhaylivska Parafiya v. Ukraine, no. 77703/01, \u00a7\u00a0146, 14 June 2007), or to act as an arbiter between religious communities (see Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun\u201d, cited above, \u00a7 165). On the other hand, a mere allegation by a religious community that there is an actual or potential threat to its autonomy is not sufficient to render an interference with its members\u2019 rights compatible with the requirements of the Convention. The religious community must also show, in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, that the alleged risk is \u201creal\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d and that the impugned interference does not go beyond what is necessary to eliminate that risk and does not serve any other purpose unrelated to the exercise of the religious community\u2019s autonomy. The national courts must ensure that these conditions are satisfied, by conducting an in-depth examination of the circumstances of the case and a thorough balancing exercise between the competing interests at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Sindicatul \u201cP\u0103storul cel Bun\u201d, cited above, \u00a7 159). Consequently, if a religious community or organisation fails to convincingly demonstrate that the State\u2019s interference poses a real threat to its autonomy, it cannot demand that the State refrain from regulating, by means of that State\u2019s law, the relevant activities of that community.

Would such rights include pension rights? Other social security rights? Health insurance rights? The right to privacy under Article 8 of the Convention? What about property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention: could such claims be excluded from the national courts\u2019 civil jurisdiction?

Moreover, some churches (unlike the Hungarian Calvinist Church) may even not have a system of ecclesiastical courts or tribunals. What would then be left of the State\u2019s obligation under Article 6, whose notion of \u201ctribunal\u201d now seems to encompass all variety of ecclesiastical dispute resolution bodies?",

According to the judgment the Supreme Court was not mistaken in deciding that the State courts had no jurisdiction to examine the applicant\u2019s civil claim. At the same time, the judgment pays tribute to the fact that the Supreme Court \u201cin fact\u201d examined this claim (see paragraph 74), even though the Supreme Court expressly \u201cdiscontinued\u201d the examination of the case on the ground of the ecclesiastical origin of the legal relationship. However, the result of that \u201cexamination\u201d is that de facto the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to examine the claim. What kind of \u201cexamination\u201d is it which ends with a realisation that examination is legally impossible?! The majority failed to distinguish between an examination of the possibility of examining the applicant\u2019s claim (i.e. examination of the limits of the Supreme Court\u2019s own jurisdiction) and the examination by the Supreme Court of the claim itself.",

At the same time it is obvious that it would be pointless for the applicant to apply to the Supreme Court, because in the applicant\u2019s civil case it (rightly, according to the logic of the majority) held that claims originating in the \u201cpastoral service relationship, regulated by ecclesiastical law\u201d, have to be decided by ecclesiastical courts. Moreover, the Supreme Court even explicitly relied on the same \u201cconclusion\u201d reached by the labour court in the applicant\u2019s labour case (see\u00a0paragraph 15 of the judgment).",
