Life prisoners had only been let out of their cells three times a day when they were allowed to use the communal toilets and wash the buckets; during the rest of the time they had to relieve themselves in the cells in front of other inmates. The court concluded that the humiliation of having to use a bucket for one\u2019s physiological needs could only be justified with security reasons. As the Government had failed to produce evidence that there had been a real and serious risk to security in the applicant\u2019s case, the restrictions applied to his access to a toilet had been excessive and beyond the ones inherent to deprivation of liberty. The court awarded the applicant BGN\u00a0200 (approximately EUR 100) in damages suffered as a result of detention in inhuman and degrading material conditions \u2013 absence of toilet facilities, bed, linen, table and chair, access of light and fresh air caused by inaction of the respondent party in the period 26 October 2000 \u2013 26 October 2005. The applicant was required to pay court fees at the amount of BGN 992 for the remaining part of his claim.",

However, he had access to the toilet during the day-time slots allowed for that and it had not been established that the prison guards had prevented him from visiting the toilet then. While serving such a punishment was no doubt characterized by negative and unfavourable effects, the circumstances of the case did not attract the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice and the prison authorities under the SMRDA since the enforcement of a punishment could not be considered as exercising administrative activities or as unlawful action or inaction within the meaning of Article 1 of this law.

It was notorious that the conditions in the Bulgarian prisons were not up to European standards, but these conditions were the same for all inmates. The execution of sentences was in itself accompanied by considerable restrictions associated with deprivation of liberty and the various regimes, especially by the \u201cspecial regime\u201d as compared to the others, and even more in placement in isolation cells as a disciplinary sanction for offences. In examining such complaints the courts had to take into account and strike the necessary balance between the prohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment as set by the Constitution and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 3 of the Convention, and the inevitable suffering inherent to deprivation of liberty. The court acknowledged the degrading effect of using buckets in the presence of other prisoners, but also took into account the necessity to ensure security and discipline in accordance with the requirements of the \u201cspecial regime\u201d served in this department of the prison as well as the personalities and specific conduct of prisoners. In striking this balance in the particular case, the Supreme Court of Cassation found that the applicant\u2019s suffering did not go beyond the level of due respect to his dignity and did not require any compensation.",

Under section 127d in conjunction with section 127a of the 1969 Act the sentence of life imprisonment without commutation is implemented either in separate prisons or in special sections of the regular prisons. According to section 167g of the regulations for the implementation of the 1969 Act life prisoners are placed in permanently locked cells under heightened security. Only after a decision of the commission under section 17 of the 1969 Act can those prisoners be accommodated in cells together with prisoners serving different sentences and can they take part in joint sport, work, educational or other activities. The lower court concluded on the basis of the legislation referred to above that the administration of Lovech and Varna Prisons cannot be said to have failed to act thus causing the applicant non-pecuniary damage. Admittedly, during the period in question the applicant did not take part in labour, educational or sport activities. However, that is explained with the type of regime under which he is serving his sentence and not with any unlawful conduct by the prison administration. The applicant has been involved in individual correctional activities; he had been allowed to spend an hour a day in the open air in a place furnished with sports equipment. As of February 2007, he has been allowed an additional hour for sport.

The request is to be made to the competent administrative court, which has to deal with it immediately and, having made the necessary inquiries, rule forthwith. The court\u2019s decision is subject to appeal, which does not have suspensive effect (Article\u00a0254\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0and 2). In addition, Article 290 of the 2006 Code regulates the enforcement of administrative court judgments vis-\u00e0-vis an administrative official obliged in a court judgment to deliver a non-substitutable action. If the responsible official fails to act, the bailiff imposes on him or her weekly pecuniary sanctions (\u0438\u0437\u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430), in the amount of between BGN 50 and BGN 1200, for so long as the act remains uncompleted. The bailiff\u2019s decisions, actions or failure to act can be challenged before the administrative court (Article 294 of the Code). If the administrative court quashes a bailiff\u2019s decision or action, or declares unlawful his or her failure to act, the court either decides the matter itself or orders the bailiff to act within a deadline it determines for it. Also, according to Article 269 \u00a7\u00a02 of the 2006 Code, monetary judgment debts are collected on the basis of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007 under which a writ of enforcement is a condition for starting enforcement proceedings. Finally, according to Article 276 \u00a7\u00a02 of the 2006 Code, compulsory execution can be started on the basis of a request by the individual to the bailiff, accompanied by a copy of the enforcement title which can be a final judgment in the individual\u2019s favour.",

They also made detailed submissions in respect of the material conditions in which the applicant had been detained in Lovech Prison but not in respect of the conditions in Varna Prison. As regards Lovech Prison, they emphasised that the use of buckets as a toilet had been found by the Court to be in breach of Article 3 of the Convention only in cases where the applicants had had to relieve themselves in front of other inmates. Given that the applicant in the present case had been locked alone in a cell under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d for practically the whole period of his detention, he could not claim to be affected by a breach of Article 3 in that respect. They further asserted that a breach of Article 3 of the Convention could only be established if the treatment to which an applicant had been subjected reached the minimum level of severity. This had not been the case, given that the authorities had not aimed at humiliating or debasing the applicant, nor had he shown that his suffering went beyond the inevitable inconvenience of serving a prison sentence.

In its recent judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 203-09), the Court found that such automatic isolation, in application of the relevant provisions of the Execution of Punishments Act 1969 and later of the Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act 2009, as well as the regulations for their application, was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.

The Court notes that the Government accepted this to have been the case before the autumn of 2008 when they submitted the situation had changed in Lovech Prison, as toilets and sinks were built in the cells of prisoners serving life sentences (see paragraph 13 above). Notably, the Government argued that this circumstance was not debasing for the applicant, given that he was alone in his cell. The Court observes, however, that the domestic courts\u2019 findings confirmed that during the period examined in the domestic proceedings the cells were inhabited also by other prisoners (see paragraphs 22 and 24 above).",

The latter were only allowed out of their cells to use the common toilet three times a day and had to relieve themselves in buckets the rest of the time. It notes that the applicant was transferred from Varna Prison to Lovech Prison on 19 February 2009 and that until that point in time he did not benefit from a cell equipped with a toilet and sink, and had to use a bucket. Even assuming that for certain periods of time the applicant was accommodated alone in a cell, the Court has already held that subjecting a detainee to the prolonged inconvenience of having to relieve himself or herself in a bucket cannot be deemed warranted, except in specific situations where allowing visits to the sanitary facilities would pose concrete and serious security risks (see Malechkov, cited above, \u00a7 140). In the present case the Government did not invoke any such risks to justify the need for the applicant to use a bucket to relieve himself during the period before 19 February 2009. In the absence of specific evidence to confirm or dispel the applicant\u2019s dangerousness so as to justify the prolonged necessity of the his isolation under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d conditions of detention, the Court is unable to agree that the conditions, in which the applicant was held were compliant with Article 3 (see Manolov, cited above, \u00a7 42).",

Bulgaria, nos.\u00a04473/02 and 34138/04, \u00a7\u00a7 55-56 and 68, 10 February 2011; Radkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 18382/05, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 58, 10 February 2011; Iordan Petrov v.

As in the cases mentioned above, the applicant is still incarcerated and it does not appear that, except with respect to the toilets or cell windows, the conditions of his detention \u2013 in particular, his very restrictive prison regime \u2013 have significantly changed in recent years (see paragraphs\u00a010, 20, 26 and 27 above). A claim for damages under section\u00a01 of the SMRDA is therefore, on its own, not capable of providing the applicant adequate relief. Moreover, such a claim, in so far as directed against conditions of incarceration that flow from the prison regime applicable to the applicant, does not stand high prospect of success, given that the Bulgarian courts have already dismissed such claims on the basis that such conditions were not unlawful within the meaning of the domestic law (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 226). Indeed, that is what happened in one of the cases brought by the applicant seeking damages for the conditions and regime in which he had been detained (see paragraphs\u00a027-28 above). Furthermore, it seems that the proceedings instituted by the applicant involved separate examination of the various aspects of his situation and for this reason failed to take into account whether their cumulative effect on him was compliant with Article 3 so as to afford redress where appropriate as required by Article 13 of the Convention.",

In any event, the Court notes that forced enforcement can be started on the basis of a request by the individual to the bailiff, accompanied by a copy of the enforcement title which can be a final judgment in the individual\u2019s favour (see paragraph 42 above). Therefore, a writ of enforcement is not an absolute condition for starting enforcement proceedings in administrative cases as regards obligations other than monetary payments.",
