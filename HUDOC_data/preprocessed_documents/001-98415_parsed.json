Greece [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 1999-II). For the Court, it would be inconceivable that Article\u00a013 provided the right to have a remedy, and for it to be effective, without protecting the implementation of the remedies afforded. To hold the contrary would lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, by analogy, Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II).",
