Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism or organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of its Protocols, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see, among other authorities, Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 62, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no. 25).",

Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 130-34, Reports 1998III), the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead (see, for example, Tanl\u0131 v.

In such cases the Court has normally limited its findings to Article 2.

A similar line of reasoning appears to be implicit in the cases of Y\u00f6yler and Ayder and Others (both cited above).

However, these lapses resulted from objective logistical difficulties arising from the character of the events of 13-14 October 2005 and the number of casualties and can hardly be said to have had as its purpose to subject the applicants to inhuman treatment, and in particular, to cause them moral suffering.",

In the cases of Pannullo and Forte v.\u00a0France (no.\u00a037794/97, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, ECHR 2001X) and Girard v.

The breadth of this margin varies and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual, the nature of the interference and the object pursued by the interference (see S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 102). The Court has on many occasions stressed that it was aware that States faced particular challenges posed by terrorism and terrorist violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 145B; \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 192-196, ECHR 2005IV; Ramirez Sanchez v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 59450/00, \u00a7\u00a7 115-116, ECHR 2006IX; and Finogenov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18299/03 and 27311/03, \u00a7 212, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual\u2019s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights (see Connors v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no.\u00a066746/01, \u00a7\u00a082, 27 May 2004, with further references). Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will be restricted (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR\u00a02007I).",

Instead, it must confine itself as far as possible, without losing sight of the general context, to examining the issues raised by the case before it. Here, therefore, the Court\u2019s task is not to review, in abstracto, the compatibility with the Convention of the above rule, but to determine, in concreto, the effect of the interference on the applicants\u2019 right to private and family life (see, as a recent authority, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v.

The Court finds that the interference with the applicants\u2019 Article 8 rights resulting from the said measure was particularly severe in that it completely precluded them from any participation in the relevant funeral ceremonies and involved a ban on the disclosure of the location of the grave, thus permanently cutting the links between the applicants and the location of the deceased\u2019s remains. In this connection the Court would also refer to the practice of various international institutions which in cases involving the application of similar measures considered such interference with the applicants\u2019 rights as particularly severe (see Sabanchiyeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 92-96).",
