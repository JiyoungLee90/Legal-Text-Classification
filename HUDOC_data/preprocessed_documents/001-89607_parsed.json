When considering the appropriateness of the applicant\u2019s sentence, it found that the mitigating circumstances relied on by the lower court were not sufficient to warrant a sentence less than the maximum penalty. It also found that the Sofia City Court had failed to take into account certain aggravating circumstances, such as the victim\u2019s good moral character. In its judgment, the murder committed by the applicant was considerably graver than other offences of that type and the aggravating circumstances were, overall, of such weight and intensity as to rule out a penalty showing any degree of lenience. However, it went on to say, by express reference to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined within a reasonable time, with all the negative repercussions which this had had on him. It found that the excessive length of the proceedings was not attributable to the applicant\u2019s conduct, although he had at times failed to organise his defence efficiently. In the court\u2019s view, the undue delay amounted in itself to a mitigating circumstance, which obviated the need to imprison the applicant for life, in line with the former Commission\u2019s and the Court\u2019s caselaw that the excessive length of criminal proceedings could be remedied by a reduction in sentence.",

In spite of the legislative reform of 1 January 2000, which was intended to bring the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure in line with the requirements of the Convention (see paragraph 32 above), the Sofia City Court and the Sofia Court of Appeals continued to rely, throughout the entire period under consideration, chiefly on the gravity of the charges against the applicant, on the presumption that due to the seriousness of the offences of which he stood accused he automatically presented a risk of absconding and would commit offences if released, and on the lack of any change in the relevant circumstances (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above and Petar Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 62544/00, \u00a7 37, 21 December 2006). This approach was due to these courts\u2019 expansive interpretation of the shift of the burden of proof under Article 152 \u00a7 2 (3) of the 1974 Code in its version after 1 January 2000 (see paragraphs 24 and 32 above). On this point, the Court reiterates that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of pre-trial detention and that continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. Where the law provides for a presumption in respect of factors relevant to the grounds for continued detention, the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty must nevertheless be convincingly demonstrated (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 84, with further references). Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (ibid., \u00a7 85). It can hardly be presumed, without more information, that the risk presented by the applicant did not recede over a period of almost seven and a half years. However, no concrete facts and arguments were invoked by the national courts to convincingly demonstrate the need for his remand in custody for such a long time.",

This means that the competent court has to examine not only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in domestic law, but also the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention (see, as a recent authority, Petar Vasilev, cited above, \u00a7 33, with further references).

They also consistently invoked the lack of any change in the relevant circumstances (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above). This approach was due to the expansive manner in which they construed the shift of the burden of proof under Article 152 \u00a7 2 (3) of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure in its version after 1 January 2000 (see paragraph 32 above). However, by relying on this presumption the courts disregarded as irrelevant or plainly insufficient a number of concrete facts and arguments adduced by the applicant. As noted in paragraph 57 above, where the law provides for a presumption in respect of factors relevant to the grounds for continued detention, the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty must nevertheless be convincingly demonstrated. The persistent application of this presumption in the instant case was particularly disquieting, considering the fact that the applicant\u2019s detention lasted almost seven and a half years. The time elapsed and the stage of the proceedings are in themselves factors which reflect upon and might negate the need for the continued detention of an accused (see Petar Vasilev, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

The rationale for this proscription was that if they did so, they would be impermissibly prejudging the merits of the criminal case (see paragraphs 29 above). The Court has already had occasion to criticise such circumscription of the scope of judicial review of pretrial detention. In Ilijkov it found, after examining the matter in considerable detail, that the Bulgarian authorities\u2019 concern to provide effective protection for the principle of impartiality was based on a misconception and could not justify the limitation imposed on the Article 5 \u00a7 4 rights of pretrial detainees (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 94100, with further references).

Also, at the hearing held on 13 January 2005 the Sofia City Court declined to consider the applicant\u2019s request for release on the grounds that his counsel was absent (see paragraph 27 above), which can hardly be seen as a valid ground for this refusal. Even if in the absence of counsel the court was unable to proceed with the trial, there was nothing to prevent it from ruling on the applicant\u2019s request.",

It was therefore inclined to allow the prosecution\u2019s request to increase the sentence to life imprisonment. The crucial factor for its eventual decision not to do so was its understanding that the unreasonable length of the criminal proceedings in itself amounted to a mitigating circumstance warranting a lesser sentence than the maximum penalty. In these circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the Sofia Court of Appeal\u2019s finding concerning the effect of the excessive length of the proceedings had a decisive and measurable impact on the applicant\u2019s sentence (see, mutatis mutandis, Beck, cited above, \u00a7 28 in fine).

However, it also notes that it is clear from the terms of section 19(2) of Regulation no. 12 of 1993, which applied between the moment when the applicant was taken into custody and April 1999, that all of the pre-trial detainees\u2019 letters, except for those to and from their lawyers, were subject to opening and inspection (see paragraph 43 above). Later, between April 1999 and December 2000, and between June 2002 and April 2006, the entirety of the applicant\u2019s incoming and outgoing correspondence, including the letters to and from his lawyers, was subject to inspection under the express terms of section 25(1) of Regulation no. 2 of 1999 and section 132d(3) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see paragraphs 44 and 47 above). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for correspondence (see Campbell, cited above, p. 16, \u00a7 33; and Petrov v. Bulgaria, no. 15197/02, \u00a7 39, 22 May 2008), at least between the time when he was taken into custody and December 2000, as well as between June 2002 and April 2006. However, in the present case the Court finds no basis to assume that such interference existed following the adoption in September 2006 of the new section 178 of the Regulations for application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see paragraph 49 above).",

The former was also found to run counter to section 18(2) of the 1991 Bar Act (see paragraphs 40, 41, 45 and 48 above). The Court also notes that the monitoring envisaged by these provisions was not based on a judicial decision, as expressly required under Article 34 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 40 above). Against this background, it finds that between April 1999 and December 2000 and between June 2002 and April 2006 the interference with the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of correspondence was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, in breach of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention.",

Furthermore, while agreeing that some measure of control over the correspondence of those in custody is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, the Court notes that the Government have not explained what was the legitimate aim pursued by the systematic interception of the entirety of the pre-trial detainees\u2019 nonlegal correspondence. Nor have they sought to adduce any arguments showing why it was to be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for its attainment (see Petrov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 44, with further references).
