The decision also stated that FSB officer T. had been questioned on 10 July and 22 October 2001 and FSB officer M. had been questioned on 16 July 2001 and 23 October 2002. They both testified that on 12 May 2001 in the vicinity of the \u201cNeftyanik\u201d market in  they had apprehended three men, including Isa Kaplanov and Ruslan Sadulayev, for insulting local residents with swearwords, had taken them to the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD and had left the detainees there. The next day they had found out that the detainees had been released. Officer T. stated that he had drawn up a report on the detention of the three men, whilst officer M. submitted that he did not remember whether he had drawn up any reports. The decision further stated that the fact of the apprehension on 12 May 2001 of the applicant\u2019s relatives and Movsar Musitov had been confirmed by the head of the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD in a letter of 8 June 2001 and by the acting head of the Chechen Department of the FSB in a letter of 12 August 2001. The decision continued that on 14 May 2001 an investigator of the Grozny Prosecutor\u2019s Office had examined the register of persons held in the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD and had found out that the names of the applicant\u2019s son, son-in-law and Movsar Musitov had not been listed among those detained there. The decision also referred to the statement of B., who between 12 April and 23 July 2001 had been seconded to  as the head of the police of the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD. B. had stated that on a date which he could not remember FSB officers had delivered four or five persons, who, as claimed by those officers, had been detained during a \u201csweeping-up\u201d operation in the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny on suspicion of their involvement in illegal military activity. Officers T. and M. had asked B. to keep the detainees until the next morning and then release them except for Isa Kaplanov and Ruslan Sadulayev, as those two were to be taken away by FSB personnel. According to B., on 13 May 2001 he had released the detainees, whilst Kaplanov and Sadulayev had been taken away by T. and M. The decision further relied on a letter of 23 May 2003 from the head of the Sverdlovskiy Regional Department of the FSB, the permanent place of service of officers T. and M., who had confirmed that on 12 May 2001 the said two officers had, indeed, delivered the applicant\u2019s relatives to the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD, but had no information as to the subsequent fate of Isa Kaplanov and Ruslan Sadulayev, as on the morning of 13\u00a0May 2001 those two individuals had been taken away by personnel of another division of the Chechen Department of the FSB.

The applicant stressed that her relatives had been apprehended in life-endangering circumstances, given that their arrest had been effected by a group of about 20 armed men who had arrived in six APCs and had not produced any documents to authorise the arrest. In this respect she referred to documents of the Council of Europe and of various human-rights NGOs reporting on a widespread practice of forced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, tortures and ill-treatment of detainees in  by representatives of the federal forces. She thus argued, relying on Article 2 of the Convention, that the fact that her relatives had remained missing since 12 May 2001 proved that they had been killed.",

She pointed out that even though she had immediately notified the authorities about the detention of her relatives, no measures to establish their whereabouts had followed and the investigation had not been commenced before 27 June 2001, that is to say more than a month after her relatives\u2019 detention and disappearance. In this respect she also referred to a discrepancy between the Government\u2019s statement to the effect that the investigation had been commenced on 12 June 2001, and the fact that the decision of the Zavodskoy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office dated 15 July 2004 to discontinue the criminal proceedings in case no. 13093 had mentioned 27\u00a0June 2001 as the date on which the investigation had been initiated. In the applicant\u2019s view, this fact clearly demonstrated the Russian authorities\u2019 indifference towards the disappearance of her relatives as well as to the investigation into these events. The applicant further contended that the investigation had been pending since June 2001 but had not brought any tangible results so far, having been repeatedly suspended and reopened. Moreover, the investigating authorities had failed to inform her about its progress or of the investigative measures that had been taken. The applicant also claimed that even though she had been declared a victim in case no.\u00a013093, she had not been allowed to have access to the case file, let alone to study it or make copies of any documents from the file.",

This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim\u2019s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition, effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances or otherwise unlawful, and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-109, 4\u00a0May\u00a02001, and Douglas-Williams v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a056413/00, 8\u00a0January 2002).",

The Court observes that, furthermore, Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government refer, does not preclude disclosure of the documents from a pending investigation file, but rather sets out a procedure for and limits to such disclosure. For these reasons, the Court considers the Government\u2019s explanations concerning the disclosure of the case file insufficient to justify the withholding of the key information requested.

However, despite the fact that the investigation established the whereabouts of Isa Kaplanov and Ruslan Sadulayev after their apprehension and obtained information about the persons who took them to and from the Staropromyslovskiy VOVD, no meaningful investigative measures were taken in the following three years, and on 15\u00a0July 2004 the investigation was inexplicably discontinued on the ground of a lack of evidence that a criminal offence had been committed.",

However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta\u00a0v. Italy [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 20, ECHR 2001-I; Akdivar and Others v.

In particular, the Assanidze judgment ordered the respondent State to secure the applicant\u2019s release so as to put an end to the violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and Article 6 \u00a7 1, whereas in the Tahsin Acar\u00a0judgment the effective investigation was mentioned in the context of the Court\u2019s examination of the respondent Government\u2019s request for the application to be struck out on the basis of their unilateral declaration. The Court further notes its above finding that in the present case the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined at its early stages by the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to take meaningful investigative measures (see paragraphs 114-118 above). It is therefore very doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could be restored. In such circumstances, having regard to the established principles cited above and the Government\u2019s argument that the investigation is currently under way, the Court finds it most appropriate to leave it to the respondent Government to choose the means to be used in the domestic legal order in order to discharge their legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention.",
