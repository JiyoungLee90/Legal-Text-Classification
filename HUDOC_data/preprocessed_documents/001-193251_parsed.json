The Code of Criminal Procedure allows for evidence to be gathered by means of secret surveillance. Considering the gravity of the offence, the interests of protecting the legal order, and the fact that gathering evidence by other procedural means is either impossible or especially complicated, then, in the interests of elucidating the truth, the application is perfectly justified and lawful.\u201d The other authorisations by preliminary investigation judges included variations of the same wording, occasionally also including references such as \u201cwhen public officials abuse their position, it damages their credibility in the eyes of society and damages the State\u2019s reputation\u201d and \u201c[t]his offence belongs to the category of offences relating to office. ...

In May 2009 dates for hearings in November and December 2009 and January, February, April, May and June 2010 were scheduled. Further dates were scheduled in February 2010 (for dates in September and October 2010), in June 2010 (for dates in December 2010 and February and April 2011), in April 2011 (for dates in October, November and December 2011), in November 2011 (for dates in December 2011 and January, February, April and May 2012), in December 2011 (for dates in January and February 2012), and in February 2012 (for dates in March 2012). At the request of some representatives, hearings were not scheduled to take place more than three days a week. The court also took into account the representatives\u2019 wishes that hearings not be scheduled too far in advance, as they were simultaneously involved in other criminal proceedings and therefore not always available. At the end of each hearing day, considering the evidence that was to be examined the following day, the court determined which of the accused and their representatives should appear at court the following day. This allowed persons who were not concerned by such evidence not to attend the particular hearing. Occasionally, hearings had to be rescheduled owing to illness or owing to other personal circumstances of either the accused or their representatives. In November 2009 the court noted that there was a risk that the proceedings might take too long, and decided that the number of witnesses to be heard each day must be increased.",

Complex schemes had been used to commit the offences in question, and the activities of the accused had involved a high level of conspiracy. This had made the collection of evidence concerning the offences difficult and the analysis of the (circumstancial) evidence time-consuming. Numerous witnesses had been heard during the pre-trial proceedings and in court (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). The proceedings before the court of first instance had entailed hearings over the course of ninety-two days, and this also indicated how many questions had needed to be addressed and how complex the questions had been.",

Rather, the lower courts had attempted to guarantee that the proceedings would not last an excessively long time. Some procedural flexibility had been lost due to the fact that the first-instance court had allowed the accused who had not been directly concerned by particular questions and evidence to be absent from the hearings altogether (see paragraph 17 above). At the same time, this had alleviated the effect of the proceedings on the accused, and had therefore been justified. The Supreme Court admitted that the organisation of the court hearings at first instance (not planning hearings sufficiently far in advance and not deciding on procedural matters quickly enough, thus allowing for long disputes between the parties), the volume and structure of the criminal file, and the presentation of the statement of charges (which had entailed unnecessary repetition and the structure of which had been illogical to some extent) might have added to the duration of the proceedings. However, the court noted that the defence representatives had opposed hearings being planned in advance, and in that regard they too had to be considered responsible. Furthermore, although it might have been reasonable for the prosecution to remove some of the material from the criminal file, the Supreme Court also considered that it had been for the defence representatives and not for the prosecution to decide whether some of the evidence in the criminal file was relevant from the perspective of the defence. The presentation of the statement of charges had not hindered defence rights either. As for separating the criminal case of E.T. from the rest of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 79 below), the Supreme Court considered that this had related to only one of the charges against the third applicant and the first applicant company, and the latter\u2019s counsel had not objected to the separation. Accordingly, the decision not to separate the case of E.T. from the rest of the proceedings could not be considered justified. In conclusion, the Supreme Court found that although some time might have been lost owing to the above-mentioned issues, the overall loss of time had been relatively insignificant in the context of the total duration of the proceedings.",

Therefore, the fact that, at the appeal stage, hearings had only taken place six months after the Court of Appeal had started planning the relevant dates (see paragraph 21 above) could not be held against the applicants.

That meant that, in accordance with Article 110 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP (see paragraph 45 below), authorisation decisions had to contain reasoning as to why the issuing court found that there was probable cause to believe that an offence had been committed, and why it was impossible, or especially complicated, to collect evidence by other means (the principle of ultima ratio). That reasoning could not be merely declaratory. The necessary reasoning could, however, rely on general criminological knowledge, for example knowledge concerning the nature of organised crime, the high level of conspiracy involved in the case in question, a presumed lack of witnesses willing to give statements, and so on. In any event, the reasoning had to be linked to the evidence in that particular case. Owing to time pressure and the likely fragmentary nature of information available at the time, the duty to provide reasons was less extensive when authorising secret surveillance than when deciding to convict a person.",

This was so because the investigating authority was not competent to assess the adequacy of reasoning. It had the right to rely on the operative part of a decision authorising surveillance activities. Therefore, the failure to give proper reasons for a decision authorising surveillance activities did not result in the inadmissibility of evidence thereby collected. The Supreme Court reasoned that it was not only during the authorisation stage that the ultima ratio nature of the secret surveillance measures could be examined. In fact, regardless of the existence of earlier decisions authorising surveillance activities, courts subsequently hearing a criminal case also had an obligation to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the authorisation decisions had been fulfilled at the time the decisions had been issued. If necessary, the courts could then declare the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible.

He found that the Supreme Court had altered its earlier practice by \u201cif not 180 degrees, then 160 degrees\u201d by accepting that the lack of reasoning in the relevant decisions could not be equated to a lack of authorisation. Up until that judgment, it had been established case-law that, in accordance with Article 111 of the CCrP, violating the ultima ratio principle when issuing secret surveillance authorisations also inevitably meant that the evidence thereby obtained was inadmissible. In the instant case, the Supreme Court had distinguished between \u201cgranting authorisation for secret surveillance activities\u201d and \u201cobtaining evidence via secret surveillance activities\u201d, and had stated that a violation of law during the authorisation stage could not affect the admissibility of evidence.",

Against that background, the legislature had created a system of safeguards. The central part of those safeguards was the requirement that measures which interfered with fundamental rights particularly severely (those mentioned in Articles 116, 118 and 119 of the CCrP) be taken only when authorised under Article 114 of the CCrP by a preliminary investigation judge. The same observation was reiterated in judgment no.\u00a031-1-10-11, dated 1 July 2011. The Supreme Court also stressed that all parties to criminal proceedings had to have the opportunity to verify whether the requirements of the law had been followed when evidence had been obtained via secret surveillance. Courts could therefore not dismiss an application to review the lawfulness of surveillance measures. This did not exclude the possibility of courts conducting such a review of their own motion, if the relevant suspicion arose. In the course of the review, the domestic courts had to verify, first and foremost, whether the required authorisations had existed, and whether the evidence had been obtained via authorised measures and within the authorised time period. The courts\u2019 obligation to conduct a review of the lawfulness of secret surveillance activities was also stressed in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgments no.\u00a03118108, dated 23 February 2009, and no. 3-1-1-31-11, dated 28\u00a0April 2011.",

It stressed that granting the authorisation orally inevitably meant that the preliminary investigation judge had not familiarised himself with the written documents forming the basis of the application for authorisation. This, in turn, made it more difficult, if not impossible, for the court to verify whether the preconditions, including the ultima ratio principle, set out in Article 110 of the CCrP had been met.",

The Tartu Court of Appeal found that an authorisation decision could not be based on merely declaratory statements, and its findings (including with regard to the ultima ratio requirement) had to be linked to concrete evidentiary material. In any event, it was unacceptable for authorisation merely to refer to a prosecutor\u2019s application and state that the judge considered it justified. The court stressed that the more possibilities the State had to interfere with persons\u2019 fundamental rights, the more responsible the State had to be in order to avoid unwarranted interferences. In this case, the Tartu Court of Appeal agreed with the reasoning of the first-instance court, finding that the authorisation decisions in the case at hand had not been sufficiently reasoned and had not satisfied the ultima ratio requirement. The surveillance activities had therefore been unlawful and the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible. That judgment became final on 19 February 2014. Based on the findings in that case, the applicant lodged a claim for damages (see paragraph 69 below).",

The person who had been subject to secret surveillance had been notified of this and had been provided with access to the surveillance documents, including the authorisations to conduct secret surveillance. Following that, the person had lodged an appeal, asking for those surveillance activities to be declared unlawful. In its judgment of 16\u00a0December 2014, the Supreme Court found that there had been insufficient reasons for the surveillance activities, despite the fact that they had been authorised by a preliminary investigation judge under Article 110 of the CCrP. Referring to its recent judgment in case (no. 3-1-1-14-14), the Supreme Court went on to explain that insufficient reasoning, albeit in breach of a procedural requirement, did not automatically render surveillance activity itself unlawful. The court examining the criminal case or complaint challenging the decisions authorising the surveillance activity (as in the instant case) was obliged, despite the existence of previous authorisation, to verify whether the material requirements set out in Article\u00a0110 of the CCrP had been satisfied. After analysing the reasoning provided in the authorisation decisions and examining the relevant criminal file, the Supreme Court concluded that the authorisations had not been in accordance with the ultima ratio principle, and thus had been unlawful.",

In a judgment of 13 June 2016, the Supreme Court found that as the surveillance activities in question had already been declared unlawful, the damage caused by them fell under section 7(1) of the Act on Compensation for Damage Caused in Criminal Proceedings. The violation of a person\u2019s home or private life or the confidentiality of his or her messages constituted grounds for compensating for non-pecuniary damage (section 11(2) of the same Act). Non-pecuniary damage was presumed (first sentence of section 11(3) of the same Act). The Supreme Court also stressed that in the event that a criminal court had already adjudicated upon the (un)lawfulness of certain measures taken in criminal proceedings and that judgment had become final, such conclusions were binding for the administrative court deciding on compensation. The court reiterated that it was only in exceptional circumstances, where a person had not had the opportunity to ask for the lawfulness of procedural measures to be assessed in the so-called main proceedings, that a court adjudicating upon the compensation claim was competent to assess the lawfulness of actions or orders taken in criminal proceedings.",

As for the applicants\u2019 criticism about the delay resulting from the failure to schedule hearings at appellate level, the Court notes that the Supreme Court specifically explained that it had not been possible to find hearing dates that suited all of the applicants\u2019 representatives (see paragraphs 21 and 32 above).

At the same time, it notes that although the Harju County Court \u2013 being aware of the risk of excessively long proceedings \u2013 took steps to speed up the proceedings (see paragraph 17 above regarding hearing witnesses), the decisions to limit hearings to three days a week, not to plan hearings more than a year in advance and to grant flexibility to the defence representatives as regards appearing in court were taken either at the request of the applicants or in their interests. As to the criticism expressed regarding the quality of the statement of charges, the composition of the criminal file and \u2013 as raised by the applicants \u2013 the reclassification of the offence as offering and accepting gratuities rather than bribery, the Court does not find that any of these acts, viewed against the wider background of the proceedings, contributed to the length of the proceedings to such an extent as to be decisive on their own. Although separating E.T.\u2019s case from the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above) would feasibly have had an impact on the length of the proceedings against her, the Court cannot speculate about the possible impact this could have had on the duration of the proceedings against the applicants. As noted above, the separation of the first applicant\u2019s case from the rest of the proceedings was opposed by other applicants\u2019 representatives (see paragraphs 18 above). In any event, as noted by the Government and not contested by the first applicant, he did not raise that matter before the Supreme Court (see paragraph 85 above).",

They asserted that under Article\u00a0145 of the CCrP, decisions authorising secret surveillance had to be reasoned. As the decisions in question had not been sufficiently reasoned, the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights could not have been \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and had failed to satisfy the foreseeability requirement. In that regard, it was of no relevance that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had been taken only after the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Dragojevi\u0107. Furthermore, referring to the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg, the Supreme Court judge (see paragraph 41 above), they argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s solution of retrospectively providing reasoning for authorisation decisions opened a door to arbitrariness, and had been a radical reversal of the Supreme Court\u2019s previous approach.",

This, in turn, meant that the authorisations had not been in accordance with the law. In support of his argument, he pointed to the modification of the relevant regulation as of 1 January 2013 (see paragraph\u00a053 above), a modification which meant that having insufficient reasoning when granting secret surveillance authorisations would result in evidence being declared inadmissible. The second applicant disagreed with the Supreme Court\u2019s line of argument that insufficient reasoning in authorisation decisions could not be equated to a lack of authorisation as such. He considered that this departed from the Supreme Court\u2019s previous case-law. In that regard, he relied on the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg (see paragraph 41 above). In the Dragojevi\u0107 case, there had been no established domestic case-law on the matter in Croatia. However, in the instant case, despite the fact that there had been domestic case-law, the Supreme Court had started to retrospectively justify the necessity of secret surveillance. The second applicant doubted the necessity of the secret surveillance in his case, and doubted that the Supreme Court had considered the private life aspect when assessing the admissibility of evidence obtained via secret surveillance. He noted that the Government had not provided any case-law examples of other remedies which could have allowed privacy concerns to be addressed before the domestic courts (see paragraph 124 below).",

This applied to cases where the courts were called upon to verify whether the preconditions for authorising surveillance measures had been fulfilled (for example by assessing whether there had been written authorisation, see paragraph 60 above), or where the courts performed checks on whether the surveillance activities carried out had indeed been in accordance with such authorisation. The Government pointed to the domestic case-law whereby the Supreme Court had declared secret surveillance authorisations unlawful once it had found \u2013 as a result of an ex post facto review \u2013 that at the time the authorisations had been granted, the ultima ratio principle had not been complied with (see paragraph 62 above). The relevant authorities were aware that insufficient reasoning in authorisations could render the ex post facto verification of adherence to the ultima ratio principle impossible, and thus result in the inadmissibility of evidence.

The Government confirmed that such remedies existed in Estonia. It had been open to the applicants to contest the relevant authorisations themselves, as well as the activities carried out on the basis of those authorisations, once they had been notified of the secret surveillance or had otherwise become aware of it (that is, at the latest, when the criminal file had been presented to them). This could have been done in the pre-trial proceedings (as regards the prosecutors\u2019 authorisations, see paragraphs 50, 51 and 54 above) or alternatively during the court proceedings (as regards both the prosecutors\u2019 authorisations and those issued by the preliminary investigation judge). The domestic courts could then have declared either the authorisations or the actions based on the authorisations unlawful, and the applicants could have lodged an application for compensation for non-pecuniary damage with an administrative court (before 1 May 2015, see paragraphs 66 to 68 above) or with a county court (after 1 May 2015, under the Act on Compensation for Damage Caused in Criminal Proceedings, see paragraphs 68 and 69 above).

In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance for the protection of national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there exist guarantees against abuse which are adequate and effective. This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 232). Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual\u2019s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his or her own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his or her rights (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 233).",

It admits that in the particular context of the Estonian court system, where the Supreme Court may also function as a court which conducts constitutional review, the Supreme Court did indeed assess whether the secret surveillance in respect of the applicants had been proportionate. The Government also provided an overview of the potential remedies that the applicants could have used to address their Article 8 concerns, notably the possibility to claim compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. However, the Court notes that the Government did not provide any examples of case-law where the fact that secret surveillance authorisation had not contained sufficient reasons as required under domestic case law had been considered grounds for awarding damages. In that regard, the Government also admitted that such a claim\u2019s prospects of success could not be predicted.",

It was exactly this practice of circumventing the requirement to provide reasons at the initial authorisation stage and accepting that they could also be provided later during the proceedings which opened a door to arbitrariness contrary to the guarantees under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court cannot but find that the same concern is also at the heart of the instant case. This is so regardless of whether the prior domestic case-law was contradictory, or whether the possibility of retrospective reasoning was first introduced only in the context of the case at hand.",
