However the applicant never requested an oral hearing. The Government added that Law no. 466 was intended to provide for a special procedure for compensating individuals who have been unlawfully apprehended or detained. The aim of the law was to allow compensation claims to be examined on the basis of the case file and to avoid the delay and expense of an oral hearing.
