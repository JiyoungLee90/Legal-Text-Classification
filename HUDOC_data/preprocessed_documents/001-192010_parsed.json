The repeated characterisation of Mrs\u00a0G. as \u201cBonnie\u201d created, therefore, the impression that Mrs\u00a0G. had participated in the offences of Mr\u00a0R.

Finally, the Government contended that in view of the relatively low amount of compensation the applicant company was ordered to pay, the Austrian courts\u2019 decisions could not be regarded as disproportionate either. As to the injunction issued under the Copyright Act, the Government further commented that Mrs\u00a0G. was pilloried by the publication of her picture as she had not been a \u2018person in public life\u2019 before.

It remains to be assessed whether they were reasonable as to quantum. The Court observes in particular that the present case comprised two sets of proceedings, namely proceedings concerning the interim injunction and, subsequently, the main proceedings including several oral hearings. Both sets of proceedings were conducted before three instances. The Court, therefore, accepts that the applicant company\u2019s costs in the domestic proceedings were higher than the costs of the applicants in other comparable cases, which varied between 5,684.8\u00a0EUR and 10,997.385 EUR according to the circumstances (see Krone\u00a0Verlag GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no. 34315/96, 26 February\u00a02002 and News Verlags GmbH & Co.KG v. Austria, no. 31457/96, ECHR 2000I; both concerning injunction proceedings under the Copyright Act). Nevertheless, it considers that the costs claimed are excessive. It therefore awards an amount of 13,000 EUR in this respect.",
