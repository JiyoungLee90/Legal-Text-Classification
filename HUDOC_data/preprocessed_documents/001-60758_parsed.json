Italy (see the judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no.\u00a0315-B), in which the Court held that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The interference with the applicant\u2019s right to the peaceful enjoyment of her property was therefore consistent with the relevant legislation. The Government concluded that the burden imposed on the applicant had not been excessive. The Government pointed out that the statutory measures had been taken in the general interest to protect tenants, regard being had to the inner-city housing crisis and the difficulty in providing adequate housing for low-income tenants who have been evicted. The Government added that a large number of leases had expired in 1982 and 1983 and that the simultaneous execution of repossession orders in respect of all the premises concerned would have resulted in severe social unrest. The purpose of the measures in issue had therefore been to maintain order. It had been necessary to stagger the provision of police assistance because it was impossible to guarantee everyone assistance at the same time.",
