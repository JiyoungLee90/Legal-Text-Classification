In addition to citing the seriousness of the charges as a reason underlying the applicant\u2019s remand in custody, the domestic authorities, in the present case, considered that the applicant might abscond or interfere with the administration of justice owing to a lack of employment or a known place of residence. The Court might accept these grounds as relevant. However, it cannot find them decisive given that the judicial decisions authorising the applicant\u2019s detention remained silent as to why those risks could not have been offset by any other means of ensuring his appearance at trial.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that it has repeatedly considered the practice of shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters to be tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, and Rokhlina v.

Nevertheless, the Court has consistently found the authorities\u2019 failure to justify such short periods of detention to be in contravention of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see, for example, Belchev v.

They further noted that the Russian rules of criminal procedure contained a strict and exhaustive list of circumstances which permitted the detention of a suspect or accused. Under Russian law, remand in custody during criminal proceedings was an extraordinary measure which could be imposed only if alternative preventive measures could not be applied. In recent years, the Russian Federation had adopted a series of measures aimed at liberalisation of criminal policy.

This had resulted in a stable reduction in the number of persons detained in remand prisons. Whilst in 2006 there were 386,800\u00a0inmates held in custody in remand prisons, in 2012 the number dropped by 29.8% to 271,200. Similarly, the number of applications for the defendants\u2019 remand in custody submitted by investigating authorities dropped by 27.1% from 208,400 in 2009 to 152,000 in 2011. Furthermore, there could be traced a clear decline in the number of applications for remand in custody granted by domestic courts. Whilst in 2009 the courts granted 187,800 applications, in 2011 that number dropped by 27.7% to 135,900. The same tendency could be sees in respect of the extensions of pre-trial detention. In 2009 the courts considered 212,800 applications for extension. In 2011 the number of such applications dropped by 15.3% to 180,300. The number of applications for extension granted by the courts also declined by 15.3% from 208,800 in 2009 to 180,300 in 2011. There was a clear tendency of a more weighted approach in consideration of appeals against detention orders by appeal courts. In the first half of 2012, the appeal courts considered 9,300 appeals. They quashed 423 detention orders and modified 479 of them. As a result, 8 defendants were released on bail and 19 defendants were transferred to house arrest.",
