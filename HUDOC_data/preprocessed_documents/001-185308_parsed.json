In this connection, it notes that Article 457 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Netherlands Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the possibility of revision (herziening) by the Supreme Court of a conviction where it has been determined in a ruling of the Court that there has been a violation of the Convention or one of its Protocols, as the case may be, in proceedings that have led to the conviction, or a conviction of the same crime, if revision is necessary with a view to reparation within the meaning of Article 41 of the Convention.",

Russia, no. 2257/12, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 12 December 2017). It reiterates that the payment of monetary awards under Article 41 is designed to make reparation only for such consequences of a violation that cannot be remedied otherwise (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], \nnos.  and , \u00a7 250, ECHR 2000VIII). The Court concludes that reopening of the proceedings is the most appropriate form of redress for the established violation of the applicant\u2019s rights, should he request it, given that it is capable of providing restitutio in integrum as required under Article 41 of the Convention. Therefore, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction in the present case.",
