Rather, her statements were a critical comment on the drug policy of another political party, and could not be understood as an attack on the plaintiffs\u2019 reputation. In any event, the IPM itself had repeatedly made public statements on AIDS prevention as well as on drug policy, and the applicant was therefore entitled to comment on that. Finally, the applicant submitted that the statements at issue were value judgments. This opinion was not shared by the Austrian courts, which qualified them as statements of fact, the truth of which had to be proved. Nevertheless, she had offered evidence to prove their truth, but the Austrian courts had refused it. Thus, it was not her fault that she had not succeeded in proving the truth of her statements. ",
