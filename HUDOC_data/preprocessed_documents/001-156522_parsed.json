They first explained that the incident in question was to be regarded as a one-off act which had not produced any permanent consequences or a continuous situation. The Government further referred to the Court\u2019s case-law, according to which in the absence of an effective remedy the six-month time-limit begins to run from the moment the event complained of occurs. That was precisely the situation in the present case, where the applicants complained that the response by the domestic authorities to the incident of 1\u00a0February 2011 had not been appropriate.",

That being so, the Court finds it sufficient to note that the penal order of 19 April 2011, whereby the first applicant\u2019s father was sentenced to a fine, was set aside and that the criminal proceedings against him are still pending (see paragraphs 37 and 51 above).

Children and other vulnerable individuals, in particular, are entitled to State protection, in the form of effective deterrence, against such serious breaches of personal integrity (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 22, and Opuz v.

It follows that its refusal to order the drastic measure proposed by the second applicant (see in this connection points 40-42 of General Comment no. 8 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in paragraph 96 above) was based on the absence of sufficient proof that the abuse had taken place and after careful consideration of all relevant materials (see, mutatis mutandis, M.P. and Others v.

It notes that the County Court had in its decision of 15\u00a0November 2013 instructed the Municipal Court to assess whether the first applicant was able to understand the importance of the proceedings and, if so, allow her to express her opinion and take a statement from her (see paragraph 77 above), although there was nothing to call into question the presumption that the first applicant \u2013 who was at the time twelve years old \u2013 was capable of forming her own views and expressing them (see paragraph 20 of the General Comment No. 12 (2009) on the right of the child to be heard, in paragraph 97 above). In any event, more than a year and seven months have passed without steps being taken to comply even with that instruction. What is even more surprising is that no steps have been taken to accelerate the proceedings even after the first applicant started exhibiting self-harming behaviour.",

Those experts also established that the first applicant expressed a strong wish to live with her mother (see paragraph 69 above). The Court further observes that both her parents live in the same town, and that a reversal of the custody order would therefore not entail the first applicant having to change school or otherwise be removed from her habitual social environment. Moreover, the first applicant, who is an A-grade pupil and whom the experts viewed as being of good or even above-average intellectual capacities (see paragraphs 19-20 above), was nine and a half years old at the start of the proceedings and is now thirteen and a half. It would thus be difficult to argue that, given her age and maturity, she is not capable of forming her own views and expressing them freely. The Court therefore finds that not respecting her wishes as regards the issue of which parent to live with would, in the specific circumstances of the present case, constitute an infringement of her right to respect for private and family life.",

Therefore, in the majority\u2019s view, the daughter\u2019s complaints under Article 8 are absorbed by her claims under Article 3 (see paragraphs\u00a0140-43).",

The manipulation of common children and (false) accusations of child abuse are very frequent in highly conflictual relationships between separated parents and are often instrumental in custody battles for the children. In this connection we note that in the period between 5 July 2006 and 7 March 2008 altogether eight criminal complaints were filed against the mother and the father, most of which they filed against each other. Five criminal complaints were dismissed, including the three in which it was alleged that criminal offences of child abuse and domestic violence had been committed against the daughter (see paragraph 9 of the judgment). It is also revealing that the mother insisted that the father be prosecuted and convicted specifically for the criminal offence of child abuse even though the conduct the applicants had accused him of could also be regarded as a criminal or minor offence of domestic violence, or as a criminal offence of bodily injury (for which he was being prosecuted).",

It is also noteworthy that it has not yet been established by a final judicial decision whether or not the daughter\u2019s eye injury was inflicted by the father during the incident of 11 February 2011 (see paragraphs 35-51 of the judgment).",

Here, the judgment refers to the local social welfare centre\u2019s assessment of 12 May 2011 that the daughter was not at risk; the refusal of the first-instance court on 7 June 2011 to grant the mother\u2019s request for provisional measures, due to the absence of sufficient proof that abuse had taken place; and the combined report from forensic experts in psychiatry and psychology of 19 December 2011 stating that there were no contraindications for the daughter to remain living with her father.",
