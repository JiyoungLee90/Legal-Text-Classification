As long as there is some meaningful contact between families and the authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a time when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be, provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case.

The applicant submitted further information to the authorities by providing a statement to the official investigation. During the initial stage of the criminal proceedings which opened in August 2001 the authorities took several steps, including questioning the applicant and obtaining official police confirmation that her son had been detained on their premises (see paragraphs 13 and 16 above). Then in February 2002 the investigation was suspended; the applicant, who had been granted victim status in the criminal case, was not informed of that decision. Having no information on the progress of the proceedings, in May 2008, that is in six years and three months after the suspension, the applicant asked for permission to familiarise herself with the contents of the investigation file (see paragraph 18 above). Once she had seen the file, the applicant sought free legal counsel (a pro bono lawyer) and with the lawyer\u2019s assistance asked for a number of steps to be taken to expedite the search for her disappeared son. Following her request, the authorities took steps to obtain evidence, including taking statements from her, three of her family members and two police officers (see paragraphs 23-26 and 33 above). Subsequently the applicant\u2019s counsel continued to request information on the progress of the investigation (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).",
