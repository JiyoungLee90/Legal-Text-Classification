With reference to the fact that M.S. failed to return on 20 October 2008 (the date agreed with the applicant), the court noted that she had been granted temporary custody over her children for the duration of the divorce proceedings. When the interim order was delivered, that is between 4 and 20 October 2008, the children remained in Poland with their father\u2019s consent. Consequently, M.S. could have decided to stay in Poland also after 20 October 2008 and there had been no wrongful retention in the case.",

It also noted that when M.S. had discovered that the applicant\u2019s new partner had been pregnant, she had decided to institute divorce proceedings. However, she had been informed by a Swiss lawyer that in view of the applicant\u2019s lack of consent to a divorce, she could only have filed a petition in Switzerland after two years of separation. For these reasons she had decided to file a petition for divorce with the Polish courts. The court further noted that on 4\u00a0October 2008 M.S. had arrived in Krak\u00f3w with her children in order to spend two weeks of school holidays there, after having obtained the applicant\u2019s consent for their trip. The court further stressed that M.S. decided to stay in Poland permanently only when she was granted temporary custody. Consequently, in the court\u2019s opinion the removal of the children was not a wrongful removal within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention.",

The Convention\u2019s true nature is revealed most clearly in these situations: it is not concerned with establishing the person to whom custody of the child will belong at some point in the future, nor with the situations in which it may prove necessary to modify a decision awarding joint custody on the basis of facts which have subsequently changed. It seeks, more simply, to prevent a later decision on the matter being influenced by a change of circumstances brought about through unilateral action by one of the parties.\u201d",

The First Commission initially adopted a provision which gave absolute priority to the application of the Convention, by making the duty to return the child prevail over any other decision on custody, which had been issued or was likely to be issued in the requested State. At the same time, it accepted the possibility of a reservation allowing the return of the child to be refused, when its return was shown to be incompatible with a decision existing in the State of refuge, prior to the \u2018abduction\u2019. The current text is therefore the result of a compromise which was reached in order to eliminate a reservation in the Convention, without at the same time reducing the extent of its acceptability to the States. In this way, the original provision was recast by emphasizing that the sole fact that a decision existed would not of itself prevent the return of the child, and by allowing judges to take into consideration the reasons for this decision in coming to a decision themselves on the application for the child\u2019s return.",

Consequently, the competent authority of the requested State will have to regard the application for the child\u2019s return as proof of the fact that a new factor has been introduced which obliges it to reconsider a decision which has not been put into effect, or which was taken on the basis of exorbitant grounds of jurisdiction, or else failed to have regard to the right of all the parties concerned to state their case. Moreover, since the decision on the return of the child is not concerned with the merits of custody rights, the reasons for the decision which may be taken into consideration are limited to those which concern \u2018the application of the Convention\u2019. A situation brought about by a decision issued by the authorities of the State of a child\u2019s habitual residence prior to its \u2018abduction\u2019 and which granted custody to the \u2018abductor\u2019, would normally be resolved by applying article 3 of the Convention, since the existence of a claimed right to custody must be understood in accordance with the law of that State.\u201d",

She promised to return with them on 20 October 2008. The applicant had agreed for them leaving Switzerland for that purpose and consented to the travelling dates. Hence, the Court can accept that the children\u2019s removal could reasonably be regarded as not being in breach of Article 3 of the Hague Convention and that the domestic courts did not err in law in referring to the applicant\u2019s agreement and considering that the removal as such, in the light of that agreement, was not \u201cwrongful\u201d in the sense of the Hague Convention, as explained in the Explanatory Report.",

The Court cannot overlook that already prior to leaving Switzerland on 4 October 2008 the children\u2019s mother had already lodged, on 24 September 2008, a petition to divorce and applied for an interim custody order. She had also informed the court that she would be in Krak\u00f3w after 4 October 2008. Subsequently, on 15\u00a0October 2008 she obtained that order.",

They reached this conclusion referring to two factors: firstly, to the applicant\u2019s prior agreement to the trip to Poland, and secondly, to the interim custody order given by the Polish courts at the mother\u2019s request during that trip. It was that order which, in the view of the Polish courts, stripped the children\u2019s retention of its wrongful character. However, it was not in dispute either before the domestic courts nor before the Court that prior to their leaving for Poland for what was originally planned as two-week holiday the children had habitual residence in Switzerland. Nor was it disputed that the applicant and M.S. jointly exercised custody rights over them under the law of that state (see paragraphs 6, 8 and 21 above). The Court also attaches weight in this respect to the relevant information contained in the letter of the Swiss Central Authority of 13 March 2009 (see paragraph 21 above).",

Under the terms of the Hague Convention Hague Convention the wrongfulness of the removal and retention derives from the fact that such action has interfered with the normal exercise of the parental rights of one of their holders under the law of the State where the children previously had their habitual residence (that is, in the present case Switzerland), not under the law of the requested State (that is, in the present case, Poland). Yet, in the present case the Polish courts ignored the law of the previous habitual residence of the children and instead relied on their own law, that is the law of the requested State. In so doing, the Polish courts did not take this aspect of the case into consideration and, as a result of the mother\u2019s unilateral act, the applicant was deprived of the protection he could reasonably expect to enjoy under its provisions.\u201d",

The Hague Convention recognises this fact because it provides for a whole series of measures to ensure the immediate return of children removed to or wrongfully retained in any Contracting State. Indeed, Article 11 of the Hague Convention imposes a six-week time-limit for the required decision, failing which the decision body may be requested to give reasons for the delay (Raw and Others v. France, no. 10131/11, \u00a7 83, 7 March 2013; M.A. v.\u00a0Austria, no. 4097/13, \u00a7 109, 15 January 2015).

She found herself completely isolated but did not abandon hope that her husband might return to her. Matters reached a crisis point when the applicant\u2019s partner became pregnant. As established in the divorce proceedings, the applicant placed his wife in a very vulnerable position. He closed his own bank account and deactivated his wife\u2019s credit card. He announced to his wife that their savings amounting to 80,000 Swiss francs (CHF) would be divided into two parts but that she would receive only CHF 9,000 to 10,000. Then the applicant ordered his wife to quit their flat and move into a two-bedroom apartment.

The domestic court may then reasonably decide that ordering the return of the children would place them in an intolerable situation and expose them to psychological harm. Such a course of action is open to it under Article\u00a013 (b) of the 1980 Hague Convention. Once it has so decided, it is duty bound to examine the substance of the matter in relation to the custody proceedings for the purpose of deciding whether or not it should make a custody order. The making of such an order is entirely consistent with the 1980 Hague Convention, whose importance as a jurisdiction-selection treaty is not thereby undermined. Such a situation is to be contrasted with cases falling within the Brussels IIa Regulation, where, under European Union law, the principle of \u201cmutual trust\u201d prevails whatever the circumstances may be: see Povse v. Austria (dec.), no. 3811/11, 18 June 2013; and see also, by analogy, the ECJ judgment in the case of Melloni, C399/11, EU:C\u00a02013,\u00a0107.",

In the circumstances already described it may, understandably, have seemed inconceivable that while the mother remained in Poland, since she had no viable alternative for selffulfilment in Switzerland, her children should be sent back to Switzerland without their mother and wait there for a decision of a Swiss court on the matter of custody.",

There is nothing to show that this exercise was not carried out correctly. In the context of the applicant\u2019s very hostile attitude towards his wife and the trauma suffered by the children because of their father\u2019s behaviour, it was legitimate to consider that the best interests of the children would not be served by their immediate return to Switzerland. To say that the decision not to return the children to Switzerland so that they could stay with their mother in Poland fell within the ambit of exceptions to the principle of returning the child provided for in the 1980 Hague Convention is not an unjustified conclusion.",

Moreover, the applicant did appeal against the provisional order of 15 October 2008 and his right to be heard was fully respected on appeal. There is no evidence that in his appeal he complained of an infringement of his right to be heard. In any event, the applicant was notified about the proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention and was able to present his case before the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction.
