However, it is not convinced that, as has also been argued by the Government, it was the applicant\u2019s attitude and conduct, and not his nationality, which was decisive for the refusal of the only therapeutic measures considered advisable by the psychiatric expert and the . It notes, in particular, that under the administrative practice relating to section 9 of the Execution of Sentences Act (see paragraph 46 above), prisoners against whom an enforceable expulsion order had been made were excluded from transfer to a social therapeutic institution and that this practice was apparently applied in the applicant\u2019s case. Having regard to all the material in its possession, the Court considers that, irrespective of his conduct and of further requests for such measures, the applicant would not have been granted the measures in question in view of the final expulsion order against him. The Court would add that, this situation having been made clear to the applicant, there must have been little incentive for him to bring about a change in his attitude as even after such a change, he would not have been considered eligible for the measures at issue.",

The refusal to grant relaxations in the conditions of detention to foreign nationals against whom a final expulsion order has been made appears to be to prevent them from absconding prior to having served their term of imprisonment and to secure the execution of the expulsion order afterwards. The aims pursued thus included securing the execution of final decisions of the criminal courts and of expulsion orders made against offenders and reserving available therapies to those to whose needs they are most tailored. The Court will examine the case on the assumption that those aims were legitimate for the purposes of Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 5, in view of the following.",

It observes that the refusal to grant the applicant measures usually considered as important in order to obtain a suspension of the preventive detention order on probation were not compensated by offers of a different therapy or any other measures adapted to his situation.

That measure, which is only applicable to foreign nationals liable to be expelled and leads to them regaining their liberty in their country of origin, can in principle be considered as a measure favourable to foreign nationals and might thus compensate for disadvantages suffered in the execution of the preventive detention order against them.
