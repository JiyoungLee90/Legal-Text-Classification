The applicant also pointed out that during the trial he had actively attempted to suggest various ways of securing J.N.\u2019s presence at the trial but to no avail. The trial court had never fined J.N. for failure to comply with the court summons, nor had it ever attempted to reach J.N. by telephone although it had had her number. This had resulted in the incorrect application of Article 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which could not apply where a witness had received a court summons but had failed to appear without any reason.

As regards the questioning of J.N, the Government, referring to European Union Council Framework Decision no. 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, pointed out that she had given her statement when lodging the criminal complaint on 3 May 1999 and before the investigating judge on 9 July 1999. It had therefore been normal that she, as a victim of sexual abuse, had not wanted to go through the whole stressful experience again by testifying at the trial. The trial court, even prompted by the instruction of the Supreme Court, had attempted to reach J.N. by various means but to no avail, and therefore it had correctly applied Article 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in admitting her written statement as evidence. The applicant could at that point have raised an objection as to the veracity of her evidence but he had failed to do so. The Government also considered that J.N.\u2019s statement had been decisive but not the sole evidence against the applicant, and that there had been sufficient counterbalancing factors to secure his rights in the proceedings.

Germany, no. 33900/96, \u00a7 28, 20 December 2001) and, as regards the possibility of excusing a witness from testifying on grounds of fear, the trial court must be satisfied that all available alternatives, such as witness anonymity and other special measures, would be inappropriate or impracticable (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 125).",

However, the domestic authorities must take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, \u00a7 78, Series A no. 146); which means that they should actively search for the witnesses (see Rachdad v. France, no.\u00a071846/01, \u00a7 24, 13 November 2003). The Court therefore must satisfy itself that the domestic authorities did everything which was reasonable to secure the presence of the witness. In other words, the Court must establish whether the absence of the witness is imputable to the domestic authorities (see Tseber, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

It is true, as the applicant suggested, that the domestic courts never fined J.N. for not appearing at the trial (see Article 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, paragraph 56 above); nor did they contact her by telephone, although they had been provided with her telephone number (see paragraph 45 above), but there is no evidence that any of these measures would actually be effective in practice. Thus, in view of the domestic courts repeated attempts to summon J.N. at the trial and the fact that the domestic courts, including the Supreme Court, duly reviewed these efforts (see paragraph 51 above), the Court considers that the domestic authorities took reasonable measures to secure her presence (compare Tseber, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52).",

Moreover, the Supreme Court itself held that J.N.\u2019s evidence was decisive for the case (see paragraph 42 above). The Court must, therefore, examine whether the applicant was provided with an adequate opportunity to exercise his defence rights within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention in respect of the evidence given by J.N. In doing so, the Court will examine whether there were sufficient procedural safeguards and other factors capable of counterbalancing the fact that the defence could not question J.N. at the trial.",

The first instance court heard witnesses who could only provide evidence of a circumstantial nature in respect of the rape allegedly committed. One of those witnesses, J.M., testified in favour of the reliability of J.N.\u2019s evidence (see paragraph 22 above) and one witness, K.N., testified in the applicant\u2019s favour (see paragraphs 21, 36 and 48 above).

The reports on J.N.\u2019s gynaecological and psychiatric examination showed no objective evidence of any injuries (see paragraphs 8, 20 and 24 above).",
