In the Government\u2019s submission, however, this apparent limitation in the law has to be read in the light of the actual practice followed whereby the advice also extended to the issue of detention and was invariably followed by the referring officer (see paragraph 14, final sub-paragraph, above). This \"standard procedure\" meant, so it was argued, that the auditeur-militair in fact decided since his advice as to whether to detain or not was treated as a \"binding recommendation\" by the officer who had the formal power of decision.

Nonetheless, the Court, like the Commission (see paragraph 83 of the report), is unable to accept the Government\u2019s reasoning. Admittedly, in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, for example, in relation to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (art. 5-1), the Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, p. 20, \u00a7 38). However, formal, visible requirements stated in the \"law\" are especially important for the identification of the judicial authority empowered to decide on the liberty of the individual in view of the confidence which that authority must inspire in the public in a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, the Piersack judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, p. 14, \u00a7 30 (a)). There was no official directive or even policy instruction to auditeurs-militair and referring officers to interpret the Military Code in this way, only a purely internal practice of no binding force that could at any moment lawfully be departed from. That is not sufficient to constitute authority given by \"law\" to exercise the requisite \"judicial power\" contemplated by Article 5 \u00a7 3 (art. 5-3) (see the final part of the passage from the Schiesser judgment cited above at paragraph 32).",

The allegations there were that prejudice had been sustained in various forms during and because of the detention in question, including psychological and emotional injury, denial of sufficient possibilities for cultural and educational development, invasion of privacy and loss of employment opportunities and social reputation.

At the very least, each applicant did however forfeit the opportunity of a \"prompt\" judicial control of his detention. The applicants must have suffered, by reason of the absence of the relevant guarantees, some non-material prejudice not wholly compensated by the findings of violation or even by the deduction of the period spent in custody on remand from the sentence of imprisonment ultimately imposed (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van Droogenbroeck judgment of 25 April 1983, Series A no. 63, p. 7, \u00a7 13).
