The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, including, therefore, the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 23, \u00a7 38).",

In support of that allegation, the applicant cited a judgment delivered by the Athens Court of First Instance on 14 January 1997 in which the unit amount of compensation payable for the expropriation of land situated 150 m from the land in issue had been assessed at GRD 70,000 per square metre.",

However, the Court cannot fail to observe that in calculating the compensation the Court of Appeal took no account whatsoever of the excessive length of the proceedings. The applicant was not awarded any sum for the pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage which she and her family had sustained as a result of their being deprived of their property, without compensation, for seventy years; nor was she awarded any interest for delay. Furthermore, although the compensation was not paid until more than five years after the Court of Appeal had assessed the amount due, the applicant did not receive any additional interest for delay (see, mutatis mutandis, Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v.
