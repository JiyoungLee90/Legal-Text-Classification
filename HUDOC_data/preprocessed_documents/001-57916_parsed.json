The Court can discern no such contradiction. The revocation by the water-rights authority of first instance, which was upheld by the respondent authority, related - according to the terms of the formal order - to the 1973 licence without any restriction. Similarly, where in the reasons given for the Land Governor\u2019s decision of 5 December 1986 the words \u2018where the gravel pit has already been closed\u2019 are used when parcel 514-1 KG Theresienfeld is being particularised, they are merely taken from the decision of 30 July 1973 whereby the licence was granted. Moreover, the use of the expression \u2018part of the area\u2019 (Teilfl\u00e4che) merely clarifies - in the context of setting out the earlier history - the meaning which the same authority attributed to the outline description in the decision whereby the revoked licence had been granted. This is not a legally binding determination, nor does it in any way restrict the revocation itself, which at all events applied to the 1973 licence in its entirety, regardless of how the indication \u2018where the gravel pit has already been closed\u2019 - which is not more closely defined - is to be understood. It is accordingly clear, without it being necessary to go into the appeal submissions in detail, that neither the aforementioned comment in the decision at first instance nor the absence of any reference to these issues in the impugned decision amounted to an interference with the rights of the appellant.",

The Court agrees with the respondent authority and, on this point, the appellant that even where, as in the present case, a reservation of the right to revoke is not spelt out in more detail, revocation is justifiable only where there are sufficient objective reasons for it; these, however (and to this extent the Court\u2019s view does not coincide with the one reflected in the decision appealed against), could only derive from considerations of public interest, since the right to revoke was not reserved in the interests of third parties. Ultimately, the revocation of a decision under the Water Rights Act can only be regarded as objectively justified if it can be considered necessary within the meaning of the Act; and that applies only where it does not serve interests that can be asserted under provisions of the Water Rights Act without any specific need for a revocation.",

In the decision at first instance the remark relating to an increased risk of this kind plainly goes back to a finding - also cited in the reasons - by the officially appointed medical expert that, in view of its position in the central area of the Mitterndorf basin, the site of the refuse tip was to be rejected on health grounds and represented a potential hazard to the groundwater. The same expert referred to a comment by the officially appointed technical expert, who had stated that by present-day criteria a renewal of the licence for a refuse tip on this site was to be ruled out. In the decision appealed against, the site of the tip as such was likewise described as problematical on the basis of the experts\u2019 reports - in the expert opinion that is reproduced in the impugned decision it is stated that it was out of the question that areas where there were sources of groundwater suitable in quantity and quality for use as a water supply should be used for refuse tips - and the tipping of waste that endangered the groundwater was attributed to among other things the \u2018imprecise wording of the licence\u2019 of 1973. This last observation concerns the past, and the appellant cannot rely on the distinction between licensed and unlicensed tipping as set out in this Court\u2019s decision of 19 May 1987, no. 86/07/0147, to rebut it. This distinction was indeed recognised partly in contradiction of the view that had been advanced by the appellant\u2019s predecessor in title. It accordingly cannot be ruled out that, prior to publication of the court decision just mentioned, the operator of the tip disregarded the differences that are pointed out in it and which are of importance as regards authorised tipping of waste. As to the technical comments on the choice of site, however, these appear to the Court sufficient to justify the view that even authorised tipping was at least \u2018problematical\u2019 on the particular site.",

In the expert report reproduced in the decision appealed against, reference was also made to the fact that a considerable length of time passed between the moment of pollution and the first observable signs of harmful substances in the subsoil or in the groundwater, a fact that had previously been regarded as pointing to the subsoil\u2019s (only) seemingly unlimited cleansing and storing capacity and in many cases had led to an approach to the siting and licensing of refuse tips that would nowadays be regarded as untenable. The fear of adverse effects on the groundwater is thus not shown to be baseless - as the appellant\u2019s objection amounts to saying - by even a single finding.",

The appellant contended that this argument overlooked the fact that, according to the officially appointed technical expert\u2019s opinion of 21 October 1986 on the issue of a general clearing up of the site, it was assumed that hazardous waste discovered on the site was separable from the other waste; in the decision at first instance, moreover, such a mixing up was a mere supposition. Apart from the fact that in describing the two types of waste as being \u2018in practice\u2019 inseparable (as was assumed), account was clearly taken of the practical difficulties which were mentioned in the same expert opinion, with express reference to the need to establish \u2018a highly qualified water-supervision unit that must have appropriate facilities available to it for carrying out analyses and for the safe disposal of any hazardous waste\u2019, this observation concerning the past is in any case of no vital importance for the revocation, which has its effects in the future, preventing future dumping.",

The passages from the administrative file which the appellant cites in evidence in this connection do not, however, support that assertion. In the opinion submitted on 23 April 1985 the domestic refuse deposited on the site is described by the expert as posing a threat to the groundwater, independently of the barrels to be disposed of. In a letter of 28 May 1985 from the district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft), which is also referred to by the appellant, it was admittedly announced that the cleaning-up operation had been completed, but at the same time the issue of what was to be done with the domestic waste whose existence had originally not been known about was also addressed. In an expert opinion of 15 May 1985, likewise cited by the appellant, it was confirmed that digging works were being carried out in the western part of the pit, but it was also noted that domestic waste had been found there and that it could not be ruled out that chemicals had been buried with it; furthermore, the possibility of sealing the site without removing the waste was rejected on technical grounds and because of the danger that barrels had been buried with it. In the district authority\u2019s letter of 18 June 1986 it was stated that the domestic waste still remaining in the cleaned-up western area would be removed once the decision had been taken on cleaning up the entire site. Thus, it has not been made out that the western part of the site is free of any dangerous waste nor has the argument been refuted that further tipping of permissible waste, on top of the waste already on the site, must be stopped precisely for the purpose of removing that existing waste.",

Nor is a cleaning-up programme thereby pre-empted; such a programme may very well make special licences necessary; and even a partial continuation of the current tipping operations until a cleaning-up project is embarked on could not on that account be regarded as justifiable.",

As regards the aforementioned municipalities, the appellant cannot legally represent their interests inasmuch as they are the interests of third parties, and it is moreover clear that the danger posed by the dumped waste affects a much larger number of people, as is apparent from the fact that it is widely known that, owing to its size, the Mitterndorf basin serves as a reservoir for drinking-water. The same considerations of public interest are valid with regard to the economic interests of an individual; the respondent authority did not, as the appellant maintained, disregard the relevant considerations, since in the decision appealed against it said, among other things, that in the case in issue \u2018the public interest in ensuring the supply of drinking-water outweighs the economic interest in continuing the operation of the tip\u2019. It is equally untrue that the question of blame for the dumping of prohibited waste had a bearing on the revocation, as the revocation concerned the licence and thus the operation of the tip as permitted by that licence up to then.",

The appellant, however, did not contradict the comment in the decision appealed against that his lawyer had been informed of the expert\u2019s name during an inspection of the entire file on 22 April 1987. As the appellant was familiar with the \u2018original\u2019 of the opinion concerned (it is referred to in the appeal), he must also have been aware of the exact date of the opinion, which was not given in the respondent authority\u2019s communication. The appellant further criticised the same expert on the ground that his opinion contained no \u2018findings of fact\u2019, a matter to which reference had already been made in the reply to the authority\u2019s communication. The way in which this point was dealt with in the impugned decision has been set out in the recital of facts. The technical opinion submitted in the appeal proceedings was an expert assessment of the same facts as those on which the first-instance authority had based its decision; the technical assessment in the appeal proceedings was intended - in view of the appellant\u2019s appeal - precisely to throw light on whether the factual situation (which was essentially identical both at first instance and on appeal) should lead to the legal characterisation given it by the Governor; it was not a question of assessing changed or substantially supplemented facts. For this reason it was unnecessary for the expert appointed by the respondent authority himself to set out afresh the facts to be taken as a basis. In a case such as the present one there can be no question of the facts on which the expert opinion was based not being known or of a further special reference being necessary to how they came about. By \u2018third-party documents\u2019 (Fremdakten) - a term used several times in the expert report - is usually understood, as can easily be inferred from the context, documents that have not been drawn up by the authority (in this instance the respondent authority) itself; since the questions being dealt with always related to the refuse tip concerned, it is clear that what was meant were the water-rights documents of other authorities than the respondent authority which related to the tipping site. As to the appellant\u2019s specific criticism to the effect that the expert did not make clear what he meant by \u2018the abuses found\u2019, it should be noted that immediately after that passage there follows a more detailed explanation, in particular through the reference to failures to comply with the decision of 21 September 1972 and condition 9 of the decision of 30 July 1973, by which is meant the occurrences which led to the revocation by the Governor on 16 May 1983 of the licence to dump distillation residues. The entire comment relating to this has little bearing on the revocation, however, because it was made by the expert only in connection with his general remarks on the need for precise definition of waste if there was to be any effective control of what was dumped. A separate reply to the question - posed in its observations in reply to the respondent authority\u2019s communication and repeated in the present appeal - whether account had been taken of the fact that in the eastern part of the tip there was a compressed mass of domestic refuse about 18 metres thick on the floor of the site does not seem to the Court to be of decisive importance with regard to the revocation stopping future tipping in view of the fact that - as set out in greater detail in the present appeal - it can \u2018now indisputably\u2019 be assumed that \u2018under a 15 to 18-metre-thick layer of highly compressed domestic refuse thousands of barrels of, in all probability, unauthorised dangerous solvents have been dumped there\u2019 and that the area must be cleaned up - which precludes all further tipping.",

Attention need only be drawn in the first place to the regulations issued by the respondent authority as early as 1969 (Federal Gazette - Bundesgesetzblatt - no. 126), which define the groundwater conservation area on whose periphery the refuse tip is situated. Furthermore - in response to the appellant\u2019s criticism - reference is rightly made in the impugned decision to the fact that the importance of the area was well known. The Environment Protection Agency\u2019s (Umweltschutzanstalt) survey report of 17 February 1987, according to which a groundwater sample taken on 22 October 1986 had shown, among other things, that the chlorinated hydrocarbon content had further fallen, had no influence on the expert opinion in this context - this is confirmed in a note by the expert. In this connection, it must be borne in mind that the measurement was based on only a single sample and was merely \u2018better\u2019 than one from an earlier sample. Even the appellant does not infer from it that the dangerous eastern part of the site is thereby shown to be free of danger; if the licence continued in force, further tipping could not, in the expert\u2019s view, be regarded as conducive to further improvement in the quality of the groundwater. The appellant\u2019s objection that there was no water seepage through an open \u2018compressed, 18-metre-thick\u2019 layer of domestic refuse is impossible to understand. Since this waste was alleged to exist in the eastern part of the tip, it was on that account alone not unreasonable to prevent further tipping in accordance with the licence by revoking that licence, given the need - mentioned even by the appellant - for a cleaning up of the site. It may therefore be concluded that in this respect the alleged material defects in the expert opinion are non-existent.",

Reference is made in the appeal to possible alternatives to revocation and to an opinion of 29 April 1986 by the hydraulic engineer officially appointed as an expert by the Governor. The appellant inferred from this expert opinion that approval of measures he had planned would have meant that the revocation could have been avoided; in that opinion, however, it was suggested - on the assumption of \u2018dangers which, if the principle that prevention is better than cure is applied\u2019, ruled out \u2018further tipping\u2019 (and it was stated that even tipping of domestic refuse \u2018undoubtedly\u2019 increased the danger \u2018significantly in quantitative terms\u2019) and on the basis of the facts - that \u2018the question of revoking the licence granted by decision of the Governor, ON 14\u2019 (i.e. the decision of 1973), should be looked into, \u2018as important assumptions, on which the issuing of the licence [had] been based\u2019 had proved to be false. The expert opinion cited, which points in exactly the direction that was subsequently - in the last instance by the respondent authority - taken, was therefore an unsuitable basis for obtaining, as requested, further expert reports. Even if in the same context reference is made in the appeal to the expert report submitted in the water-rights proceedings of 18 November 1986 in support of the view that the \u2018re-storage variant\u2019 (final disposal of the \u2018eastern refuse\u2019 in the western part of the tip), which the appellant had suggested as an alternative to revoking the licence, was \u2018technically feasible\u2019, little is gained - particularly in view of the many discussions that, according to the administrative documents, had already taken place - in the way of showing that the additional investigations that were held to be unnecessary in the impugned decision are in fact needed.",

From the point of view of international law, this practice strikes me as highly questionable, given that Article 64 (art. 64) expressly authorises States to make reservations, even if the Convention makes them subject to certain conditions. The Contracting States which made such reservations in respect of a Convention Article or one of its Protocols did so in good faith, trusting to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Convention that were current at the time of ratification, and they could not foresee the steady development that the case-law would undergo in the future. In this way, many reservations and interpretative declarations have become obsolete or, to put it another way, the mutual trust has been betrayed.",

An example of the latter category may possibly be seen in the Obermeier case (see note 1), where the subject-matter was the right of a disabled person not to be dismissed unless dismissal was socially justified.",

I am inclined to think that there is no room for the opposite effect, that is: the particular subject-matter entailing less strict requirements than are normally acceptable.

This means, on the one hand, that in the aforementioned balancing exercise one should be careful not to attach undue weight to local particularities and traditions as regards the organisation of administrative justice and, on the other, that States should be treated equally. In this respect it may be recalled, for instance, that the Benthem v. the Netherlands judgment obliged the Netherlands to reorganise completely their system of administrative justice, just as a series of judgments made it necessary for  to do the same. Other States cannot claim that they should not be obliged to bear similar consequences of the Court\u2019s gradual widening of the ambit of Article 6 (art. 6) into the field of administrative procedure, however unexpected this evolution of the case-law may have been.

Article 130 para. 2 of the Constitution and section 41 (1) of the Administrative Court Act - which one should not consider separately, since (as follows from the above) they are clearly interrelated - bar such determination by the Verwaltungsgerichtshof. Such is the core of the above compromise. However, essentials do not allow of compromise.",

The Court has tried to conceal this by referring, at the outset, to its \"full jurisdiction\" doctrine.

The choice of just that possibility may therefore suggest that the Court preferred to avoid the other two options and may, on a subsequent occasion, be lured into finding the reservation valid and applicable to proceedings before the Verwaltungsgerichtshof. After all, as the Government have stressed, the Court has already twice implicitly recognised the reservation as valid and construed it broadly as encompassing administrative proceedings also. Since in my opinion the a fortiori construction of the Ringeisen judgment - which was followed in the Ettl and Others judgment - is no longer tenable following the Court\u2019s statement (in paragraph 59 of its Belilos judgment) that reservations are to be construed stricto sensu, I do not like creating the impression that the Court might be induced to maintain that old construction. The less so because I think that it follows from the Belilos judgment that the reservation is invalid. In this respect I fully share the opinion of Mrs Liddy.",

I am, however, of the opinion, that the principle, laid down in paragraph 33 of the judgment (the  should confine itself as far as possible to examining the question raised by the case before it) should neither be phrased nor be applied in too restrictive a way. Accordingly, the  should not hesitate also to couch its findings in more general terms. In this respect, I would recall the Court\u2019s recent description of the Convention \"as a constitutional instrument of European public order (ordre public)\" (Loizidou v. Turkey judgment of 23 March 1995, Series A no. 310, p. 24, para. 75). It seems to me that reasoning not solely restricted to the scope and the circumstances of the case would contribute better to the quality of the Court\u2019s case-law in the service of the Convention as a living constitutional instrument on European public order. In this respect, my own views come close to the methodological objection raised by Judge Martens in paragraph 16 of his separate opinion.",
