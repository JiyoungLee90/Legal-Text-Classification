In its brief reasoning, the court did not make any assessment of the statement of Mr\u00a0B.A., who testified that he had seen the applicant being beaten by the police officers. There is also no explanation as to why the police officers\u2019 statements were considered more credible than the statements of the applicant and Mr B.A. Furthermore, the domestic court decision did not provide any clarification as to how the applicant had sustained the injuries observed in his back. In this connection, the Court also takes note of the applicant\u2019s allegation that during his medical examination the police officers were present in the examination room. The Court reiterates that the CPT (the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment) has underlined the importance of proper medical examinations as an essential safeguard against ill-treatment of persons in custody. Such examinations must be carried out by a properly qualified doctor, without any police officer being present.
