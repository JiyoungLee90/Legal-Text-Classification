The applicants argued that the document described in paragraph 22 above \u2013 explaining that during court hearings in Lovech Prison it was for the judge to decide whether or not to keep the participating prisoners handcuffed \u2013 proved their point.

In this regard, it is important whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, or cause injury or damage, or suppress evidence (see Raninen v.

The assessment in that regard will depend on the circumstances of the case in their entirety (see Gorodnichev, cited above, \u00a7 100). In considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a03, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as regards the consequences, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see Raninen, cited above, \u00a7 55, and Peers v. Greece, no.\u00a028524/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2001III). Being publicly visible may also be a relevant factor in assessing whether a form of treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, but the Court does not consider that the absence of this public aspect will necessarily prevent a particular form of treatment from falling into that category; the application of measures of restraint to an applicant in a non-public setting may still give rise to a violation of Article 3 in a situation where no serious risks to security could be shown to exist (see Ashot Harutyunyan v.

The Government defended it by pointing out that the applicants were particularly dangerous and that there was a risk of their attempting to abscond, resorting to force or otherwise disrupting the hearing. In support of this argument they submitted three reports on the applicants (see paragraph 20 above). While not wishing to undervalue the conclusions drawn in these reports, and being aware of the caution the authorities need to exercise when dealing with individuals \u2013 such as the applicants \u2013 who have been convicted of violent offences and are apparently aggressive even in prison (see Kashavelov, cited above, \u00a7 39), the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s arguments. It notes that the hearing at issue took place in an already secure environment and that the Government have not disputed the applicants\u2019 statement (see paragraph 25 above) that there were also prison warders present. These and any other possible security measures were apparently sufficient to permit the removal of the handcuffs of those inmates who were to be examined as witnesses and who were also life prisoners. These measures must therefore also have significantly reduced any risk posed by the applicants. Moreover, the applicants\u2019 feet remained shackled the entire time. The Government have not shown why in these circumstances any risk posed by the applicants also required that they should have their arms handcuffed behind their backs, and remain in this strenuous position throughout the hearing. Nor did the judge presiding over the hearing give any particular reasons in that regard (see paragraph 8 above). Lastly, the Court notes that the hearing at issue was part of proceedings in which the applicants sought to defend their right not to be detained in inhuman and degrading conditions (see paragraph 6 above).",

It is clear that the measure applied related to detention and was closely connected to the personalities of the persons concerned. The same approach was taken in the case of Paradysz v. France (no. 17020/05, \u00a7 95, 29 October 2009), in which the Court concluded that the use of handcuffs and shackles during transport from prison to hospital was a process related to the detention and the personality of the person concerned and did not reach the minimum level of severity required in order to fall within the ambit of Article 3 of the Convention. A hearing that takes place on prison premises, taking into account the personalities of the persons concerned, can hardly be said to reach the minimum level of severity required by Article 3 even if the persons concerned were handcuffed and shackled during a relatively short hearing. Even in the case of Kashavelov, cited above, which is referred to in paragraph 33 of the judgment, the Court found (\u00a7 33) that \u201c[i]t is aware that those [prison] authorities need to exercise caution when dealing with individuals who have been convicted of violent offences, refuse to accept the fact of their imprisonment, and are consequently hostile towards prison staff and other inmates. However, it observes that the systematic use of handcuffs in respect of the applicant started about thirteen years ago, in December 1997, and apparently continues to this day.\u201d The other case referred to in the present judgment, namely Gorodnichev v. Russia (no.\u00a052058/99, \u00a7 108, 24 May 2007), relates to the use of handcuffs during a public hearing at which the applicant was subjected to public exposure wearing handcuffs. I believe that the national authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in these cases to assess each individual and the possible risks he or she poses to public order, and to take the necessary measures in accordance with the requirements of Article 3. I see no cause to depart from these cases. The Court found a violation of Article 3 in the cases referred to because of treatment imposed on the individuals concerned that went far beyond the minimum severity and intensity required under Article 3. It appears that these cases do not support the conclusion reached in the present judgment in respect of the severity of the measures applied and their impact on individuals\u2019 dignity in the given circumstances.",
