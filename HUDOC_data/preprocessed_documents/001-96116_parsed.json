However, even assuming that during those periods the applicant was detained \u201cwith a view to\u201d his extradition on the ground that General Prosecutor's Office still intended to extradite the applicant, the finding that there was no adequate legal basis for the applicant's extradition detention covers the whole of the period, and it is not necessary for the Court to consider separately the period subsequent to the grant of refugee status.",
