In particular, where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of individuals within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence which casts doubt on the version of events given by the victim. In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that those in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (ibid., \u00a7\u00a083). The same principle applies to all cases in which a person is under the control of the police or a similar authority (ibid., \u00a7\u00a084).",

Hence, nothing can explain the six years and eight months\u2019 delay in commencing the criminal investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaint. The Court considers that such a significant delay could not but have had a significant adverse impact on the investigation, as it would have considerably undermined the investigating authority\u2019s ability to secure the evidence concerning the alleged illtreatment (see Manzhos v. Russia, no.\u00a064752/09, \u00a7\u00a040, 24\u00a0May 2016, with further references). It rendered impossible, in particular, determination of the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries and the time they were inflicted (see paragraphs 42 and 44 above), which led to the termination of the criminal proceedings on 12 June 2013 with an inconclusive finding that the applicant\u2019s injuries might have been caused during the applicant\u2019s arrest on 18\u00a0March 2006 as a result of lawful use of force by the police, or under other circumstances prior to the arrest (see paragraphs 45-46 above).",
