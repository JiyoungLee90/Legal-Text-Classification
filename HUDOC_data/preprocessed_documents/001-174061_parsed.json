In particular, \u201cas a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses\u201d (see Vidal v.

Finland, no.\u00a040847/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 15 June 2004). Although \u201cArticle 6 does not go as far as requiring that the defence be given the same rights as the prosecution in taking evidence\u201d (see Mirilashvili\u00a0v.Russia, no. 6293/04, \u00a7\u00a0225, 11 December 2008), the accused should be entitled to seek and produce evidence \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d as the prosecution (see, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos.\u00a011082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a0728, 25\u00a0July 2013). Clearly, those \u201cconditions\u201d cannot be exactly the same in all respects; thus, for example, the defence cannot have the same search and seizure powers as the prosecution. However, as follows from the text of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) the defence must have an opportunity to conduct an active defence \u2013 for example, by calling witnesses on its behalf or adducing other evidence (ibid.).",

However, the Court considers that the statements, assessed as a whole, were not made with necessary discretion and circumspection. Both the prosecutor and the investigator unequivocally implicated the applicant in several assassinations. Their statements represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, his involvement in the commission of the offences. The Court considers that those statements by the public officials amounted to a declaration of the applicant\u2019s guilt and prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. Having regard to the contents of their statements as outlined above, the Court finds that they could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicant guilty before he had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the applicant\u2019s presumption of innocence.",
