One of the elements of the broader concept of a fair trial is the principle of equality of arms, which requires each party to be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see, among many other authorities, Nider\u00f6st-Huber v. , judgment of 18 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, pp. 107-08, \u00a7 23). That right means, in principle, the opportunity for the parties to a trial to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court\u2019s decision (see Lobo Machado v. Portugal, judgment of 20\u00a0February\u00a01996, Reports 1996I, p.\u00a0206, \u00a7\u00a031). This position is not altered when the observations are neutral on the issue to be decided by the court (see G\u00f6\u00e7 v.  [GC], no.\u00a036590/97, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2002V) or, in the opinion of the court concerned, they do not present any fact or argument which has not already appeared in the impugned decision. Only the parties to a dispute may properly decide whether this is the case; it is for them to say whether or not a document calls for their comments (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7\u00a029).",
