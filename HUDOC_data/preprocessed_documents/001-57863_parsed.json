The conduct of which the applicant stood accused was defined as \"deception\" (\"manoeuvres frauduleuses\") and not as \"evasion\" (\"soustraction frauduleuse\"); the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat regarded the former offence as a tax offence and the latter as a criminal offence. The nature and degree of severity of the penalty were not such as to suggest a different conclusion. The surcharges were imposed by the Revenue, under the supervision of the administrative courts, and not by a criminal court; they were calculated on the basis of the supplementary tax assessment and were therefore directly proportional to the tax originally evaded; they were not an alternative to a custodial penalty and never entailed any loss of rights; they remained payable by the heirs in the event of the taxpayer\u2019s death; and they were not covered by the rules on reoffending, aiding and abetting, consecutive and concurrent sentences or the making of entries in the criminal records.",

The complaint therefore relates to documents that were not in the file produced to the administrative courts and were not ones on which the applicant\u2019s adversary relied (see, mutatis mutandis, the Schuler-Zgraggen v.  judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, p. 18, para. 52).",

This omission is all the more detrimental to his case as he was aware of the existence and content of most of the documents and he and his counsel had had access to the complete file, at any rate during the criminal investigation (see paragraph 26 above).",
