In response to the applicant\u2019s statement that he had assumed he was a Dutch national, the Deputy Minister noted that the applicant had not submitted any documents to substantiate this alleged Dutch nationality despite having been given the opportunity to do so, and he was therefore to be considered as an alien. The Deputy Minister held, inter alia, that because of the nature and seriousness of the offences he had committed, the applicant constituted a danger to public order, which was a ground for rejecting an application for a residence permit under domestic law (see paragraph 26 below). Next, the Deputy Minister examined whether obligations arising from international agreements nevertheless required that the application for a residence permit be granted (see paragraph 27 below). To the extent that it had to be assumed that family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention existed between the applicant and his uncle, the Deputy Minister considered that the refusal to allow the applicant to reside in the Netherlands did not entail divesting him of any residence permit that had enabled him to enjoy family life in the Netherlands. It had, moreover, not appeared that there were any facts or circumstances of such seriousness that the right to respect for family life entailed a positive obligation on the part of the State to admit the applicant. The Deputy Minister noted that the applicant had been living in the Netherlands since he was four years old and that it had been argued that he was completely integrated into Dutch society; however, no rights could be derived from a period of residence without a residence permit.",

In that context she considered it decisive that the applicant had never been lawfully resident in the Netherlands. His presumed biological father or his foster parents ought to have ensured that the applicant obtained lawful residence after his arrival in the Netherlands; this responsibility could not be passed on to the national authorities. Given that an application for a tourist visa had been made prior to the applicant\u2019s arrival, the Deputy Minister failed to see how the presumed biological father or the foster parents could not have realised that the applicant was not a Dutch national.",

According to the Deputy Minister, there was no objective impediment to family life being continued in Indonesia. Holding, moreover, that the applicant was an adult who should be considered capable of managing by himself in his country of origin, the Deputy Minister found no indications that he had more than the usual dependence on, and emotional ties with, his foster parents. The fact that the applicant might experience certain problems in adapting to life in Indonesia, where he had no family and did not speak the language, was not considered an unacceptable consequence of the decision. In any event, contact between the applicant and his foster parents need not be ruptured as the latter could visit him in Indonesia.",

Next, it noted that the case did not concern an interference within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention since the applicant had not been divested of a residence permit which had enabled him to enjoy private or family life in the Netherlands. That being the case, it followed from the established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that a balancing of interests was to be conducted in order to assess whether, in the concrete circumstances of the case, the right to respect for family life within the meaning of Article 8 nevertheless entailed a positive obligation on the part of the State to allow the applicant to remain in the country. The Regional Court considered that the Deputy Minister\u2019s decision did not demonstrate that an express and transparent balancing exercise between all the interests at stake had been conducted. It noted that the Deputy Minister had summarily reasoned that what was decisive was that the applicant constituted a danger to public order and that he had never held a residence permit enabling him to enjoy family life in the Netherlands, without indicating in a careful and sufficiently transparent manner what weight was to be attached to the circumstances that the applicant had grown up in the Netherlands, had received his schooling in that country and had built up his social, cultural and family ties there.",

Section B2/10.2.2. specified that, in general, the decision to refuse a residence permit to an alien who had not previously held one was not considered to amount to interference with his or her right to respect for family or private life, even if the alien had in fact already been staying in the Netherlands for some time and had been enjoying family and/or private life there.

The Court accepts that the applicant\u2019s ultimate aim in lodging an application under Article 34 of the Convention will have been for the Dutch authorities to allow him to reside in the Netherlands by granting him a residence permit. However, his application to the Court, in which he complained of a violation of his right to respect for his private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, cannot be equated with an application for a residence permit. Firstly, neither Article 8 nor any other provision of the Convention and its Protocols guarantees, as such, a right to a residence permit (see Bonger v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a010154/04, 15 September 2005). Moreover, in accordance with Article 19 of the Convention, the only task of the Court is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the Parties in the Convention. When the Court concludes that a State has breached the Convention, that State is in principle free to choose the means whereby it will comply with the Court\u2019s judgment (see, amongst other authorities, Kuri\u0107 and Others v. Slovenia (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 26828/06, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2014). Accordingly, the Court does not have the power to direct that a residence permit be issued to an applicant.",

The Court has held that where this is the case it is likely only to be in exceptional circumstances that the removal of the non-national family member will constitute a violation of Article 8 (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2006I; Nunez, cited above, \u00a7 36; and Jeunesse, cited above, \u00a7 108). Thus, a distinction must be drawn between those seeking entry into a country to pursue their newly established family life; those who had an established family life before one of the spouses obtained settlement in another country; and those who seek to remain in a country where they have already established close family life and other ties for a reasonable period of time (see Priya v. Denmark (dec.), no. 13594/03, 6 July 2006). In addition, the Court has accepted that weighty immigration policy considerations militate in favour of identifying children with the conduct of their parents, failing which there would be a great risk that the parents exploit the situation of their children in order to secure a residence permit for themselves and for the children (see Butt v. Norway, no.\u00a047017/09, \u00a7 79, 4 December 2012).",

The Court finds that similar considerations apply in respect of an alien who has established social ties amounting to private life in the territory of a State during a period of unlawful stay. The extent of the State\u2019s positive obligations to admit such an alien will depend on the particular circumstances of the person concerned and the general interest. Moreover, the factors set out in paragraph 56 above also apply \u2013 to the extent possible\u00a0\u2013 to cases where it is more appropriate to focus on the aspect of private life. Equally, if an alien establishes a private life within a State at a time when he or she is aware that his or her immigration status is such that the continuation of that private life in that country would be precarious from the start, a refusal to admit him or her would amount to a breach of Article 8 in exceptional circumstances only.",

Therefore, the domestic authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him a residence permit did not require the \u201cvery serious reasons\u201d that would be needed to justify the expulsion of a settled migrant who had arrived in the Netherlands at around the same age (see paragraph 52 above).",

As set out above (see paragraph 58 in fine), that principle applies if it is known to the person concerned from the moment he or she starts a private life in the host country that his or her immigration status may well stand in the way of the continuation of that private life. In the present case, the Court observes that when the applicant started to build up his ties with the Netherlands he was completely unaware that neither his presumed father nor his foster parents had taken steps to regularise his stay in the country. Having regard to his young age when he came to the Netherlands and the other circumstances of the case, the Court considers that this cannot be held against the applicant. In that latter context, and with reference to paragraph 57 in fine above, the Court finds, moreover, that the applicant cannot be identified with any omission on the part of his foster parents to ensure that his stay in the Netherlands had a lawful basis since, as Dutch nationals (see paragraph 5 above), their right of residence in the Netherlands was not dependent on whether or not the applicant would be granted a residence permit \u2013 as was also recognised by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (see point 2.5 in paragraph 23 above).",

Instead, the assessment has to be carried out from a neutral starting point, taking into account the specific circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case.",

Whereas the Regional Court considered that the Deputy Minister had not sufficiently indicated what weight she attached to certain circumstances (see paragraph 22 above), the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State held that the Deputy Minister had rightly attached great weight to the offences committed by the applicant in view of their nature and seriousness and the fact that the applicant was a recidivist.

This explains why the applicant started experiencing problems and taking drugs. He was convicted several times of assault, indecent assault and attempted indecent assault, his last offence dating back to December 2007. In 2006 he had applied for a residence permit. While his application in 2008 was rejected by the Deputy Minister of Justice, the Regional Court in 2012 upheld the applicant\u2019s appeal.

The Court in its case-law has in particular dealt with two different situations. On the one hand, cases involving the expulsion of settled migrants \u2013 that is, where persons have already been formally granted a right of residence in a host country and this right has subsequently been withdrawn (see, for example, \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, ECHR 2006XII; Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, ECHR 2008; A.A. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a08000/08, 20\u00a0September 2011; Levakovic v. Denmark, no. 7841/14, 23 October 2018; and I.M. v. Switzerland, no. 23887/16, 9 April 2019). This situation gives rise to negative obligations for States, and in that respect the Court has set out relevant criteria for assessing compatibility with Article 8 of the Convention, the so-called \u00dcner criteria (see \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-60, and Boultif v. Switzerland, no. 54273/00, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2001-IX). On the other hand, positive obligations arise for States in cases concerning, inter alia, the denial of a residence permit to individuals already present in the territory of the respondent State (see, for example, Jeunesse v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a012738/10, 3 October 2014; B.A.C. v. Greece, no.\u00a011981/15, 13 October 2016; Abuhmaid v. Ukraine, no. 31183/13, 12\u00a0January 2017; Ejimson v. Germany, no. 58681/12, 1 March 2018; and Hoti v.

The Court has therefore also acknowledged in admission cases, where the foreign national is already in the host country, that the positive and negative obligations do not lend themselves to precise definition and that the applicable principles are similar (see Osman v. Denmark, no. 38058/09, \u00a7 53, 14 June 2011; Nunez v.\u00a0Norway, no. 55597/09, \u00a7 68, 28 June 2011; and Jeunesse, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). Accordingly, in Nunez (cited above, \u00a7 69) the Court did not find it necessary to determine whether in that case the impugned decision constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 or was to be seen as involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation. Where the case concerns (factual) residence in the host country without a valid residence permit, it can be considered neither a case of purely positive obligations nor one of purely negative obligations; it is rather a kind of \u201chybrid obligation case\u201d (see Mark Klaassen, \u201cBetween facts and norms: Testing compliance with Article\u00a08 ECHR in immigration cases\u201d, NQHR 37(2), p. 164 (2019)). Against this background, it seems quite artificial in such admission cases to formally distinguish between positive and negative obligations. Consequently, although the Court has established the \u00dcner criteria in the context of expulsion cases, as a matter of fact it has also applied most of these criteria \u2013 albeit without explicitly acknowledging it \u2013 in cases concerning residence permits, when in the balancing exercise it has taken into account the interests of the individual, most of which are reflected in the \u00dcner criteria.",

As a result of this balancing exercise, there will, of course, be cases where the nature and seriousness of the offence committed or the person\u2019s offending history outweighed all other criteria to be taken into account (see, for example, \u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 62-64, and Salem v.\u00a0Denmark, no. 77036/11, \u00a7 76, 1 December 2016).",

The Court\u2019s task consists in ascertaining whether the impugned measures struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely the individual\u2019s rights protected by the Convention on the one hand and the community\u2019s interests on the other (see, for example, Boultif, cited above, \u00a7 47, and Levakovic, cited above, \u00a7 38). The margin of appreciation has generally been understood to mean that, where independent and impartial domestic courts have carefully examined the facts, applying the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and its case-law, and adequately balanced the applicant\u2019s personal interests against the more general public interest in the case, it is not for the Strasbourg Court to substitute its own assessment of the merits for that of the competent national authorities. The only exception to this is where there are shown to be strong reasons for doing so (see Ndidi v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a041215/14, \u00a7 76, 14 September 2017). In line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is therefore not the Court\u2019s task to take the place of the competent authorities in assessing the circumstances of a specific case, but to ascertain whether the domestic courts secured the guarantees set forth in Article 8, and whether that was sufficiently reflected in their reasoning in order to enable the Court to carry out the European supervision entrusted to it (see El Ghatet v. Switzerland, no. 56971/10, \u00a7 47, 8 November 2016).",

After mentioning the Court\u2019s case-law concerning the balancing exercise, it referred to the judgment in Butt v. Norway (no.\u00a047017/09, 4 December 2012), according to which \u201cstrong immigration policy considerations would in principle militate in favour of identifying children with the conduct of their parents, failing which there would be a great risk that parents exploited the situation of their children in order to secure a residence permit for themselves and for the children\u201d. That entailed the conclusion in Butt that the aliens\u2019 removal would be incompatible with Article 8 only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 79). Although the Council of State recognised that in the present case the situation was different because the foster parents\u2019 status as Dutch nationals did not depend on the applicant\u2019s residence permit, it only characterised that factor as not constituting a \u201cdecisive\u201d element. That was not sufficient, however. In the present case, this element was of no relevance at all, not simply \u201cnot decisive\u201d, and should therefore have been completely discarded. On the contrary, with the reference to the Butt jurisprudence the national assessment seems to have been put on the wrong track from the outset.",

I would agree with that. However, these weighty aspects in favour of the applicant were immediately wiped away by the formal argument that there was no positive obligation on the State to allow the alien to reside in the country. In other words, instead of genuinely balancing all the relevant criteria and reaching a conclusion only at the very end of the assessment, the court had already made its finding at that early stage.

No doubt these elements were of great importance in the balancing exercise and needed to be taken into account to the applicant\u2019s detriment. However, in the face of these criteria, all other elements, to the extent that they had been considered by the domestic authorities at all, were again put aside. For example, while the Council of State mentioned the fact that the applicant did not have any family in Indonesia and did not know the language spoken there, it did not attach any relevant weight to these aspects, but instead observed in a rather laconic manner that given his adult age, he should be capable by himself of managing these problems of adjustment.",

The present case can be considered neither a case of purely positive obligations nor one of purely negative obligations (see paragraph 4 above). The majority accepted, at least, that the applicant qualified neither as a settled migrant, within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law, nor as an alien who had to have been aware of the precariousness of his immigration status from the outset, and therefore the assessment had to be carried out from a neutral starting-point, taking into account the specific circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 61 of the judgment). Apart from the fact that the starting-point of the Deputy Minister and the Council of State could not be considered \u201cneutral\u201d, it seems to me that the applicant\u2019s situation, from a factual point of view, was very close to that of a \u201csettled migrant\u201d, since he had spent his life from the age of four in the host country. Although, legally speaking, he was not a \u201csettled migrant\u201d, because his stay in the host country was apparently never \u201clawful\u201d, this legal aspect should not be overstated in the specific circumstances of the present case. In this connection, it needs to be emphasised that the host country had tolerated the applicant\u2019s residence since 1991, including the period in which he had undergone primary and secondary education. The authorities must have known of his legal status, but it was only in 2004, when the applicant was 17 years old, that the authorities started to formally enquire about his nationality, and it was only in 2008, when he was 21 years old, that the decision not to grant him a residence permit was taken.",

As already mentioned, when the applicant started to build up his ties with the host country, he was completely unaware that neither his presumed father nor his foster parents had taken steps to regularise his stay there. Had they taken those steps, the applicant would easily have become a Dutch national and could under no circumstances, irrespective of how badly he had behaved, have been refused residence in or been expelled from the Netherlands. The same would have been the case if, for example, not his presumed father but his mother had had Dutch nationality or if the presumed father had been married to the applicant\u2019s mother at the time of his birth. He would automatically have been a Dutch national with legal residence status in the Netherlands. My argument in this respect is that the applicant was liable to be denied a residence permit, whereas he would not have been if any of the above eventualities had occurred. How can the fact that the applicant was liable to be denied residence in the country in which he had been living since the age of four be justified when he would not have been liable had any one of these eventualities occurred? This distinction is based solely on accident and on a situation for which the applicant is not responsible at all (see, in a comparable context, the judgment of 19 October 2016 of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; see also the judgment of 20 May 2020 of the German Constitutional Court, 2 BvR 2628/18).

I concede that it is more moral than legal in nature, but nevertheless it may have a place in the overall assessment of the case. In that regard, I refer to the concurring opinion of H.G. Schermers, joined by G.H. Thune, in Beldjoudi v. France (6\u00a0September 1990, opinion of the Commission, Series A no. 234-A), the dissenting opinion of Judge Morenilla in Boujlifa v. France (21 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI) and the joint concurring opinion of Judges Bianku and Lemmens in Levakovic (cited above). If the applicant is denied residence in the Netherlands, consequently at a given time he must leave the country and move to another country, most probably his country of origin, the only State in which he can settle down without having to fulfil further conditions. However, why should that State, or any other State with which the applicant has no ties at all, bear more responsibility than the Netherlands, where he has lived nearly his whole life? To borrow the words of H.G. Schermers, if there is one country responsible for the upbringing and the criminal behaviour of the applicant, that country must be considered to be the Netherlands. It would be more just for the Netherlands \u201cto keep both the good and the bad immigrants\u201d, at least in a case such as the present one in which it is only by accident that the applicant has not become a Dutch national, whereas if he had had such a legal status, he could have stayed in the country that corresponded to his real home.",
