It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty.

However, while the proceedings were pending before the domestic courts there were significant periods of inactivity which have not been reasonably explained by the Government. In particular, the Court refers to the period between 17\u00a0May 2000 and 2\u00a0October 2001, which lasted more than a year and four months; the period between 2 October 2001 and 6 October 2003, which lasted more than two years; and the period between 10\u00a0October 2003 and 26\u00a0January 2004, which lasted about three months and a half. It appears that no procedural steps were taken within those periods and the delays identified are attributable to the conduct of the domestic authorities.",

The section did not specify in any detail the procedure and grounds for imposing this penalty (see paragraph 28 above), which could give rise to the question whether the requirement of the quality of law had been met. The Court does not find it necessary to dwell on this issue, however, since the interference was in any event not compatible with Article 8 of the Convention for the reasons set out below.",

It follows that the letter did not give rise to any risk of the applicant\u2019s obstructing the course of justice, or to any other possible risk that justified the domestic requirement of sending letters exclusively through the authorised channels. Moreover, the applicant, in sending a letter bypassing the control of the detention centre, committed a relatively minor offence, but was still punished with the severest penalty. Lastly, the Court observes that the applicant had no remedy to effectively challenge the impugned disciplinary measure (contrast Puzinas v.
