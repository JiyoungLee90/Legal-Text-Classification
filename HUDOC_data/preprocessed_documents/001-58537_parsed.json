Subsequently the President of the Court, Mr\u00a0L.\u00a0Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1). The Chamber constituted within that Section included ex officio Mr\u00a0J.\u00a0Makarczyk, the judge elected in respect of Poland (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 \u00a7 1 (a)), and Mr M. Fischbach, Vice-President of the Section (Rule 26 \u00a7 1 (a) taken together with Rule 12). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr\u00a0B.\u00a0Conforti, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs M. TsatsaNikolovska, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Rule 26 \u00a7 1 (b)). Subsequently, as Mr Makarczyk was unable to sit in the Chamber, the Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d), after being invited to do so by the President of the Chamber, indicated that they wished to appoint another elected judge to sit in his place. Pursuant to the President's order made in consequence, Mrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1, substitute judge, replaced Mr Makarczyk as a member of the Chamber (Rule\u00a026\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) read together with Rule 29).",

There is a link between all those persons in that they may be deprived of their liberty either in order to be given medical treatment or because of considerations dictated by social policy, or on both medical and social grounds. It is therefore legitimate to conclude from this context that a predominant reason why the Convention allows the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 (e) of Article 5 to be deprived of their liberty is not only that they are dangerous for public safety but also that their own interests may necessitate their detention (see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6\u00a0November 1980, Series A no. 39, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 98 in fine).",

On this point, the Court observes that there can be no doubt that the harmful use of alcohol poses a danger to society and that a person who is in a state of intoxication may pose a danger to himself and others, regardless of whether or not he is addicted to alcohol.",

In my humble opinion, where the Convention gives the possibility of indicating to the State with clarity and precision how it should or should not conduct itself, the Court's decision should not be made to depend on an assessment of the minor details of a case.

A vagrant is a person who lives a life of vagrancy, not anyone who temporarily happens to have no fixed abode.
