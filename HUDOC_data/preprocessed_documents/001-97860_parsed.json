Although the Court of Cassation accepted the applicant's request and granted him leave to appeal because the aforementioned judgment had not been duly served on him (see paragraph\u00a025 above), the Court observes that the applicant must be considered to have been negligent by not appointing a new legal representative to replace the former one who had died in 1989, or by not contacting his co-litigants for a substantial period of time. In these circumstances, the delay during the period between 23 December 1992 and 2\u00a0February 1999 cannot be wholly attributed to the national authorities.",
