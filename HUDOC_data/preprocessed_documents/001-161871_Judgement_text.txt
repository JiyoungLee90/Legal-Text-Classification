The case originated in an application (no. 28041/13) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Brazilian national, Ms Andreia Aparecida de Oliveira Nabor (“the applicant”), on 12 April 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr J.J. Ferreira Alves, a lawyer practising in Matosinhos. The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy Attorney-General.
On 19 May 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Porto.
On 28 April 2009 the applicant lodged a request to be granted permanent disability with respect to work before the State’s Attorney’s Office of the Porto Labour Court as a consequence of a labour accident that she had suffered and with regard to which she was claiming damages and compensation.
On 27 May 2009 the applicant supplied statements to the State’s Attorney’s Office in which she confirmed she was receiving medical care. On the same day the State’s Attorney’s Office request the applicant to provide her medical reports, which she submitted on 28 and 29 July 2009.
Meanwhile, the applicant’s employee was notified to provide information on the applicant’s work accident, which was done on 16 June 2009.
On 16 September the applicant supplied second statements, informing the State’s Attorney’s Office that she remained under medical treatment.
Between 16 September 2009 and 20 September 2010 the State’s Attorney’s Office requested information regarding the evolution of the applicant’s medical treatment. Between these dates, the State’s Attorney’s Office stayed the proceedings twice for thirty days, on 5 March and on 4 May 2010, until the applicant was medically fit.
On an unknown date the State’s Attorney’s Office was informed that the applicant was no longer being treated in the same clinic and on 7 October 2010 requested the applicant to inform whether she was still being treated and in which clinic. The State’s Attorney’s Office was informed that the applicant had changed her address and on 25 October 2010 requested the police to provide information on the applicant’s new address.
On 4 November 2010 the applicant informed the Porto Labour Court of her new address and that she had not been certified as medically fit yet.
On 5 January 2011 the court requested the Forensic Institute (Instituto de Medicina Legal) to make a medical examination of the applicant, which was made on 27 February 2011. The medical report was submitted by the Forensic Institute on 3 March 2011 in which it referred that further clinical data and an additional examination were still needed.
On 9 March 2011 the Porto Labour Court the collection of those data and the realisation of the additional examination, which were submitted on 26 May and 15 June 2011, respectively. On 12 October 2011 the Forensic Institute submitted its final report.
On 24 October 2011 the State’s Attorney’s Office scheduled a conciliatory hearing between the parties on 23 November 2011.
The conciliatory hearing was adjourned to 24 January 2012 due to the lack of notification of the applicant’s employer. On 24 January 2012 the hearing was again adjourned to 14 March 2012 at the request of the applicant. On this date the conciliatory stage ended without an agreement between the parties.
On 2 April 2012 the applicant requested the Porto Labour Court to continue with the judicial stage of the proceedings against her employer and the insurance company.
Between 8 June 2012 and 21 November 2012 several procedural steps took place, mostly notifications, provision of information from the parties to the Porto Labour Court and a medical examination at the request of the applicant.
The hearing started on 20 February and continued on 28 February 2013.
On 8 March 2013 the Porto Labour Court delivered its decision in which it ruled against the applicant.
The relevant parts of the Code of Labour Procedure provide as follow:
“Actions emerging from labour accidents and from occupational diseases are of an urgent nature ...”
“If the victim is still not healed when the notification [of the accident] is made and if he/she is not getting proper treatment or without receiving compensation for temporary incapacity, the State’s Attorney’s Office shall request an expert medical report followed by an attempt to conciliate ...”
