Nevertheless, the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it is subject to limitations permitted by implication, in particular where the conditions of admissibility of an appeal are concerned since by its very nature it calls for regulation by the State, which enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in this regard (see, for example, Garc\u00eda Manibardo v.

However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce a person\u2019s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired; specifically, such limitations will only be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if they pursue a legitimate aim and there is a proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (see Gu\u00e9rin v.

As regards the applicant\u2019s alleged procedural mistakes, it was the plaintiff and not the applicant who had set the unrealistic value of the dispute, which the applicant apparently challenged before he had concluded his own response to the claim (see paragraphs 12, 13, 24 (Article 297 \u00a7 5) and 31 above; also, compare and contrast to Dobri\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 54).\u00a0It further transpires that the Municipal Court, arguably before it had genuinely opened a discussion of the subject matter at the main hearing of these unorthodox proceedings, had complied with its obligation to establish the proper value of the dispute (approximately 6,700 euros) instead of the clearly inadequate amount specified by the plaintiff in his claim (approximately 15 euros). The Municipal Court thus issued a formal decision (re\u0161enje) on the newly assessed value of the dispute (compare and contrast to Dobri\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 54) and, furthermore, ordered the plaintiff to pay additional court stamp duty in this respect (compare and contrast to Garzi\u010di\u0107, cited above, ibid.). The value of the dispute, which was above the threshold required for the lodging of an appeal on points of law, was clearly and repeatedly stated in the lower courts\u2019 judgments. The applicant was therefore entitled to believe that an appeal on points of law would be available to him in due course and if needed.",

The Court\u2019s role is not, save in the event of evident arbitrariness, to question it (see, among many authorities, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50, 20 October 2011; see also paragraph 26 above), but to verify whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see Kuchoglu v. Bulgaria, no. 48191/99, \u00a7 50, 10 May 2007). The authorities should respect and apply domestic legislation in a foreseeable and consistent manner and the prescribed elements should be sufficiently developed and transparent in practice in order to provide legal and procedural certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57). The Court considers that these requirements applied to the present case, particularly in view of the legal complexity of the issue in question, calling for more transparency than a mere dismissal of the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law by the Supreme Court without any further clarification of why it found the Municipal Court\u2019s conduct to be unlawful (compare and contrast to Dobri\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 54, where the Supreme Court had adopted a sufficiently reasoned decision). Therefore, even assuming that the refusal of the applicant\u2019s access to the Supreme Court was in accordance with the relevant domestic law and having accepted its legitimate aim, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s loss, in an unforeseeable and non-transparent manner, of the possibility of using a remedy which he had reasonably believed to be available, amounted to a disproportionate hindrance given that the applicant had not contributed to this situation in any respect.",
