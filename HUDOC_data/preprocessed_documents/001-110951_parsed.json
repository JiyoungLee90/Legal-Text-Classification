Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7\u00a0102, 8 February 2005; Goral v. Poland, no. 38654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov v. , no. 33977/96, \u00a7 81, 26 July 2001). After a certain period of time it no longer suffices and the domestic authorities are under an obligation to analyse the detainee\u2019s personal situation in greater detail and to give specific reasons for holding him in custody (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0177).",

The Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish the existence of concrete facts relevant to the grounds for continued detention. Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases. It remains to be ascertained whether the domestic authorities established and convincingly demonstrated the existence of concrete facts in support of their conclusions (see Avdeyev and Veryayev v.\u00a0Russia, cited above, \u00a7 65).",

They submitted that the applicant\u2019s permanent address had been located in another region of Russia and that his registration with the Ulyanovsk police had expired, which meant that he had no address at which he could be reached. The Court reiterates at the outset that according to its case-law, the absence of a fixed residence as such does not give rise to a danger of absconding (cf. Popkov v. Russia, no. 32327/06, \u00a7 59, 15 May 2008; Pshevecherskiy v. Russia, no. 28957/02, \u00a7 68, 24 May 2007; and Sulaoja v. Estonia, no.\u00a055939/00, \u00a7 64, 15 February 2005). Moreover, the Court stresses that the existence of a stable residence is a question of fact which is different and distinct from the issue of whether or not an individual has complied with the legal and administrative formalities for having his address registered with the competent authorities. In the instant case, out of some twenty judicial acts dealing with the matter of the applicant\u2019s detention, only two set out reasoned findings of fact concerning his residences in Ulyanovsk and in the Moscow Region (see paragraphs 14 and 21 above), whereas the others merely mentioned that he had omitted to renew the registration of his Ulyanovsk address with the local police.",

In these circumstances, the Court finds that the domestic courts failed to refer to specific and sufficient facts to demonstrate the risk of the applicant re-offending.
