The applicant was unaware that the land had been sold to her in breach of the law; the unlawfulness of her land purchase was only established by the District Court on 4 June 2004 (see paragraph 9 above). In this connection, and in the absence of any submissions by the Government to the contrary, the Court is satisfied that the applicant was a bona fide owner, and that her proprietary interest in the enjoyment of the land was sufficiently established (see Pyrantien\u0117, cited above, \u00a7 60, and Albergas and Arlauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 68-69).",

In these circumstances, the \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d is also based on a reasonably justified reliance on administrative decisions which have a sound legal basis and which bear on property rights (see Kopeck\u00fd v.

While the domestic courts did not make any findings in regard of that assessment, the Court finds it reasonable to conclude that the market value of the land in 2009, when the final judgment of the Supreme Court was adopted, was higher than the nominal price paid by the applicant in 1995. It should also be noted that the LTL 2,976 returned to the applicant had obviously suffered considerable devaluation and could not be reasonably related to the value of the land fourteen years later. Accordingly, the Court finds that the compensation of LTL 2,976 paid to the applicant in 2009 was clearly insufficient for the purchase of a new comparable plot of land (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikovi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 207).",
