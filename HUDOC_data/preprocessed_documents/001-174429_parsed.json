The Court holds that the requirement on the courts to assess medical expert reports in cases of alleged medical negligence cannot extend to imposing unnecessary or disproportionate burdens on the State in the enforcement of its positive obligations under Article 8. The intensity of the work required of the courts in terms of evaluation should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the nature and complexity of the medical issue concerned and, in particular, to whether the claimant alleging negligence on the part of medical practitioners had been able to put forward concrete, specific allegations of negligence necessitating a reply from medical experts mandated to draw up a report. Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that it has previously held that proceedings were ineffective vis-\u00e0-vis the procedural obligations where the final decision had been based on expert reports that had evaded or unsatisfactorily addressed the central question to be answered by the experts and where the applicants\u2019 decisive, or at least primary, arguments had not received a specific and explicit response (see Altu\u011f and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a032086/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077-86, 30 June 2015, where the medical reports had highlighted the existence of a risk to life in the event of a penicillin injection and found that the doctors had not been at fault without seeking to establish whether they had fulfilled their professional obligations).",
