The second applicant was partly of Ukrainian and partly of Chechen origin, and a Russian Orthodox. Between 1983 and 1985, the first applicant performed military service, following which he had worked as a carpenter and then as an apprentice at a periodical until 1992. In the beginning of 1995 he had worked at a hospital, helping wounded people. On 25\u00a0February 1995 he had been injured as a result of an explosion outside the hospital. In 1995 he had met a man called H, who accompanied the first and the second applicant to a mountain village. They had stayed there for twelve years until 6 October 2007. H had given the first applicant a camera in order to document the executions of villagers committed by the Russian federal troops. The first applicant had taken photographs and written reports concerning several such executions. The \u201cKardyrov group\u201d had been behind all those executions. The material had been sent to different television broadcasting companies, including the BBC. In return he had been provided with food. On 6 October 2007 the first applicant had received news that his wife and child had been kidnapped by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (\"the FSB\"). The second applicant had been tortured and raped for several days. On 11 October 2007 she had heard a male voice asking her and the child to be quiet and follow him. They had gone through a gate where another man was waiting for them and then hidden in a house in a village. On 31 October 2007 they had gone to another village where they stayed until 13 December 2007 when she was taken to the first applicant, with whom she and their child were reunited the following day. In the meantime, on 9 October 2007, while searching for his family, the first applicant contacted a military guard, who arrested him. The first applicant was wanted as a key figure and an agent had informed the FSB about him. There was a price on his head of 10.000 dollars. The first applicant had been detained in a cellar and forced under torture to provide information about the rebels, their hiding places and various radio signals. The torture included having a cross burned into his chest with cigarettes. After some time, he had been taken to a forest to be shot. He had been told to run, whereupon the FSB had fired at and hit him three times. He had lost consciousness. By chance he had survived and woke up on 11 October 2007 at a camp where he had been taken by rebels and where he had been operated on by a doctor. The latter told him that two rebels had been near to the place of his planned execution, had fired at the FSB officers and thereby prevented his execution. H came to see him on 14\u00a0October 2007 and informed him that he would be killed either by the FSB or by the rebels, who considered him as a traitor because he had revealed information about the rebel group under torture. H had therefore encouraged the first applicant to commit suicide. On 15 November 2007 he had confirmation that his wife and child were alive. Immediately after they were reunited on 14 December 2007, the family had left Russia.",

After having met H in 1994 the first and second applicant had moved to the mountain village and joined the rebels. He met Anna Politkovskaja only once, in February 2002. After that he had begun to forward copies of his work to her and to H. He had spoken with her on the telephone and she had planned to write a book about him. Her assistant had photographed them on the day they met. He had documented an estimated total of over a thousand crimes between 1995 and 2007. It was R, a man he worked together with as a journalist, who had told him that he was wanted by the occupying authorities. Having been subjected to torture and an execution attempt, he had learned in October 2007 that his wife and child were alive and they were reunited on 13 December 2007. The second applicant added that she had been physically and verbally abused by her kidnappers because she was not a \u201cpure\u201d Chechen. Before the Migration Board the applicants submitted three letters dated August 2008 from private persons of Swedish nationality, and a medical certificate dated 17 April 2008 which stated that the first applicant had wounds on his body which had \u201ca good relation\u201d with his explanation both of the timing and the extent of the torture to which he had allegedly been subjected.",

It agreed with the conclusion that the general situation in the Russian Federation was no ground for asylum as such and that an individual assessment should be made. It also found that the first applicant\u2019s injuries had probably been caused by ill-treatment resembling torture. However, even though the evidence supported his statements, and taking into account that victims of torture cannot be expected to provide completely coherent and consistent statements, the Migration Court did not consider that the first applicant had made probable why he had been subjected to abuse and by whom. In assessing the first applicant\u2019s credibility, the Migration Court noted that he had changed his statements several times on central points. Regarding his alleged contacts with Anna\u00a0Politkovskaja, the Migration Court noted, in addition to the discrepancies pointed out by the Migration Board, that in the request for appeal, it was stated that the first applicant had been in telephone contact with Anna Politkovskaja on several occasions, starting in 2000. During the oral hearing, on the other hand, he had stated that he had only met her once in 2002 and had had no contact with her before or after that, except through a contact person. Furthermore, the Migration Court noted that it was unclear how he had established contact with Anna Politkovskaja in the first place. According to his submission of 13 May 2008, he had met her when he worked for Amnesty International. However, during the oral hearing before the Migration Court he had stated that he had sought contact with her through contact persons who worked in the same field as he did. As to the first applicant\u2019s alleged journalistic work, the Migration Court noted that the description of his activities had been remarkably vague, and that although he claimed that he had collected material for several years he had not been able to provide any concrete examples of what he had done. Nor had he been able to provide any form of evidence of his work. Thus the Migration Court found reason to question the credibility of the applicants\u2019 statements. Two members of the Migration Court dissented and found that the divergences in the applicants\u2019 explanation concerned insignificant issues and that the applicants could not substantiate their story more than they already had done.",

Despite these positive steps to improve the quality of life of the people living in the region, the situation in the North Caucasus continued to present major challenges for the protection of human rights. The Commissioner defined some of the most serious problems in terms of the protection of human rights in the republics visited as being the issues of counter-terrorism measures, of abductions, disappearances and ill-treatment, of combating impunity and of the situation of human rights defenders.

Referring to the far-reaching effects of disappearances on a society as a whole, he supported the proposal of the Presidential Council for Civil Society Institutions and Human Rights to create an interdepartmental federal commission to determine the fate of persons who had gone missing during the entire period of counter-terrorism operations in the North Caucasus. The Commissioner further emphasised the importance of the systematic application in practice of rules against the wearing of masks or non-standard uniforms without badges as well as against the use of unmarked vehicles in the course of investigative activities. He also encouraged wide dissemination of all reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment among all stakeholders.",

Despite these measures of a systemic, legislative and regulatory nature, the information gathered during the visit had led the Commissioner to conclude that the situation remained essentially unchanged in practice since his previous visit in September 2009. He emphasised the importance of effective investigations of possible violations by State actors of the right to life and the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment and called on the Russian leadership to deliver the unequivocal message that impunity would no longer be tolerated, to help create the requisite determination on the part of the investigators concerned (see paragraphs 65 et seq. of the report).",

However, Chechnya saw a decrease in violence from the previous year. Government personnel, rebels and criminal elements continued also to engage in abductions in the North Caucasus. Officials and observers disagreed on the number of victims. Human rights groups believed the number of abductions was under-reported due to the reluctance of victims\u2019 relatives to complain to the authorities for fear of reprisals. According to a report on the website Caucasian Knot, in 2010 approximately fifty people were kidnapped or unlawfully detained by armed parties in the North Caucasus, and only sixteen were freed. Allegedly, there was no accountability for government forces involved in abductions. There were continued reports that abductions were followed by beatings or torture to extract confessions and that abductions were conducted for political reasons. Security forces under the command of Chechen President Kadyrov allegedly played a significant role in abductions, either on their own initiative or in joint operations with federal forces. Human rights groups reported that these forces were frequently suspected of being responsible for disappearances and abductions, including those of family members of rebel commanders and fighters.",

Those most at risk belonged to the following groups: NGO and human rights activists; victims, their lawyers, witnesses and their families; journalists; government opponents and returnees from abroad and their relatives. The report noted that returnees from abroad were generally immediately detained, questioned about their stay abroad and sometimes tortured. The questioning did not necessarily stop after their release from detention. Returnees and their relatives had to expect arbitrary detention at any time. In individual cases, criminal suspicions were invented so that returners could be ill-treated as a form of punishment for leaving Chechnya in the first place (see pages 10 to 17 of the report).",

They further risked being suspected of holding information about anti-Kadyrov elements of the Chechen diaspora in Western European countries and were often interrogated on their return to Chechnya. A returnee would need explicitly to unite with the government and Kadyrov\u2019s policies (see pages 56 et seq. of the report). On the other hand, the International Organisation for Migration (\u201cthe IOM\u201d) in Russia reported on voluntary returns to Chechnya which were considered a success. In 2010 the IOM assisted approximately 2,000 returns to the North Caucasus. The IOM conducted regular visits to Chechnya and met returnees there. The organisation conceded however that it was difficult to assess the situation in Chechnya on such short visits. It was also emphasised that the number of returnees in a particular IOM project might be too low to reflect fully the situation of returnees in general (see pages 62 et seq. of the report).",

Returnees were reportedly called to meetings with the Federal Security Services and the Ministry of the Interior, where they were questioned, often with threats and ill-treatment and demands for payment.

Nor was he able to provide any evidence of these activities whatsoever, which seems remarkable considering his claim that he provided written and photographic material to, among others, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Anna Politkovskaja, as well as to the BBC and other television broadcasting companies. This was even more remarkable in view of the fact that in the interview on 16 September 2008 with the Migration Board the first applicant had stated that he had documented an estimated number of more than a thousand crimes, which indicated that his alleged work was extensive in scope. No satisfactory explanation for this complete lack of evidence of his alleged work was ever presented in the domestic proceedings, as noted by both the Migration Board and the Migration Court. In addition, in several respects there were shortcomings and inconsistencies in the applicants\u2019 statements. The Government also found it unlikely, in view of the applicants\u2019 statement that they had not been in possession of any identity papers since 1994, that such a situation would not have caused the first applicant serious problems in his alleged journalistic work since he must regularly have faced police controls and road blocks.

The Court is also aware of the reported interrogations of returnees and of harassment and possible detention and illtreatment by the Federal Security Service or local law-enforcement officials and also by criminal organisations.

Sweden, no. 41827/07, \u00a7 52, 9 March 2010). But at the same time it acknowledges that owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker\u2019s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, N. v.

Notably, as to the first applicant\u2019s explanation that he was a key figure and wanted by the Russian authorities with a significant price on his head because he had carried out journalistic work to their detriment, the Migration Court pointed out that his statements had been remarkably vague and that although he claimed that he had collected material for twelve years, he had not been able to provide any concrete examples of what he had done or been able to provide any form of evidence of his work. Thus, the Migration Court found reason to question the credibility of the first applicant\u2019s statements.",

The Court is aware that in R.C. v. Sweden (quoted above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050 and 55), it found that since the asylum seeker in that case had proven that he had been subjected to torture, the onus rested with the State to dispel any doubts about the risk of his being subjected again to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the event that the expulsion were carried out. However, leaving aside deportations to countries where the general situation is sufficiently serious to conclude that the return of any refused asylum seeker thereto would constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court acknowledges that in order for a State to dispel a doubt such as mentioned in R.C. v. Sweden, the State must at least be in a position to assess the asylum seeker\u2019s individual situation. However, this may be impossible, when there is no proof of the asylum seeker\u2019s identity and when the statement provided to substantiate the asylum request gives reason to question his or her credibility. Moreover, as stated above, the Court\u2019s established case-law is that in principle it is for the person to be expelled to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any doubts about it. Accordingly, the Court considers that where an asylum seeker, like the first applicant, invokes that he or she has previously been subjected to illtreatment, whether undisputed or supported by evidence, it may nevertheless be expected that he or she indicates that there are substantial and concrete grounds for believing that upon return to the home country he or she would be exposed to a risk of such treatment again, for example because of the asylum seeker\u2019s political activities, membership of a group in respect of which reliable sources confirm a continuing pattern of illtreatment on the part of the authorities, a pending arrest order, or other concrete difficulties with the authorities concerned (see, inter alia, H.N.\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 30720/09, \u00a7 40, 15 May 2012; Yakubov v.

As to the Court\u2019s request for documentation or evidence of the first applicant\u2019s work, the Court received a compilation of incidents allegedly documented by the first applicant during the period from 1995 to 2007. He did not develop on the link between his work and the compilation of incidents. Moreover, he submitted only one example of an article (see paragraph 20) allegedly based on his reports, but he contended that he was not in possession of any articles where his name was mentioned. The Court notes in addition that the first applicant did not submit any articles written by him either, whether unsigned or written under a pseudonym, nor did he point to one single photograph taken by him and published by one of the many wellknown sources or media which he claimed had used his material. In these circumstances, the Court must conclude that the first applicant have failed to present any documents or information which would lead it to depart from the domestic authorities\u2019 conclusion that there are reasons to doubt the applicant\u2019s credibility.",

Sweden, no.\u00a041827/07, 9 March 2010).",

In fact, they presented a story which gave rise to serious doubts about its credibility. Whilst they were given numerous opportunities \u2013 both by the domestic authorities and by this Court \u2013 to substantiate their claims and to explain the inconsistencies in their submissions, they failed to do so, providing instead \u201cstrikingly brief\u201d and vague information in respect of both the first applicant\u2019s alleged journalistic activities and the alleged illtreatment.",

The Migration Court merely \u201cfound that the first applicant\u2019s injuries had probably been caused by illtreatment resembling torture\u201d (see paragraph 16). Further, it \u201cdid not consider that the first applicant had made probable why he had been subjected to abuse and by whom\u201d. Thus, in the absence of any clear and consistent information from the applicants, the domestic authorities conducted a thorough assessment of their submissions and came to the conclusion that these submissions were unfounded. We see no reason to reproach them for a failure \u201cto make assessment of this specific risk in the applicants\u2019 case, notably that the first applicant has significant and visible scars on his body\u201d (see paragraph 67) \u2013 it is precisely because their story as a whole, including the alleged ill-treatment, lacked credibility that the authorities concluded that there had been no real risk for the applicants in the event of deportation.",

We find it a bit odd that the majority, whilst doubting \u2013 like the domestic authorities \u2013 the credibility of the applicants\u2019 story, nevertheless concluded that the Russian local authorities would be able to \u201csee scars [that had] occurred in recent years which would indicate that he took [an] active part in the second war in Chechnya\u201d.",

These injuries in themselves, unlike, for instance, gunshot wounds or other battle injuries, have no obvious and incontestable connection to military operations. Moreover, it is unclear how these injuries, which appeared in 2007 and were confirmed by medical examination in 2008, can still have the same implication six years later.",
