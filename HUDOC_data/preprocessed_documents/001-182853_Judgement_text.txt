The case originated in an application (no. 75139/10) against Montenegro lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Montenegrin and Norwegian national, Mr Igor Vujović (“the applicant”), on 13 December 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr Đ. Čepić, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Pavličić.
On 3 December 2014 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government. Pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court the complaint concerning the outcome of the criminal proceedings in question was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Oslo, Norway.
On 26 April 2000 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and one other person in connection with a traffic accident which had resulted in death of a child.
On 25 February 2003 the Court of First Instance in Podgorica convicted the applicant for endangering public traffic and sentenced him and his co-accused to one year and six months’ imprisonment.
On an unspecified date in 2006 the High Court in Podgorica quashed this judgment and remitted case back to the Court of First Instance.
On 18 April 2007 the Court of First Instance adopted a new judgment and again convicted the applicant and his co-accused. But the court reduced the sentence to one year and four months’ imprisonment.
On 13 November 2009 the High Court further reduced the sentence of the applicant’s co-accused, but upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in respect of the applicant.
The applicant’s subsequent appeal against the judgment of the High Court was rejected on 14 June 2010.
Following that rejection, on an unspecified date in 2010, the applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law (zahtjev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosnažne presude) with the Supreme Court.
On 26 October 2010 the Supreme Court rejected this appeal.
On 11 December 2010 the applicant lodged an action for fair redress (tužba za pravično zadovoljenje) with the Supreme Court, complaining about the overall length of criminal proceedings. It was rejected on 31 December 2010.
On 19 April 2013 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s ultimate appeal.
