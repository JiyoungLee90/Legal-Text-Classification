Austria (dec.), no.\u00a074159/01, 9\u00a0October 2003). In the Court\u2019s view, a detailed examination as to whether the applicants, or their predecessors, could have made more efficient use of the remedy by using it at other stages of the proceedings, would overstretch the duties incumbent on an applicant pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Kern v. , no.\u00a014206/02, \u00a7\u00a049, 24 February 2005, and, mutatis mutandis, Wohlmeyer Bau GmbH\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a020077/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 8\u00a0July 2004). This is all the more so, as the applicants have used the remedy not only once but on two occasions, namely on 12 January 1998 and again on 16 January 2001. The Court concludes that the applicants complied with their obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. Thus, the Government\u2019s objection on non-exhaustion has to be dismissed.",
