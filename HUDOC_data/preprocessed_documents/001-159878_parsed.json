Neither the judgment of 25\u00a0April 2007 nor that of 15 October 2009 acknowledged, implicitly or explicitly, that she had unlawfully remained in prison in that period. The ground for awarding the applicant compensation was her acquittal rather than the alleged irregularity of her delayed release (compare Shkarupa v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a036461/05, \u00a7 76, 15 January 2015, and Shalya v.\u00a0Russia, no. 27335/13, \u00a7\u00a019, 13 November 2014).
