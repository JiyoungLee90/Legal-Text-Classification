Under the provisions of the Polish law such a decision provided, to the applicant as a legal successor of the former owner, the right to have the property restored to him, or, failing that, the right to compensation. The Court thus notes that the decision to set aside the final expropriation decision had consequences for the applicant which should be regarded as conferring on him a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of possessions within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention.",

Even though the applicant contested the amount of the compensation awarded, he did not appeal against the Minister\u2019s decision in compliance with the procedural law. The compensation decision became final and enforceable. On 30 August 2006 the Pozna\u0144 District Court authorised the State Treasury to make a security deposit, enabling the applicant to actually receive the money.",
