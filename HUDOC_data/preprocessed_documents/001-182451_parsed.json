It was subsequently established as a public holiday on\u00a0\u00a0 22 April 2009 by Law no. 5892. The Court further takes note of the fact that the two largest trade unions, namely the D\u0130SK (Devrimci \u0130\u015f\u00e7i Sendikalar\u0131 Konfederasyonu \u2013 Confederation of Revolutionary Workers\u2019 Trade Unions) and the KESK (Kamu Emek\u00e7ileri Sendikalar\u0131 Konfederasyonu \u2013 Confederation of Public Employees\u2019 Trade Unions) had made an announcement well in advance that their members would be gathering in Istanbul to celebrate the Labour Day and to commemorate their friends who had lost their lives during the demonstrations of 1 May 1977 (see Disk and Kesk v. Turkey, no. 38676/08, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6, 27 November 2012).",

It is also clear from the case file that disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the applicant for being absent from work without leave and in the course of the disciplinary proceedings against him, the applicant explicitly stated that he had been absent because he had participated in the demonstration organised by his trade union to celebrate the Labour Day. The disciplinary bodies were thus made explicitly aware of the reasons for his absence. Nevertheless, without the reasons for his absence being taken into account, the applicant was subsequently given a warning, under Law no. 657, as a disciplinary sanction owing to his absence without leave.",

Turkey (no.\u00a06615/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39, 27 March 2007), it had found a violation of Article\u00a011 of the Convention as the applicant had participated in a trade union activity. However in the present case the reasoning of the disciplinary sanction was the applicant\u2019s absence from work without leave. In this connection, the Court notes that even before it became an official holiday in 2009, 1 May (Labour Day) was a highly symbolic day for trade union members, and was considered as a day of commemoration and celebration (see para. 19 above). The authorities could not have ignored the reason of his absence considering, all the more, that the demonstration was announced publicly by two of the largest trade unions and they were informed about it.\u00a0Thus, it is safe to presume that the authorities were well aware of the reasons of the applicant\u2019s absence as the demonstration in question was announced at the national level in advance. Moreover, it is of importance for the Court, in its assessment of the necessity of the interference under Article\u00a011 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, that in the course of the investigation, the applicant had explained the reason of his absence by stating that he had participated in a trade union activity. Nevertheless, in their evaluation the disciplinary authorities failed to take into consideration, either explicitly or in substance, whether it was justified to issue a warning pursuant to Section\u00a0125 of Law no. 657 in the particular circumstances of the case.",
