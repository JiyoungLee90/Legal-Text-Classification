The case originated in an application (no. 34976/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian limited partnership, presently under liquidation, Metalco Bt. “f. a.” (“the applicant”), on 10 September 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr J. Dobos, its owner and chief executive officer. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant complained that its litigation with the Tax Authority lasted an unreasonably long time, was unfair and resulted in the loss of the value of its share held in another company. It relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
On 30 March 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant is a limited partnership under liquidation, with its seat in Pécs.
In 1996 the Tax Authority established that the applicant owed some 10 million Hungarian forints (HUF) in outstanding taxes. To secure this claim, on 10 April 1997 it attached a 100%-share the applicant had in another company, which was nominally worth over HUF 103 million. Aware of the applicant’s own intention to sell the share by 30 June 1997, the Tax Authority forbade the transaction but did not proceed to auctioning it within the statutory two-month deadline or afterwards.
In the ensuing two-year-long administrative procedure, the applicant’s tax debt was eventually cancelled and the asset unfrozen. However, by that time the company in which the share belonged had been liquidated – as of July 1997 – and the share had lost its value altogether.
Some time in 1999 the applicant sued the Tax Authority for damages. On 12 December 2000 the  awarded it HUF 103 million. On 13 June 2002 the Supreme Court quashed this decision. On 3 June 2003 the  again found for the plaintiff.
On appeal, on 6 May 2004 the Pécs Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and rejected the applicant’s action. It held in essence that there had been no causal link between the Tax Authority’s unlawful omission to hold an auction to sell the attached asset within two months from its attachment, as required by section 116(1) of the Enforcement Act 1994, and the damage the plaintiff had sustained. In the court’s view, the burden of proof to show that had there been a timely auction the share could have successfully been sold to a buyer with the requisite liquidity lay with the applicant. However, the applicant could not prove this assertion. The court observed that the buyer suggested by the applicant had never had, according to its books, the capital needed for the acquisition; that the company in which the share belonged had lost all its own capital by early 1997 and been in liquidation as of July 1997; and that its manager had been convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy.
On 16 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s petition for review. This decision was served on 22 April 2005. The applicant’s request for a re-opening was to no avail.
