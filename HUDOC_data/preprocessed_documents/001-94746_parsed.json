Before both officials, the applicant retracted his police statement, alleging that he had been forced to sign it.

As a result this restriction applied as a blanket rule and the applicant could not request the benefit of legal assistance during his police custody. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government's preliminary objection regarding the exhaustion of domestic remedies. As to the Government's contention that the applicant failed to comply with the six months time-limit, the Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8\u00a0February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I). In the present case, the applicant lodged his application with the Court within six months of the delivery of the final decision given by the Court of Cassation. He therefore lodged his application to the Court within the six month time-limit, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.
