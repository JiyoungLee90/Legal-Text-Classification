The court argued that any list of medicines is susceptible of being amended all the time; otherwise, the use of any new drug proved to have positive effects on the evolution of cancer would be impossible for at least one or two years after it became available owing to administrative barriers and logistical formalities meant to ensure that its cost could be reimbursed by the FNUASS; this delay would have only negative repercussions for the health of the population. Furthermore, the court held that in so far as in the applicant\u2019s case there was no other drug available as a replacement for Avastin, and considering that failure to use it would have repercussions for the evolution of his illness, the State authorities should have made it possible to have Avastin rapidly included on the list of reimbursable drugs.",
