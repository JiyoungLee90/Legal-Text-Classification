The case concerns the length of the civil proceedings initiated by the applicants in order to recover possession of a property which had been nationalised under the former communist regime and had been sold by the State to third parties.
The applicants were born in 1927, 1931, 1936 and 1932 respectively and live in Bucharest. Ms Maria Nicola Georgescu also holds Belgian nationality. Mr Ioan Mihai Nistor died in 2006 and his heirs, Ms Magdalena-Niculina Nistor (his wife) and Maria Nistor (his sister, the second applicant) expressed their intention to pursue the application on his behalf. Ms Maria Nistor died in 2010 and Mr Mircea Nestor (the third applicant, her sole heir), expressed his intention to pursue the application on her behalf.
The applicants were represented by Ms M.N. Georgescu, a lawyer practising in Bucharest.
The Government were represented by their Agent, most recently Ms O.F. Ezer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 05 August 1996 the applicants lodged an action before the Constanţa District Court seeking to recover possession of a property which had been nationalised in 1950 from their respective grandfathers, the brothers V.N. and C.I.N., under the former communist regime and then sold to third parties.
The case was examined by six courts representing three levels of jurisdiction. After a first set of proceedings, on 27 September 1999, the Constanţa Court of Appeal, acting as a court of last resort, sent the case back to the first instance court, as it found that the latter had failed to establish the scope of the application and the object of the case and to identify the parties to the proceedings. In a final decision of 20 December 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice found that the nationalisation of the property in question had been lawful.
