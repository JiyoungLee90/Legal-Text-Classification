As has been stated many times in the Court's judgments, not only is democracy a fundamental feature of the European public order but the Convention was designed to promote and maintain the ideals and values of a democratic society. Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article\u00a011, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a041340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08689, ECHR 2003II, and Christian Democratic Peoples Party v.\u00a0Moldova, 28793/02, 14\u00a0May 2006).",

For pluralism is also built on genuine recognition of, and respect for, diversity and the dynamics of cultural traditions, ethnic and cultural identities, religious beliefs and artistic, literary and socio-economic ideas and concepts. The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a044158/98, \u00a7\u00a092, 17\u00a0February 2004).",

Genuine and effective respect for freedom of association and assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 nor with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of these freedoms (see Wilson & the National Union of Journalists and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a030668/96, 30671/96 and 30678/96, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2002V, and Ouranio Toxo v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a074989/01, 20\u00a0October 2005, \u00a7\u00a037).

The Court observes that the refusals to give authorisation could have had a chilling effect on the applicants and other participants in the assemblies.

However, the exercise of freedom of expression by elected politicians who at the same time are holders of public offices in the executive branch of government entails particular responsibility. In certain situations it is a normal part of the duties of such public officials personally to take administrative decisions which are likely to affect the exercise of individual rights, or that such decisions are given by public servants acting in their name. Hence, the exercise of freedom of expression by such officials may unduly impinge on the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed by the Convention (as regards statements by public officials, amounting to declarations of a person's guilt, pending criminal proceedings, see Butkevi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a048297/99, \u00a7\u00a053, ECHR 2002II (extracts); see also Allenet de Ribemont v.\u00a0France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-36, and Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04144, ECHR 2000X). When exercising their freedom of expression they may be required to show restraint, bearing in mind that their views can be regarded as instructions by civil servants whose employment and careers depend on their approval.",

The Court is fully aware of the differences between administrative and judicial proceedings. It is true that it is only in respect of the latter that the Convention stipulates, in its Article\u00a06, the requirement that a tribunal deciding on a case should be impartial from both a subjective and an objective point of view (see Findlay v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 25\u00a0February 1997, Reports 1997I, \u00a7\u00a073, and Warsicka v.\u00a0Poland, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-37, no.\u00a02065/03, 16\u00a0January 2007).",

It is further noted that the Mayor expressed these views when a request for permission to hold the assemblies was already pending before the municipal authorities.
