The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in .
On 24 March 1992 the applicant claimed restitution of real property before the Považská Bystrica District Court. He relied on the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitations Act.
The District Court held a number of hearings and took extensive evidence. In a judgment of 11 August 1995 it ordered the defendant to restore the property to the applicant.

After several hearings the District Court delivered its second judgment on 13 January 2000. It granted the applicant’s claim. The defendant appealed. On 30 November 2001 the court of appeal quashed that judgment.
In a third judgment, delivered on 26 February 2004, the District Court ordered the defendant to restore the property to the applicant. The  quashed the judgment on 10 May 2005.

Between 8 December 1994 and 19 April 1995 the parties had attempted to reach an agreement. The applicant had failed to appear before the court on 15 September 1992, 15 December 1997, 10 and 25 May 1999 and 10 January 2000.
