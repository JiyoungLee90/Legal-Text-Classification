These considerations applied in the present case.

However, it was not encouraged or supported either, because of the inherent risks. Health professionals who encouraged unsafe home births, overstepped the limits of their licences and disregarded the rules of their profession might face administrative sanctions. Statistics, however, did not disclose that this provision dissuaded mothers from giving birth at home: in 2008 and 2009, some 150 planned home births had taken place annually whereas only one single administrative procedure had been instituted in connection with home birth. There was no evidence that birth care professionals were effectively discouraged by the legislation from providing assistance to those in need, that obtaining the necessary assistance was impeded by the lack of regulations, or that there were legal obstacles to women exercising their right to self-determination in respect of giving birth.",

The notion of a freedom implies some measure of choice as to its exercise. The notion of personal autonomy is a fundamental principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees of Article 8 (cf. Pretty, loc. cit.). Therefore the right concerning the decision to become a parent includes the right of choosing the circumstances of becoming a parent. The Court is satisfied that the circumstances of giving birth incontestably form part of one's private life for the purposes of this provision; and the Government did not contest this issue. The Court notes that the applicant was not prevented as such from giving birth at home. However, the choice of giving birth in one's home would normally entail the involvement of health professionals, an assumption not disputed by the parties. For the Court, legislation which arguably dissuades such professionals who might otherwise be willing from providing the requisite assistance constitutes an interference with the exercise of the right to respect for private life by prospective mothers such as the applicant.",

The concept of lawfulness in the Convention, apart from positing conformity with domestic law, also implies qualitative requirements in the domestic law such as foreseeability and, generally, an absence of arbitrariness (Rekv\u00e9nyi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, \u00a7 59, ECHR 1999III). The Court notes that it has found that the law itself constitutes the interference with the applicant's right to respect for private life (see paragraph 22 above) but considers that this conclusion does not preclude an examination of whether the quality of the law meets the requirements of the notion of \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d in paragraph 2 of Article 8.",

It is true that, in this regard, the State has a wide margin of appreciation; however, the regulation should ensure a proper balance between societal interests and the right at stake. In the context of home birth, regarded as a matter of personal choice of the mother, this implies that the mother is entitled to a legal and institutional environment that enables her choice, except where other rights render necessary the restriction thereof. For the Court, the right to choice in matters of child delivery includes the legal certainty that the choice is lawful and not subject to sanctions, directly or indirectly. At the same time, the Court is aware that, for want of conclusive evidence, it is debated in medical science whether, in statistical terms, homebirth as such carries significantly higher risks than giving birth in hospital.",

At the same time, section 101(2) of Government Decree no.\u00a0218/1999 sanctions health professionals who carry out activities within their qualifications in a manner which is incompatible with the law or their licence (see paragraph 9 above). For the Court, these legal provisions may reasonably be seen as contradictory in the context of assisting home births, an issue otherwise unregulated under Hungarian law. The Court notes in this connection that the Government admitted that in at least one case proceedings were instituted against a health professional for having assisted home birth. It also takes cognisance of the task given by Act\u00a0no.\u00a0CLIV of 2009 to the Government to regulate the matter in a decree (see paragraph 10 above). However, the parties agree that such regulations have not been enacted to date, although the Government accepted their necessity (see paragraph 18 above). These considerations enable the Court to conclude that the matter of health professionals assisting home births is surrounded by legal uncertainty prone to arbitrariness. Prospective mothers cannot therefore be considered as freely benefiting from such assistance, since a permanent threat is being posed to health professionals inclined to assist home births by virtue of Government Decree no.\u00a0218/1999 as well as the absence of specific, comprehensive legislation on the matter. The lack of legal certainty and the threat to health professionals has limited the choices of the applicant considering home delivery. For the Court, this situation is incompatible with the notion of \u201cforeseeability\u201d and hence with that of \u201clawfulness\u201d.",

Such choice would have been a liberty in the 19th century. As long as there is no State interference with the freedom, there seems to be no problem. But the background assumption of classical liberalism does not necessarily work in the contemporary welfare State, especially in the medical environment. In this welfare system practically everything is regulated; regulation is the default, and only what is regulated is considered safe and acceptable. Suddenly, in the absence of positive regulation, what was a matter of uncontested private choice becomes unusual and uncertain. In a very densely regulated world some disadvantages emerge for freedoms without regulatory endorsement.",

The sanctions applicable to midwives discourage their participation in home-birth-related activities. Where regulation is the default, as in the medical context, lack of enabling regulation may be detrimental to the exercise of the right, and traditional non-interference will not be sufficient. This may be one of the many unpleasant consequences of living in an overregulated world. It is here that an affirmation of a liberty in positive law is warranted.",

The real issue is whether the lapse of time can transform someone who is not a victim into a victim, in the light of his/her claim? Or, in other words, can the lapse of time by itself alone bring the victim status to the applicant? There has not been a single change of circumstances of the case between the moment of filing the application with the Court and the moment of giving judgment on the case. That is why I fail to understand how the lapse of time alone, without provoking any change of material circumstances, could have altered the applicant's situation under Article 34 of the Convention.

In the case at stake the character of primary legislation is permissive, which represents the ground for distinguishing the present case from the situation in Klass and Others.
