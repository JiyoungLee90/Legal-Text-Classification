The case originated in an application (no. 30475/03) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by  “Moldovahidromaş”, a company registered in Chişinău, on 18 September 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr N. Moşcin, a lawyer practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Pârlog.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that its right to a fair hearing and its right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions were breached as a result of the quashing of the final judgment of 23 October 1992.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court).
On 12 October 2004 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. On 4 April 2006 the application was declared partly admissible. The Court found that the applicant could claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as the current owner of the property concerned by the original judgment, despite the fact that the judgment as such did not concern the applicant.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
By Government order of 19 June 1990 the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the  was given the right to manage the property of “Moldovahidromaş” (the State-owned legal predecessor of the applicant, hereinafter “M.”). On 28 November 1990 the Ministry of Heavy Industry concluded with the staff employed within M.’s scientific laboratory a contract for the creation of a separate association (întreprindere de arendă) to hold and manage the laboratory (“Hidrotehnica”, hereinafter “H.”).
The Ministry of Industry of  (“the Ministry”) later considered that contract to be unlawful. On 1 September 1992 it ordered H.’s liquidation. H. challenged that order in court. The Ministry also initiated court proceedings for the annulment of the contract creating H.
On 23 September 1992 M. made a statement about its registration as a shared company, 58.2% of the shares of which were to be distributed to the staff and the rest remained State property. According to the statement, the final evaluation of the company’s assets was to be based on the accounting situation on 31 December 1992 and on the assets evaluation document to be drawn up. The period for the staff to subscribe for stock was set at between 25 September 1992 and 25 March 2003. M. also declared its right subsequently to be privatised in accordance with the law by becoming a public limited company.
On 22 October 1992 the Economic Court of Moldova annulled the Ministry’s order of 1 September 1992 since the Ministry had not been competent to order the liquidation of a company.
On 23 October 1992 the same court accepted the Ministry’s court action and declared the contract for the creation of H. null and void (“the 1992 judgment”). That judgment was not appealed against and became final. The court also ordered the liquidation of H., with the transfer of assets to the Ministry and the publication of an announcement in the press about its liquidation, setting a time-limit until 23 January 1993 for submitting any claims against H.
On 11 December 1992 the Ministry ordered H.’s liquidation pursuant to the court judgment of 23 October 1992 and the transfer of its assets to M., which was declared to be the legal successor of H. M.’s manager was ordered to create, on the basis of the property obtained from H., a subsidiary without a separate legal personality, to manage H.’s scientific laboratory and plant.
On 29 December 1992 M. registered its statute with the State Registration Chamber. The applicant company was thereby created and it retained the name of its legal predecessor, “Moldovahidromaş”. In respect of its assets, the statute referred to the statement of 23 September 1992.
On 30 December 1992 an “Act for the transfer and receipt of [H.]” was concluded. According to this Act, pursuant to the ’s judgment of 23 October 1992, H. was transmitted to the applicant. M.’s assets evaluation document was drawn up on 1 January 1993.
In an evaluation of the value of the applicant’s real estate dated 1 January 1994 referring to the accounting situation on 1 January 1993, subsidiary H.’s real estate was mentioned among the applicant’s property. On 4 June 1994 the applicant’s staff and the Government of Moldova signed the applicant’s constitutive contract, which replaced certain parts of the constitutive statement of 23 September 1992. In respect of the property in the applicant company owned by the State, the constitutive contract referred to the assets evaluation document of 1 January 1993.
Also in 1994 the applicant registered with the State Registration Chamber a subsidiary under the name “Hidrotehnica” (hereinafter “subsidiary H.”), to manage its laboratory and plant and to act on the basis of the applicant’s statute and that of subsidiary H. The applicant issued a general power of attorney to subsidiary H.’s director, authorising him to sign contracts, act in court and take financial decisions regarding H. In accordance with subsidiary H.’s statute, should that subsidiary be liquidated, its property was to be transferred back to the applicant. In the applicant’s request to a bank to open a sub-account for the use by its subsidiary H., the latter’s stamp was applied, which referred to its status as the applicant’s subsidiary.
In 1995 more of the State’s shares in the applicant company were privatised, which raised the total percentage of private ownership in the company to 75.3%.
In 1997 the court file regarding the 1992 proceedings was destroyed pursuant to regulations establishing a five-year limit for keeping such files in court archives.
On 30 June 1998 the applicant made changes to its statute. The new statute declared that the company had been created through the re-organisation of M. and H. and was the legal successor of both.
By 2001, the company was 100% privately-owned. On 24 July 2001 the Department of Privatisation and Administration of State Property issued the applicant a privatisation certificate. It listed the real estate included in the company’s constituting capital (capitalul social) in accordance with the evaluation act of 1 January 1993. Five buildings of subsidiary H. were included in that list. The certificate finally stated that the State had not entrusted the management of any State property to the applicant. In a letter of 18 May 2002 the same Department informed the Government and the staff of subsidiary H. that the latter could not claim the right to separate from the applicant in order to become a State company unless the applicant’s general assembly of stock holders decided so. It added that the entire property of H. had been transferred to M. following the 1992 judgment and the Ministry’s order of 11 December 1992 and that thereafter M. was privatised by selling stocks to the staff and on the stock exchange.
On 23 July 2002, on the initiative of a group in the staff of the subsidiary H., the Prosecutor General filed a request with the Supreme Court of Justice for the annulment of the 1992 judgment.
On 25 September 2002 the applicant informed the Supreme Court of Justice about the failure of the Prosecutor General to send it a copy of his request for the annulment of the 1992 judgment, as he was obliged to do by law, and asked to be recognised as a party to the proceedings. It received no reply. The applicant submitted its arguments against the annulment of the 1992 judgment and asked the court to reject the Prosecutor General’s request. On 29 October 2002 the applicant sent to the Supreme Court of Justice an addendum to its request, relying, inter alia, on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
On 11 October 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice informed the applicant about the date of the hearing of the case. Similar letters were sent to the applicant for the hearings of 11 December 2002, 22 January 2003 and 21 April 2003. In none of them was the applicant mentioned as a party to the proceedings. According to the Government, the applicant was represented before the Supreme Court of Justice in all these hearings and was informed about the decision of 21 April 2003 by that court.
On an unknown date thereafter the Prosecutor General withdrew the request. On 11 December 2002 the court upheld the Prosecutor General’s withdrawal of the request for annulment. On 22 January 2003 the court rejected the request for revision made by the “shareholders of H.” because they had no standing, not having participated in the 1992 proceedings.
The Prosecutor General filed a further request with the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice for the annulment of its judgment of 11 December 2002.
On 9 April 2003 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the request of the managing director of subsidiary H. to freeze all the company’s assets pending the court’s decision on the case.
On 21 April 2003 the applicant asked the Plenary Supreme Court of Justice to reject the Prosecutor General’s request for the annulment of the 1992 judgment. It received no reply.
On the same day the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the Prosecutor General’s request and quashed the judgment of 11 December 2002, ordering a re-hearing of the case by its own Economic Chamber.
On 23 April 2003 the applicant asked the Economic Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice to recognise it as a party to the proceedings and to order the Prosecutor General to send it a copy of his request for the annulment of the 1992 judgment. The applicant received no reply. The Government have not commented on this in its observations.
On 24 April 2003 the Economic Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the Prosecutor General’s request and quashed the 1992 judgment. It adopted a new judgment whereby it rejected the Ministry’s request to declare null and void the contract concluded in 1990 creating H. However, there was no annulment of the privatisation of the applicant’s predecessor, M., nor was any compensation awarded to the applicant.
On 7 May 2003 the applicant made a request for the annulment of the judgment of 24 April 2003. On 26 June 2003 the court rejected that request, referring to the new Code of Civil Procedure and the introduction of a new form of court proceedings (revision, see paragraph 41 below).
On 6 June 2003 the newly created H. was registered in the State register of companies and the subsidiary H. was deleted from that register. According to a letter from the Chamber of Commerce of 28 May 2003, there was no company called “Hidrotechnica” in the State register on 1 May 2003 and no such company had been deleted from the register. Moreover, no such company had been registered in 1990-1992. The applicant challenged in court the changes made to the State register.
On 26 June 2003 the applicant made a request for the revision of the judgment of 24 April 2003 on the ground, inter alia, that it had not been allowed to intervene in proceedings which affected its pecuniary rights. On 10 July 2003 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected the request as unfounded but gave no reasons.
On 22 July 2003 the applicant was informed about the hearing by the Supreme Court of Justice of H.’s request for an additional ruling. By its judgment of 24 July 2003 the Supreme Court of Justice decided that H., created by the 1990 contract, could be registered in the State register under the same name and that the 1994 registration of the applicant’s subsidiary H. should be deleted. At the same time, the court declared null and void all the decisions concerning the creation of the applicant’s subsidiary H., including the applicant’s decisions of 1992-1994.
On 18 February 2005 the Department of Privatisation of the  issued the applicant a new privatisation certificate. According to this certificate, following the Supreme Court of Justice judgment of 24 July 2003 and the registration, on 6 June 2003, of H. in the State register, the previously issued certificate of 24 July 2001 had been amended to exclude from the list of the applicant’s property the five buildings belonging to its subsidiary H.
H. also requested amendments to the State real estate register to confirm its title to the buildings previously registered as belonging to the applicant. On 25 March 2005 the Chişinău Court of Appeal accepted that request. That judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court of Justice on 22 June 2005. Both courts found that the applicant had lost to H. the ownership over those buildings following the judgment of 24 April 2003.
H. initiated court proceedings against the bank in which the applicant’s subsidiary H. had had its account, asking for the transfer of all the money in that account to its new account. The applicant was allowed to intervene as a third party, claiming that the money belonged to it, since its subsidiary had had to be closed following the annulment of the 1992 judgment and since the newly registered H. had not been declared to be the legal successor of subsidiary H. On 27 October 2005 the  accepted the applicant’s request. That judgment was quashed by the Chişinău Court of Appeal on 19 December 2005. On 16 February 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld that judgment. The court relied on the judgments of 24 April and 24 July 2003 which annulled the 1992 judgment and found that the money on H.’s account had been earned after the annulment of the 1992 judgment and from H.’s own resources.
On 18 May 2006 the Agent of the respondent Government informed the Prosecutor General about the Court’s decision of 4 April 2006 to declare partly admissible the present application. He annexed a copy of that decision and requested the Prosecutor General’s Office to contribute its comments as part of the Government’s observations to the Court regarding the present case. On an unknown date, the Prosecutor General’s Office asked the Supreme Court of Justice to revise its judgments of 24 April and 24 July 2003, invoking Article 449 (c) and (j) of the Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”, see paragraph 41 below) and the decision declaring partly admissible the present application. He annexed the Government Agent’s letter of 18 May 2006.
On 29 June 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected that request. It found that the request had not been accompanied by sufficient evidence of new and relevant facts in the form of an application pending before the European Court of Human Rights regarding the case at issue. Moreover, the Court had declared the application partly admissible but had not adopted a judgment on the substance of the complaints, which prevented the Supreme Court of Justice from revising the judgments of 24 April and 24 July 2003 on the basis of Article 449 (c) CCP.
The court also found that the documents annexed to the request did not disclose the Government’s position that a provision of the Convention had been violated as a result of the quashing of the 1992 judgment. Accordingly, Article 449 (j) CCP did not apply either.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the case of Roşca v. Moldova (no. 6267/02, §§ 16 and 17, 22 March 2005).
In addition, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure concerning revision of final judgments, where relevant, read as follows:
“Article 446: Court decisions which may be subject to revision
Final decisions ... and judgments of all courts may be subject to revision, under the conditions of the present Chapter.
Article 447: Persons who may lodge a request for revision:
The following have the right to lodge a request for revision:
...
(b) persons who have not participated in the proceedings but whose rights were violated by the relevant judgment;
...
Article 449: Reasons for granting a request for revision:
A revision request shall be granted when:
... (c) certain essential circumstances or facts of the case become known which did not and could not have been known to the applicant;
... (g) The court adopted a decision in respect of the rights of persons not participating in the proceedings;
(j) The Government of the Republic of Moldova, represented by their Agent, or the European Court of Human Rights, have initiated a friendly settlement procedure in a case pending against the Republic of Moldova, which [the Government] consider that the court’s judgment has seriously violated a right provided by the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova or the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;”
