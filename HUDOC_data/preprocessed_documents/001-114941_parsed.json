Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2000I; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a0128, ECHR 2004XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v.

It is desirable that public authorities act with the utmost care, in particular when dealing with matters of vital importance to individuals, such as welfare benefits and other such rights. In the present case, the Court considers that having discovered their mistake, the authorities failed in their duty to act speedily and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see\u00a0Moskal, cited above, \u00a7 72).
