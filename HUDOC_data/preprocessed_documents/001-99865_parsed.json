If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity (see Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a0102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).",

Turkey, nos. 71912/01, 26968/02 and 36397/03, \u00a7 54, 10 March 2009). The Court notes that the applicant alleged before the domestic authorities that he had been seriously ill-treated by the police. The credibility of that allegation could have been verified on the basis of the applicant's medical documentation of April 2002. However, even though the prosecutor seized the relevant documents shortly after the applicant had lodged his complaint, those documents not only remained without any evaluation, but went missing altogether while in the authorities' possession. This omission makes it more difficult for the Court to determine whether there was a reasonable suspicion underlying the applicant's allegation which would engage the authorities' obligation effectively to investigate it. At the same time, the Court is mindful of the fact that the responsibility for the aforementioned difficulty \u2013 the missing documents - lies with the State authorities rather than with the applicant. Furthermore, the Court does not lose sight of the findings of subsequent medical forensic reports, none of which contradicted the applicant's allegations. In sum, there is nothing in the case-file materials to convince the Court that the applicant's complaint of ill-treatment before the domestic authorities so devoid of any reasonable suspicion that it merited no investigation. It therefore finds that the State was bound in the present case by the positive obligation to investigate the allegation in an efficient and expedient manner.",

The authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis for their decisions (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103 et seq.).",

The Court does not rule out that such a delay could in principle have a negative impact on the efficiency of the investigation. In the present case, however, there are no reasons to regard it as a prima facie impediment for establishment of the truth, for the investigation could have relied on the applicant's medical documentation of April 2002, or alternatively it could have arranged for new X-rays, for which it was still not too late (see paragraph 34 above). None of these measures was undertaken. As noted above, the medical documentation of April 2002 disappeared from the investigation paperwork without trace, whereas the applicant's new X-ray, taken only in January 2007, was not capable of establishing the exact date of his injuries and, in any event, it too was lost, in unclear circumstances. It is also noteworthy that, firstly, the applicant did not fail to comply with any time-limits in raising his complaint, and, secondly, the investigation authorities themselves never invoked his delay as an obstacle to the investigation.",

Having regard to the reasons for the multiple remittals in the present case, which were unambiguously indicated by the Crimea Prosecutor or the Prosecutor General as largely based on the unlawfulness, prematurity and groundlessness of the investigation findings (see paragraph 17 above), the Court considers that such remittals indeed disclose serious deficiencies in the investigation. Its effectiveness is further undermined by the investigator's disregard for the instructions of the higher-level prosecutors, which seemed to be a regular practice (see paragraphs\u00a023 and 33 above).",
