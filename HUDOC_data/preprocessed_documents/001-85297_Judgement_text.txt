The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Sztum.
On 20 October 2000 the Otwock District Court remanded the applicant in custody, relying on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed aggravated murder and robbery. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence and the fact that the applicant was a recidivist offender. Finally, the court found that there were no special grounds, as specified in Article 259 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe preventive measure.

The court found that his continued detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.
On 27 August 2002 the  gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. He was also deprived of his civic rights for a period of five years. The court further ordered that the period spent by the applicant in pre–trial detention from 20 October 2000 up to the date of his conviction was to be deducted from the sentence imposed.
The applicant appealed. He was kept in detention pending the outcome of his appeal for three months.
On 26 November 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal heard the applicant’s appeal. It quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for retrial. It ordered that the applicant’s detention should continue.

On 4 September 2007 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
Between 27 June 1999 and 3 February 2004 the applicant served a prison sentence which had been imposed on him in two other sets of criminal proceedings.
On 6 October 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).
On 23 November 2004 the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court observed that the length of the proceedings could not be considered unreasonable. It examined the course of the impugned proceedings and held that there were no delays for which the  or Court of Appeal could be held responsible.
