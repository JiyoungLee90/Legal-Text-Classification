Later on, the proceedings were stayed by the decision of 13 January 1997, the domestic court having regard to the applicant\u2019s failure to comply with a renewed order to indicate the names and addresses of the successors of persons who had died since the appointment of the curator absenti in 1993. The applicant\u2019s subsequent attempts to advance the proceedings were unsuccessful, the courts repeatedly relying on her failure to identify all of the potential parties to the proceedings and to give their addresses. The court finally decided to discontinue the proceedings on 21 February 2005. The applicant\u2019s later efforts to have this decision set aside failed for similar reasons (see paragraphs 22-30 above).",

The Court considers that no convincing explanation has been provided as to why this was not done.",

When examining her successive appeals against refusals to resume the proceedings, the courts requested her to submit fifty copies of her procedural appeals (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, it is also relevant to note that the applicant had emphasised that the proceedings could have been terminated long before had proper use been made of the appointment of a curator absenti and the publication of press notice. Moreover, on 21 February 2005, she requested that the court publish a further press notice (see paragraph 22 above).",
