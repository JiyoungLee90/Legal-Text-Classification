The experts stated that a high level of the children\u2019s alienation from, and hostility towards, their mother was at present an obstacle to the immediate establishment of contact. The experts thus recommended referring the father for psychotherapy with a view to changing his attitudes toward the applicant, as well involving in that process the supervising officer, who should, in the course of supervising the exercise of the father\u2019s parental authority, also work with him towards that goal. They further recommended that, after a period of six months, the applicant be granted contact rights, to be exercised once a month for one hour on the premises of the Split Social Welfare Centre; thereafter, if the situation permitted, contact could be extended.",

That case-law also showed that the Constitutional Court very thoroughly examined complaints concerning the right to family life and placed special emphasis on the right of a child to have contact with both parents, as well as on the State\u2019s positive obligations to facilitate such contact. Lastly, under section 31(4) and (5) of the Constitutional Court Act that court had the power to designate a specific domestic authority to carry out its decisions and could order the specific manner of their execution (see paragraph 96 above). Therefore, had the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Split County Court\u2019s decision of 10\u00a0January 2013 (see paragraph 72 above), the Constitutional Court would have reviewed all the proceedings up until that point and could have ordered, either of its own motion or upon her request, specific measures to be taken with a view to re-establishing contact between the applicant and her sons.",

At that time much more subtle measures had been required than those of imposing fines on I.B. or taking away the children by force.

It further notes that in the period before the applicant lodged her application with the Court on 22 May 2013 (see paragraph 1 above), the domestic judicial and welfare authorities had considered that her contact rights had remained unenforced because of the children\u2019s strong resistance to meeting her and not because the children\u2019s father, I.B., had been obstructing the exercise of those rights (see,\u00a0in particular, paragraph 59, but also paragraphs 58, 64 and 67 above). That being so, the Court considers that the methods of enforcement available at the relevant time under Croatian law (fines, incarceration and the physical removal of the children, see section 345 of the Family Act, cited in paragraph 103 above) \u2013 all directed against an adult obstructing the enforcement of contact orders \u2013 could not have been considered effective in such a situation. The Court therefore cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies in that she did not appeal against the decision of 28 December 2011, and nor did she apply for enforcement of the decision of 6 August 2012, upheld by the decision of 10 January 2013, in the first set of proceedings concerning contact arrangements (see paragraphs 115-117 above).",

Even after those experts had established that the children\u2019s behaviour had been a result of their father\u2019s negative attitude toward the applicant, the domestic authorities did not resort to any of the above-mentioned methods of enforcement but referred the father to psychotherapy (see paragraph 90 above). The applicant, for her part, at that point resorted to probably the strongest possible remedy in the circumstances and asked that the children\u2019s father be deprived of custody (see paragraph 90 above).",

Therefore, in the present case the Court\u2019s task consists of examining whether the domestic authorities took all necessary steps that could reasonably be demanded in the specific circumstances to facilitate contact between the applicant and her children after she separated from her husband. The adequacy of the measures is to be judged by the swiftness of their implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the applicant and her children and may result in a de facto determination of the matter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a093-94).",

France, no. 10131/11, \u00a7 94, 7 March 2013). The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional veto power to children without any other factors being considered and an examination being carried out to determine their best interests (see C. v. Finland, no. 18249/02, \u00a7\u00a7 57-59, 9 May 2006); such interests normally dictate that the child\u2019s ties with its family must be maintained, except in cases where this would harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for example, Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2010). What is more, if a court would base a decision on the views of children who are palpably unable to form and articulate an opinion as to their wishes \u2013 for example, because of a loyalty conflict and/or their exposure to the alienating behaviour of one parent \u2013such a decision could run contrary to Article 8 of the Convention (see Laylle v.

Finland, cited above, \u00a7 155). The Court therefore considers that in cases such as the present one, where the children resist contact with one parent, Article 8 of the Convention requires States to try to identify the causes of such resistance and address them accordingly. It is an obligation of means, not of result, and may require preparatory or phased measures (see Ribi\u0107, \u00a7 94). The cooperation and understanding of all concerned will always be an important ingredient (ibid., loc.cit.). However, since the authorities must do their utmost to facilitate such cooperation, the lack of it is not a circumstance which can by itself exempt them from their positive obligations under Article 8 (see the preceding paragraph and Ribi\u0107, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95). Rather, it requires of the authorities that they take measures to reconcile the conflicting interests, keeping in mind the best interests of the child as a primary consideration (see Ribi\u0107, \u00a7 94). Only after such measures have been exhausted are the domestic authorities to be considered to have complied with their positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.",

For the applicant this was both objectionable for psychological reasons and costly, as it entailed her having to travel to S. (see paragraph 31 above). She considered such contact arrangements awkward and thus unacceptable and appealed against that part of the decision (see paragraph 31 above). The Court finds it evident that, in order to have any effect, her appeal had to be decided urgently. Yet the Split County Court only decided on the applicant\u2019s appeal on 20\u00a0May 2011, almost eleven months after the end of the period covered by the first-instance decision (see paragraphs 32 above). That court thus failed to recognise the urgency of the situation and even ignored the domestic law providing that judicial proceedings in respect of family matters were urgent and that appeals in such proceedings had to be decided within sixty days (see sections 263 and 266 of the Family Act, cited in paragraph 101 above). In other words, it allowed the passage of time to resolve the matter.",

They did not sit idle. After several hearings and the submission of an expert report on the father, the Split Municipal Court on 7 April 2011 awarded custody to the latter and granted the applicant the right to be visited by her children in her home (see paragraph 50 of the judgment). On 30 May 2011, the Split Social Welfare Centre imposed a \u201csupervision\u201d measure geared to establishing unhindered contacts between the applicant and her children (see paragraph 52 of the judgment). After various unsuccessful attempts at a meeting, and upon the advice of the supervising officer, the Municipal Court on 28 December 2011 decided not to order enforcement of its earlier decision (see paragraph 59 of the judgment). After some further unsuccessful attempts at a meeting, and upon reports of the supervising officer and the Split Social Welfare Centre, the Municipal Court on 6\u00a0August 2012 changed the contact arrangement, specifying that the applicant would have the right to see her children near the place where they stayed with their father (see paragraph 69 of the judgment). During new proceedings, instituted by the applicant in order to obtain a change in the contact arrangement, upon the recommendation of the Split Social Welfare Centre (see paragraph 77 of the judgment), the Municipal Court on 11\u00a0November 2013 appointed experts to determine the causes of the children\u2019s refusal to have contact with their mother (see paragraph 80 of the judgment). It is true that these experts criticised the way in which the welfare and judicial authorities had handled the situation up until then, and therefore asked to be relieved of further cooperation with the court (see paragraph 84 of the judgment). Faced with this reaction, the Municipal Court appointed new experts, and on 31\u00a0August 2015, after having received their report, referred the father to psychotherapy, instructed the supervising officer to work with him on changing his negative attitude toward the applicant, and ordered the Split Social Welfare Centre to appoint a special guardian \u201cad litem\u201d for the children (see paragraph 90 of the judgment). After the father had undergone six months\u2019 therapy, his psychiatrist stated in a report of 18 July 2016 that she had managed to achieve a situation whereby at the conscious level the father would not resist contact between the mother and the sons, but that she was unable to influence the subconscious processes, and that it was pointless continuing with the psychotherapy (see paragraph 94 of the judgment).",

Soon after 27 April 2012, at the suggestion of the supervising officer, the father started to take the children to Dr D.B., another psychiatrist, with the specific aim of overcoming their emotional and psychological difficulties and easing their resistance towards their mother (see paragraph 63 of the judgment). That psychiatrist submitted reports on 17 July 2012 and 10 September 2012 (see paragraphs 68 and 70 of the judgment). In March 2013, the father stopped taking the children regularly to Dr D.B., apparently because the children cried during the therapy sessions and Dr\u00a0D.B. herself was of the opinion that she could not achieve anything (see paragraphs 73, 74 and 79 of the judgment). As of 4 December 2014 the father took the children for family therapy to a family counselling centre, which counselling was monitored by the Split Social Welfare Centre (see paragraph 85 of the judgment).",
