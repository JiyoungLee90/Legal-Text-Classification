He submitted in this connection that, as he had been immediately handcuffed after being detained by the SOD officers, he could not have interfered with the evidence.

While noting that the criminal procedural law allowed searches to be conducted in the absence of attesting witnesses, the first-instance judge stated that the statements of the applicant and his family members concerning the circumstances of the searches were unreliable.

They further claimed that given the small size of the drugs, there had been a real risk of the applicant swallowing, throwing away or otherwise getting rid of the substance. As to the attesting witnesses, the Government submitted that if allowed, the applicant would have had one hour (see Article 102 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cited in paragraph 23 above) to secure their attendance, which implied that he could have walked freely within that one hour, out of the control of the police and destroy the evidence.

It considered, in view of the importance of that evidence, that, cumulatively, the procedural irregularities during the applicant\u2019s body search, the inconsistent and conflicting evidence concerning the actual circumstances of the search, the inadequate judicial scrutiny both before and during the trial, including the failure of the domestic courts to sufficiently examine the applicant\u2019s allegations that the drugs had not belonged to him, and the weakness of the corroborating evidence, rendered the applicant\u2019s trial as a whole unfair (ibid., \u00a7 73).",

The searches in question were conducted on the basis of so-called operational information which, it appears from the case file, was not subjected to judicial scrutiny at either the pre-trial or trial stages (see paragraphs 12-13 and 17-20 above). Furthermore, all four searches were conducted in \u201curgent circumstances\u201d in the absence of a prior judicial warrant. While this in itself did not render the investigative measures unlawful (see Article 290 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4 of the CCP cited in paragraph 23 above), it should be noted that the relevant decisions were not substantiated as they did not specify the urgent circumstances that allegedly necessitated searches without a prior judicial warrant (see, in this connection, Article 290 \u00a7\u00a03 of the CCP, ibid.). Moreover, unlike in Kobiashvili, the SOD officers refused the applicant and his wife\u2019s right to have attesting witnesses attend the searches. They referred to \u201curgent circumstances\u201d as justification for their refusal to call attesting witnesses. They failed, however, to identify either in the relevant police reports or subsequently in the course of their giving evidence any specific \u201curgent circumstances\u201d (see paragraphs 5-8-9 above). The Court notes, in this connection, the Government\u2019s argument that the drugs the SOD officers were looking for were small in size and could be easily disposed of (see paragraph 29 above). It is difficult to accept this argument in abstracto because, if accepted, this rationale would render the whole concept of attesting witnesses meaningless, as any search for small objects would appear to be urgent notwithstanding the particular circumstances of the search, including the particular situation in which the individual subjected to a search founds himself or herself. Furthermore, in this particular case, the applicant\u2019s right to call attesting witnesses was explicitly guaranteed by law (see Article 102 of the CCP, cited in paragraph 23 above). The applicant claimed that he had been handcuffed and surrounded by several officers during the searches and could not as a result have interfered with the evidence. This argument was never addressed in the course of the trial, with the result that his complaint about the arbitrary refusal of his procedural right remained unanswered.",

It is true that unlike in Kobiashvili, in the current case, in view of the amended procedural law, the applicant had an opportunity to appeal against the decisions recognising the lawfulness of the searches (see Article 293 \u00a7 3, cited in paragraph 23 above). While the applicant did not avail himself of that remedy, the Government failed to show how an appeal, in view of the limited scope of the first-instance court proceedings and the lack of reasoning in the relevant court decisions (see paragraph 13 above), could have offered the applicant adequate redress.

Such restrictive interpretation of that court\u2019s jurisdiction is at odds with Article 111 of the CCP (see paragraph 23 above) and also with the Government\u2019s position before the Court (see paragraph 35 above). In the course of the appeal proceedings, the applicant again requested that the court exclude the search reports as inadmissible evidence because they contained a number of procedural deficiencies (see paragraph 18 above). In reply, the appellate court simply held, without giving any reasons, that there had been no procedural violations during the searches and the evidence was therefore admissible (see paragraph 20 above). It should be stressed that the operational information that triggered the conduct of the searches, as was already noted above, was missing from the case file available to the trial, appellate and cassation courts. In such circumstances, it is doubtful that the courts could have assessed in any meaningful way the degree of reasonable suspicion that the authorities had against the applicant before searching him, their prior knowledge of the type of drugs that they were looking for, or the urgency and necessity of carrying out a search without a prior judicial warrant (see in this connection, Kobiashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a068).",

The Court considers that no other evidence in the case file, in the absence of the reports on the searches, was sufficiently strong on its own. As regards the SOD officers, it notes that as they were at the origin of the proceedings against the applicant and belonged to the authority which initiated them, they had an interest in the outcome of the prosecution. Their interest was particularly obvious in view of the applicant\u2019s allegation that they had planted the drugs. Nonetheless, their testimony was automatically taken as objective in contrast to, for example, that of the applicants\u2019 family members, which was dismissed as subjective and not credible (see paragraphs 17 and\u00a020 above).",

In view of the importance of that evidence, the Court considers that, cumulatively, the procedural irregularities during the searches, the inadequate judicial scrutiny both before and during the trial, including the failure of the domestic courts to sufficiently examine the applicant\u2019s allegations that the drugs did not belong to him, and the weakness of the corroborating evidence, rendered the applicant\u2019s trial as a whole unfair.
