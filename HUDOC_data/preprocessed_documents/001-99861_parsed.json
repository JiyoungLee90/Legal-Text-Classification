In particular, it takes cognisance of the District Court's procrastination in submitting all necessary documents to the bureau and the latter's repeated references to a heavy workload. The Court recalls in this respect that the principal responsibility for the delay due to the expert opinions rests ultimately with the State (see Capuano v. , 25 June 1987, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 119).
