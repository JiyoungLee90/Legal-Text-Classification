The Court notes that the case had been pending for about two months on that date. The period in question ended on 4 April 2006. It thus lasted thirteen years and seven months. Of this time, two years and three months corresponding to the suspension of the proceedings, apparently justified and thus not imputable to the State, must be deducted. However, the remaining period still exceeds eleven years and four months for three levels of jurisdiction. In view of such lengthy proceedings, this complaint must be declared admissible.",

Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present circumstances. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

In so far as his complaint may be understood to concern the assessment of the evidence and the result of the proceedings before the domestic courts, the Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999-I). In the present case, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s submissions do not disclose any elements of arbitrariness and, hence, no appearance of a violation of his rights under Article 6 of the Convention has been demonstrated. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
