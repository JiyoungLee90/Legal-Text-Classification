The case originated in an application (no. 57252/13) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Serbian nationals, Mr Adem Nuhović, Ms Enisa Kurtanović, Mr Rafet Nuhović and Ms Selma Nuhović (“the applicants”), on 5 June 2013.
The applicants were represented by Mr E. Fetahović, a lawyer practising in Novi Pazar. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Rodić.
On 6 October 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants were born in 1947, 1981, 1982 and 1988 respectively and live in Novi Pazar.
The applicants’ late wife and mother, Ms Fatima Nuhović was employed by “Raška” Viskozna predionica DOO Novi Pazar (hereinafter “the debtor”), which was, at the relevant time, a company predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital.
On 13 July 2004 the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Novi Pazar ordered the debtor to pay Ms Fatima Nuhović certain amount on account of salary arrears and social insurance contributions, plus the costs of the civil proceedings. By 7 February 2006 this judgment became both final and enforceable.
On 3 April 2006, upon Ms Nuhović’s request to that effect, the Municipal Court in Novi Pazar ordered the enforcement of the judgment of 13 July 2004 by means of a bank transfer and ordered the debtor to pay Ms Nuhović the enforcement costs. This judgment became final on an unspecified date.
On 25 December 2011 Ms Fatima Nuhović passed away. Inheritance proceedings have been instituted shortly thereafter before the Novi Pazar First Instance Court. Those proceedings are still pending.
On 25 October 2013 the Commercial Court (Trgovinski sud) in Kraljevo opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor (St. 17/2013). On 5 January 2014 the applicants submitted their claims for the payment of the amount ordered by the judgment of 13 July 2004. The insolvency proceedings are still pending.
