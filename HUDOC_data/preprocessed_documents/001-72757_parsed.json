In such a case the Court will mainly have regard to whether the authorities have paid late-payment interest to offset the depreciation of the amount due on account of the time that has elapsed (see, among other authorities, Akku\u015f v. Turkey, 9 July 1997, \u00a7 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV).
