However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v.

The applicant did not bring a claim for damages or other claims that could be characterised as civil under the Court\u2019s case-law relating to the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Kovalev v. Russia, no. 78145/01, \u00a7\u00a7 26-29, 10 May 2007). In essence, these complaints fell within the ambit of the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention, relating to the procedural obligation on the part of the State to conduct an effective investigation into an arguable complaint of ill-treatment. In this respect the Court refers to its finding above, that the authorities were in breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of their failure to ensure an effective investigation in the applicant\u2019s case. It further considers that it is not necessary to resolve the question whether the instant complaint raises yet another, separate, issue under Article 6 of the Convention, because it considers that this part of the application is in any event inadmissible, because of the loss of victim status. For the same reason it will dispense with a ruling on the applicability of Article 6 to the proceedings in question.",
