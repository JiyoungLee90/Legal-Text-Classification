Switzerland, judgment of 25\u00a0March 1983, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041; Daktaras v. , no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43, ECHR 2000X; and Butkevi\u010dius v.

Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It further refers to its settled case-law to the effect that when an applicant has suffered an infringement of his rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, he should, as far as possible, be put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of that provision not been disregarded, and that the most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6calan v.
