Finally, a law which confers discretion must indicate the scope of that discretion. However, the Court has recognised the impossibility of attaining absolute certainty in the framing of laws and the risk that the search for certainty may entail excessive rigidity (see, among other authorities, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25\u00a0March 1983, Series A no.\u00a061, p.\u00a033, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a086-88).",

It considers that even if there is no separate stamp on the letter as such, there is, in the particular circumstances of the case, a reasonable likelihood that the envelope was opened by the domestic authorities. In coming to such a conclusion, the Court takes into account that, in the Polish language, the word ocenzurowano means that a competent authority, after having controlled the content of a particular communication, decides to allow its delivery or expedition. Consequently, as long as the domestic authorities continue the practice of marking the detainees' letters with a simple ocenzurowano stamp, the Court would have no alternative but to presume that those letters have been opened and their contents read. It is the matter for the domestic authorities, to elaborate a procedure of giving clearance for delivery and expedition of letters to and from the European Court of Human Rights in a way clearly indicating that neither the relevant envelopes have been opened nor the letters have been read. The Court would also point out that the risk of such a stamp being forged by prisoners in order to fabricate evidence in the Strasbourg proceedings is so negligible that it must be discounted. Had domestic authorities been concerned about the risk of fabrication, they could have avoided it by adding to the register of incoming mail information about its condition (see, mutatis mutandis, Campbell v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 February 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0233, p. 22, \u00a7 62; Halford v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 25\u00a0June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, p. 1016, \u00a7\u00a048).",
