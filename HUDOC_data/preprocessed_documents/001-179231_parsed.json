Two of the mattresses are on the floor, one is on the single bed, and one is on the bottom bunk of one of the bunk beds. A single crumpledup bed sheet lies on one of the mattresses on the floor.

In one such case, in determining the quantum of the award of non-pecuniary damages, the Sofia City Administrative Court held, by reference to this Court\u2019s case-law, that it should not be too strict in requiring detained asylum-seekers to prove that they had suffered mentally as a result of their unduly prolonged decision (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 4059 \u043e\u0442 17.06.2013 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 3527/2013 \u0433., \u0410\u0434\u043c\u0421\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f-\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434). Its judgment was, however, reversed on appeal by the Supreme Administrative Court, which held, inter alia, that it had erred in doing so. On that point, it had to abide by the domestic rules of procedure, which required full proof in that respect and could not be disregarded simply because this Court had in some cases found their application unduly formalistic (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 75 \u043e\u0442 05.01.2015 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 10659/2013 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, III \u043e.).

The Court went on to say that if there was doubt regarding whether a remedy was likely to succeed, it had to be attempted, and on that basis concluded that by not bringing such a claim an alien aggrieved by the conditions in which he had been kept in an immigration detention facility in Sofia had failed to exhaust domestic remedies (see Djalti, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73, 74 and 76).",

The information about their applications for international protection in Bulgaria and Switzerland and the way in which these had been dealt with (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above) does not relate to it.

In view of the applicants\u2019 explanations on that point (see paragraph\u00a017 above), and since it is well known that electronic files can be automatically re-dated when copied from one device to another, the Court finds that the time stamps on the two video files do not throw doubt on their authenticity. The footage is, for its part, sufficiently clear, and there are no signs that it has been manipulated. Indeed, the Bulgarian authorities confirmed that the people featuring on it were the applicants (see paragraph\u00a018 above). It is true that there are no elements in the video \u2013 such as text written in Cyrillic or words spoken in Bulgarian \u2013 which could enable the Court positively to ascertain that it was recorded inside the border police\u2019s detention facility in Vidin where the applicants were held. At the same time, there are no elements which suggest otherwise. In these circumstances, the mere expression of misapprehensions by the Government on that point cannot cause the Court to doubt that the video depicts, as asserted by the applicants, that facility. Although it was open to the Government to submit visual material \u2013 such as photographs or a video recording of the premises where the applicants had been kept according to official records \u2013 or other evidence casting doubt in that respect, they did not back their assertions with such evidence (see paragraph 19 above). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, when applicants produce prima facie credible accounts or evidence that the conditions in which they were detained were inhuman or degrading, it is for the respondent Government to come up with explanations or evidence which can cast doubt in that respect, failing which the Court may find the applicants\u2019 allegations proven (see, among other authorities, Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and\u00a060800/08, \u00a7\u00a7 122-23, 10 January 2012).",

Even so, noting that (a) the detention facility had not been adapted to minors, (b) the applicants had been particularly vulnerable owing to the fact that before arriving in Belgium, they had been separated from their father on account of his arrest in Sri Lanka and had fled the civil war there, (c) their mother, although with them in the facility, had been unable to take proper care of them, and (d) their detention had lasted a much longer period of time than that in the case of Muskhadzhiyeva and Others (cited above), the Court found a breach of Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 64-69).",

Although designated for receiving families, the detention facility had been, according to several reports and domestic judicial decisions, not properly suited for that purpose, both in terms of material conditions and in terms of the lack of privacy and the hostile psychological environment prevailing there. That led the Court to find that, (a) despite the lack of medical evidence to that effect, the applicants, who had been very young, had suffered stress and anxiety, and that (b) in spite of the relatively short period of detention, there had been a breach of Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 92-103).",

France (no.\u00a011593/12, 12 July 2016), A.M. and Others v. France (no. 24587/12, 12\u00a0July 2016), R.K. and Others v. France (no. 68264/14, 12 July 2016) and R.C. and V.C. v. France (no. 76491/14, 12 July 2016) \u2013 had been between four months and four years old, and had been detained for periods ranging between seven and eighteen days. The Court noted that unlike the detention facility at issue in Popov (cited above), the material conditions in the two detention facilities concerned in those five cases had not been problematic. They had been adapted for families that had been kept apart from other detainees and provided with specially fitted rooms and child-care materials. However, one of the facilities had been situated right next to the runways of an airport, and so had exposed the applicants to particularly high noise levels. In the other facility, the internal yard had been separated from the zone for male detainees by only a net, and the noise levels had also been significant. That had affected the children considerably. Another source of anxiety had been the constraints inherent in a place of detention and the conditions in which the facilities had been organised. Although over a short period of time those factors had not been sufficient to attain the threshold of severity engaging Article 3 of the Convention, over a longer period their effects would necessarily have affected a young child to the point of exceeding that threshold. Since the periods of detention had been, in the Court\u2019s view, long enough in all five cases, it found breaches of Article 3 in each of them (see R.M. and Others v. France, \u00a7\u00a7 72-76; A.B. and Others v.\u00a0France, \u00a7\u00a7 111-15; A.M. and Others v. France, \u00a7\u00a7 48-53; R.K. and Others v. France, \u00a7\u00a7 68-72; and R.C. and V.C. v.

However, the conditions in the border police\u2019s detention facility in Vidin, as described by the applicants (without being contradicted by the Government), and as revealed by the video submitted by them, were considerably worse than those in all those cases. The cell in which the applicants were kept, though relatively well ventilated and lit, was extremely run-down, with paint peeling off the walls and ceiling, dirty and worn out bunk beds, mattresses and bed linen, and litter and damp cardboard on the floor (see paragraph 15 above). It can hardly be said that those were suitable conditions in which to keep a sixteen-year old, an eleven-year old, and especially a one-and-a-half-year old, even for such a short period of time.",

Belgium and Greece, cited above, \u00a7 223). But a perusal of the relevant statistics shows that although the numbers are not negligible, in recent years Bulgaria has by no means been the worst affected country (see paragraphs 8 and 39-41 above). Indeed, the number of third-country nationals found illegally present on its territory in the course of 2015 was about twenty times lower than in Greece and about forty-four times lower than in Hungary (ibid.). It cannot therefore be said that at the relevant time Bulgaria was facing an emergency of such proportions that it was practically impossible for its authorities to ensure minimally decent conditions in the short-term holding facilities in which they decided to place minor migrants immediately after their interception and arrest (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0178-83).",
