In that document, the forensic medical expert noted that death had resulted from multiple fractures to the head, chest and spine, and to the base and dome of the skull. According to the expert, the location of the injuries identified, and the preponderance of internal over external injuries, led to the conclusion that those injuries had originated in [Mr Lykov\u2019s] fall from the fifth floor. The expert concluded that there was no cause-and-effect relationship between the other injuries (hematomas and scratches on the trunk and the lower and upper limbs, namely a hematoma in the fold of the right elbow measuring 4 x 3\u00a0cm; a scratch on the right forearm measuring 6 x 0.7 cm; a 4.5 x 2\u00a0cm hematoma on the right carpus; a hematoma on the left shoulder measuring 18 x 14 cm, on which there were scratches of 5 x 2.5 cm; a hematoma on the left knee measuring 7 x 6 cm, on which there was a scratch of 1.5 x 1\u00a0cm; and an oval-shaped scratch on the left ankle measuring 2 x 1.5 cm) and the death. As to the question of whether there were traces of a struggle or self-defence, the doctor indicated that it was generally accepted in forensic medicine that injuries to the arms and wrists were to be classified in that way. Thus, he noted the presence of a bruise on the right carpus and a scratch on the right forearm. He added that he was unable to ascertain how those injuries had been sustained.

Referring to the Mikheyev judgment (Mikheyev v.

However, as the Court has noted above, this report indicates that the forensic doctor found the presence of injuries which were unrelated to the fall from the window and which are generally attributed to acts of struggle or self-defence. In addition, the Court considers that it is appropriate to have regard to the explanations provided by P., who described, in a detailed and coherent manner, the violence perpetrated against Sergey Lykov and himself. The Court sees no reason to call into question the testimony by P.: his account is consistent with the nature and position of the injuries identified on Sergey Lykov\u2019s body (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Moreover, as the Court has established above, from September 2009, that is, before the autopsy report was submitted, witness P. gave the relevant domestic authorities several opportunities to verify his allegations, including those concerning Sergey Lykov (see paragraphs 39, 42 and 46 above). However, on each occasion the relevant authorities ignored his complaints and proposals to provide witness statements ...",

The Court considers that the victim\u2019s vulnerability at the precise moment when he threw himself from the window resulted, first and foremost, from the torture to which he had been subjected by the police officers. The Court has already had to assess a case in which the ill-treatment inflicted was of such intensity that it pushed the victim to throw himself from a window to escape his suffering (see Mikheyev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0135). In the present case, the Court has established that Mr Lykov had been tortured in the presence of P. (see paragraph\u00a0127 above). In addition, it cannot be excluded that the victim was tortured afterwards, in so far as P. claims to have heard his cries throughout the following hour (see paragraph 8 above). Moreover, the Court also notes that during this period Mr Lykov confessed and threw himself from the window (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). The Court notes that the victim entered the building alive and died on account of the fall from the fifth floor of the police station. Firstly, the Court considers that the Government\u2019s version of suicide for personal reasons is not satisfactory. It failed to take account of the established fact that the applicant was being tortured (see paragraphs\u00a0120-127 above), or of his unrecorded detention ... Secondly, the Court cannot draw any decisive conclusion from the investigation, which it has found to be ineffective (see paragraph 109 above). Accordingly, having found that neither the Government nor the national investigation have provided a satisfactory explanation for the victim\u2019s death, the Court considers that the Russian authorities are responsible for Sergey Lykov\u2019s fatal fall from the window.",
