The placement cannot last for less than a year. During the period of treatment, the convicted person is examined periodically in order to establish whether he has been cured or whether the placement must continue. Periodic reviews begin after one year and are carried out by the court either of its own motion or on an application by the prosecution. If the court ... considers - after studying the relevant expert\u2019s report - that the accused has been cured, it orders his discharge from the centre; if the term of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced is longer than the period of treatment, the prisoner is returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. In that case, if the court considers that there is no serious reason why the prisoner should serve the remainder of his sentence, it orders his release on licence. ... Persons who have become habitual users of drugs and are unable to give up the use of them voluntarily - in other words `drug addicts\u2019 - are patients and are treated as such under section 23. It is to be noted that the Greek legislation in force ... does not use the scientifically accepted term of `drug addict\u2019 but the expression `user of narcotic substances subject to special treatment\u2019 (section 13 (1) of Law no. 1729/1987) ... The release on licence of persons convicted under Article 105 of the Criminal Code should not be confused with the discharge of convicted drug addicts under the provisions of section 23 of Law no. 1729/1987. In the first case the aim pursued is solely that of rehabilitation, whereas in the second case it is also therapeutic ... For an application to this end by a convicted person to be admissible it is a prerequisite that (a) he has been placed in a centre to receive treatment for drug addiction and (b) he has spent at least one year in such a centre and is considered cured ... A problem arises where a convicted person has never been admitted to such a centre. In that case, section 23 does not apply, because the procedural requirement will not have been satisfied. Such a person is deprived of his right to make such an application, which will accordingly be inadmissible. This is not affected by his alleged recovery in prison while serving his sentence. The fact that the prison psychiatrist has certified that he has been cured is of no avail. On the other hand, it raises serious questions and doubts as to the objectiveness of the findings in the psychiatric reports made during the investigation and taken into account by the relevant courts. Although these persons are described as \u2018drug addicts\u2019 ... in these reports, within a few months they are regarded as \u2018completely cured\u2019 after non-existent treatment and merely taking aspirin or Hypnostedon.",
