He had complained neither about poor food quality nor about insufficient access to cultural and sports activities. The grounds of his claim had fundamentally related to the sanitary conditions in the cells and, in particular, a lack of privacy when using the toilet. This lack of privacy had been explicitly confirmed by the first-instance court.

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Furthermore, in considering whether treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article\u00a03. Although the question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a factor to be taken into account, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06768 and 74, ECHR 2001-III, and Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a0101, ECHR\u00a02001VIII).",

Under Article 3 the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured.

However, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise an issue in itself under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of the physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, the adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements and the possibility of using the toilet in private. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue \u2013 measuring between 3 and 4\u00a0sq. m per inmate \u2013 the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with an established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v.

It therefore follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that the domestic authorities have a positive obligation to provide access to sanitary facilities which are separated from the rest of the prison cell in a way which ensures a minimum of privacy for the inmates. The Court observes that according to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (\u201cCPT\u201d), a sanitary annex which is only partially separated off is not acceptable in a cell occupied by more than one detainee (CPT/Inf (2012) 13, \u00a7 78, and 2nd General Report (CPT/Inf (92) 3), \u00a7 49). In-cell toilets should be provided with a full partition extending up to the ceiling (CPT/Inf (2015) 12, \u00a7\u00a074). In particular, the CPT has recommended, after visits to Polish prisons, that a full partition be installed in all in-cell sanitary annexes (see, for example, CPT/Inf (2014)\u00a021, \u00a7\u00a061, and CPT/Inf (2011) 20, \u00a7\u00a7 105 and 106).",

In those cells he had to use the toilet in the presence of other inmates and was thus deprived of a basic level of privacy in his everyday life. The applicant raised the matter with the prison authorities and requested that at least a curtain be hung in place to separate off the sanitary facilities. The prison authorities replied that domestic law did not set out specific regulations as regards the way in which sanitary facilities were to be fitted and separated off in prison cells (see paragraph 31 above).",
