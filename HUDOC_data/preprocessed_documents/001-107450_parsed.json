Some of the mujahedin married girls from the region. Over time, however, the foreign mujahedin tried to promote their view of fundamental Islam. They ordered the Bosnian women to cover their heads, condemned the consumption of alcohol and insisted that the local Muslims practice their religion. The foreign mujahedin burst into caf\u00e9s and restaurants that served alcohol and if they saw a woman or young girl dressed in what they considered inappropriate fashion, they voiced their strong opposition.

Such episodes reflect the fact that old habits of police agents are not easily eradicated. Whether they are isolated or more frequent, beatings inflicted as a form of punishment or intimidation reflects complete disrespect for the presumption of innocence and the dignity of persons suspected of crimes. For that reason, every single act of torture is intolerable and elicits the obligation of the State under international law to investigate, prosecute and punish it. I heard testimonies according to which the safeguards during arrest and detention, such as rules governing warrant, compulsory medical examination upon arrest and transfer, notification to the family, access to a lawyer, interrogation in the presence of witnesses, as well as the right against self-incrimination were not respected in practice. Sadly, some of those testimonies were about events that have taken place after the January 14 Revolution.",

However, in Al Mornaguia Prison I learned that individual judges sometimes still order persons detained under the 2003 law. This now mostly dormant law did not do what it was supposed to do. It did not provide more security to the Tunisian people, but was used as a tool of oppression against any form of political or other dissent. The Transitional Government has acknowledged this by adopting an amnesty law covering those who were convicted or held under this law. In order to provide the Tunisian people with the security they deserve, I offer the assistance of my mandate to replace the 2003 law with a proper legislative framework which regulates \u2019s anti-terrorism efforts in line with international conventions and protocols on countering terrorism, while fully respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.

It was thus not raised early enough to allow an exchange of observations between the parties (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, \u00a7\u00a7 6163, 28\u00a0March 2006; Maznyak v.

Nevertheless, the Court does not have to decide whether it is appropriate to take this matter up separately at this stage as the complaint is in any event inadmissible for the following reasons.",

Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 13628/03, 16 May 2006, and Aliba\u0161i\u0107 v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 18478/08, 29 March 2011). Since this complaint is still pending before that court and the Convention does not require that an applicant complaining about his or her deportation under Article 8 should have access to a remedy with automatic suspensive effect (in contrast to such complaints under Article 3, see paragraphs 32-33 above), the complaint is premature. It must therefore be rejected pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.",
