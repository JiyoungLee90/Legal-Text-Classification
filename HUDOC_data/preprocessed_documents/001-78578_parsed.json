In its submission, the District Court first noted that since A. worked as a lawyer within its jurisdiction, judges of another court had dealt with the case which had prolonged the proceedings somewhat. It further considered that the circumstances of the case had been special and fairly complicated from a legal point of view, and that the preparations for the main hearing had been demanding. For its part, the Court of Appeal noted, inter alia, that the case had not concerned a complicated matter, but the case file had been voluminous and difficult to grasp.

Moreover, the judgment of the Supreme Court was pronounced on 9 June 2005, i.e. more than four years after the applicant company lodged its case with the Court. Thus, the Court considers that it cannot now be required of the applicant company to lodge a compensation claim before the national courts and nor could it have been expected to have done so 5 years ago since, at that time, there were no indications that it would have been an effective remedy. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant company, during the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, did complain to the Chancellor of Justice that the proceedings were taking too long. The Government's objection must therefore be dismissed.",
