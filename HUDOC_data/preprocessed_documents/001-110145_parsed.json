It is not clear what measures this inquiry involved, as the relevant documents had apparently been destroyed when the time-limit for keeping them in the archives expired. However, it is clear that the person in charge of that inquiry was the same official who investigated the applicant\u2019s criminal case, and the Court finds it striking that in the present case the initial investigative steps, which usually prove to be crucial for establishing the truth in cases of brutality committed by State officials, were conducted by the official in charge of the applicant\u2019s prosecution. It was later established by the  in its decision of 12 January 2001 that Ms. K. had failed to meet the objective criteria of independence (see paragraph 19 above), and the Court cannot but endorse this conclusion. In this connection the Court reiterates its finding, made on a number of occasions, that the investigation should be carried out by competent, qualified and impartial experts who are independent of the suspected perpetrators and the agency they serve (see Ramsahai and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR\u00a02007-II, and O\u011fur v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92, ECHR\u00a01999-III).",

The latter admitted, however, that he had been in a state of alcoholic intoxication at the time of the applicant\u2019s physical examination and that after the passage of time he could remember very little of what had happened. He was confident, however, that the applicant had not been ill-treated. Despite his reduced ability to remember the events in question the authorities did not seek evidence from the second attesting witness in order to obtain a more detailed account. There is nothing in the file to suggest that any attempts were made to question him, and the reasons for that remain unclear. The Court, on its part, cannot overlook the unexplained failure to question that person, because he was one of the only two people, apart from the implicated policemen, with first-hand knowledge of what had happened, and possibly the only one who could make up for the deficiencies in A.T.\u2019s account.",
