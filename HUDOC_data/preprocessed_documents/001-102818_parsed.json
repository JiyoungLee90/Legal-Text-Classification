The domestic courts in their turn had rejected the applicants' complaints about the omissions on the part of the General Prosecutor's Office. As the investigation's failure to establish the circumstances of Vasiliy Mikhalkov's death was deliberate and aimed at concealment of the crime committed by the police officers, any further proceedings before the domestic courts would have been futile.",

The applicants' version is consistent with the findings of the forensic expert assessments, as summarised by the Government. In particular, on 12 May 2004 it was concluded that Vasiliy Mikhalkov's small intestine had been traumatised by the impact of a blunt object with a limited surface, possibly a booted foot, with significant force and at an acute angle. This injury could not have been caused by an accidental single fall. Further, expert assessments of 23 January 2006 and 11 February 2008 confirmed that the applicants' version of the events was not incredible and that the abdominal injury could have resulted from the cumulative force of a number of blows.",

The investigation must be, inter alia, thorough, impartial and careful (see McCann and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 161-63; Kaya v.\u00a0Turkey, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 105, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I; and \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v.

The authorities must have taken all reasonable steps to obtain all available evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy report providing a complete and accurate record of injuries and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see, for example, Carabulea v. , no. 45661/99, \u00a7\u00a0130, 13\u00a0July 2010).
