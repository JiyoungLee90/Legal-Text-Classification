In the same way as material goods, certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as \u201cproperty rights\u201d, and thus as \u201cpossessions\u201d for the purposes of this provision. In each case the issue that needs to be examined is whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, among the recent authorities, Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions or controlling their use. Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance, and, notably, whether it imposes a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see Former King of Greece and Others v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000-XII).",

Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make an initial assessment as to the existence of a matter of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see, among many authorities, Edwards v.

It was also within the State\u2019s exclusive competence to legalise the transfer of title to flats through a registration procedure specifically aimed at providing extra security to the title holder. With so many regulatory authorities having granted clearance to the title to the flats, it was not for the applicants, or any other third-party buyer of the flats, to assume the risk of ownership being revoked on account of defects which should have been eliminated in procedures specially designed to do so. The authorities\u2019 oversight could therefore not justify subsequent retribution against the applicants (see Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7 79).",

Belgium (Article\u00a050), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case and to the fact that the applicants did not receive compensation for loss of title to the flat in the domestic proceedings, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicants\u2019 title to the flats. Thus, the applicants would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which they would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106). In the alternative, if the Government no longer own the flats, or if they have been otherwise alienated, the Government should ensure that the applicants receive equivalent flats.",
