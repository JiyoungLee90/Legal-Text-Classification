Domestic law must afford a measure of protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with Convention rights, in respect of which the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society, would not condone unfettered powers being conferred on the executive. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any executive discretion and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a030985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000-XI). It must furthermore provide adequate and effective safeguards against abuse, which may in certain cases include procedures for effective scrutiny by the courts (see, Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Elenkov v. , no.\u00a014134/02, \u00a7\u00a046, 11\u00a0October 2007).",

The Court observes that the second applicant contended that there had been no reason to terminate the membership of the thirteen people, including her own. She maintained that, although she had been taken into custody in 1999, she had been released and no criminal proceedings had been brought against her at that time. The Court is persuaded by the applicant's claim in the light of the Izmir Governor's letter of 10 July 2001 (paragraph 5 above). Consequently, the Government have not demonstrated why the public authorities could otherwise have legitimately required the annulment of the applicant's membership.",
