From these evaluations, it appeared that C. was very attached to her older brother and gave the impression of being very insecure and younger than her actual age. It was not possible to give a clear answer as to whether or not she had been exposed to a specific kind of abuse but, on the basis of her emotional development and her behaviour at the evaluation home, it was found that the parents had exposed her to some form of abuse or ill-treatment. With regard to B., the evaluation showed that he was ambitious and responsible but that he was under a lot of pressure as he identified with his parents and was unwilling to talk about his situation. Moreover, on several occasions, he had hidden in a closet when someone was angry with him because he had been afraid to be yelled at or beaten by the personnel. Both children had mentioned that they had been beaten by their father and that they had seen him beat A. and they gave specific examples of such incidents. Although the abuse committed against the children had not caused physical damage, it was found that it could potentially have caused permanent psychological damage and even more so since their mother had not intervened to protect them. However, apparently, both children had promised their parents not to talk about their home situation and were keen to keep this promise, which had prolonged their evaluation. It was concluded that both children were in need of long-term qualified care outside their home to deal with their negative experiences and be protected from their father.",

In the latter case, a balance had to be struck between the parents' right to raise their children and the child's right to be protected from harm. The court then observed that, in the present case, the parents and the social services had given completely contradictory information about the children and their situation. However, it noted that all three children had, at some point, told both police officers and personnel at the evaluation homes that their father had exposed them to physical, psychological and verbal violence. In the court's view, there was no reasonable explanation why all three children would tell lies about their parents. Moreover, professionals at the evaluation homes had observed and assessed the children's behaviour and had found them to be afraid of being beaten or otherwise badly treated. Thus, the court concluded that, even though A. had retracted substantial parts of her accusations, the material in the case still supported the view that B. and C. had been the victims of such ill-treatment in their home that there was a substantial risk to their health and development unless they got proper care outside their home.",

In relation to A., it was found that she had a very deep split in her personality which could often be seen in children who had been in a position of strong negative dependence on a parent. Her behaviour reflected a traumatic up-bringing. Moreover, she had been in need of very close contact with aunt I. who, in turn, had set down limits to their contact. A. had reacted strongly to this and had felt let down. In March 2002 she had called her father once but had reacted very strongly to their conversation. After this she did not want to say more about the abuse and she no longer knew if she wanted to maintain what she had previously said, although she did not deny that it was true. Turning to B., it was observed that he had been involved in adult conflicts and family secrets by his parents which was a heavy burden for him and that he was afraid of his father's and others' anger. He had developed positively at Ekbacken and needed continued care and protection from his father. C. had lived in a strictly controlled environment with secrets and both physical and mental abuse and, although she had improved at the evaluation home, she was in need of continuous care and protection.

In the report, it was noted that the children felt that they had not been listened to by the authorities or the personnel at the evaluation homes but that, instead, they had been pressured by them. Dr Hellblom Sj\u00f6gren found no proof that the children had been traumatised in their home. On the contrary, she considered that the trauma for B. and C. had taken place when they had suddenly been separated from their parents without understanding why and then, for almost seven months, had not been allowed to talk to their parents. Moreover, they had not benefited from normal schooling and they had not been well cared for at the evaluation homes. In conclusion, she observed that the children denied that any abuse had taken place at home or that there had otherwise been any problems. They had expressed a strong wish to return home, which Dr Hellblom Sj\u00f6gren agreed would be best for them.",

At the same time, it decided that the location of the children should be kept secret from the first and second applicants and that all contact with the children, including by telephone, should again be prohibited. However, contact in writing would be allowed, but only via the social services. The reasons for the decision were, essentially, that the first and second applicants had not followed the guidelines concerning contact with the children given by the social services and that the contacts had had a very negative effect on, in particular, B., who had become very unstable, difficult to handle and controlling towards his little sister. C. had also reacted negatively and had been heard to tell her parents several times on the telephone that they should not beat her if she moved back home. To begin with, the parents had called every day and, after restrictions imposed by the evaluation home because of B.'s negative change in behaviour, they called three times per week. At the beginning of May 2002 the social services had proposed that the parents meet staff from Ekbacken and the responsible social worker to be informed about the children's development, schooling and health and to plan the meetings with the children. The goal was to ensure that the meetings would be positive for the children, who had expressed a strong wish to see their parents. The parents refused this preparatory meeting on the ground that the staff had already labelled the first applicant and therefore they did not wish to have any contact with staff or other adults in the children's vicinity. They wanted a priest, who was close to the family, to visit the children, which was arranged. In July 2002 the first applicant, together with two others, came unannounced to Ekbacken, accusing the staff of mistreating the children. On 15 August 2002 the children's cousin, on their mother's side, was to make a scheduled visit to the children but the first and second applicants arrived, unannounced, with him. Still, the staff decided to invite them all in to visit the children for two hours but wanted to talk to the parents alone first. B. wanted to join them, the staff refused, but the first applicant allegedly did not respect this and said that they had no secrets from B. The meeting then became agitated and it was decided that the parents and cousin should take the children out for a pizza and then return. Upon return, the situation became chaotic with the children screaming and refusing to re-enter the home. The cousin threatened a member of the staff and police were called. In these circumstances, it was considered that the children needed to be protected from the negative and destabilising influence of their parents to be able to get some peace and benefit from the care. Information on how to appeal against the decision was attached but no appeal was lodged.",

If necessary, the council may decide how this contact is to be arranged. In the preparatory works to the 1990 Act (Government Bill 1979/80:1, p. 602), it is noted that the provisions on access restrictions are to be applied restrictively. The Social Council must have strong reasons to decide on access restrictions between a young person and his or her parents. However, it can happen that the parents intervene in the care in an inappropriate manner. Their personal situation, for instance serious abuse or a grave mental illness, may be such that they should not see their child for a limited period of time. Moreover, section 14 gives the Social Council the possibility to decide to keep a young person's place of residence secret from his or her parents. This should only be done in very exceptional cases (Government Bill 1989/90:28, p. 74).",

Still, it should be noted that the existence of mere doubts as to the prospects of success of a particular remedy which is not obviously futile is not a valid reason for failing to exhaust domestic remedies (see Brusco v.

The applicants contend that they did not receive all of these decisions, that some of them were received too late to appeal against and that some others were only orally transmitted to them. The Court is not convinced by these contentions as all of the above decisions have been submitted in writing to it and since the applicants have specified neither which decision fell into what category nor why they did not appeal against those decisions that they did receive in writing and in time. Moreover, the Court notes that they were represented by legal counsel and that their good friend, who was a lawyer, also assisted them. They knew that decisions on access restrictions are reconsidered at least every six months and they could have requested to have the \u201coral\u201d decisions in writing in order to appeal against them. Furthermore, the Court cannot help but notice that the first applicant as well as his and the second applicant's legal counsel were present at the Social Council's meeting on 17 April 2002 and thus knew about this decision and could have appealed against it. Still, they did not, and it also appears from the facts that they had expressed the view that they could envisage refraining from contact with their children for the duration of the police investigation. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicants had an effective remedy available to them to appeal against the above specified decisions on access restrictions but that they chose not to make use of it.",

By withdrawing their appeal, the Court considers that they cannot be said, from a purely technical point of view, to have exhausted domestic remedies. The applicants have claimed that they did so on recommendation by the Chairman of the Administrative Court of Appeal because the continuation of the public care of the children was pending before that court at the same time. Although the Court can understand why this would be tempting advice to follow, it underlines that the two sets of proceedings were completely separate and dealt with two different questions, namely, the first relating to the granting of a care order and the second proceedings relating to the continuation of such an order. This is also manifested by the fact that the first set of proceedings neither lapsed nor was discontinued when the second set of proceedings started. Consequently, the Court finds that the applicants, by withdrawing their appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court, did not exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in relation to that set of proceedings.",

Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no 130, \u00a7 68). Account must also be taken of the fact that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned (see Olsson v.  (no. 2), judgment of 27 November 1992, Series A no. 250, \u00a7 90). It is not the Court's task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding public care and access but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for instance, Hokkanen v. Finland, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, \u00a7 55; and Johansen, cited above, \u00a7 64). Thus, while the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, in particular when assessing the necessity of taking a child into care, a stricter scrutiny is called for in respect of any further limitations, such as limitations on parental rights and access (see Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002-I).",

At this point, A. had told the authorities that her father beat her and treated her in a degrading manner. Consequently, it was in response to accusations by A. that the Social Council opened an investigation into the family's situation. In the Court's view, such a grave accusation by a child against a parent has to be taken seriously by the social authorities since one of their primary tasks is to protect a child in a vulnerable situation (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0115116). Moreover, the Court notes that, already in 1998, A. had told personnel at her school that she and her siblings were beaten by their father and that she was afraid to go home with him. At that time, it had been agreed between the social services and the first and second applicant that A. should see a psychologist which, however, she apparently only did for a short period of time. Against this background, the Court finds that the Social Council had good grounds to investigate the family's situation and, since A. maintained her accusations and the second applicant declined an offer to live with her children away from their home during the investigation, to take all three children into public care as a protective measure.",

Thus, even though A. had retracted substantial parts of her accusations against the first applicant, the Social Council was still of the opinion that the children had been exposed to physical and mental abuse in their home, noting that B. and C. had also mentioned that they had been beaten and that they had seen their father beat A. Moreover, they had been observed by the personnel at the evaluation home on a daily basis and their behaviour and reactions had been assessed and it had been noted that they had, inter alia, showed fear of being beaten when someone at the home had been angry with them. The personnel had further observed a very negative change in the behaviour of B. and C. once telephone contact had been re-established with their parents at the end of April 2001. Apparently, B. had become very unstable and controlling towards C. and she had been heard to tell her parents several times over the telephone that they should not beat her if she returned home.

Instead they chose to appear unannounced at Ekbacken, which to the Court was clearly not in the best interest of the children.

Moreover, both sides were allowed to submit written observations and evidence and, as is the practice before the administrative courts, all submissions by one party were communicated to the other party. Consequently, all investigation and documentation relied on by the Social Council before the national courts were communicated to the applicants who were provided with the opportunity to reply to them. As concern the journals which had not been handed over by Ekbacken to the applicants until several months after this had been requested by the first applicant, the Court notes that the County Administrative Board criticised this and justly so in the Court's opinion. However, it has not been shown that the delay in handing over these journals caused a disadvantage to the applicants vis-\u00e0-vis the Social Council in the proceedings before the national courts. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants, who were represented by legal counsel throughout the proceedings, were involved effectively in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, and able sufficiently to protect their interests.

Also, the first and second applicants were given regular reports about the younger children's situation at the evaluation home and, as soon as the preliminary investigation against the first applicant had been cancelled by the police, the Social Council lifted the access restrictions completely, allowed unlimited telephone contact and tried to find an agreement with the first and second applicants to meet with their children (see, mutatis mutandis, R.K. and A.K. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38000/05, \u00a7 37, 30 September 2008).

According to the Court, these measures have to be seen in their context. As noted above, the social authorities had tried to arrange meetings with the first and second applicants already at the beginning of May 2002 in order to prepare for direct meetings between the parents and the children but no meeting had taken place as the first and second applicants refused to meet with the authorities. Still, the authorities agreed that a priest, a friend of the family, should meet with the children to see how they were and the applicants also had frequent and regular telephone contact. Unfortunately, it appears that this contact upset the children and that, during the summer of 2002, they developed negatively as a result of it (see above paragraph 113). It is further clear that the access restrictions were applied anew by the Social Council on 16 August 2002, as a direct consequence of the unannounced visit by the first and second applicants on 15 August 2002 (see above paragraph 114). The decision to prolong these restrictions on 2 October 2002 was based on the children's need for a calm and stable environment. Again, the Court, like the domestic authorities, considers that the first and second applicants appear to have been unable to prioritise the children's interests over their own. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the prolongation of the access restrictions was justified. In any event, it notes that the decision was repealed by the  on 11 November 2002 and that the first and second applicants fetched the younger children on that same day. Thus, the restrictions were de facto terminated on this date and the proceedings before the appellate courts were limited to the matter of continued public care.",

Italy ([GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, ECHR 2000VIII), which was a Grand Chamber case, we held an oral hearing and considered de novo the facts as relevant in terms of the Convention and our own case-law. As I explained in my concurring opinion in Scozzari and Giunta, Article 8 cases do not, as is usual in most other legal cases, pertain to a historical event lost in the past. Because the family situation itself will change with the passage of time, cases such as the one before us here frequently deal with an evolving situation. As a consequence, it is often the case that this Court is not in a position to refrain completely from a fresh assessment.
