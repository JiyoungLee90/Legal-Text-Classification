Owing to their willingness to apply that method to their son, there was a likelihood bordering on certainty that if he remained with them, they would apply corporal punishment. This, the expert concluded, would significantly jeopardise the son\u2019s development and result in psychological problems. Overall, it was in the child\u2019s best interests to place him away from his parents to protect him from the applicants\u2019 parenting methods, which were dangerous for the child. Since their parenting was based on religious convictions, they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and lacked the will to cooperate with the authorities or accept help. Consequently, less intrusive measures could not be considered sufficient.",

Even though separating the parents and the child constituted a severe interference with their right to a family under Article 6 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 53 below) and may possibly have negative consequences for the child, that interference was justified in the case at hand. Corporal punishment of the kind at issue was particularly degrading for a child. It was not only banned by Article 1631 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below) but also constituted an interference with a child\u2019s human dignity, protected under Article 1 of the Basic Law (see paragraph\u00a050 below), and a child\u2019s right to physical integrity, protected under Article 2 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 51 below).",

According to the expert\u2019s explanations, the psychological consequences could, by contrast, only be determined after a longer period of time and they were difficult to discern at first glance. Although the applicants had most recently indicated to the court that they were ready to refrain from corporal punishment in the future, the court regarded such statements as not being compelling since they had not provided any grounds. The Family Court, nonetheless, pointed out that the applicants were free to reach an out-of-court settlement with the youth office concerning the conditions under which the son could be returned after the proceedings had been concluded. However, the previous settlement proposal had been refused because the applicants had not been willing to agree to have their son take part in play therapy and attend a state school.",

The court emphasised that not all individual violations of the right to a non-violent upbringing under Article 1631 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below) could justify a withdrawal of parental authority. However, there was a fear in the applicants\u2019 case that systematic caning with a rod would be the reaction whenever the child was deemed to have broken a rule. There was moreover already a threat to the child\u2019s best interests as he would live in constant fear of suffering physical pain and experiencing the resulting humiliation as psychological suffering. Beatings as such, the court held, constituted child abuse and misuse of parental authority. It was of no relevance whether or not lasting physical injuries occurred.",

He stated that the applicants and their daughters had confirmed that the parents had used a rod as corporal punishment on the daughters and that even though the applicants had a loving attitude towards their children, they considered corporal punishment using physical objects as an appropriate and necessary parenting method. Given the past incidents of corporal punishment and the applicants\u2019 general willingness to use that method on their children, it was virtually certain that they would subject them to corporal punishment again. The expert concluded that the applicants\u2019 rigid, authoritarian parenting style and their conviction that children should be raised to obey their parents by means of corporal punishment using physical objects from the age of three conflicted significantly with the best interests of the children and was also detrimental to the unimpaired development of their personality. He expected that such methods would likely result in psychological issues. Overall, it was in the best interests of the children to place them away from their parents. Since the applicants\u2019 parenting style was based on religious convictions, they were unwilling to abandon the parenting method of corporal punishment and were not fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and accept help.

The court emphasised that the aim of Article 1666 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 55 below) was not to penalise past child abuse or views on parenting that were in contradiction to Article 1631 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below), but to prevent imminent threats to the best interests of children. Based, in particular, on the opinion by the courtappointed expert and the statements by the applicants and their children, the court concluded that there was a high, concrete probability that the children would be subjected to systematic corporal punishment using physical objects, which would in turn be detrimental to the best interests of the children in physical and psychological terms. The severe interference with the applicants\u2019 right to a family under Article 6 of the Basic Law (see paragraph 53 below) by separating them from their children was nonetheless not only justified but also proportionate since the risk to the children could not be averted using milder means. Besides the problem of detecting corporal punishment through unannounced visits by the youth office (see paragraph 30 above), the court also pointed out that the applicants had consistently, over the course of the proceedings, shown a lack of willingness to cooperate with the youth office and had refused to accept state schools, both of which the court found necessary to prevent degrading corporal punishment and ensure the children\u2019s autonomous development. Furthermore, the court held that it could be expected that the applicants would leave Germany if their children were returned to them and thereby elude any orderly monitoring and supervision by the competent youth office. Lastly, the court concluded that the withdrawal of the consent to being examined by the court-appointed expert did not hinder the use of the expert opinion in the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above).",

The court held that corporal punishment with a rod, prohibited by Article 1631 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 54 below), constituted the physical abuse of children and if applied regularly and repeatedly the competent authorities were obliged under Article 1666 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 55 below) to intervene and take the necessary measures in the best interests of the children. The applicants\u2019 daughters had consistently stated during the proceedings that they had been caned on a daily basis and the applicants themselves had confirmed that they had \u201cdisciplined\u201d their daughters with a rod. The court was convinced that the applicants would continue to use corporal punishment on their children in the future since that parenting method was already firmly established and was based on religious beliefs from which the applicants had not fundamentally distanced themselves. Their statements had shown that they, in essence, continued to approve of corporal punishment and considered it an appropriate parenting method. The fact that the applicants had recently acknowledged that their children had a right to a non-violent upbringing did not mean they had changed their attitudes to parenting in a permanent way; rather, that had only served a procedural purpose, namely to have their daughters returned to them as soon as possible. In the court\u2019s opinion, the applicants were only prepared to refrain temporarily from corporal punishment. The court was therefore unable to find that the applicants had changed their way of parenting and distanced themselves from corporal punishment in a manner which the court could regard as credible. Consequently, there was an imminent danger of systematic corporal punishment if the two daughters were returned to their parents. The danger also existed for the applicants\u2019 son as there was no fixed age when the applicants started \u201cdisciplining\u201d their children as they rather considered it a tool to enforce their parental authority. As the two-year-old son was expected to start his \u201cphase of defiance\u201d soon, it also had to be expected that the applicants would respond with caning.",

In that regard, the court, inter alia, pointed to the fact that the applicants had already left Germany with their son and refused to return to live there permanently. The competent authorities would therefore from the very outset be unable to provide sufficient support to the family or effectively monitor the applicants\u2019 parenting methods.",

The proceedings, at three levels of jurisdiction, therefore lasted one year and eleven months. The Court further notes that during the one year and one month the cases were pending before the Family Court it commissioned an expert opinion, which had to be supplemented owing to criticism of it by the applicants\u2019 privately commissioned expert. The court also substituted the consent of the children in parallel proceedings, heard the applicants, their children and further witnesses and led settlement negotiations between the applicants and the youth office. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that there were no particular delays in the course of the proceedings that could be attributed to the conduct of the Family Court. The Court therefore finds that in the light of all the material in its possession they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of Article 8 in regard to the length of proceedings. Accordingly, this complaint is manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(a) and 4 of the Convention.",

Pingen, who was still with his parents during the proceedings, the Court reiterates that the requirement of hearing children in custody proceedings depends on the specific circumstances of each case, in particular the age and maturity of the child concerned (see Sahin v. Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, \u00a7 73, ECHR\u00a02003VIII). Given that G. Pingen had just turned two before the decision of the Court of Appeal, the Court finds it acceptable that the domestic courts did not question him.",

The Court would therefore note that the expert did not act against the will of the applicants and that the applicants were not forced to undergo the expert\u2019s assessment. In addition, the Court finds that the Government has rightly pointed out that Article 6 does not include a privilege against selfincrimination in civil proceedings and that it is therefore not necessary to accept a withdrawal of consent ex post, when the result of the expert opinion had already been known. Accepting such a withdrawal would jeopardize family court proceedings and a court\u2019s obligation to effectively protect children from harm. In sum, the Court agrees with the Family Court and the Court of Appeal that the withdrawal ex post of the applicants\u2019 consent did not render the expert opinion unusable as evidence and that relying on the opinion was justified by the general interest of the effective protection of children in family court proceedings.",

Taking children into care and thereby splitting up a family constitutes a very serious interference with the right to respect to family life protected under Article 8 of the Convention and should only be applied as a measure of last resort (see Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7 136). However, the decisions by the domestic courts were based on a risk of inhuman or degrading punishment, as prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. The Court has previously held that even in the most difficult circumstances the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned. Moreover, the domestic courts did not assess the risk for the children in the abstract \u2013 based on the applicants\u2019 view on parenting \u2013 but followed a differentiated approach and examined for each child, based on the respective age, whether it could be expected that the applicants\u2019 child-rearing methods would be put into practice and that therefore a real and imminent risk of corporal punishment existed. Given the right of children to a non-violent upbringing in German law and the conflicting but strict conviction of the applicants, the domestic courts concluded that taking the children into care was justifiable.",

Based on the expert\u2019s opinion that the physical effects of caning were only short-lived while psychological consequences could only be determined after a longer period of time, the courts correctly concluded that an effective protection of the children by unannounced visits and closer monitoring was impossible. The Court agrees with this line of reasoning and would add that the proceedings concerned a form of institutionalized violence against minors, which was considered by the applicant parents as an element of the children\u2019s upbringing. Consequently, any assistance by the youth office, such as training of the parents, could not have effectively protected the children, as corporally disciplining the children was based on their unshakeable dogma.",

In that regard, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not order the applicants to stay in Germany but reasonably concluded that any less infringing measure would have at least entailed the need for supervision and monitoring by the competent domestic authorities. Lastly, the Court observes that the Family Court attempted to broker a friendly settlement between the youth office and the applicants, with the aim of returning the children to their parents and simultaneously protecting the children from corporal punishment.",
