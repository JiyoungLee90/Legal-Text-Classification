Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or brought before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling suspicions which provide the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of the criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A).",

Accordingly, while reasonable suspicion must exist at the time of the arrest and initial detention, it must also be shown, in cases of prolonged detention, that the suspicion persisted and remained \u201creasonable\u201d throughout the detention (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 90).",

The applicant also produced a mission order proving that he had been sent to Ismayilli by the Yeni Musavat for the period from 24 to 25 January 2013.

It is therefore apparent from the documents submitted to the Court that, although on 24 January 2013 the applicant went to Ismayilli as a journalist for the Yeni Musavat one day after the beginning of the events and stayed there for only thirty minutes, he was charged with the criminal offences of \u201corganising public disorder\u201d and \u201cviolent resistance to the police\u201d.",

In particular, the Government failed to specify whether the material submitted by the prosecuting authorities contained witness statements or any other specific information, facts or evidence which would satisfy an objective observer that the applicant may have committed a criminal offence.

However, it was not shown by the Government that in the present case the above mentioned directives had been taken into account by the domestic courts. Therefore, the vague and general references by both the prosecuting authorities and the courts, in their respective documents and decisions, to unspecified \u201ccase material\u201d, in the absence of any specific statement, information or concrete complaint, cannot be regarded as sufficient to justify the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the suspicion on which the applicant\u2019s arrest and detention were based (see Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 97). For the above reasons, the Court considers that no specific facts or information giving rise to a suspicion justifying the applicant\u2019s arrest were mentioned or produced during the pre-trial proceedings.",

In this respect, having regard to the above analysis, the Court finds that the material put before it does not meet the minimum standard set by Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (c) of the Convention for the reasonableness of a suspicion required for an individual\u2019s arrest and continued detention.
