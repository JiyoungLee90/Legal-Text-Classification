However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, \u00a7 64, Reports 1997III).",

It notes, at the same time, that the first applicant furnished no documents to corroborate that Mr\u00a0Ramzan Guluyev's daughter had even been born, let alone to prove that the latter was dependent on the first applicant and not on her mother or other relatives.

Furthermore, in their submissions before the Court the applicants referred to the fact that the first applicant was suffering from cancer at the time of her son's abduction (see paragraphs 11 and 88 above). Therefore, leaving aside the question whether cancers could in principle be provoked by psychologically traumatising situations, the Court concludes that this is obviously not the case in the present circumstances. Accordingly, the Court finds that there is no direct causal link between the violation of Article 2 in respect of the first applicant's son and her claim for medical expenses.",
