Referring to Article\u00a014 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) of the Convention, the Supreme Court highlighted the significance of the right to examine witnesses and pointed out that under Article\u00a0281 \u00a7\u00a02.1 of the Code, the reading out of witness\u2019s statements must be secured by affording the accused the opportunity to challenge those statements at previous stages of the proceedings, for example by asking questions and presenting objections during pre-trial confrontations.",

If a party insists on calling a witness whose testimony may be important to the case, the court should take all available measures to ensure the presence of the witness in court. When that witness is available for questioning, the reading out of his or her deposition should be considered inadmissible evidence and should not be relied upon. However, when the witness is not available for questioning, the defence should still be provided with appropriate procedural safeguards such as the ability to challenge the read-out deposition, request the examination of further evidence, as well as to consider any pre-trial face-to-face confrontation between that witness and the defendant when the latter was given an opportunity to put questions to the former (see also the admissibility decision of 7 December 2006 (no.\u00a0548-O)).",

At the same time, it noted in respect of the first step that while the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of the witness cannot of itself be conclusive of the unfairness of the applicant\u2019s trial, it is a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial, and one which may tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (\u00a7\u00a0113). Expounding on the interplay of the second and third steps the Grand Chamber highlighted the importance of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the absent witness\u2019 testimony was the sole or the decisive basis for the conviction, but also in those cases where in the domestic courts\u2019 assessment that evidence, without clearly reaching the threshold of \u2018sole or decisive\u2019, carried significant weight and its admission may have handicapped the defence (\u00a7 116). Lastly, it should be underlined that while as a rule, it is pertinent to examine the three steps of the AlKhawaja test in the order defined in that judgment, it may be appropriate, in a given case, to examine the steps in a different order, in particular if one of the steps proves to be particularly conclusive as to either the fairness or the unfairness of the proceedings (cited above, \u00a7 118).",

The information obtained by the trial court from various medical facilities also demonstrated that she had been suffering from a perinatal and alcoholinduced organic mental disorder, had been having episodes of psychosis and seizures, and had been hospitalised at least six times during the previous three years (see paragraphs 14-15 above).
