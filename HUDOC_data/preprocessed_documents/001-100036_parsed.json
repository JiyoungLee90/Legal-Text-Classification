The Court also observes that the presumption is in favour of release (see McKay v. the  [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006X). What is more, the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in abstracto. Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features (see J\u0117\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7 93). Continued detention may be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the right to liberty (see Lavents v. , no. 58442/00, \u00a7 70, 28 November 2002).",

To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and of the matters established as fact by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0152).",

In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. The need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view. It must be examined with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may either confirm the existence of a danger of absconding and reoffending or make it appear so slight that it cannot justify detention pending trial (see Letellier, cited above, \u00a7 43; Panchenko v. , no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7\u00a0106, 8 February 2005; also see Smirnova, cited above, \u00a7 59).",

The Court nonetheless observes, that already the second period of detention, which lasted until 19\u00a0July 2002, the date of the applicant's conviction by the \u0160iauliai  (see paragraph 48 above), was of a rather long duration.

At that stage of the proceedings those reasons were sufficient to justify keeping the applicant in custody (see Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7 176).",

Accordingly, the authorities were under an obligation not only to analyse the applicant's personal situation in greater detail and to give specific reasons for holding him in custody but also to conduct the criminal proceedings with particular diligence. The Court observes in that connection that the new indictment against the applicant, approved in April 2000, related to offences which had been committed in 1996-98.",

As can be seen from those judicial orders, the reasons given for extending the applicant's detention were just a brief and abstract repetition of the criteria enumerated in Article 104 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, governing the grounds to maintain a person in detention, without specifying the manner in which those grounds applied to the individual case of the applicant (see Lavents, cited above, \u00a7\u00a073, and, by converse implication, Silickis and Silickien\u0117 v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 20496/02, 10\u00a0November 2009). The Court could accept that, as submitted by the Government, the fact that the applicant was charged with serious crimes and his co-conspirators testified could have been one of the specific reasons for his continued detention. However, those grounds were not analysed in any great detail in any court order made with respect to the applicant. The reasons given in the orders remained general, theoretical and nearly identical throughout time, without examining the personal circumstances of the applicant, and therefore were clearly insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7 3 (see paragraphs 79 and 80 above).

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV).

The same paragraphs, taken together, require the Contracting States to take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him, such measures being part of the diligence the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Sadak and Others v. , nos.\u00a029900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2001VIII).",

From the reading of the Court of Appeal's and the Supreme Court's decisions it emerges that they did consider the applicant's arguments in the light of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention and gave them reasoned responses, nonetheless finding that, in view of other available evidence, there was enough proof against the applicant.
