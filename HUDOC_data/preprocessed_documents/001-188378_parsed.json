As to the Government\u2019s submission that even had it been lodged, the appeal had been returned to the applicant unexamined because the statement of intent had not complied with the procedural rules, the Court considers that this is merely speculation unsupported by any evidence. Moreover, that submission contradicts the Government\u2019s other submission that the applicant\u2019s appeal had \u201capparently [been] accepted for consideration\u201d (see paragraph 19 above).",

The Government neither argued that the provision was likewise applicable to appellate court decisions nor cited any other provision which would give recourse to the same option in appellate proceedings. Even on the assumption that the above provision is also applicable to appellate court decisions, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint was that no decision had been taken on his appeal because it had been mislaid, and the Government did not explain how he could have raised this particular point in the framework of the provision in question.",

In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Court has no reason to doubt that the copy of the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation in the case file and dated 17 May 2008 is indeed the same as the one he lodged with the Supreme Court. In any case, the Government did not explain how a request that the Supreme Court rectify its mistake as to the date would have led to an examination of the merits of the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation.",

However, the Supreme Court did not address that argument at all, having held instead that the applicant had not first appealed against the above judgment and therefore that it could not review the appeal in cassation (see paragraph 11 above). In the absence of any further explanation by the Supreme Court about how it reached this conclusion, despite the arguments to the contrary raised by the applicant in his appeal in cassation, and also taking into account the findings made in paragraph\u00a022 above, the Court considers that the above conclusion was the result of a manifest error on the part of the Supreme Court. The Government did not present any argument that would convince the Court to reach any other conclusion. The Court thus finds that the Supreme Court did not ensure that the applicant had a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Dulaurans, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-39).",
