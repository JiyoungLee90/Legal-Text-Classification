According to a partial copy of her witness statement furnished by the Government, she stated that Sarali Seriyev had a disability: he had lost his hand as a result of a mine explosion. On 1 June 2004 she had been at home when she had heard from the hallway an order to put her hands up. She saw a man in camouflage uniform holding a machine gun, and her brother Sarali next to him. The man asked whether anyone else, other than the family members, were in the house. When the applicant responded that only family members were in the house, the man asked what had happened to her brother's hands. The applicant explained that a mine had exploded in his hands and that there were medical documents certifying it. Several more men entered the house and asked her to fetch the documents. After the applicant returned with the papers, they sprayed her in the eyes with tear gas, pushed her into a room and dragged her brother downstairs. She attempted to follow them, but one of the abductors pointed his gun at her and ordered her to get back in the room. Then the applicant decided to call for help from the window; from there she saw several more armed men in camouflage uniforms in the yard and five or six VAZ-21099 cars. All the vehicles were silver-coloured, except for one, which was white. The intruders put Sarali into one of the cars and drove away.",

There had been Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the settlement. Most of the armed men who had abducted Sarali Seriyev had spoken Russian without accent, which proved that they were not of Chechen origin and belonged to the federal forces. The men, who were armed and wearing specific camouflage uniforms, had arrived in a convoy of several vehicles during the daytime, which demonstrated that they had been allowed to drive around and pass through the checkpoints. The abductors were a large group and they acted in a manner similar to that of special forces carrying out identity checks. The applicants further submitted that since Sarali Seriyev had been missing for a very long time he could be presumed dead. That presumption was further supported by the circumstances in which he had been arrested, which should be recognised as life-threatening.

They further argued that there was no convincing evidence that the applicants' relative was dead. The Government raised an objection to the applicants' presentation of facts alleging that the applicants' description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction was inconsistent. In particular, they referred to inconsistencies in the applicants' statements provided to the investigation and to the Court in respect of the precise sequence of events during the abduction and the first applicant's submission to the Court concerning his attempts to follow the abductors by car. Referring to the applicants' witness statements given to the investigation, they pointed out that the first applicant had not informed the investigators about his attempt to follow the abductors by car and that both applicants had not mentioned the presence of their relative Imali in the house during the abduction. The Government further submitted that fact that the majority of the abductors spoke unaccented Russian, were wearing camouflage uniforms and drove around in several vehicles did not mean that these men could not have been members of illegal armed groups or criminals pursuing a blood feud. They asserted that the crime could have been attributable to illegal armed groups and pointed out that groups of mercenaries from Ukraine had committed crimes in the . They further emphasised that members of illegal armed groups could have passed through the checkpoints in the area under the full control of the Russian federal forces.",

The investigation in case no. 36076 was instituted on 2 July 2004, that is, a month after Sarali Seriyev's abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were delayed or not taken at all. For instance, the investigators did not question the Russian federal servicemen who had been on duty at the checkpoints on the day of the abduction; they had not questioned the applicants' neighbours apart from Mr V.S., who could have also witnessed the abduction (for example, see paragraph 54 above) and they had failed to question any of the local law-enforcement or military officers about their possible involvement in the abduction. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, the Court emphasises in this respect that while the suspension or reopening of proceedings is not in itself a sign that the proceedings are ineffective, in the present case the decisions to adjourn were made without the necessary investigative steps being taken, which led to numerous periods of inactivity and thus unnecessary protraction. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative\u00a0measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
