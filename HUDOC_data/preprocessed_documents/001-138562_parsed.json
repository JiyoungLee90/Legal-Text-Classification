It ruled that the applicant\u2019s behaviour in\u00a02006 had called into question whether he was fully aware of the severity of the acts he had been sentenced for in 2001 and the effectiveness of the psychiatric treatment that he had received until the end of 2006. It held that the writ of nolle prosequi did not provide a basis for concluding that the applicant was no longer a threat to public safety. By contrast, the events in\u00a02006 showed that the applicant still had difficulties controlling his sexual instincts in the presence of women who were in a situation in which they were not able to defend themselves, and that there was therefore a risk of recidivism. The Federal Supreme Court further held that his expulsion was proportionate under Article 8 of the Convention. It established that after his release from prison in December 2002, the applicant had been able to stay in Switzerland only because he had married a Swiss citizen in April 2003. It had learned from the hearings before the cantonal authorities that his wife, who had been informed about the applicant\u2019s situation since the beginning of their relationship, had hesitated to settle in Switzerland. Only two years after their wedding, had she left her job in Germany and come to live with the applicant. Furthermore, there was no indication that she wanted to stay in Switzerland in the long term. With regard to the applicant\u2019s personal life, the Federal Supreme Court noted that having arrived in Switzerland at the age of twenty-seven, he had always worked as a chauffeur but was neither professionally nor socially particularly well integrated. In the light of the seriousness of the crimes committed and the established risk of recidivism, the applicant\u2019s interest in remaining in Switzerland did not outweigh the State\u2019s interest in expelling him.",

However, he retained the possibility to apply for permission to enter Switzerland as a tourist or even to request reconsideration of the entry ban. In July 2007, one month after the final decision of the Federal Supreme Court, the applicant \u2013 who at that time was probably still living in Switzerland \u2013 had unsuccessfully applied to the authorities of the Canton of Geneva for permission to return to Switzerland. In 2008 he had further applied for a Swiss work permit. The cantonal authorities in Geneva had however dismissed his request because of the entry ban in force. The applicant had not submitted any further requests to the Swiss authorities. The Government also informed the Court that on 10 January 2012 the applicant had received a new sentence in Switzerland for entering Swiss territory without the necessary authorisation and without a valid passport, and for riding a motorbike under the influence of alcohol without having his driving licence with him. From those proceedings it transpired that the applicant had already been sentenced for illegally entering and working in Switzerland on 5 May 2009, and that he had an adult son living in Peru.",

However, he had not proven that his behaviour had changed in the long term. In the Government\u2019s view, the new charge brought against him in 2006 weighed heavily, especially as it related again to offences against the sexual integrity of persons incapable of resistance and showed that, despite his psychiatric treatment, the applicant still had difficulties in controlling his sexual behaviour towards women in vulnerable situations. Although the public prosecutor had discontinued the criminal investigations, those facts could be taken into account as they had either been recognised by the applicant himself or established by evidence.

Furthermore, the refusal of the applicant\u2019s residence permit for Switzerland had little impact on his relationship with his brothers and sisters or his social life.

Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I). It must therefore be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitute part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8. An expulsion of a settled migrant can therefore constitute an interference with his or her right to respect for private life. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see \u00dcner v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a046410/99, \u00a7 59, 5 July 2005).",

However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant spent some of those years in prison and that his residence status had remained unsettled since October 2002. The Court is therefore not willing to attribute the same weight to the applicant\u2019s duration of stay in Switzerland as it would had he lived there with a valid residence permit throughout that period. In the light of his conviction for a serious crime, the applicant should not have been entirely unprepared for the final endorsement of the expulsion order and the refusal of his residence permit by the Federal Supreme Court in 2007.",

On the one hand, the applicant generally made considerable efforts to improve his behaviour after his release on parole in December 2002. He collaborated with the domestic authorities, received psychiatric treatment and continued working. On the other hand, although the criminal proceedings in 2006 were discontinued by order of the public prosecutor, the facts that led to those criminal proceedings are nevertheless a matter of concern to the Court. The charges were of a similar nature to those for which the applicant had been convicted in 2001 and the criminal charge against him in 1995. Furthermore, the public prosecutor described the applicant\u2019s behaviour towards the inebriated woman as not criminal but certainly inappropriate. In addition, information received from the Government this year further revealed that the applicant had been sentenced twice for illegal entry into Switzerland since his expulsion in\u00a02008. The Court therefore concludes that although the applicant has shown willingness to improve his behaviour, there is still a certain risk of recidivism.",

Moreover, until she moved to Switzerland in 2005, she had been living and working in Germany. The Court therefore considers that the couple took a conscious decision to settle in Switzerland rather than in Germany, despite the risk that they might not be able to remain there. Furthermore, after the final domestic decision in 2007, the couple, who had no children, were able to resettle together in France, close to the Swiss border. Owing to the German nationality of the applicant\u2019s wife and the AFMP (see paragraph 22 above), they never faced the risk of being separated from each other. In that respect, the fact that the applicant\u2019s wife had a nationality other than that of the respondent State distinguishes this case from others where the spouse of the person to be expelled had only the nationality of the expelling State (see, for example, Boultif, cited above, \u00a7 53). For the same reasons, the couple did not have to consider the difficulties the wife would encounter if they had to establish a family life in the applicant\u2019s home country, Peru. Their family life has therefore not been directly affected by the expulsion order.",

Under certain circumstances the relationship between siblings also falls under the concept of family life, depending on the existence of close personal ties (see Moustaquim v. Belgium, 18 February 1991, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 193; Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, \u00a7 31, series A no.\u00a031; and K. and T. v. Finland [GC], no. 25702/94, \u00a7 150, ECHR 2001-VII). In the present case, however, the Court is of the view that the applicant has not demonstrated that especially close ties with his brothers and sisters existed. The Court therefore considers that although the applicant\u2019s relationships with his siblings are covered by the private life aspect of Article 8 of the Convention, they can be maintained from a distance, particularly given that he was able to settle close to the Swiss border in France where his brothers and sisters could easily visit him (see, mutatis mutandis, Shala v. Switzerland, no. 52873/09, \u00a7 54, 15 November 2012).",

In its case-law the Court has repeatedly held that the permanent nature of an exclusion order was a very intrusive measure in a person\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention and that, based on the particular facts of each case, a limited duration of such a measure was usually more proportionate (see Emre, cited above, \u00a7 85, and the case-law referred to therein). The Court however also notes that the Government have emphasised that the applicant could always apply for authorisation to enter Switzerland as a tourist or request the domestic authorities to reconsider the decision regarding the entry ban. The applicant has not made use of those possibilities. He only applied for permission to return to Switzerland in 2007, a month after the entry ban had entered into force, and for a work permit in 2008-2009, which the cantonal authorities refused on account of the expulsion order. The Court therefore observes that although the entry ban was for an unlimited period of time, the applicant was not completely prevented from entering Switzerland with the relevant authorisation. Furthermore, the entry ban might eventually be lifted entirely if the applicant so requests (see, mutatis mutandis, Kissiwa Koffi v. Switzerland, no. 38005/07, \u00a7 70, 15 November 2012). The applicant now lives close to the Swiss border and his social ties with Switzerland are therefore not seriously disrupted by distance.",

The court did not mince its words when referring to the applicant as an \u201canimal on heat\u201d (\u201canimal en rut\u201d), using language that one would expect to hear in the street rather than in a reasoned act of adjudication. But when it came to justifying the expulsion order, the sole argument given was as follows: \u201cThe need for an expulsion measure is self-evident. The clemency shown in such matters in the case-law requires that [the expulsion] be suspended\u201d (\u201cUne mesure d\u2019expulsion s\u2019impose \u00e0 l\u2019evidence. La cl\u00e9mence de la jurisprudence en la mati\u00e8re impose le sursis\u201d). The Court of Cassation of the Canton of Vaud confirmed, by a judgment of 15 August 2000, the conviction and sentence, but on an appeal on grounds of nullity (pourvoi en nullit\u00e9) by the public prosecutor, the Court of Cassation of the Federal Supreme Court annulled, by a judgment of 14\u00a0June 2001, the impugned judgment of the Court of Cassation of the Canton of Vaud and remitted the case for a new judgment. By a new judgment of the Cantonal Court of Vaud of 24 September 2001, the applicant was found guilty of the same offence and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The expulsion order banning him from Swiss territory for the subsequent period of ten years was maintained, subject to a suspension on condition that his behaviour remained irreproachable for five years. By so finding, the first Criminal Court judgment did not provide any plausible legal ground for the expulsion order other than that it was \u201cself-evident\u201d! A single word, \u201cclemency\u201d, was invoked to determine the suspension of the expulsion. No reference whatsoever was made to the factual and legal requirements for the imposition of such a measure.",

Both decisions were confirmed by a decision of the Cantonal Appeals Board of 19 May 2005, which was quashed by the Federal Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 9 January 2006. After reassessing the situation, the same Cantonal Appeals Board reaffirmed, by a decision of 14 February 2007, its previous decision dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal, with the argument that the applicant had in the meantime been charged with another criminal offence of a sexual nature, thus proving the existence of a threat to public safety. The Federal Supreme Court explicitly upheld this understanding by a judgment of 25 June 2007. Yet the public prosecutor of Geneva had, on 9\u00a0February 2007, decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings for lack of evidence of any criminal conduct. In other words, the Federal Supreme Court based a presumption of a threat to public safety on a decision to discontinue criminal proceedings. In fact, the Federal Supreme Court invoked not one, but two decisions discontinuing criminal proceedings against the applicant, one referring to a complaint of 2006 and another referring to a much older complaint dating back to 1995. In both cases, the applicant was not even formally accused of any criminal offence, but that was enough for the Federal Supreme Court to ground a presumption of risk to public safety.",

Moreover, it is to be stressed that the Federal Supreme Court inferred a threat to public safety from legally irrelevant facts. The discontinuance of the criminal proceedings initiated in 1995 and 2006 was not based on a procedural ground, but on the substantive ground of a lack of criminal characterisation of the facts imputed to the applicant. A threat to public safety was ascertained on the basis of two decisions dismissing criminal charges for a lack of criminal characterisation of the facts.

On the contrary, the Federal Supreme Court attached extremely severe legal consequences, namely the applicant\u2019s expulsion, and not temporarily but for an unlimited period of time, to facts that had been considered legally irrelevant by the competent public prosecutors.",
