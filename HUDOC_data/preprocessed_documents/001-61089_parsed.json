Having summarised the events, the governor concluded that the accusations made by the applicant were mere allegations since there was no evidence to substantiate them. He noted that on 4 August 1993 the applicant had received a phone call from a person who had told him to bring TRL 1 billion to an address in Elaz\u0131\u011f if he wanted to rescue his son. When the applicant had gone to the address accompanied by police officers from the Elaz\u0131\u011f Security Directorate, they had not been able to find anyone. Meanwhile, following inquiries made by the Elaz\u0131\u011f police, it had been established that the residents at this address were two journalists from \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem who had moved out 15 or 20 days before. The police had found the two journalists concerned and had taken statements from them. The governor concluded from these facts that the impugned incident had been a settling of scores within the PKK.",

Nor did he find any fracture or bruising thereon. There was no sign that the deceased had been either in a fight or hit, beaten, pushed, thrown or killed, or that the body had been brought and thrown into the water. However, the witness saw some marks on the neck and diagnosed them as being erythema, an allergic reaction. He did not think it was necessary to note this in the autopsy report. The witness considered it unnecessary to call in a pathologist or to apply to superior authorities for an autopsy, since he had no doubt that it was a case of ordinary drowning.",

At the beginning of his testimony, the witness stated that he had not taken any steps to see whether the body he had found matched any person reported as missing. After consulting the doctor and having heard the witnesses, he decided that a systematic autopsy was unnecessary as there was nothing suspicious about the incident and that he had come across similar drowning incidents in the past. However, he had not encountered a case where the identity of the victim was unknown and the identity card missing. Later he said that he had instructed both the gendarmes and the police to investigate whether anyone had reported a relative missing. He had the body sent to the morgue of the Elaz\u0131\u011f State Hospital as there was no suitable morgue in Sivrice. He was informed later that the body had been buried because of a technical problem in the morgue. However, he did not know when the body had been buried and who had ordered the burial. He did not know anything about Ferhat Tepe until Ferhat\u2019s cousin, a lawyer, had applied to their office five days after the incident. When the witness learned that the scene of the incident fell within the territorial jurisdiction of Elaz\u0131\u011f, he issued a decision of non-jurisdiction on 9 August 1993.",

The Government were unable to find these witnesses or serve summonses on them, explaining that they had been released from prison at various dates between 5 October 1993 and 6 July 1994 and that their addresses were unknown to the authorities.

X\u2019s oral account confirmed the Court\u2019s previous finding that the security forces suspected Ferhat Tepe of possible involvement in the PKK, since X had identified Ferhat as a member of the PKK who had been sentenced to death by the organisation (see paragraph\u00a096 above). While X recounted in detail his contacts and conversations with Ferhat Tepe prior to his apprehension, his account of his meetings with Ferhat were vague and unspecific. Furthermore, although X gave animated and detailed information concerning Ferhat\u2019s sexual relations with a female member of the PKK, which had caused her death and subsequently constituted one of the grounds for Ferhat\u2019s death sentence, his account concerning Ferhat\u2019s collection of money for the PKK and his use of that money to build a house and to buy a car lacked precision and any proof. In view of the aforementioned considerations, the Court finds that X\u2019s allegation that the applicant\u2019s son could have been killed by the PKK was not sufficiently substantiated by the evidence given and cannot be regarded as a fact or a significant probability. There is accordingly no satisfactory explanation as to who could have killed Ferhat Tepe, bearing also in mind X\u2019s statement that he did not know whether the applicant\u2019s son had been killed by the PKK (see paragraph 97 above).",

After having checked the custody records, they all reported to the prosecuting authorities that Ferhat had never been taken into custody by the gendarmerie to which they belonged (see paragraphs 98, 100 and 102 above). In this regard, the Court notes with concern Mr Hatipo\u011flu\u2019s statement that mistakes occurred in the keeping of custody records at headquarters (see paragraph 99). In the Court\u2019s opinion, his statement confirms the Convention institutions\u2019 earlier findings concerning the inadequacy and unreliability of custody records (see \u00c7i\u00e7ek v. Turkey, no. 25704, \u00a7\u00a7 137-138, 27 February 2001, unreported; \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 105, ECHR 1999-IV; Ayd\u0131n v.

Against this background, the Court considers that even if the name of the applicant\u2019s son does not appear in the custody ledgers, that does not prove that the security forces did not arrest him. Accordingly, no conclusion can be drawn from these witnesses\u2019 testimonies as to the alleged detention of Ferhat Tepe.",

It further notes that the evidence given by Mustafa Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, who was present at the post\u00a0mortem examination and subsequently issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction, indicated that the witness lacked competence and reliability. The Court points out in this connection that the witness, while stating on the one hand that he had no reason to suspect that this was anything else than an ordinary case of drowning similar to cases he had already seen, claimed on the other hand that he had not previously encountered a case where the person\u2019s identity card was missing (see paragraph\u00a0107\u00a0above). The Court also finds the witness\u2019s explanations contradictory in that he admitted not having taken any steps to see whether the body matched that of any person reported missing and later claimed to have instructed both the gendarmes and the police to find out whether there were any persons reported missing. It further appears that the security forces and the prosecuting authorities were unaware of the disappearance of Ferhat\u00a0Tepe (see paragraph 107), contrary to what was alleged in the letter from the Ministry of the Interior (see paragraph 65).

He did not consider it necessary to conduct a further investigation since there was no evidence on which to conclude that Ferhat Tepe had been abducted and tortured to death. The Court is struck by the fact that the witness deemed it unnecessary to extend the investigation although it had been alleged that secret forces within the State security forces had abducted and killed a young man. This is parallel to the above finding (see paragraph\u00a0151 above) that the judicial authorities did not consider hearing further witnesses, such as the members of the applicant\u2019s family or the security forces said to have been involved in the alleged killing, to verify the applicant\u2019s allegations.",

The Court notes that, apart from general observations on the body, the witness did not indicate in his report the skin marks which he had seen on the neck of the deceased. Although he told the Delegates that the death had occurred within a maximum of four hours before his arrival at the scene of the incident, the time of the death is not indicated in his report. Furthermore, the evidence given by the witness casts doubt on his credibility. At the beginning of his testimony the witness claimed that, at the relevant time, death by drowning occurred every day around the lake. At the end of his testimony he stated that in some weeks there were two such cases whereas in other weeks there was none. The Court further points out that the witness reached a firm conclusion of death by drowning without considering why a person would go swimming at around 4 o\u2019clock in the morning in his underwear, without an identification card, money or keys. The Court considers it remarkable that in the circumstances of such a case the witness considered it unnecessary to call in a pathologist or refer the matter to superior authorities for an autopsy, despite his not being qualified to conduct autopsies. The post-mortem report and Dr Altuner\u2019s statements lead the Court to conclude that he did not possess sufficient expertise to conduct a forensic examination on the body of the applicant\u2019s son.",

Accordingly, the Court refers to its finding above (see paragraph 163) to the effect that the applicant\u2019s allegations have not been sufficiently proved. It appears from the evidence that there were no eye-witnesses to the alleged abduction and killing of the applicant\u2019s son. Nor has it been established that Ferhat was seen in detention in Diyarbak\u0131r Prison. The witnesses referred to by the applicant remained anonymous and failed to give evidence for various reasons (see paragraphs 138 and 139 above). The only evidence available in this latter connection was the hearsay statement of the applicant\u2019s then lawyer, Mr\u00a0Osman\u00a0Ergin (see paragraph 143).",

It is true that the authorities were not informed by the applicant of his suspicion that General Korkmaz Ta\u011fma had been involved in the abduction of his son. However, they did reluctantly admit to hearing that persons within the State security forces might have been involved in the abduction but denied having heard anything about the contra-guerrilla forces in Turkey (see paragraph 17).

The Court underlines in this connection the importance and need for a medico-legal autopsy to be carried out by a qualified medico-legal expert or by a physician familiar with medico-legal examination in cases of suspected unnatural death (see Recommendation No. R (99) 3 of the Committee of Ministers on the Harmonisation of Medico-Legal Autopsy Rules, 2 February 1999). It is also of the utmost importance that, in such cases, the body of the deceased person should not be disposed of until an adequate autopsy is conducted by a physician, who is an expert in forensic pathology (see Section 12 of the UN Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/65 of 24 May 1989 on the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions).",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention.

It reiterates in this connection that only legal costs and expenses necessarily and actually incurred can be reimbursed under Article 41 of the Convention. Accordingly, the Court is not satisfied that in the instant case all the costs and expenses were necessarily and actually incurred. It considers excessive the total number of hours of legal work (over 274 hours) for which the applicant submitted claims in respect of his British lawyers and Turkish administrators and finds that it has not been proved that all those legal costs were necessarily and reasonably incurred. As regards the translations and summaries and administrative costs, the Court considers that they may be regarded as necessarily and actually incurred. Deciding on an equitable basis and having regard to the details of the claims submitted by the applicant, it awards him the sum of EUR 14,500, exclusive of any valueadded tax that may be chargeable, less EUR 2,922.97 received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe such sum to be converted into pounds sterling (GBP) at the date of settlement and to be paid into the bank account in the United Kingdom indicated in his just satisfaction claim.",
