In those moments, sparks of thought appeared. However, objectively and without renouncing the past, the conditions of the birth of Kurdish intellectualism are based on the 1970s. In earlier periods, there had only been individual and temporary developments not creating traditions. The political nature of the 20th century, the existence and rise of national liberation movements, the emergence of modern currents in Kurdish politics and, most importantly, the creation of a mass movement, served as the basis for the birth of the Kurdish intellectual. This process was manifested in the figure of the PKK. All political movements before the PKK were rebellious, devoid of political depth, tactical unity, stable path and permanence. The ideological and intellectual superficiality of these revolts and their fierce repression led to the loss of existing knowledge and to falling behind. From this point of view, through political and thoughtful analysis, while being free from the system and alienation, and bearing within it its own cultural identity based on the impoverished Kurdish rustics, [the PKK] allowed the beginning of a permanent and stable political enlightenment process.",

The Court finds no reason to depart from its considerations in the above-mentioned cases, particularly in view of the fact that, as a publisher, the applicant faced, for five years, the threat of a penalty. In the Court\u2019s opinion, that condition entailed real and effective restraint and had a deterrent effect on his very profession (see Erdo\u011fdu v. Turkey, no. 25723/94, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2000VI, and Ko\u00e7 and Tamba\u015f v. Turkey, no. 50934/99, \u00a7 39, 21 March 2006). The Court hence finds that the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant and the judgment of 23\u00a0September 2008 amounted to an \u201cinterference\u201d with the exercise of his freedom of expression and that he has \u201cvictim status\u201d under Article 10.

Within that context, in a number of passages the author assessed the establishment and development of the PKK and the Kurdish intellectuals\u2019 relationship with that organisation. The Court has examined the passages cited in the Istanbul Assize Court\u2019s judgment and also the article in its entirety. It observes that the author had particularly critical views on Kurdish intellectuals and sympathy towards the intellectual background of the PKK and its leader. However, in the Court\u2019s view, the article as a whole cannot be construed as encouraging violence, armed resistance or an uprising or being capable of inciting to violence by instilling a deep-seated and irrational hatred against identifiable persons, which are essential elements to be taken into account. The Istanbul Assize Court, however, does not appear to have given consideration to any of the above.
