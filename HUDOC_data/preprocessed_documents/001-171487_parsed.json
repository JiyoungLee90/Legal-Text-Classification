Furthermore, a punishment in the form of administrative detention of up to fifteen days was introduced for the first time. Another new form of punishment introduced by the amendment was community service.\u00a0In addition, the fine for breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was increased and the amounts fixed as follows: between 300 and 600 manats (AZN) for participants of an assembly; between AZN 1,500\u00a0and 3,000 for individuals who organise an assembly; between AZN 3,000\u00a0and 6,000 for persons in charge (v\u0259zif\u0259li \u015f\u0259xsl\u0259r) who organise an assembly; and between AZN\u00a015,000 and 30,000 for legal entities involved in the organisation of an assembly.",

The Court notes that the issues raised by the applicant are essentially the same as those examined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment (cited above). The facts of the Gafgaz Mammadov case closely resemble those of the present case. The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz\u00a0Mammadov judgment also apply to the applicant\u2019s first case. In that judgment, the Court noted in particular the existence of serious concerns about the foreseeability and precision of the legislation governing public assemblies, and about the possibility of public assemblies being abusively banned or dispersed (ibid., \u00a7 55); doubts about the credibility of the formal ground, namely, Article 310.1 of the CAO, invoked by the authorities for arresting and convicting the participant in an unauthorised demonstration (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 62); the failure by the authorities to take into consideration the fact that the demonstration had been notified (ibid., \u00a7 60); the lack of relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration, which had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner (ibid., \u00a7 61); and the lack of any acknowledgment that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64). Having regard to the above, in the Gafgaz Mammadov case the Court found that the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of assembly had been violated on account of the dispersal of the demonstration and his arrest and conviction.",

The Court observes that the organisers did not give the BCEA prior notice about the protest of 6 May 2014. However, it is ready to accept that that protest was an immediate response by people who had gathered near the Baku Court of Serious Crimes to the judgment of that court against certain members of the opposition group, Nida. The spontaneous nature of the protest was warranted by those circumstances and thus the obligation to submit prior notice was overridden (see, mutatis mutandis, Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, ECHR 2007III). The Court also observes that, indeed, under Article 5 \u00a7 IV of the Law on Freedom of Assembly, no prior written notification was required for \u201cspontaneous assemblies\u201d. In such circumstances the Court has doubts as to whether the dispersal of the assembly of 6 May 2014 was prescribed by law (contrast with Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 69234/11, 69252/11 and 69335/11, \u00a7\u00a7 74-75, 11 February 2016). However, given that a more conspicuous problem arises with respect to the necessity of the interference, the Court considers that it is not appropriate to limit its examination under Article 11 of the Convention to the lawfulness of the interference only (see Gafgaz\u00a0Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 57).",

Therefore, for the same reasons as those outlined in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment, the Court concludes that the authorities in the present case have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the protest (see Gafgaz Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 61). The authorities also failed to acknowledge that the act of participating in an unauthorised peaceful assembly was by itself protected by Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

The Court considers that the analysis and conclusions made in the Gafgaz Mammadov judgment also apply to the applicant\u2019s first case. In that judgment, the Court noted in particular that the measures applied by the authorities, namely, arrest and custody followed by a sentence of several days\u2019 imprisonment, had pursued aims unrelated to the formal ground relied on to justify the deprivation of liberty, and implied an element of bad faith and arbitrariness (ibid., \u00a7 108).
