Furthermore it is primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, the Hadjianastassiou v.  judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 252, p. 18, para. 42).

That would be a daunting task and would cast doubt upon the legal certainty created by so many years of tacit acceptance. It is only in connection with specific applications relating to compliance with a provision which has been the subject of a reservation that the question should be examined. In such cases, the Commission should systematically transmit the question to the Court so that it may review the position.",

In principle that should not be possible, because a reservation may be made only at the moment of ratification. That would, however, be unreasonable, because the government concerned have been informed of the non-validity of their reservation only several years after the ratification. The government in question should therefore have the opportunity to rectify the situation and to submit a valid reservation within a reasonable time and on the basis of their former reservation. That is what appears to have happened in regard to the Swiss declaration which the Belilos judgment found to be invalid, but the government concerned ought also - and this does not appear to have been done - to inform the Court of the new wording, so that it can rule on the validity of the declaration, since otherwise the problem may recur.",

In my view, it may nevertheless be held that there has been no violation of this provision, in view of the fact that the individuals in question were arrested because, as is stated in Article 5 (art. 5), it was reasonably considered necessary to prevent them committing a public-order offence.",
