Nevertheless, even assuming that the call occurred, the Court cannot consider that the officers confined themselves to \u201cinvestigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner\u201d as although they could have assumed that the applicant had been inclined to commit an offence having regard to the information provided by the unidentified informant, there was no objective evidence to suggest that he would have sold the heroin he had purchased a few days back without their intervention. It is true that the applicant had a history of drug-related offences and that at the time of the police intervention a warrant had been issued for his arrest in connection with a previous conviction (see, a contrario, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Burak Hun, cited above, \u00a7 44). However, the Court observes that those facts were not known to the police officers when they called the applicant on his mobile telephone to ask him if he could procure heroin for them, as they found out about his convictions and the arrest warrant at later stages of the preliminary investigation (see paragraphs 10 and 14 above). With regard to the amount of drugs found on the applicant following his arrest, the Court notes that the applicant accepted from the outset that he was addicted to heroin and would regularly buy a certain amount from a drug dealer. It does not consider it relevant in the instant case that the applicant had already committed an offence prior to the police officer\u2019s telephone call, as using illegal drugs and their possession constitute criminal offences in themselves, because the offence of which he was convicted in the end was drugs trafficking (see paragraph 21 above).",
