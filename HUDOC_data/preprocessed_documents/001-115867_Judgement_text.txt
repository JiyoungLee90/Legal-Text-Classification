The case originated in four applications (nos. 29760/06, 48249/07, 4707/08 and 17792/10) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by nine citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Jovan Janjić, Mr Nedeljko Brborović, Mr Milenko Brborović, Ms Branislavka Brborović, Ms Vojka Kandić, Mr Miloš Kandić, Ms Mirjana Kandić, Ms Slavojka Kandić and Mr Draženko Zavišić (“the applicants”), between 12 July 2006 and 19 February 2010.
Mr Nedeljko Brborović, Mr Milenko Brborović and Ms Branislavka Brborović were represented by Ms Radmila Plavšić and Mr Ranko Vulić, lawyers practising in . Mr Draženko Zavišić was represented by Mr Đorđe Marić, a lawyer practising in . The Government of Bosnia and  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
This case is, like Čolić and Others v. , nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009, and Runić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 28735/06 et al., 15 November 2011, about the nonenforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments awarding war damages to the applicants.
On 30 August 2010 (applications nos. 29760/06, 48249/07 and 4707/08) and on 4 July 2011 (application no. 17792/10) the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicants live in .
By five judgments of different courts of first instance (the application no. 48249/07 concerns the non-enforcement of two judgments) of 22 January 2003, 5 October 1999, 25 June 2002, 19 December 2000 and 11 January 2000 which became final on 17 September 2003, 1 June 2001, 6 December 2004, 22 February 2001, 7 April 2004, respectively, the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay, within 15 days, the following amounts in convertible marks (BAM) in respect of war damage together with default interest at the statutory rate:
  BAM 5,555.25 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 881 in respect of legal costs to Mr Jovan Janjić;
  BAM 1,500 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the Kandićs;
  BAM 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, BAM 400 in respect of pecuniary damage and BAM 2,986.80 in respect of legal costs to the Brborovićs (this is the total amount awarded by the domestic judgments of 5 October 1999 and 25 June 2002); and
  BAM 28,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and BAM 2,015 in respect of legal costs to Mr Draženko Zavišić.
The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 27 August 2001, 22 December 2006, 12 October 2001 and 9 July 2004, respectively. In the case of Mr Jovan Janjić no writ of execution was issued.
The applicants, except for Mr Jovan Janjić, complained of nonenforcement to the Human Rights Chamber or to the . On 8 March 2006 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the case of the Brborovićs. On 20 December 2005 and 26 June 2007 the  ruled likewise in the case of the Kandićs and Mr Draženko Zavišić. The applicants did not claim compensation, but even if they had done so, their claim would have most likely been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, § 195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, § 79; AP 244/08 of 8 December 2010, § 37).
After the extensive information campaign explaining the available options for the settlement of the Republika Srpska’s public debt (including its debt arising from domestic judgments), between 31 March 2008 and 26 May 2009 the applicants informed the authorities that they agreed to be paid only the legal costs in cash and the principal debt and default interest in bonds. Government bonds were then issued on the following dates:
  on 7 October 2010 to Mr Jovan Janjić;
  on 30 October 2009 to Mr Nedeljko Brborović and MsBranislavka Brborović (in respect of the judgment of 25 June 2002);
  on 15 December 2008 to Ms Vojka Kandić, Mr Miloš Kandić and Ms Mirjana Kandić; and
  on 30 October 2009 to Mr Draženko Zavišić.
Ms Vojka Kandić, Mr Miloš Kandić and Ms Mirjana Kandić have already sold all of their bonds on the Stock Exchange.
Mr Nedeljko Brborović and Mr Milenko Brborović were not issued bonds in respect of the judgment of 5 October 1999.
The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Čolić and Others (cited above, §§ 10-12) and Runić and Others (cited above, § 11).
On 13 January 2012 the Domestic Debt Act 2012 entered into force, thereby repealing the Domestic Debt Act 2004. As regards the payment of war damage, it envisages the same solution as the old Act, with the change in the maturity of government bonds which is now 13 years instead of 14 years. The new Act is, however, irrelevant for the present case: as regards those applicants who were issued government bonds, the applicable provisions are those from the Domestic Debt Act 2004, which was in force at the time the bonds were issued; and the other applicants did not accept issuance of bonds in lieu of cash as means of enforcement, therefore, the new Act is also irrelevant.
