The court noted that the child had not had any contact with her father for four years, and that he had become a stranger to her. This had been confirmed, in particular, by the courtappointed expert. When heard in court, the child had clearly stated that she did not want to see her father. She only had limited, bad memories of him. The child, who appeared to have developed properly in relation to her age, had given the impression that she knew what was at stake and what she wanted. In spite of her young age, she had clearly and firmly expressed the desire to have her own wishes respected, suggesting that she would not accept being forced into doing something she did not want. The guardian submitted that he had not succeeded in breaking the child\u2019s aversion to her father.

She saw rejecting her father as the only way to preserve at least her mother\u2019s love. Relying on the expert\u2019s findings, the Court of Appeal observed that the child was mature enough to make a conscious decision and be aware of its consequences. She found herself in a psychological dilemma caused by the communication troubles between her parents, without yet having developed post-traumatic stress disorder. On the one hand, the loss of contact with a parent generally led to a disturbance of psychological development which affected a child\u2019s welfare, but on the other, forced contact in the context of a continuing dispute between parents could also seriously affect the child.",

The Family Court\u2019s decision had failed to take this \u201cprerequisite\u201d into account. The parents had not undertaken any steps in this direction. When heard in the Court of Appeal on 6 September 2012, the expert had clarified that if the parents did not change their way of communicating, which would necessitate at least some form of professional help such as mediation, it would cause more harm to attempt to reinstate contact than to exclude it altogether.",

Revocation had to be considered as a matter of course, pursuant to Article 1696 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code taken in conjunction with section 166(2) of the Family Matter Act if the measure was no longer necessary or if there was no longer a risk to the child\u2019s welfare. Furthermore, under the domestic law the applicant had been entitled, at any time, to submit a new request to court for a new contact arrangement. Besides these legal provisions, the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning had made it sufficiently clear that the denial of contact was not permanent, as it had explicitly stated that contact visits were not an option \u201cat the present time\u201d. The decision thus signified that no final answer had been given to the question of whether contact visits would ever be arranged again, especially as the Court of Appeal had stressed that the present decision did not rule out contact on the application of the child herself at a later date.",

However, stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations \u2013 such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental contact \u2013 or legal safeguards designed to secure effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that family relations between parents and a young child might be effectively curtailed (see Sommerfeld, cited above, \u00a7 63, and G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v.\u00a0Germany, no. 74969/01, \u00a7 42, 26 February 2004).",

                        "content": "8.\u00a0\u00a0As to the possibility of proposing a review (see paragraph 53), first, as mentioned in the Chamber judgment, section 24(1) of the Family Matters Act does not give the applicant a right formally to request a review. It is just a proposal to start new proceedings (Anregung eines neuen Verfahrens) which does not at all have the same procedural value as a formal application in civil law. Neither does it necessarily entail new proceedings or a judicial decision. The Chamber assumes that proposals for review are taken \u201cvery seriously by the courts\u201d. In the case at hand, at least, I cannot see any justification for such an assumption. Secondly, the judgment refers to the fact that the applicant has never even tried to use this procedural avenue. However, in the Court of Appeal the expert stated that further attempts by the father to have contact with his daughter would \u201cat present\u201d \u2013 in September 2012 \u2013 prejudice (\u201cabtr\u00e4glich sein\u201d) the best interests of the child, and that there were \u201cat present\u201d no possibilities for the father to actively and positively work towards such contacts. The applicant even agreed to mediation, whereas the mother refused such steps towards a solution. The problem did not seem primarily to lie with the father but with the mother and her \u2013 as worded by the Court of Appeal \u2013 \u201caversion to the father\u201d (\u201cAbneigung gegen den Vater\u201d). In this difficult situation, there was very little the father could do. Moreover, the Court of Appeal explicitly demanded that the applicant be \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201cunderstanding\u201d. Besides the fact that this is not at all easy for a father who has not seen his daughter for several years, the court\u2019s demand provides a further argument as to why the applicant cannot be blamed for not having proposed new proceedings. Thirdly, the judgment points out that the Court of Appeal, in its decision, \u201calluded to a possible change of the child\u2019s will with advancing age and maturity\u201d. Does that really constitute a counterbalancing factor? In this regard the Court has held that the right of contact is an important element of the duty to preserve the uniting bonds between father and daughter and that the national courts are under a positive and ongoing obligation to reassess the situation and to try to overcome any of the obstacles which might hinder the granting of even very limited contact (see Nekvedavicius v. Germany (dec), no. 46165/99, 19 June 2003). This positive obligation is not fulfilled by simply alluding to a possible change with advancing age and maturity. In addition, a lack of cooperation between parents does not dispense the domestic authorities from their positive obligation (see Bondavalli, cited above, \u00a7 82).",

This would, in the present case, have put a certain \u201cpressure\u201d on the mother, in particular, to work towards regular contacts between daughter and father, in the best interests of the child. The expert emphasised that regular contact should be revived and maintained and that contact should be suspended only \u201cat present\u201d due to the daughter\u2019s loyalty conflict with her mother.",
