In the present case, the Court considers that only postal expenses relating to the applicant's correspondence with the Court meet the above criteria. Thus, the applicant failed to provide the Court with any information or documents concerning the work allegedly done by lawyers and the relevant expenses allegedly incurred by him. The Court awards the applicant EUR\u00a019 in respect of his postal expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
