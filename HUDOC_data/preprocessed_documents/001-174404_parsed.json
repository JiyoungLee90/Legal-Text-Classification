In this respect, it is noted that in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public\u2019s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. At the same time, the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press (see, inter alia, Delfi AS v.

[A] has, because of his occupation, appeared publicly on behalf of the LIU and advocated the organisation\u2019s views. The defendant, who writes on a regular basis about various social matters, has discussed the fisheries management system though his writings and criticised certain aspects of it.\u201d Thus, the District Court adequately took into account that the subject matter of the disputed article was, as such, an issue of public interest. The Court notes that the Government did not dispute that finding (see paragraph 28 above).",

Furthermore, as found by the District Court, the applicant did not offer any proof for the factual allegations or demonstrate that they were based on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis. The fact that the applicant submitted that his allegations could not be confirmed does not, in the Court\u2019s view, detract from the sufficient basis upon which the District Court classified the statement in question as constituting \u201cinsinuations of fraud by abuse of position and negligence at work\u201d and thus defamatory.
