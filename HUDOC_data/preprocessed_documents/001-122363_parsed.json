Bulgaria, no. 18967/03, \u00a7\u00a0104, 3 December 2009, with further references). In addition, the Court was not satisfied that there was a sufficiently developed practice of the domestic courts relating to the remedy at issue (ibid., \u00a7 105). The Court has dismissed a similar objection in a number of other cases against Bulgaria concerning delays in completing the parallel process of restitution of agricultural land (see Lyubomir Popov v. Bulgaria, no. 69855/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102107, 7 January 2010; Vasilev and Doycheva v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a014966/04, \u00a7\u00a7 26-30, 31 May 2012; and Petkova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a019130/04, 17694/05 and 27777/06, 25 September 2012). The Government have not put forward arguments capable of convincing the Court to depart from the approach adopted in the above cases. In particular, it is noteworthy that the domestic judgments referred to by the Government (see paragraph 41 above) concern different situations and do not establish the effectiveness of a tort action in the specific circumstances of a case such as the present one.",

In particular, as concerns the possibility for a rei vindicatio action, the Court notes that what the applicants could obtain was a judgment ordering the authorities to transfer to them possession of the disputed plot.

Referring to Article 46 of the Convention, the Court recommended to the national authorities to introduce such remedies (see Mutishev and Others v.
