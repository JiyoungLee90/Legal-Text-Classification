The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported \u201cprotective function\u201d of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning 'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of 'State secrets' became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that 'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of 'State secrets'' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above).",

Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, \u00a7 176, ECHR 2010..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, \u00a7\u00a085, 12 November 2008).

In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on 's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above).  did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention.
