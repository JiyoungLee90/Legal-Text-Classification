The Court was of the view that, in the circumstances of this case, it would have been impossible for the applicant to find a new lawyer. Consequently, the brevity of the time remaining to the applicant to take any steps to have the cassation appeal in her case prepared and lodged by another lawyer did not give her a realistic opportunity of having her case brought to and argued before the cassation court.",

However, I should like to point out that it is not necessary that all the details of a legal aid mechanism be strictly regulated in domestic law (for example, the time-frame for a refusal to prepare a cassation appeal). The accessibility, quality and diligence of advice provided by lawyers should be the same, whether or not provided under a legal aid scheme. Had the legal aid system functioned properly and efficiently, making legal aid accessible in all circumstances, there might have been enough time for the applicant to take additional steps to seek advice from another lawyer and to have an appeal prepared, even at a very late stage prior to the expiry of the time-limit for lodging such appeals. Thus, within an efficient legal aid system, the lack of time, even if it placed the applicant in a difficult situation, might not in itself have been enough to result in a violation of the applicant's right of access to a court. In this respect, I consider that the situation cannot be compared to that in the case of Tabor v.\u00a0Poland (no.\u00a012825/02, judgment of 27\u00a0June 2006), where the Court did find a violation, in a case where the national court dealt with the applicant's request for legal aid in a way which left him without any realistic opportunity of seeking legal assistance of his choice in lodging a cassation appeal. In the Court's view, the manner in which the relevant court handled the applicant's request for legal aid was not compatible with the requirement of diligence (see Tabor v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046).",
