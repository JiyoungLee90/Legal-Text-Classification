In the meantime, the appeal court had allowed the applicant\u2019s application for the investigator to be examined again. According to the relevant court transcript, in reply to a question concerning the report on photo identification, the investigator maintained that the victim had orally identified photo no. 2, whereas she had mistakenly written down photo no. 4 in the report. As he had noticed that mistake only after she had left the police station, he had made a note to that effect. In view of the investigator\u2019s explanations regarding the photo identification report, the defence once again requested that the appeal court summon the victim. The applicant\u2019s lawyer maintained that it was necessary to examine her in court in order to establish the circumstances surrounding the photo identification parade, and also to verify the value of the necklace that had been stolen. By a letter of 5 September 2007 the victim once again informed the court that, in view of her pregnancy, she could not appear in court. On the basis of that statement, the prosecutor asked the court to rely on the victim\u2019s statement given before the first-instance court.

He only complained of his cataract. According to the case file, within that period of time he had various medical tests, including regular blood tests; the deterioration in his general condition was noted only in summer 2007. He was soon transferred to the prison hospital, where, after having the required medical tests, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis (see paragraph\u00a022 above). The applicant was immediately enrolled in the DOTS program, the first phase of which he successfully completed in May 2008 (see paragraph\u00a024 above). Within four months he was diagnosed with recurrent tuberculosis and was again enrolled in the DOTS programme (ibid.). It is important to note that, according to the case file, he was provided with a medical check-up only after his mother\u2019s repeated requests. However deplorable the four-month gap in the applicant\u2019s medical supervision may be, the Court cannot speculate as to the reasons why the tuberculosis reappeared. Subsequently, the applicant was placed in Ksani prison, where he continued to have tuberculosis treatment under the supervision of relevant specialists until his release on probation. The Court notes in this respect that it is guided by the due diligence test in its assessment of the adequacy of the treatment, since the State\u2019s obligation to cure a seriously ill detainee concerns the means to be employed and not the results to be achieved (see Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7 71). In view of the relevant case-law, and having regard to the relevant factual circumstances, the Court is not in a position to conclude that the overall medical treatment available to the applicant for tuberculosis was either insufficient or poor. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention in that respect.",

Five months after his arrest the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital for the first time, where he was prescribed drug-based treatment for his cataract (ibid.). Surgery was not mentioned. In May 2007 his diagnosis of a cataract and the need for an operation were confirmed (see paragraph 20 above). However, his medical file indicates that after he was diagnosed with tuberculosis his treatment for the cataract was suspended. Within the relevant period of time he was not seen by an ophthalmologist (see paragraphs 23-24 above). It was only in November 2008, after the Court had asked the Government to provide it with a specific treatment plan aimed at safeguarding the applicant\u2019s eyesight (see paragraphs 25-26 above), that he was transferred to the prison hospital and seen by an ophthalmologist (see paragraph 27 above). The applicant was subsequently offered an operation (ibid.). It is true that he rejected that offer. However, the fact that the applicant had to spend two and a half years in prison with a severe visual impairment before finally being offered a medical procedure capable of restoring his vision is, in the Court\u2019s view, highly deplorable. Thus, for a prolonged period of time, the authorities withheld from the applicant a medical procedure that could have restored his vision. They failed to provide any explanations to that effect. His medical file does not indicate, and nor did the Government allege, that his tuberculosis treatment necessitated the suspension of his cataract treatment and the postponement of the operation.",

With that application, the defence aimed to challenge firstly the results of the photo identification parade, and secondly the firstinstance court\u2019s classification of the purported offence as aggravated robbery in view of the price of the necklace. The way in which the appeal court accepted pregnancy as a valid reason for the victim\u2019s absence is not entirely convincing (see, for example, Bobe\u015f v. Romania, no. 29752/05, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, 9\u00a0July 2013). From a procedural point of view, no alternative ways of questioning the victim were ever considered by the court. However, from a substantive point of view, the Court notes that both aspects of the defence\u2019s argument as advanced by the applicant in his application to examine the victim were fully and comprehensively re-examined by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal. That court thus dismissed the aggravating circumstance, finding that the price of the necklace as estimated by the victim and accepted by the first-instance court had not been proved. The applicant\u2019s sentence was reduced as a result. As regards the results of the photo identification parade, the appeal court dismissed them as unreliable (see paragraph 14 above).",
