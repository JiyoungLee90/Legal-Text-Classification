However, in its recent judgment in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, 19\u00a0April 2007), the Court found that the functional criterion, adopted in the Pellegrin judgment, did not simplify the analysis of the applicability of Article 6 in proceedings to which a civil servant was a party or brought about a greater degree of certainty in this area as intended (\u00a7 55). For these reasons the Court decided to further develop the functional criterion set out in Pellegrin and adopted the following approach (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062):",

Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in the Pellegrin judgment, a \u2018special bond of trust and loyalty\u2019 between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article\u00a06 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified\u201d.",

The person applying for rescission [on account of newly discovered circumstances] should show that there was no opportunity to present the item of evidence at the final hearing and that the evidence is decisive\u201d (see Pravednaya v. , no.\u00a069529/01, \u00a7\u00a027, 18\u00a0November 2004). The Government did not point to any exceptional circumstances that would have prevented the commander\u2019s office from challenging the evidence at either first or appeal instance. On the contrary, it transpires that the military commander\u2019s office expressly waived its right to take part in the proceedings before the  and subsequently chose not to avail itself of the right of appeal against the first-instance court\u2019s judgment. It follows that the commander\u2019s office\u2019s request to re-open the case due to the discovery of the new circumstances was in essence an attempt to re-argue the case on points which the office had been able, but had failed, to raise in the original proceedings. The Court therefore considers the office\u2019s request to be an \u201cappeal in disguise\u201d rather than a conscientious effort to make good a miscarriage of justice (compare Pravednaya, cited above, \u00a7 32). The Court furthermore notes an exceptionally long period of time which preceded the office\u2019s application for rescission of the judgment of 25 January 2003. No justification for that delay was put forward by the Government. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the quashing of the judgment of 25\u00a0August 2003 breached the principle of legal certainty and that, in any event, it may not serve as a justification for the authorities\u2019 failure to execute a valid and enforceable judgment in the preceding period.",

The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found (compare Poznakhirina \u00a7\u00a033, and Sukhobokov, \u00a7 34, both cited above). The applicant was prevented from receiving money he had legitimately expected to receive under the judgment of 25 August 2003.
