The fact that the provision ordered the confiscation of a vehicle used by a person caught driving without a licence or without insurance, even if the vehicle belonged to a company the perpetrator worked for, or the vehicle belonged to a family member with whom that perpetrator lived, struck the necessary balance and was an appropriate deterrent to the commission of crime.

Article 3 of the Ordinance was therefore declared null and void in regard to such consequences. The Constitutional Court ordered the release of both vehicles, and the payment of nonpecuniary damages in the sum of 300 euros (EUR) to each of the applicants.

Furthermore, the Government submitted that once the Peugeot was released it was deposited under the authority of the courts as there was uncertainty as to who the owner of the vehicle was. It later turned out that that the hire purchase agreement of the Peugeot had stipulated that the vendor (the importer) remained the owner of the vehicle until the purchaser (the second applicant) paid the price in its entirety.
