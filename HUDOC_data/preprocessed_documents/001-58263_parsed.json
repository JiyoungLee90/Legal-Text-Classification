The latter\u2019s rulings on such special applications, like those of the Fund, were \u201cvery protective\u201d of victims. However, the latter were entirely free to accept the Fund\u2019s offer in respect of one head of damage and to bring an action for damages in an ordinary court in respect of one or more different heads of damage for which they had not been compensated by the Fund. That was precisely what the Court of Cassation had said in its judgment of 6 June 1997 in the present case, which reproduced the reasoning already followed by the Civil Divisions and the Social Division (see paragraph 34 above) The applicant was not entitled to rely on the rulings of the Conseil d\u2019Etat in other cases, concerning the State\u2019s liability. The interpretation of a statute was a matter for the courts alone, and in the present case for the Court of Cassation. References to the history of the legislation and subsequent proposals for amendments could not eclipse that fundamental rule.",

Loss of a lawsuit through a mistake on a point of law or procedure does not constitute denial of access to a court; that goes well beyond the requirements of Article 6 and reduces procedural law to a matter of litigants\u2019 subjective understanding of the law and procedure.",

Although Mr Bellet accepted the compensation in the belief that this acceptance would not deprive him of his right to claim additional compensation, F.E., after the Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment of 26 January 1994, knowing the risk he ran, could have argued in the Colmar Court of Appeal, and later before the Court of Cassation, that he had accepted the compensation without prejudice to his right to bring judicial proceedings, not once and for all. He had not appealed against the Fund\u2019s decision. He could perhaps have tried an application for leave to appeal out of time in respect of the special appeal which lay to the Paris Court of Appeal. He preferred to bring concurrent proceedings in the Colmar Court of Appeal. In such cases victims retain the right to bring proceedings in respect of heads of damage different from those for which the Fund has awarded compensation and on separate grounds, whether civil, criminal or administrative. What the Court of Cassation decided on 6 June 1997, confirming the judgment of 26 January 1994, was that victims could not claim compensation twice over for the same damage (see also Court of Cassation, First Civil Division, 28 April 1998). It therefore excluded the different interpretation of the law based on its drafting history that it had been possible to hold immediately after its enactment. Admittedly, from the humanitarian point of view, one can only regret such a situation and hope that the member States of the Council of Europe will set up procedures and machinery for double or additional compensation, but this remains within the competence of the States or a special European compensation fund. In the absence of such initiatives and possibilities, the European Convention can only offer the Article 6 approach. But can that approach, in the F.E. case, include, as grounds for finding a violation and as a criterion, \u201ca clear, practical opportunity of challenging the amount of compensation in a court\u201d (see paragraph 48 of the judgment)? Is there not a risk that this recent tendency of some of the Court\u2019s judgments will leave too important a place to the subjectivity of litigants to the detriment of procedural principles which are the guarantors of rights?",
