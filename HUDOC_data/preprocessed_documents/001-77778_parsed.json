If the subsidiary prosecutor takes over the proceedings, the public prosecutor is entitled at any time pending the conclusion of the main hearing, to resume management of the prosecution (CPA, section 63/2).

The Court has held on many occasions that where a person is injured while in detention or otherwise under the control of the police, any such injury will give rise to a strong presumption that the person was subjected to ill-treatment (Corsacov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055, and Bursuc v.
