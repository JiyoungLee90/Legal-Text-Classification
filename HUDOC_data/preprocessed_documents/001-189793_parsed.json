The compensation paid to the applicant had been proportional to the aim pursued. The market value of the plot of land in question had been calculated by applying income and comparative methods. The comparative method took into account several factors influencing the market value of agricultural lands, such as property rights and restrictions; appearance of the plot of land; existence of any water supplies; measurements, location and yield of the plot of land; melorative conditions; existence of any transport access; and slope degree and degree of rock content of the plot of land. The income method took into consideration the necessary expenses and the expected incomes of the growing crops in the agricultural lands at issue. The average fertility rates were used for the calculation of the market value of the plot of land in question. Data from neighboring and compatible plots of land not subject of expropriation for the State needs were used in the market value assessment.",

Armenia, no. 71306/11, \u00a7 58, 11 October 2018). For the Court it was not unreasonable that a certain choice of methods to be used during evaluation is left to the evaluator who chooses an appropriate method in a particular situation depending on the specificities of the real estate in question (ibid., \u00a7 57). As the applicant could challenge the report prepared by the evaluator hired by the acquirer of their property, the Court finds that the applicant was afforded sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness.
