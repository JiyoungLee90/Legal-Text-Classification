Having arrived at the scene, police officer K., off duty, and Mr\u00a0S., a volunteer law enforcer, established that there were no signs of any criminal act.

In this context the Court notes that, under section 4 of Decree 30/2011.

As a party to the criminal proceedings the victim has more procedural rights than as a simple complainant before the public prosecutor. Section 199(2) of the Hungarian Code of Criminal Procedure suggests that a substitute private prosecution is the normal remedy for the victim after the rejection by a higher-ranking prosecutor of a complaint against the decision by a lower-ranking prosecutor to discontinue the investigation.
