In practice, however, these claims only lead to recovery of insignificant amounts owing to inflation, which in the 1990s depreciated the national currency by a factor of several hundred, and as a result of the Bulgarian courts\u2019 practice of refusing revalorisation. The 1991 Act does not provide for recovery by persons in the applicants\u2019 position of the price they paid for the property.

The Court notes that the 1991 Act contained in its section 2 a special provision entitling persons in the applicants\u2019 position to seek compensation for all improvements in the property (see paragraph 21 above). That provision formed an integral part of the relevant legislation. As the Court stated in Velikovi and Others, when examining complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the specific context of restitution of property after the fall of communism, it must take into consideration, as a central factor, \u201cthe hardship suffered by the applicants and the adequacy of the compensation obtained\u201d through various procedures and possibilities available to them, as the case may be (ibid., \u00a7 190).",

Also, despite the final outcome of these proceedings, the Court considers that the applicants\u2019 attempt was not unreasonable. In particular, the first instance court granted their claim and awarded them a sum of money which was far from being insignificant (see paragraph 16 above). Therefore, it cannot be considered that the eventual ineffectiveness of the remedy employed by the applicants must have been obvious to them at the outset (see the following decisions which concerned the starting point of the six-month time-limit in situations where the applicants used remedies that proved ineffective: Lotter and Lotter v.

If national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. The Court enjoys a certain discretion in the exercise of that power, as the adjective \u201cjust\u201d and the phrase \u201cif necessary\u201d attest. In particular, if one or more heads of damage cannot be calculated precisely or if the distinction between pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage proves difficult, the Court may decide to make a global assessment (see Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2000-IV).",

However, where the failure to strike a fair balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s rights, rather than illegality, was the basis of the violation found, just satisfaction must not necessarily reflect the idea of wiping out all the consequences of the interference in question and compensation need not always equal the full value of the property (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, p.36, \u00a7 54, and The Former King of Greece and Others v.\u00a0Greece [GC] (just satisfaction), no. 25701/94, \u00a7\u00a7 75-78, 28 November 2002).",

The Court further notes that approximately one third of the property\u2019s area was taken up by a basement which, apparently, could not form a separate living space.
