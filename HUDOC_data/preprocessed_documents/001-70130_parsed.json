Since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, it has to be ascertained whether the situation amounted to a de facto expropriation (see the Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp.\u00a024-25, \u00a7 63).
