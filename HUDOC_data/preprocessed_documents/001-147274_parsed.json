Given that the procedure against the applicant had just reached the stage of the authorities introducing coercive measures, the Court is of the view that the granting of the request, that is, allowing the applicant, freshly apprehended, to attend the funeral under police escort, would not have been unreasonable in the circumstances. The Court notes in this connection that although the time available to the authorities to arrange for such an escort was admittedly short, the little distance between the place of interrogation and the cemetery would have facilitated their task. It is also noteworthy that, according to the reasoning given by the Attorney General (see paragraph 9 above), those detained on remand because of the reasonable suspicion of having committed a crime, as endorsed by a judge, can benefit from such leave, whereas arrestees \u2013 whose cases are normally in a rather initial stage \u2013 cannot.",
