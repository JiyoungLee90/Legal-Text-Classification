After an appeal by S.V. the Sofia Court of Appeal carried out a thorough analysis of the witness statements given at first instance, of the record of the examination of the murder scene conducted on the day after the killing, of the search and seizure measures, and of the conclusions of the numerous expert reports, the autopsy, etc. Following this, on 22 December 2014 the appellate court upheld the guilty verdict and sentence, but lowered the amount in damages to be paid to the second applicant to around EUR\u00a08,000.

The administrative remedy under the 2007 Act covers civil, administrative and criminal proceedings, including pre-trial proceedings (section 60a(2)). It is open to persons who are aggrieved by the length of proceedings which have come to an end. The judicial remedy under the SMRDA appears to cover all sorts of judicial proceedings (section\u00a02b). It is open to persons who are aggrieved by the length of proceedings which are still pending (section 2b(3)), as well as to persons who are aggrieved by the length of proceedings which have come to an end but who have not obtained adequate redress through the administrative remedy under the 2007 Act (section 8(2)).

Bulgaria ((dec.), nos. 6194/11 and 34887/11, \u00a7 98, 18 June 2013) the Court found that, taken together, an application for compensation under sections 60a et seq. of the Judiciary Act 2007 and a claim for damages under section 2b of the SMRDA could be regarded as effective domestic remedies in respect of allegedly unreasonable length of proceedings before the civil, criminal and administrative courts in Bulgaria.",

In the course of the investigation the higher prosecutors returned the case several times for a number of shortcomings to be redressed (see paragraphs 9-10 above). This resulted in the investigation lasting for over three years before the case was brought to court (contrast with Mulini, cited above, \u00a7 48, with S.Z. v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 49, and with Antonov v.

When, subsequently, a procedural defect led to the appellate court sending the case back to the investigation stage, this was remedied in less than a month (see paragraphs\u00a014-15 above). The ensuing delay concerned the trial stage and was the result partly of changes in the composition of the bench, which could not be dealt with other means than by restarting the trial (see paragraph 22 above).",

The latter had been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a final judgment and damages which the second applicant had sought had been awarded to her (see paragraph 18 above). The situation, therefore, has to be contrasted with that observed in a number of other applications before the Court. In those cases, for example Mulini, \u00a7\u00a7 44-46, and Antonov, \u00a7 51, both cited above, the numerous flaws of each investigation had made it impossible to establish the perpetrator or to shed sufficient light on the facts surrounding the death of the applicants\u2019 relative. Likewise, in the case of Anna Todorova v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no. 23302/03, \u00a7\u00a7 76-78, 24 May 2011), the violation of the procedural limb of Article 2 found by the Court had been the result of excessive length of the criminal proceedings coupled with the fact the authorities had not deployed reasonable efforts to gather the evidence and establish the facts and had thus failed to establish the perpetrator. Similarly, in the case of Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia (nos. 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10, \u00a7\u00a7 123-125, 18 December 2012), a conclusion of a violation of the procedural aspect of Article 2 was reached by the Court because the criminal proceedings had been plagued by a combination of defects, which included various delays and periods of inactivity along with a failure to take vital investigative steps, belated granting of victim status to the relatives, failure to involve relevant authorities in the proceedings, all of which had led to the inability to establish the perpetrators. Also, in Byrzykowski v. Poland (no. 11562/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0114 and 116, 27 June 2006) the proceedings had not reached any conclusive decision and the applicant had remained in a protracted state of uncertainty about the proceedings\u2019 outcome; similarly, in Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dek and\u00a0Dvo\u0159\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 v. Slovakia (no. 30754/04, \u00a7 66 and \u00a7 68 last sentence, 28\u00a0July 2009), the proceedings aimed at establishing the circumstances and attributing responsibility for conduct which had led to the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter had remained pending for more than twenty-one years, and no decision had been reached. Further, in Angelova and Iliev, cited above, \u00a7 101, as a result of deficiencies and delays in the investigation spreading over eleven years, no one had been brought to trial and the proceedings had been terminated as a result of expiry of the limitation period, despite the fact that, early on, the authorities had identified the perpetrator with some degree of certainty. Lastly, the situation in the instant case is to be distinguished from that in S.Z. v. Bulgaria, cited above, where, in addition to an excessive delay in investigating, there had been important omissions on the part of the investigating authorities (ibid., \u00a7 50) and considerable psychological stress placed on the applicant as she had been repeatedly made to recall her own ordeal during the proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a052) and had had to endure prolonged uncertainty about whether her aggressors would be punished or not.",

Furthermore, it notes that the applicants have been involved in the proceedings to an extent satisfying the requirement regarding the participation of next of kin under Article 2 (see paragraphs 11, 15 and 16 above), and the independence of the bodies conducting the investigation has not been called into question by the applicants at any point.

The Court already found that the excessive length of the criminal proceedings in the present case did not affect the overall effectiveness of the investigation under the procedural aspect of Article 2 (see paragraph 43 above). It is in this light that the remedy under the SMRDA, suggested by the Government as an effective remedy, will have to be assessed. The applicants, for their part, submitted that the remedy under the SMRDA was one only with respect to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 48 above, last sentence). It is true that the Court tends to examine claims about length of proceedings under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. However, considering that the duration of the criminal proceedings into the murder of the applicants\u2019 relative is covered by the procedural obligations of the State under Article 2 to carry out effective investigations in good time, the Court finds that the applicants may be considered as having an arguable complaint under Article 2. They are entitled to have access to a remedy domestically in connection with this complaint. It remains to be seen whether the remedy under the SMRDA is an effective one.",

The Court finds that, as follows from the text of the relevant legal provisions (see paragraphs 26-28 above), not only the accused but all parties to finished criminal proceedings, including private prosecutors and civil claimants, were entitled to seek related damages. This has been confirmed by the domestic courts (see paragraph 29 above). In addition, claims for damages for excessive length of proceedings can be introduced pursuant to those provisions either directly before the courts while the proceedings are pending, or first before the administrative authorities and, if not satisfied, before the courts after the proceedings have come to an end. Therefore, these remedies cover situations related to excessive length of both pending and finished proceedings, and the Court has already accepted that the combination of these two remedies could be regarded as effective in that context (see paragraph 25 above). Consequently, the Court finds that it cannot be said that an effective domestic remedy did not exist and was not available to the applicants in relation to their complaint about the length of the criminal proceedings into the murder of their relative.",
