In cases where the plaintiff sought payment of a sum of money, the value of the subject matter of the dispute was the amount sought in the civil action. As a direct consequence thereof, when a plaintiff brought a high-value claim, the defendant\u2019s costs of proceedings were also high. Furthermore, the costs of civil litigation were apportioned at the end of the proceedings in accordance with the success of the parties to the dispute. These rules also applied in cases where the State, represented by the State Attorney\u2019s Office, was a party. In the present case the applicant had sought payment of HRK\u00a0335,000 in compensation, whereas the domestic courts had eventually awarded him HRK 24,000, that is, only 7% of the amount sought, which had meant that the State had succeeded with 93%. Thus, the applicant had been ordered to pay 93% of the costs incurred by the State. That rule, providing for an obligation on the parties to pay costs depending on their success in the proceedings and which was determined in proportion to the value of the claim, pursued the legitimate aim of the proper administration of justice by preventing plaintiffs from bringing unfounded actions or submitting unreasonably high claims having no support in facts or not corresponding to the actual damage sustained, and by protecting the financial interests of defendants.",

What was more, after the medical expert had given his opinion and after it had become clear that the applicant had not been entitled to receive an amount that was even close to that initially sought, the applicant and his advocate had without any justification raised the claim to HRK 335,000 (see paragraph 13 above).

In the Stankov case the Court held that there had been a violation of the right of access to court primarily because it found that in a situation where the Government had not shown that there was developed or accessible case-law in respect of the level of compensation for unlawful detention, the applicant could not be blamed for putting a high estimate on the \u201cvalue\u201d of his freedom.

Even though it seems that the 1995 Guidelines were not published, the applicant did not argue, and there is no evidence to suggest, that they were inaccessible to his representative. On the contrary, the fact that the amounts the applicant\u2019s representative claimed in compensation for physical pain (HRK 15,000) and for fear (HRK 20,000) were not exaggerated in comparison with the upper limits set forth in the 1995 Guidelines (DEM\u00a05,000, that is, HRK 18,600 for physical pain, and DEM 3,000, that is, 11,160 HRK for fear), indicates that the applicant\u2019s advocate was familiar with those Guidelines (see paragraphs 13 and 30 above).",

In respect of that type of non-pecuniary damage the applicant sought HRK\u00a0300,000 in compensation but was awarded only HRK 5,000 by the domestic courts. In this connection the Court notes that neither the 1995\u00a0Guidelines nor the 2002 Guidelines specify any amounts in respect of that type of damage, nor is there any indication in the case-law of the Supreme Court as to what the appropriate level of compensation for that kind of damage would be \u2013 damage which, in terms of section 200 of the 1978 Obligations Act (see paragraph 29 above), is considered as damage resulting from a breach of rights of personality. Nonetheless, the Court considers, having regard to the amounts of compensation provided for in the 1995\u00a0Guidelines for the most serious types of non-pecuniary damage such as death of a close relative (DEM 15,000, that is, HRK 55,800) or severe disability of an immediate family member (DEM 20,000, that is, HRK\u00a074,400), that the applicant or his representative, although lacking clear guidance, had at least an indication that claiming HRK\u00a0300,000 for mental anguish suffered on account of ill-treatment by the authorities was most probably exaggerated. As to the applicant\u2019s argument that his claim should not have been considered excessive because the purpose of compensation was not only to compensate the victim but also to prevent future misconduct (see paragraph 75 above), the Court notes that Croatian law does not provide for punitive (exemplary) damages (see paragraph 29 above).",

In addition, the domestic courts did not order the applicant to pay statutory default interest on the amount of costs he was ordered to pay to the State. Therefore, if the HRK 18,907.28 is taken into account, the costs that the applicant had to pay the State (HRK 19,000) amounted to 44% of his overall financial award (HRK 42,907.28).
