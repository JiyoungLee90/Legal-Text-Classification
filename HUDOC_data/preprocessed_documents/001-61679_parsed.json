According to the director of the  prison, all necessary measures had been taken. The applicant had been treated according to the doctors' recommendations. In July 1997 he had been admitted to hospital for examinations but had been sent back to the prison as he had behaved rudely with the medical staff. A disciplinary punishment had been imposed in that connection on 6 August 1997. The applicant submitted that as a result the operation of his gland had been postponed. According to the medical records, the applicant was again brought to the hospital for examinations and treatment in October 1997, but the applicant alleged that he had been quickly returned back to his cell.

It took that long, including more than six years after the Convention's entry into force in respect of , for the Bulgarian legislature to abolish the death penalty. Secondly, the moratorium had been introduced by means of a mere decision by Parliament which could have been amended at any stage. That eventuality was by no means hypothetical, as is clear from the political debate on the death penalty in  until its abolition in 1998 (see paragraphs 20-28 of the judgment). Lastly, as to the consideration that not a single violation of the moratorium on executions occurred in  during these eight years, that fact could only be observed with hindsight and was therefore not capable of reducing the risk or the applicant's feelings of fear throughout that lengthy period.",
