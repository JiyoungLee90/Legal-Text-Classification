In addition to citing the seriousness of the charges as one of the reasons for remanding the applicant in custody, the domestic authorities considered that the applicant was liable to abscond in the light of his having been living in a place of residence other than that which he had registered. However, that risk was not assessed in the light of the applicant\u2019s medical condition, which called for in-patient treatment. As regards the risk of the applicant reoffending, the domestic courts did not refer to any circumstances warranting the detention of the applicant on that ground.
