France [GC], no. 3394/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2010). In all cases, it establishes the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of the laws concerned (see \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2005IV; Saadi v. the  [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2008; and Medvedyev and Others, cited above). It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, even when that law refers to international law or agreements, and it is for the Court to assess whether the effects of such adjudication are compatible with the Convention (Bosphorus Hava Yollar\u0131 Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

It observes that the applicant was legally represented in the enforcement proceedings and had the opportunity to make oral submissions (see paragraph 36 above). At the conclusion of the hearing, the High Court gave detailed reasons for its findings (see paragraphs 38-42 above). The Court notes that the finding that the default term was an integral part of the confiscation order, which was in turn part of the original sentence, does not appear to be unreasonable or arbitrary, and refers in this regards to its own finding in the case of Crowther, cited above, to the effect that the enforcement of a confiscation order by imposition of the default term of imprisonment did not involve the bringing of any new \u201ccriminal charge\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see\u00a0\u00a7 25 of the Court\u2019s judgment).

Indeed, the High Court specifically found that the  had not deliberately misled the Swiss authorities, that it had always made its intentions clear and that there had been no improper or unfair manipulation of the processes of extradition or for the enforcement of the default term (see paragraph 44 above).

The Court considers that any such misunderstanding did not render the applicant\u2019s detention arbitrary in all the circumstances of the case. It reiterates in this regard that the applicant\u2019s detention was based on the provisions of the 1988 Act and on a lawful order handed down by a court competent to make such an order. In the context of the enforcement proceedings and, subsequently, the judicial review proceedings, he was able to argue his case fully before the judge (see\u00a0paragraphs 32 and 36 above).
