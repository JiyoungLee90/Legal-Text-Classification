Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question witnesses against him, either when they make their statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

Furthermore, given that the Court\u2019s concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, it must review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors not only in cases in which the evidence given by an absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the accused\u2019s conviction. It must also do so in those cases where it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was the sole or decisive basis but is nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and that its admission may have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors will have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7 59, 12 September 2016).

The present case does not concern witnesses who gave evidence on matters they had seen or learnt about by hearsay (see, among many other authorities, Nikolitsas v. Greece, no.\u00a063117/09, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 3 July 2014), but rather an expert report which was drawn up by an independent expert appointed by the judicial authorities during the investigation with the aim of providing the court with information on a technical aspect of the case, and the findings of which were scrutinised by an expert instructed by the applicant himself. In that respect the present case differs from Matytsina (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0175), in which the Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3 (d) because, among other things, the domestic court had before it an expert report which had been produced by the prosecution without any involvement of the defence, and the findings of which the defence had been unable to challenge at the hearing.",
