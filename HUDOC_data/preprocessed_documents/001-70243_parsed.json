In particular, the applicant alleged that in the part relating to indexation the judgment of 21 May 1999 remained non-enforced. The Court considers however that there is nothing in the case-file or in the parties\u2019 submissions to support this allegation. It is undisputed between the parties that as of 1 July 2002 the applicant has been in receipt of the monthly compensation of a substantially higher amount that the one originally determined in the judgment of 21\u00a0May\u00a01999 which, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, conclusively indicates that the compensation was index-linked. Insofar as the applicant alleges that the indexation was insufficient, it is clear from the operative part of the judgment of 21 May 1999 that the District Court ordered the authority to index-link the applicant\u2019s monthly compensation but did not specify the manner of such indexation. It was open to the applicant to challenge this ruling on appeal or subsequently to apply to the District Court for interpretation of the relevant part of the judgment but he did not avail himself of these opportunities. The Court finds no indication that the manner in which the authority index-linked the applicant\u2019s monthly compensation was arbitrary or unreasonable and therefore concludes that the judgment of 21 May 1999 was enforced in full.",

However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a059498/00, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-III, and Hornsby v.
