It took the view that there was no public-interest imperative to justify that interference in the administration of justice, given that the purpose of section 14 was to ensure that the State, through the intermediary of the URSSAF, could eliminate any risk of a finding against it.

It added that the new law could not have been interpretative in nature, justifying its retroactive application to ongoing proceedings, because it replaced the conditions for exemption set out in the previous law with more restrictive ones, which previous law had not required the existence of an exclusively private home (domicile) as a condition for granting exemption from contributions.

The reasons given by the public authorities during the parliamentary proceedings very clearly stressed the need to remedy a technical shortcoming in the law highlighted by the litigation, in order to reaffirm the legislature\u2019s initial intention concerning the mechanism of exemption from social security contributions in the personal services sector. It thus transpires from those debates that the applicants could not have expected to benefit from the said mechanism, which had from the outset been designed to ensure that elderly persons did not leave their private homes. One clear result is that unlike residential homes, the EHPADs were never intended to be eligible for the exemption provided for in Article L. 241-10 III CSS (see paragraph 45 above; see also paragraphs 22 and 42 above). Lastly, the Constitutional Council considered that the purpose of the impugned exemption was to enable dependent persons to remain in their private homes, and that section 14 of the 20 December 2010 Law, in pointing out that it was only applicable to the remuneration of work performed in the private homes of such persons, merely reiterated that purpose.",

The Court of Cassation had therefore not been invited to consider that law, even though the URSSAF and the applicant discussed it in their subsequent written submissions. That led that court to refuse to follow its reporting judge, who had observed that section 14 of the 20 December 2010 Law settled the problem of interpretation raised by the applicant and consequently proposed dismissing his ground of appeal as \u201cineffective\u201d, in order to declare the appeal on points of law inadmissible. In doing so the Court of Cassation very clearly stated that it was not adjudicating on the basis of the new law. The Court does not consider that that analysis was altered by the fact that the judgment of 22 September 2011 used the word \u201cprivate\u201d (privatif) as set out in section 14 of the 20 December 2010 Law, as that word is particularly apposite for expressing the fact, in accordance with that decision, that collective accommodation would not be taken into account. The Court therefore concludes that the judgment of 22 September 2011 ruled that the interpretation of Article L. 241-10 III, in the version applicable to the facts of the present case, did not make institutions accommodating elderly dependent persons eligible for the reimbursement of contributions which they had been seeking.",

A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Moreover, the Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment; a wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy\u00a0(see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, ECHR 2006VI).",

The Court notes that the TASS and the court of appeal established the difference between a nursing home and a residential home by pointing out that the residence contract signed by persons accommodated in the former excludes home help in the strict sense (see paragraph 29 above). It observes that the Government has confirmed that nursing homes are not private accommodation structures on the same basis as residential homes.
