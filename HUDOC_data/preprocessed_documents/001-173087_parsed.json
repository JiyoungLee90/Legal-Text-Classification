At the outset they argued that the applicant had not exhausted the available domestic remedies, of which there had been two. First, the applicant could have contested the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law setting out the procedure for summoning parties to hearings before the Constitutional Court. Second, the applicant should have lodged an appeal alongside a request for renewal of the procedural time-limit, against the judgment of 6\u00a0April 2004 of the Riga City Zieme\u013cu District Court, after she had learned about it. The Government argued that, taking into account the particular circumstances of the case and the domestic courts\u2019 case-law on the subject matter, there were firm reasons to believe that had the applicant lodged such a request, the court would have granted it. In that connection the Government relied on a letter of 13 April 2010 by the President of the Supreme Court, addressed to the Government\u2019s Agent, stating that a plaintiff\u2019s concealment of a defendant\u2019s place of residence and a court\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of a hearing could serve as the grounds for requesting a renewal of a procedural time-limit. The Government submitted that the examination of this request would not have been affected by the fact that the other party to the case had died. The Government also emphasised that a refusal to renew said time-limit would still have been amenable to appeal through an ancillary complaint. Moreover, this remedy had been directly available to the applicant.",

Besides, it was limited to the procedural issues raised by the President of the Supreme Court. Hence, the applicant had not been required to use it. On these grounds, the Government submitted that, even if the Court dismissed the non-exhaustion plea, the applicant would have, nonetheless, missed the six-month time-limit, which ought to be calculated from the beginning of May 2004 when the applicant had learned of the judgment on her divorce.",

It was beyond doubt that the proceedings could have only resulted in divorce and it was not clear what arguments the applicant would have wished to put forward had she been present at the hearing. The applicant\u2019s complaint before the Court was motivated solely by pecuniary interest. Nonetheless, on the basis of A.S.\u2019s will the applicant had inherited part of his possessions located in Latvia. Moreover, by the judgment of the Riga Regional Court of 30\u00a0November 2006 the applicant had reclaimed from A.A. some other assets and property she had regarded as the spouses\u2019 common possessions.

It could not be excluded that either of those purposes would have been attained. In addition, the case had also had a notable pecuniary effect, as she had lost the right to be recognised as A.S.\u2019s heir and the failure to divide the joint property of spouses had resulted in the applicant having lost a share of those possessions.",

In particular, the only remedies which the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and are at the same time available and sufficient (see Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2006\u2011III). To be effective, a remedy must be capable of directly redressing the impugned state of affairs and must offer reasonable prospects of success (see Mocanu and Others v.\u00a0Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, \u00a7\u00a0223, ECHR\u00a02014 (extracts)).

The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77, ECHR\u00a01999-V).",

After the applicant learned about the judgment dissolving her marriage, she had a possibility to submit a request for a renewal of the procedural time-limit for lodging an appeal (see paragraphs 26-27 above). When examining such a request, the domestic court would be required to assess the applicant\u2019s Convention complaints (see the Governments argument to that regard, paragraph 50 above), even though the plaintiff\u2019s death would have prevented to attain a fresh adjudication of the divorce matter (see paragraph 30 above). The applicant, instead, choose to use an extraordinary remedy by requesting the President of the Supreme Court to trigger the supervisory review procedure. That review in her case led to the assessment of the applicant\u2019s principal grievance under the Convention (see paragraph 16 above), even though, as stated above, the Senate of the Supreme Court came to a conclusion that reopening of the contested proceedings would not be possible due to the plaintiff\u2019s death. The comparison of the two mechanisms shows that in the particular circumstances of the case the procedure of a renewal of the procedural timelimit for lodging an appeal, if invoked, would not be more efficient in terms of raising and addressing the applicant\u2019s principal grievance under the Convention as the extraordinary remedy already used by the applicant where it was reviewed by the highest domestic court.",

The obligation of the domestic courts to act on their own initiative in order to establish the defendant\u2019s address varies greatly amongst the member States, with some countries requiring that all possible measures to reach the defendant be exhausted (see paragraph 43 above). When the obligation to identify the defendant\u2019s address is placed on the plaintiff or another person, he or she is usually required to substantiate before the court that the steps taken have been sufficient.

For instance, the plaintiff\u2019s claim contained a reference to a telephone conversation he had recently had with the applicant (see paragraph 9 above). According to the applicant, A.A. further referred to regular telephone conversations between the applicant and A.S. in her witness testimony \u2013 a claim the Government have not contested. Furthermore, even though the domestic court was not expressly informed of the fact that the applicant had moved back to the couples\u2019 previous place of residence, that the landline there was used for their telephone conversations, and that the plaintiff received correspondence at that address, it cannot be excluded that these circumstances would have transpired had the court made further enquiries and scrutinised the actions A.S. had taken in establishing the applicant\u2019s place of residence (compare and contrast with the case of Avoti\u0146\u0161, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0120 and 122).

It does not unequivocally establish that all of these costs necessarily concerned the present proceedings and does not indicate how the specific sums were arrived at. These vouchers are not supported by invoices, time-sheets, hourly rates or any other information that would allow the Court to assess their justification. Nonetheless, the Court accepts that the applicant must have incurred legal costs, which are at least partially supported by the vouchers submitted.
