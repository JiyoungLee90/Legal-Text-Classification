It rather appeared that the plan was to improve bathing facilities in the context of the \u201cG\u0127adira scheme\u201d also for the purpose of attracting tourism which favoured economic development in Malta. The court considered that the fact that the land had then been given for use to a third party did not detract from the public interest of the measure. Similarly, the fact that land had not been built upon did not mean that no use had been made of it, as the concept of public interest included the aim of maintaining the original habitat or keeping a location pristine.",

It further considered that it should not order the return of the land to the applicants. However, it was for the CoL not to stall any further the process of paying compensation for the taking to allow the expropriation to come to an end, even more so since in the present proceedings sufficient proof of ownership had been put forward.

On that basis (capitalizing the net rental income by 7.5%) the value of the land was estimated at EUR 4,194,226, which when backdated gave a value of EUR\u00a035,512 in 1957.",

Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96 \u00a7 32, ECHR 2000-XI, and Guiso-Gallisay v.  (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 58858/00, \u00a7 90, 22 December 2009).

This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflects the freedom of choice attached to the primary obligation of the Contracting States under the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed (Article 1).
