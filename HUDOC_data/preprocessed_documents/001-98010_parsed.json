France, 29 April 1997, \u00a7 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III).

Furthermore, the applicant brought to the authorities' attention the fact that the Colombian Vice-President had threatened to have him rot in jail. The Supreme Court of Russia limited its assessment of the alleged individualised risk of ill-treatment deriving from Vice-President Santos's statement to a mere observation that the Colombian judiciary were independent from the executive branch of power and thus could not be affected by the statement in question (see paragraph 21 above). The Court is therefore unable to conclude that the Russian authorities duly addressed the applicant's concerns with regard to Article 3 in the domestic extradition proceedings.",

But the applicant has not indicated the source of the information concerning the statement in question! The Russian newspaper article, a copy of which was submitted by the applicant, merely cited the Colombian Vice-President without any reference to the circumstances under which the statement in question had been made. Furthermore, the applicant has not provided the Court with any evidence from the International Relations and Security Network website, which allegedly reproduced the statement in question. In such circumstances the Court is usually unable to assess fully the nature of the statement and the connotations it might have had in the original language.
