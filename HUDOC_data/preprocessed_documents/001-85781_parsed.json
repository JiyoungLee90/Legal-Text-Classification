As regards the applicant\u2019s alleged failure to apply for compulsory enforcement of this judgment to the Bailiffs\u2019 Service, the Court observes that even if it is true that the applicant had not complied with relevant formalities, it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction (see, for example, Scordino v.  (no.\u00a01) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7198, ECHR\u00a02006... and Lizanets v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 6725/03, \u00a7\u00a043, 31\u00a0May 2007).
