The Administrative Court of Appeal had, in its judgment, accounted for the applicant\u2019s arguments and the new evidence he had submitted before it. It had further accounted for the considerations and conclusions drawn from the evidence submitted by the parties, namely, that the investigation in the case did not demonstrate that the applicant had been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which, with a high degree of probability, could have caused his problems. Thus, the Chancellor of Justice found that the Administrative Court of Appeal had taken a stance on the central and decisive question in the case, that is, whether the applicant had been exposed to harmful influences in his work. While the Chancellor noted that it would have been preferable, for pedagogical reasons, for the court to have given clearer grounds for why the applicant\u2019s evidence had not been sufficient, she concluded that the reasoning was not so deficient that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention had been infringed.",

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case. Although Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court\u2019s decision (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 26, ECHR 1999I, and N.A.\u00a0v. Norway, no. 27473/11, \u00a7 61, 18 December 2014). However, the notion of a fair procedure requires that an appellate court which has given sparse reasons for its decisions, whether by incorporating the reasons of a lower court or otherwise, did in fact address the essential issues which were submitted to its jurisdiction and did not merely endorse without further ado the findings reached by a lower court. This requirement is all the more important where a litigant has not been able to present his or her case orally in the domestic proceedings (see Helle v. Finland, 19 December 1997, \u00a7 60, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, and Hansen v. Norway, no.\u00a015319/09, \u00a7 60, 2 October 2014).",

At the various stages of the proceedings he was able to submit the arguments he considered relevant to his case and an oral hearing was held both before the Social Insurance Office and the County Administrative Court. The factual and legal reasons of the lower court\u2019s judgment were also set out at length. Although the applicant was denied an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal, the Court sees no reason to question the finding of the Chancellor of Justice that the applicant\u2019s fair trial guarantees had not been infringed because of that decision (see paragraph 21 above). The Court further observes that, in its judgment, the appellate court endorsed the statement of the facts and the legal reasoning set out in the lower court\u2019s judgment. The new evidence presented by the applicant and the arguments submitted by the parties were also explicitly set out by the appellate court. It is therefore not the case that the Administrative Court of Appeal ignored the applicant\u2019s submissions altogether (compare Bochan v. Ukraine, no. 7577/02, \u00a7 84, 3 May 2007). Accordingly, the reasons given by the Administrative Court of Appeal must be taken to relate, by implication, to those submissions as well as to the conclusions of the lower courts.",

As I understand this statement, the standard for the establishment of a causal link is not very high (a probability criterion is allowed, and the problems may be either caused or aggravated by harmful effects at work).

However, in spite of the additional expert opinion, the appeal court, surprisingly, came to an even more far-reaching conclusion, and was even more confident that the applicant\u2019s back-related and other problems could not be defined as a work-related injury (see paragraph 14 of the judgment).",
