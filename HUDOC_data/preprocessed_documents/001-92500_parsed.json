In the Court\u2019s case-law, reputation has only been deemed to be an independent right sporadically (see Petrina v. Romania, no.\u00a078060/01, 14\u00a0October 2008, and Armonien\u0117 v.

However, the Court said at \u00a7 50 of that judgment that the concept of private life \u201cextends to aspects relating to personal identity, such as a person\u2019s name (see Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 28, \u00a7\u00a024), or a person\u2019s picture (see Sch\u00fcssel v. Austria (dec.), no. 42409/98, 21\u00a0February\u00a02002)\u201d. This means, in my opinion, that the Court interpreted a person\u2019s picture as part of a person\u2019s private life relating to his personal identity (and not personal integrity). Furthermore, the Court held in the same \u00a7 50 of that judgment that \u201cprivate life ... includes a person\u2019s physical and psychological integrity [...].\u201d",

In \u00a7 34 of the Pfeifer judgment, the Court found that the publication of a person\u2019s photograph fell within the scope of his or her private life even where the person concerned was a public figure (see Sch\u00fcssel v.

In the said Pfeifer v. Austria case the Court stated: \u201cIt has already been accepted in the Convention organs\u2019 case-law that a person\u2019s right to protection of his or her reputation is encompassed by Article 8 as being part of the right to respect for private life\u201d.",

This approach was followed in Abeberry v. France ((dec.), no. 58729/00, 21 September 2004) and Leempoel & S.A. ED. Cin\u00e9 Revue v. Belgium (no. 64772/01, \u00a7 67, 9\u00a0November 2006). I agree that the right to the protection of a person\u2019s reputation and honour, as such, was left open in Gunnarsson v. Iceland ((dec.), no. 4591/04, 20 October 2005). However, in the Pfeifer case (\u00a7 35), the Court came to the conclusion that a person\u2019s reputation, even if that person is criticised in the context of a public debate, forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity and therefore also falls within the scope of his or her \u201cprivate life\u201d, and Article 8 therefore applies.",
