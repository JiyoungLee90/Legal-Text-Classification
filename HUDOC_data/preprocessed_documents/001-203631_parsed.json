The same philosophy is inherent in the Hague Convention, which associates this interest with restoration of the status quo by means of a decision ordering the child\u2019s immediate return to his or her country of habitual residence in the event of unlawful abduction, while taking account of the fact that non-return may sometimes prove justified for objective reasons that correspond to the child\u2019s interests, thus explaining the existence of exceptions, specifically in the event of a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation (Article 13, first paragraph, (b)). The Court further notes that the European Union subscribes to the same philosophy, in the framework of a system involving only European Union member States and based on a principle of mutual trust. The Brussels II\u00a0bis\u00a0Regulation, whose rules on child abduction supplement those already laid down in the Hague Convention, likewise refers in its Preamble to the best interests of the child (see paragraph 42 above), while Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights emphasises that in all actions relating to children the child\u2019s best interests must be a primary consideration (see X v.

The domestic court did not attach any weight to the fact that Y had been removed from Italy without the applicant\u2019s consent, which breached his rights protected by law and interfered with their normal exercise.

No such assessment was made by the Court of Appeal, insofar as the Hague Convention was found not to be applicable in the case. Equally important, the Court finds no indication in the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that that court identified the best interests of the child and appropriately took them into account in making its assessment of the family situation, as required by Article 8 of the Convention (see the case-law quoted in paragraph\u00a037 above).
