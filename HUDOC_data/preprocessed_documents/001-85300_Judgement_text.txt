The case originated in an application (no. 11748/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Adrian Wróblewski (“the applicant”), on 24 March 2003.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged that his detention on remand exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.
On 11 October 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicant’s pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

On several occasions, namely 25 November 2002, 25 February, 28 May, 29 September 2003 and 21 January 2004 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was prolonged. The  relied in its decisions on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and on the severity of the likely sentence. According to its reasoning, the applicant’s detention was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings in view of the extensive body of evidence which was to be considered in the case. The court stressed that the evidence already collected in the case, including mechanoscopic and olfactory expert opinions, comparative hair analysis, testimonies of witnesses and an experimental reconstruction of the crime scene indicated a high probability that the applicant had committed the crimes. Moreover, a psychiatrist’s examination and the observation of the applicant in a mental institution had been ordered by the court, as well as a genetic and chemical comparative analysis of available evidence. The court further added that the applicant had a previous criminal record.
The applicant submitted that his appeals against some of the above decisions were dismissed by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 18 December 2002, 18 March, 11 June 2003 and 25 February 2004.

On 10 July 2003 the first hearing in the applicant’s case was scheduled for 20 August 2003; however the start of the trial had to be postponed, since the applicant’s counsel had asked the court to relieve him of his duties. The newly ex officio appointed lawyer informed the court that he was not able to fulfil his duties, as he had earlier been appointed as counsel of the auxiliary prosecutors – the victim’s parents. The Toruń Regional Bar immediately appointed another lawyer at the request of the court.
On 1 August 2003 the applicant’s counsel requested that the composition of the court to hear the applicant’s case be decided by the drawing of lots.
On 28 November 2003 the court scheduled the first hearings for 22 and 23 December 2003. On 3 December 2003 a supplementary drawing of lots was necessary as one of the lay judges could not take part in the proceedings.

On 23 June 2005 the  found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment. The judgment ran to 167 pages.
The applicant, the prosecutor, as well as the auxiliary prosecutors, appealed.
On 30 May 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case for re-examination to the . The proceedings are still pending. The applicant is still in detention in respect of the charges against him.
On 16 May 2002 the applicant was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for double rape.

As it further transpires from the Government’s submissions, which were not contested either by the applicant, between 9 and 29 February 2004 he was serving a term of imprisonment imposed on 17 May 1996 by the Nowe Miasto Lubawskie District Court in another set of criminal proceedings.
Moreover, during the period between 21 May 2003 and 10 June 2003 the applicant was serving a term of imprisonment imposed by the Grudziądz District Court on 11 April 2001 for drunk driving.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are described in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.
