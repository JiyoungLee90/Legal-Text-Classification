The case originated in an application (no. 40555/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ekrem Ütebay (“the applicant”), on 1 October 2004.
By a letter of 11 March 2007, the Registry was informed of the death of the applicant. His parents, Mrs Muhteber Ütebay and Mr İyasettin Ütebay, and his brother, Mr Ercan Ütebay, declared their intention to pursue the application.
For practical reasons, Mr Ütebay will continue to be called “the applicant” in this judgment, although his family is now to be regarded as such (see Ahmet Sadık v. Greece, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, p. 1641, § 3).
The applicant was represented by Mr F. Babaoğlu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 6 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
