He also justified his opinion on principle. First, he pointed out that whatever the place reserved for the victim in the criminal trial, the judgment of the civil action remained contingent on the outcome of the criminal proceedings as it required the prior demonstration of the existence of an offence of which a particular individual was guilty, which ruled out the possibility of continuing the action against the heirs. He cited a passage from an authoritative work (Pr\u00e9cis de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale, by Professors Stefani, Levasseur and Bouloc, 19th edition): \u201cin our modern law we no longer bring actions against the dead or the memory of the dead\u201d. Next, he explained that the need for a violation of the criminal law which was inherent in any decision of the criminal courts justified the fact that, for the court even to rule only on the civil action, the accused had to be given a criminal trial that respected the \u201cprinciple that hearings must be oral ... and the adversarial nature of the trial, which was an essential component of a fair trial. In other words, in order for the criminal court to be able to rule, in both the criminal and the civil proceedings, there is a condition: the effective participation of the accused in his trial\u201d. This meant that in order for the criminal court to be able to examine the civil action alone, it would be necessary for the accused \u201cat one time or another, to have had an effective opportunity to submit his arguments in full concerning the presence and the solidity of all the constituent elements of the offence with which he has been charged, and his responsibility in the matter\u201d.",

I have certain difficulties with the free-standing, post-acquittal \u201ceternally live\u201d model of interpretation of Article 6 \u00a7 2. This model holds that an accused person who has been acquitted at trial continues to enjoy the presumption of innocence even after the trial has ended once there exists a sufficient \u201clink\u201d between the post-acquittal observations of a court and the criminal responsibility of an accused.",

This model considers the presumption as something that is \u201ctriggered\u201d, that only becomes legally meaningful, when events occur through which a person is, in reality, facing or likely to be facing a criminal charge which has not, as yet, been determined.",

France that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1. The principle of presumption of innocence is, above all, a procedural safeguard in criminal proceedings and it imposes obligations on all State authorities to ensure that no suggestion is made that an accused person charged with a criminal offence is guilty of that offence before he has been so found in accordance with law.",

I cannot, however, accept that the presumption of innocence which heretofore in the case-law attached only to an accused person either charged with a criminal offence or subsequently acquitted thereof, can now be passed on to the applicant as the successor of such a person. The applicant was never facing a criminal charge. The proceedings in which he suffered a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention were not criminal proceedings. The applicant\u2019s complaint is that his father suffered breach of the presumption of innocence\u2014which may well have been the case. However, his father is not and never was an applicant before this Court. The presumption of innocence as a procedural safeguard in criminal proceedings is not a chattel which forms part of a person\u2019s estate and which can be passed from a deceased to his successors. To my mind, the majority in finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 has extended, beyond recognition, the purpose of the presumption of innocence as set forth in the Convention. Perhaps it is time to reconsider the direction which the Court\u2019s case-law is taking on this important point of principle.",
