There was no predominant public interest in revealing the identity of the offenders as the public could be informed on the psychological dynamics of crimes of violence and sexual abuse committed within the family without revealing the identity of the victim.

The permissibility of revealing the identity of an offender did not mean that the identity of the victim could also be disclosed. This question had to be examined separately and carefully. C was not a public figure nor was she a person otherwise connected with public life.

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

By reason of the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d inherent in the exercise of freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Fressoz\u00a0and Roire v.
