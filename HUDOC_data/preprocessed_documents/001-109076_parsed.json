The first applicant\u2019s offences of the immigration rules were aggravated and his expulsion was warranted by weighty considerations of general deterrence. According to the immigration authorities\u2019 practice, a prohibition on re-entry would normally be made permanent in such cases. The reason why the prohibition on reentry had been limited to a period of five years in the present case was the fact that the first applicant had a six years\u2019 old daughter (the third applicant).

One would have to take into account possible problems for her in the event of a return to Norway. If the first applicant were to be expelled to Ghana for a period of five years, his daughter would most probably loose the close contact she had with him. To deprive the child of her relationship with her father would be a serious measure and could have disturbing effects on the child\u2019s development.

Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.; Ajayi and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999; Solomon v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5\u00a0September 2000). Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious (see Jerry Olajide Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43279/98, 26\u00a0January 1999; Andrey Sheabashov c. la Lettonie (dec.), no. 50065/99, 22\u00a0May 1999).

Moreover, as already held on previous occasions, the possibility for the authorities to react with expulsion would constitute an important means of general deterrence against gross or repeated violations of the Immigration Act (see Nunez, cited above, \u00a7 71, and Darren Omoregie and Others v.\u00a0Norway, no. 265/07, \u00a7 67, 31 July 2008; see also Kaya v. the Netherlands (dec.) no 44947/98, 6 November 2001). A scheme of implementation of national immigration law which, as here, is based on administrative sanctions in the form of expulsion does not as such raise an issue of failure to comply with Article 8 of the Convention (see Nunez and Darren Omoregie and Others, cited above, ibidem). In the Court\u2019s view, the public interest in favour of ordering the first applicant\u2019s expulsion weighed heavily in the balance when assessing the issue of proportionality under Article 8 of the Convention (see Nunez, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

To put it with a well-known commentator, \u201cthe principle of the best interests of the child is primarily concerned with acts of public officials\u201d (S. Detrick, op.\u00a0cit., p. 90). As underlined by the Committee on the Rights of the Child: \u201cThe principle requires active measures throughout Government, parliament and the judiciary. Every legislative, administrative and judicial body or institution is required to apply the best interests principle by systematically considering how children\u2019s rights and interests are or will be affected by their decisions and actions - by, for example, a proposed or existing law or policy or administrative action or court decision, including those which are not directly concerned with children, but indirectly affect children\u201d (General Comment No. 5 (2003), \u201cGeneral Measures of Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\u201d, CRC/GC/2003/5).",

As observed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees: \u201cSuch well-being is determined by a variety of individual circumstances, such as the age, the level of maturity of the child, the presence or absence of parents, the child\u2019s environment and experiences\u201d (UNHCR, Guidelines on Determining the Best Interests of the Child, May 2008). Furthermore, the principle of the best interests of the child is of particular significance because it provides a general standard to be applied \u201cin all actions concerning children\u201d. Such principle is relevant in respect to most if not all substantive provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (R. Hodgkin, P. Newell, Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the rights of the child, UNICEF (1998), p. 40). It constitutes a general principle of interpretation of this Convention as a whole. It is true that Article 3, \u00a7 1 quoted above uses the expression \u201ca primary consideration\u201d instead of \u201cthe primary consideration\u201d. As it results from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, the aim of the Convention\u2019s drafters implicit in choosing the word \u201ca\u201d was to ensure a certain degree of flexibility, at least in extreme cases, to permit the interests of people other than the child to prevail (S. Detrick, op. cit., p. 91). However, the formulation adopted seems to impose a burden of proof on those seeking to put the interests of the child aside to demonstrate that, under the circumstances, other feasible and acceptable alternatives do not exist (P.\u00a0Alston, \u201cThe Best Interests Principle: Towards a Reconciliation of Culture and Human Rights\u201d, in P. Alston (ed.), op. cit., pp. 1-25, at 13).",

Naskou-Perraki, K. Chrysogonos, X. Anthopoulos (ed.), op. cit., pp. 48 ff.; cf. also the judgments by national courts cited in Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland, no. 41615/07 (GC), \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061-64, 6 July 2010). It is also to be noted that in some such cases the relevant provisions go beyond the aforementioned formulation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (\u201ca primary consideration\u201d) by stipulating that \u201cthe best interests of the child shall always be the paramount consideration\u201d (Article 14, \u00a7 1 of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, italics added; cf. also Article 5 b) of the 1979 UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). Given its broad acceptance, it seems that the principle of the best interests of the child has become a general principle of (international) law.",

To resume this important jurisprudence goes far beyond the object and purpose of the present opinion. Suffice it to recall in this respect the terms of the Grand Chamber, according to which: \u201cThe Court notes that there is currently a broad consensus \u2013 including in international law \u2013 in support of the idea that in all decisions concerning children, their best interests must be paramount\u201d (Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 135). In this context, the Court has repeatedly underlined that: \u201cThe child\u2019s interest (...) dictates that the child\u2019s ties with its family must be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit. It follows that family ties must only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations...\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 136; Gnahor\u00e9 v. France, no. 40031/98, \u00a7 59, ECHR\u00a02000-IX). It is also important to note that, although the landmark case of Neulinger and Shuruk concerned the abduction of a child, the Grand Chamber took the view that guidance on this point may be found mutatis mutandis in the case-law of the Court on the expulsion of aliens (see also, for instance, Emre v. Switzerland, no. 42034/04, \u00a7 68, 22 May 2008), \u201caccording to which, in order to assess the proportionality of an expulsion measure concerning a child who has settled in the host country, it is necessary to take into account the child\u2019s best interests and well-being\u201d (Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, \u00a7 146. See also \u00dcner\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2006-XII). Finally, the Court has stressed that \u201cthe passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent with whom he or she does not live\u201d (Macready v. the Czech Republic, nos\u00a04824/06 and 15512/08, 22 April 2010; Maumousseau and Washington v.

The Norwegian authorities themselves have been somehow divided over the issue. It is recalled that in its judgment of 28 March 2008, the Oslo City Court quashed the Immigration Appeals Board\u2019s decision to expel the first applicant, noting that to deprive the third applicant of her relationship with her father would be a serious measure and could have disturbing effects on the child\u2019s development. According to the City Court, such a measure would be disproportionate vis-\u00e0-vis the first applicant\u2019s daughter (supra, \u00a7 28 of the judgment). In the same vein, the minority of the High Court was of the view that the imposition of a five-year re-entry ban would be too severe and disproportionate a measure and that a two-year ban would have been preferable. The minority took especially into account the age of the third applicant and her close relationship with her father, noting that since birth the first applicant had taken special care of his daughter, following her up in her recreational activities and through extensive contacts with her school. In relation to the first applicant\u2019s offences under the Immigration Act, the minority of the High Court rightly observed that they had been comparable to those committed by the applicant in the Nunez case, though less aggravated bearing in mind that he had not committed other offenses in Norway and had not defied any prohibition of re-entry (supra, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48).",

However, the High Court concluded that the interests of the child should not be a decisive consideration in assessing whether an expulsion measure should be implemented and that the five-year ban was not a disproportionate measure (supra, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41).",

In view of the above elements, we have serious difficulties to follow the majority when stating that: \u201cthe Court is satisfied that sufficient weight has been attached to the best interests of the child in ordering the first applicant\u2019s expulsion\u201d (supra, \u00a7 103). Admit that the impugned measure was \u201cclearly not\u201d in \u2013 i.e. against - the best interests of the third applicant, while at the same time affirming that such interests have been duly taken into account seems to pay lip service to a guiding human rights principle. All the more so that, taking into account the normal processing time for a request for family reunification, the daughter \u2013 who is today eleven years old \u2013 would be about eighteen years before the family could resume cohabitation in Norway. As rightly observed by the minority of the High Court, the years in between would be important years (supra, \u00a7 48). To put it otherwise, the expulsion order, combined with the five-year re-entry ban could entail a serious disruption of the third applicant\u2019s adolescence.",

Contrary to the opinion of the majority, the present case is very similar to Nunez. In this last case, the Court noted the \u201caggravated character\u201d of the breaches under the Immigration Act, as well as other criminal offences by the applicant (Nunez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 67, 72). For another comparable case under Article 8, involving serious breaches of the relevant immigration legislation, as well as other criminal offences (see Konstatinov v. the Netherlands, no. 16351/03, \u00a7\u00a7 9-12, 49 ff., 26 April 2007). As observed by the minority of the High Court, the (administrative) offences of the first applicant in the present case were \u201cless aggravated\u201d than those of the applicant in the Nunez case. Furthermore, in the Nunez case, the Court took note of the rationale of the Norwegian legislation in authorizing the imposition of expulsion with a re-entry ban as an administrative sanction (ibid., \u00a7 71). Such possibility would indeed constitute an important means of general deterrence against gross or repeated violations of the Immigration Act. Under those circumstances, the Court considered that \u201cthe public interest in favour of ordering the applicant\u2019s expulsion weighted heavily in the balance when assessing the issue of proportionality under Article 8 of the Convention\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 73). However, taking mainly into account the age of the applicant\u2019s children and their close bonds to their mother, the Court concluded that the expulsion order with a two-year re-entry ban \u2013 \u201ca very long period for children of the ages in question\u201d (nine and eight years old respectively) \u2013 would entail a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 81-85).",

Furthermore, since May 2007 and until the adoption of the Nunez judgment in June 2011, i.e. for more than four years, the applicant did not have the daily care of her children and the relevant parental responsibilities, which had been granted exclusively to the father following the separation of the couple. In other words, the bonds of the applicant with her children in the Nunez case were in fact (and in law) much less close than those of the first applicant with his daughter in the present case. To put it otherwise: if there is indeed a difference between Nunez and the present case, this lies in the fact that the latter is even more striking than the former. Consequently, the solution in Nunez should have been applied in the present case a fortiori.",
