Since it had not done so, i.e. since there had not been any such errors, it cannot be argued that there were reasons allowing the Supreme Court to quash a final judgment upon an extraordinary appeal by the Prosecutor General. The applicant company noted in this context that the latter had only relied in his appeal on an incorrect legal assessment of the matter by the lower courts. In the applicant company\u2019s view, there was thus no reason in the present case to depart from the Court\u2019s judgments in the very similar cases of DRAFT\u00a0- OVA a.s. v. Slovakia, cited above, and PSMA, spol. s r.o. v. Slovakia (no. 42533/11, 9 June 2015), nor from the subsequent domestic practice of the Slovak highest courts according to which the admissibility of an extraordinary appeal on points of law was acceptable only if the party to the proceedings had exhausted all ordinary and extraordinary remedies which were available to him/her. The applicant company further stated that if both the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court had chosen not to follow their own case-law in the case at hand, it was because they tended to decide on the admissibility of extraordinary appeals rather selectively and arbitrarily, depending on whether such appeals were lodged for the benefit of the State\u2019s financial interests.",

Moreover, while the lower courts had duly refuted most of these arguments, some other points relied on by the Prosecutor General or the Supreme Court constituted inadmissible novelties which had not been previously raised by the State. In such circumstances, the applicant company was convinced that the extraordinary appeal had amounted rather to an appeal in disguise, the Supreme Court having itself considered that the impugned judgments had been vitiated by simple \u201cerrors of legal assessment\u201d within the meaning of Article 243f \u00a7 1(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure.",

In the instant case, the Government was of the view that, having not complied with the conditions required by Act no. 58/1969 for claiming damages from the State and having failed to seek unjust enrichment first, the applicant company was simply not entitled to seek damages from the State. The fundamental errors stemmed also from the fact that the lower courts\u2019 decisions displayed incoherent approach to the issue of the State liability and did not even determine on which of the two legal grounds (irregular procedure or unlawful decision) damages should be granted, which is why they had been quashed by the Supreme Court. The latter also shared the Prosecutor General\u2019s opinion that the claim for damages against the State could only be successful if the plaintiff had unsuccessfully sought to recover an unjust enrichment from the relevant entity, and stated that the lower courts\u2019 assessment of that issue was incorrect. The Government also asserted that the impugned judgments were in contravention with the established domestic case-law concerning damages under the State Liability Act, quoting in this respect judgments issued by the same courts in 2009-2013, by which similar claims had been dismissed.",

Thus, even though the impugned annulment did not directly presume the outcome of the applicant company\u2019s action, which is to be examined anew, it arguably constituted an interference with its right to claim the damages.",
