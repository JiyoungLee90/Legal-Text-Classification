They further considered that distinguishing between the two above-mentioned categories of persons deprived of their liberty had a legitimate aim. The restriction in question was required as a security measure to prevent further crimes from being committed or to ensure that criminal proceedings were not impeded. The grounds for imposing pre-trial detention were also to ensure that the suspect would not obstruct the investigation by tampering with evidence or intimidating witnesses. The Government concluded that the difference of treatment was objectively and reasonably justified within the scope of Article 14 of the Convention. Lastly, the Government considered it worth noting that the applicant\u2019s requests for ordinary visits had never been refused by the prison administration, and as a result he had benefited from a large number of visits from his family during his detention.",

That being so, it also observes that Article 10 \u00a7 2 (a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires, inter alia, that accused persons should, save in exceptional circumstances, be subject to separate treatment appropriate to their status as unconvicted persons who enjoy the right to be presumed innocent (see paragraph 27 above). The 1987 European Prison Rules contain an analogous rule. Similarly, the 2006 European Prison Rules, provide that unless there is a specific prohibition for a specified period by the judicial authority in an individual case, untried prisoners are to receive visits and be allowed to communicate with family members in the same way as convicted prisoners (see paragraph 27 above). This approach appears to be supported by the CPT, which considered that any restriction on a remand prisoner\u2019s right to receive visits should be based on the requirements of the investigation or security considerations, be applied for a limited period and be the least severe possible (see paragraph 28 above). Romanian legislation, however, restricts remand prisoners\u2019 visiting rights in a general manner and to a greater extent than those of convicted persons placed in a prison, as in the applicant\u2019s case. In this regard the Court has already had occasion to hold that, as far as specific restrictions on a detained person\u2019s visiting rights are concerned, the aim of protecting the legitimate interests of an investigation may also be achieved by other means which do not affect all detained persons, regardless of whether they are actually required, such as the setting up of different categories of detention, or particular restrictions as may be required by the circumstances of an individual case (see Laduna, cited above, \u00a7 66, and Varnas, cited above, \u00a7 119).",

However, it also finds that security considerations relating to any criminal family links were absent in the instant case (see Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. , \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, ECHR 2000X). Namely, the applicant\u2019s wife was neither a witness nor a coaccused in the criminal case against her husband, which removed the risk of collusion or other forms of obstructing the process of collecting evidence (see, in contrast, mutatis mutandis, Silickien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. , \u00a7\u00a7\u00a028 and 29, 10 April 2012). Nor has the Court any information to the effect that the applicant\u2019s wife was involved in criminal activities. Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that there was a particular reason to prevent the applicant from having conjugal visits from his wife (see, by contrast, Klamecki v. Poland (no. 2), no. , \u00a7 135, 3 April 2003; Bagi\u0144ski v. Poland, no. , \u00a7 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Ku\u010dera v. Slovakia, no. , \u00a7 130, 17 July 2007). Above all, the Court notes that in justifying the prohibition on the applicant having conjugal visits when placed in pre-trial detention, the Government, like the domestic prison authorities and the Gherla District Court, in essence relied on the legal norms as such, without any reference as to why those prohibitions had been necessary and justified in the applicant\u2019s specific situation.",

It therefore finds that by refusing to allow the applicant conjugal visits when detained on remand the authorities failed to provide a reasonable and objective justification for the difference in treatment, and thus acted in a discriminatory manner.",
