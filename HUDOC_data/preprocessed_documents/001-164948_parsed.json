In particular, they stressed that a Russian court acknowledged a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to have his case examined within a reasonable time and awarded him 30,000 Russian roubles (RUB, approximately 800 euros in compensation). The Court accepts that the Russian courts acknowledged, in substance, a violation of the applicant\u2019s right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in relation to the length of the civil proceedings in his case. However, the redress awarded to him by the Russian courts was insufficient and manifestly unreasonable having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 204, ECHR 2006V, Firstov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 42119/04, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 20 February 2014 and Shilbergs v.\u00a0Russia, no. 20075/03, \u00a7\u00a7 70-79, 17\u00a0December 2009) and taking into account the absence of a reasonable relation of proportionality between the amount of compensation awarded to the applicant and the circumstances of the case and the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning in making the award. As the second condition \u2013 appropriate and sufficient redress \u2013 has not been fulfilled, the Court finds that the applicant in case no. 41170/06 may still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of a breach of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the length of the civil proceedings.
