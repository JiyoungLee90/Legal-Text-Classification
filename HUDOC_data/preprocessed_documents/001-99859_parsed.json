Although a party to civil proceedings who uses the avenues available to him or her under domestic law in order to protect his or her interests must bear the consequences when it leads to delays, the Court does not share the Government's view that the applicant was responsible for the delay in this case. Her appeal of 17 September 2001 was ultimately admitted and examined on the merits and this fact demonstrates that the applicant had complied with the relevant procedural requirements. Furthermore, the responsibility of the courts for the delay was confirmed by the decision of the Council of Judges of 14 March 2003 (see\u00a0paragraph 18 above).",
