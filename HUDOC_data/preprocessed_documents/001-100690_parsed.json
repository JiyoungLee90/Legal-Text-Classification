It stressed that having based, to a substantial degree, the applicant's conviction for drug trafficking on statements by witnesses whom the applicant had been unable to confront in open court, including the anonymous witness I. and a lay witness K., the domestic courts had violated Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

Having acquitted the applicant of that charge, the Presidium reduced his sentence to two years' imprisonment and authorised his immediate release, as he had already served the entire sentence.

In particular, section III of the Regulation sets out the procedure for initial steps to be taken by medical personnel of a detention facility on admission of a detainee. On arrival at a temporary detention facility all detainees should be subjected to preliminary medical examination before they are placed in cells shared by other inmates. The examination is performed with the aim of identifying individuals suffering from contagious diseases and those in need of urgent medical assistance. Particular attention should be paid to individuals suffering from contagious conditions. No later than three days after the detainee's arrival at the detention facility he should receive an in-depth medical examination, including X-ray. During the in-depth examination a prison doctor should record the detainee's complaints, study his medical and personal history, record injuries if present, and recent tattoos and schedule additional medical procedures, if necessary.

Primarily restating the European Prison Rules and CPT standards, the Recommendation went beyond reiteration of the principles in some aspects to include more specific discussion of the management of certain common problems including transmissible diseases. In particular, in respect of cases of tuberculosis, the Committee of Ministers stressed that all necessary measures should be applied to prevent the propagation of this infection, in accordance with relevant legislation in this area. Therapeutic intervention should be of a standard equal to that outside of prison. The medical services of the local chest physician should be requested in order to obtain the long-term advice that is required for this condition as is undertaken in the community in accordance with relevant legislation (Section 41).",

This was due to a combination of factors, including: (i)\u00a0increased poverty, (ii) under-funding of TB services and health services in general, (iii) diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that were designed for a centralized command-and-control TB system, but were unable to cope with the social mobility and relative freedom of the post-Soviet era, and (iv) technical inadequacies and outdated equipment. Migration of populations from ex-Soviet republics with high TB burdens also increased the problem. Prevalence rates were many times higher in the prison system than in the general population. Treatment included lengthy hospitalizations, variations among clinicians and patients in the therapeutic regimen, and frequent recourse to surgery. A shrinking health budget resulted in an erratic supply of anti-TB drugs and laboratory supplies, reduced quality control in TB dispensaries and laboratories, and inadequate treatment.

Although the Government did not comment on the outcome of the treatment, they did not dispute the applicant's assertion that the treatment had been a success, resulting in his recovery from active tuberculosis. In any event, medical records produced by the Government confirm that no signs of reactivation of the illness were recorded on the applicant's admission to facility IZ-25/1. In this respect, the Court would like to stress already at this juncture that the medical assessment of the applicant conducted during his first days in the detention facility appear to comply fully with international standards of tuberculosis control policy in prisons, a recognised setting for transmission of tuberculosis (see paragraphs 43- 45 above). In particular, the Court notes that the applicant was seen without delay by an attending prison doctor, who studied his medical history, recorded complaints, organised a meeting with a tuberculosis specialist and scheduled an X-ray examination. The doctor's recommendations were promptly put into practice. Subsequent X-ray exams were also performed without undue delay.",

While the cause of the reactivation of the illness is not the subject matter of the Court's examination (see paragraphs 51-53 above), it considers it necessary to reiterate its constant approach that even if an applicant had contracted tuberculosis while in detention, this in itself would not imply a violation of Article 3, provided that he received treatment for it (see Alver v. Estonia, no. 64812/01, \u00a7 54, 8 November 2005, and Pitalev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 34393/03, \u00a7 53, 30 July 2009, with further references). However, the State does have a responsibility to ensure prevention and treatment for prisoners in its charge and a lack of adequate medical assistance for serious health problems not suffered from prior to detention may amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 108 et seq.). This principle should certainly be extrapolated to the case of the applicant, who suffered a relapse of tuberculosis after his admission to the detention facility. Absent or inadequate treatment for tuberculosis, particularly when the disease has been contracted or reactivated in detention, is most certainly a subject of the Court's concern. The Court is therefore bound to assess the quality of medical services rendered to the applicant in the present case.",

In particular, it did not escape the Court's attention that a drug susceptibility test had been performed at the initial stage of the diagnostic process, in line with the WHO's most recent recommendations (see paragraph 50 above). The test not only allowed efficiently finalising diagnostic procedures and allocating the applicant's case to standardised treatment category, but also guided the choice of appropriate regimen adjustments given the results of the test. At the same time the Court is satisfied that the DST did not delay the start of the applicant's treatment.",

During the entire period of his treatment the applicant was subjected to regular and systematic clinical and radiological assessment and bacteriological monitoring, which formed part of the comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the disease. The detention authorities also effectively implemented the doctors' recommendations of a special dietary ration necessary for the applicant to improve his health (see, by contrast, Gorodnitchev v. , no. 52058/99, \u00a7 91, 24 May 2007).",

The Court notes that the intake of medicines by the applicant was supervised and directly observed by the facility medical personnel throughout the whole re-treatment regimen as required by the DOTS strategy (see paragraph 49 above). In addition, in a situation when the authorities met with the applicant's occasional refusal to cooperate and his resistance to the treatment they offered him psychological support and attention, having provided clear and complete explanations of medical procedures, the sought outcome of the treatment and negative side-effects of interruption of treatment or irregular medication (see, by contrast, Gorodnitchev, cited above, \u00a7 91; Testa v.

The applicant's transfer to the tuberculosis hospital was accompanied by recommendations from doctors of the detention facility no. IZ-25/1 to continue HRE treatment regimen. The Court is particularly mindful of the fact that without bluntly accepting the recommendations of the facility medical personnel, the tuberculosis hospital specialists gave an independent assessment of the applicant's case on the basis of the clinical examinations, radiography and bacteriological tests performed in the hospital. Recommendations of the detention facility doctors having been considered valid, the applicant continued the prescribed treatment regimen. Nothing in the case file can lead the Court to the conclusion that the applicant did not receive comprehensive medical assistance during that stage of his tuberculosis treatment. The list of tests submitted by the Government included regular X-ray exams, sputum smear tests, further clinical analysis and examinations by tuberculosis specialists. The applicant did not deny that medical supervision had been provided and tests had been carried out in the tuberculosis hospital, or that the prescribed medication had been provided, as indicated in the medical records submitted by the Government.
