Nor can the number of the respondents explain the complexity of the case. Even though the case examination may have been complicated by six expert examinations, the Court recalls that it is within the competence of a court to decide whether or not to seek outside advice (see Dulskiy v. , no. 61679/00, \u00a7 71, 1\u00a0June 2006). As to the conduct of the applicant, his specifications of the claim (see paragraph 8 above) may have somewhat contributed to the overall duration of the case examination. However, this fact alone does not explain that duration. On the other hand, the Court is of the opinion that the proceedings have been mainly delayed by the District Court (see paragraphs 5, 6 and 8 above). It thus concludes that the main responsibility for the protracted length of the proceedings has rested with the State.",
