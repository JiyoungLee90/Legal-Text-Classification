In fact, A.R.\u00a0\u201cVanagas\u201d had been one of its leaders (the court referred to his service history, see paragraphs 8\u201315 above, and Lithuanian legislation as to the status of volunteer soldiers). Accordingly, the repressive structures\u2019 actions against them could be considered as targeted against a \u201csignificant part of a national-ethnic-political group\u201d. This was also proved by the fact that their capture had been declared by the KGB as the end of the \u201cliquidation of former bourgeois nationalist banditry formations\u201d (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). Although the active resistance ended in 1953, A.R.\u00a0\u201cVanagas\u201d and B.M. \u201cVanda\u201d were searched for by the Soviet authorities even after this.

In his testimony the applicant confessed that at the time he was aware of A.R.\u00a0\u201cVanagas\u201d, that the latter was leader of the partisan movement, and that he was in hiding. Accordingly, the mere fact that A.R.\u00a0\u201cVanagas\u201d and B.M. \u201cVanda\u201d had succeeded in hiding from repression, not only during the partisan war but until their capture in 1956, was not an impediment to qualifying the applicant\u2019s actions as genocide.",

The Court held that there has been a violation of Article 7 (nullum crimen sine lege) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by the conviction of the applicant under Article 99 of the Criminal Code for the genocide of a political group of the Lithuanian population \u2013 participation in the killing of two Lithuanian partisans in 1953. The Court, inter alia, found that in 1953 international treaty law did not include a \u2018political group\u2019 in the definition of genocide, nor could it be established with sufficient clarity that customary international law provided for a broader definition of genocide than that set out in Article II of the 1948 Genocide Convention (Vasiliauskas v. Lithuania, \u00a7\u00a0178). In examining whether the interpretation of the actions of V.\u00a0Vasiliauskas provided by the Lithuanian courts in the case of the applicant V. Vasiliauskas conformed to the concept of the notion of genocide as it stood in 1953, the Court, inter alia, noted that authorities have discretion to interpret the definition of genocide more broadly than that contained in the 1948 Genocide Convention. However, such discretion does not permit domestic tribunals to convict persons accused under that broader definition retrospectively. Considering the fact that in 1953 political groups were excluded from the definition of genocide under international law, the [Court] held that the prosecutors were precluded from retroactively charging, and the domestic courts from retroactively convicting, the applicant of genocide of Lithuanian partisans, as members of a political group.",

Partisan groups regulated their activities with statutes and rules. Those who joined the partisans took an oath. Partisans wore military uniforms with distinctive signs. The ten years of resistance, also known as the Lithuanian War or the resistance or partisan war, is exceptional in the history of Lithuania from several aspects: its duration (almost ten years), universality (during the entire period there were at least 50,000 active members of the armed resistance and about 100,000 others who participated in the resistance as members of underground organisations and supporters), and the unequal balance of power which was unfavourable to the Lithuanian partisans .... On 10-20 February 1949 an assembly of Lithuania\u2019s partisan commanders took place; this brought together the units of the anti-Soviet resistance into one organisation, namely the Movement of the Struggle for the Freedom of Lithuania (LLKS). This organisation, under the leadership of General Jonas \u017demaitis\u2013Vytautas, adopted military-political documents proclaiming the LLKS as the organisation which was leading the political and military liberation struggle of the nation and represented the ideals of independent Lithuania in the occupied country.

In the applicant\u2019s case, it was paramount that his and the KGB\u2019s actions had been prompted by one single goal, namely to physically exterminate all or part of the members of a protected group.

In other words, retroactive prosecution for genocide of social and political groups, in respect of facts which took place before the Criminal Code amendments which established this crime, would be in breach of the Constitution and the principle of the rule of law. At the same time, the Constitutional Court concluded that actions which took place at an earlier date and which had been directed against certain political and social groups might constitute genocide if it could be proved that the aim was to destroy groups that represented a significant part of the Lithuanian nation and whose destruction had an impact on the survival of the entire Lithuanian nation. The Constitutional Court indicated that Lithuanian partisans constituted such a group, taking into account their activity during the 1944-1953 partisan war.",

The domestic courts were criticised for not explaining what the notion of \u201crepresentatives\u201d entailed, and for not providing much of a historical or factual account of how the Lithuanian partisans were representative of the Lithuanian nation (see Vasiliauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0159 and 179-86).

In this regard the Government referred to the Court\u2019s judgment in Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom ([GC] no.\u00a057592/08, 17\u00a0January 2017), in which the Court examined the domestic law of the United Kingdom after the domestic court had responded to the critique of it expressed in the Court\u2019s earlier judgment.

In the light of its constant case-law the Court reiterates that it is not within its province to substitute its assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts. The Court confirms that the question of the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility was primarily a matter for assessment by the domestic courts (see Vasiliauskas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0164, and the cases cited therein). It also considers that in view of the complexity of the task of reconstructing the facts of the case nearly sixty years after the events, the national courts were in a better position to assess all the available material and evidence. Those courts also had regard to the historical background, the manner in which the MGB/KGB functioned, and the archive documents regarding the impugned operation (see paragraphs 37-39, 43, 44, 54 and 55 above).

It has already reached a similar conclusion in the case of Vasiliauskas (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0158), where it reiterated that even a private soldier could not show total, blind obedience to orders which flagrantly infringed internationally recognised human rights, in particular the right to life, which is the supreme value in the hierarchy of human rights. As noted by the domestic courts, the applicant, who from 1950 on had certainly had knowledge of the MGB/KGB methods, given that he had not only studied at the MGB school, but then from 1952 worked as an officer of the MGB/KGB division tasked with suppression of resistance, must have clearly understood that after their capture the two partisans would be eliminated (see paragraphs 54-56 above). Accordingly, the fact that A.R.\u00a0\u201cVanagas\u201d was shot and B.M.\u00a0\u201cVanda\u201d deported on the basis of LSSR Supreme Court decisions (see paragraphs\u00a031 and 32 above) does not alter or remove the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility for their fate.",

Among other things, the Supreme Court noted that the Soviet repression had been targeted against the most active and prominent part of the Lithuanian nation (lietuvi\u0173 tauta), defined by the criteria of nationality and ethnicity. These repressive acts had the clear goal of creating an impact on the demographic situation of the Lithuanian nation. In turn, the members of the resistance\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Lithuanian partisans, their liaison persons and their supporters\u00a0\u2212\u00a0had represented a significant part of the Lithuanian population, as a national and ethnic group, because the partisans had played an essential role when protecting the national identity, culture and national selfawareness of the Lithuanian nation. The Supreme Court therefore held that such characteristics led to the conclusion that the partisans as a group were a significant part of a protected national and ethnic group, and that their extermination had therefore constituted genocide, both under Article\u00a099 of the Criminal Code and under Article II of the Genocide Convention (see, for particularly detailed analysis, paragraphs 50-52 above).

It must be said that the broad definition of genocide in national jurisdictions in 2000 gained momentum (Schabas, 2000, p. 141-42). But the problem was that Lithuania applied this extended definition retroactively. Instead of criticising Vasiliauskas\u2019 actions as another crime (war crimes or crimes against humanity), both the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the courts have argued that Vasiliauskas committed a genocidal act against the political group, even though the court of appeal did try connecting it with the national group for the first time describing the political group as part of the national group (Vasiliauskas, \u00a7 36).

Thus, a conviction for genocide would not have been sound if the Soviets were \u201cmerely\u201d destroying their political opponents in Lithuania. Regarding the expression \u201cin part\u201d, the minority believes that it is perfectly fine to first define the protected group as ethnic Lithuanians, and then further define a \u201cpart\u201d of that group as Lithuanian partisans or opponents of Soviet rule. The majority, on the other hand, believes that while the idea of \u201ca part\u201d of a group could foreseeably be thought of in numerical terms in 1953, it was not foreseeable that the part could also be defined in qualitative terms, as emerged from the case law of modern international criminal tribunals (see paragraph 177). This last point is, I think, highly problematic, since those individuals who were convicted for intending to destroy a part of a group in modern trials could then also say that their convictions violated nullum crimen, since their crimes also preceded in time the case-law of the tribunals who convicted them (see\u00a0M.\u00a0Milanovic, \u201cEuropean Court Tackles the Definition of Genocide\u201d).",

However, there is a problem that seems to be overlooked by both the majority and the dissenters. If the domestic courts had \u201cproperly\u201d proven this significance, would the decision of the final majority have changed? It seems that this decision was based primarily on the predictability of the act committed by Vasiliauskas being considered as genocide. So the first question must be \u201ccould Vasiliauskas have assessed partisans as being a significant part of the national group?\u201d That is, the claim should have been linked not to the coherency of the national court\u2019s arguments but to Vasiliauskas\u2019 mens rea. Secondly, the Court has already characterised the newly developed criterion of \u201cthe importance of the party\u201d (paragraph 178); therefore, Vasiliauskas would still be considered incapable of accounting for his action, and the earlier argument would not have changed.

(\u201cVanagas\u201d) and his wife B.M. (\u201cVanda\u201d). A.R had been elected Chief of Defence Forces of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters (LLKS) in 1949 and became chairman of the LLKS Council in 1951. After the arrest, the two partisans were detained in the KGB prison in Vilnius and tortured. In September 1957, the Supreme Court of the LSSR sentenced A.R. to death, and he was shot two months later. B.M. was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. After Lithuania regained its independence, the applicant was found guilty in 2015/16 of his participation in the operation of 12 October 1956, during which A.R. and B.M. had been captured and detained. He was convicted of being \u201can accessory to genocide\u201d under Article 99 of the Lithuanian Criminal Code in force since 1 May 2003. The legal provisions that led to the applicant\u2019s conviction were therefore applied retroactively. The combination of nationality and ethnicity aspects has already been assessed by the Grand Chamber in its Vasiliauskas judgment. It also took into account the decision of the Constitutional Court of 18 March 2014 (see\u00a0\u00a7 56 of Vasiliauskas) which the majority now refers to in support of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 12 April 2016 (see paragraph 104).

It therefore appears that this particular issue has already been dealt with, at least to some extent, by the Grand Chamber in Vasiliauskas.

Indeed, the definition of the crime of genocide in Lithuanian law had not only had no basis in the wording of that offence as expressed in the Genocide Convention, but had also been gradually enlarged during the years of Lithuania\u2019s independence.
