His detention there was not, however, continuous and comprised three distinct periods punctuated by his two transfers to correctional colony no.\u00a0IK-5 where he underwent medical treatment (see paragraph 21 above).

The personal space afforded to him amounted, accordingly, to 1.63 square metres. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that this figure is below the domestic statutory standard of 2\u00a0square metres for male convicts in correctional colonies (see paragraph 34 above). It also reiterates that this figure must be viewed in the context of the wide freedom of movement enjoyed by the applicant from the wake-up call in the morning to lights out at night, when he would have been able to move about a substantial part of the correctional colony, including the rest of the prison block and adjacent grounds of 274 square metres (compare Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the level of privacy available to the applicant was insufficient to comply with the standards set forth in Article 3 of the Convention. For over seven and a half months, during the night, the applicant was housed in a dormitory with at least 120 other persons where he was afforded only 1.63 square metres of personal space. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, the sanitary facilities available were not sufficient to accommodate the needs of the detainees. There were only ten wash basins and five toilets available for approximately 180 detainees living in the same block as the applicant (see paragraphs 21 and 26 above).",
