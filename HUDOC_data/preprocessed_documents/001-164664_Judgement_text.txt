The case originated in an application (no. 2586/07) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Valeriy Petrovych Petrychenko (“the applicant”), on 12 December 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented most recently by their Acting Agent, Ms O. Davydchuk of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the domestic courts failed to give sufficient reasons for their decisions in his pension dispute.
On 31 March 2011 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Kyiv.
In October 2004 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Obolonskiy District Court of Kyiv against the local department of the Pension Fund of Ukraine, seeking recovery of alleged pension arrears and compensation for moral damage. In his claim the applicant stated, in particular, that under Article 46 of the Constitution he was entitled to a pension equal to the amount of the minimum living standard. However, his pension was lower than that minimum standard applicable at the relevant time.
On 25 October 2004 the court rejected the applicant’s claim as unfounded, stating that the Pension Fund of Ukraine had not breached any legal act. On 3 February 2005 and 14 June 2006 respectively the Kyiv City Court of Appeal and the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine upheld the decision of the first-instance court. Neither of these courts considered the applicant’s argument under Article 46 of the Constitution in respect of inconsistency of the amount of his pension with the minimum living standard.
The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment in the case of Pronina v. Ukraine (no. 63566/00, §§ 13-19, 18 July 2006).
