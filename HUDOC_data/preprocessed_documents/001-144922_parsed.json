However, the Government argued that this deprivation of rights had been in accordance with the law and had been justified, given that the rei vindicatio proceedings had sought to ensure the protection in adversarial proceedings of parties whose interests had been affected by the decision in the restitution proceedings, and to achieve a fair balance between these and the public interest. The initial decision favourable to the applicants had not taken into account the provision of section 10b of the ALA, which barred restitution, and had therefore been reached in breach of law. Moreover, it had been established that the buildings on the land had existed prior to the entry in force of the ALA, which showed that the land had served important public interests and had not been agricultural.",

Bulgaria [Committee], no.\u00a019988/06, 11 December 2012). In the case of Vasilev and Doycheva (see \u00a7 69 of the judgment) the Court concluded that the problem was recurrent and expressed the view that the Bulgarian authorities should provide for clear timelimits for the adoption and enforcement of administrative decisions necessary for the completion of the process of restitution of agricultural land.",

Even though there do not appear to have been any particular periods of inactivity, the Court notes that the delays after that resulted from the approach adopted in the domestic law, under which third parties such as the Stara Zagora municipality were not allowed to take part in restitution proceedings and thus have their competing claims to the same land examined. Instead of that, the domestic law provided for such issues to be resolved in separate proceedings (see paragraph 33 above). The Court has already criticised this approach for prolonging the restitution process and placing individuals in situations such as the applicants\u2019 in a state of lengthy uncertainty (see Sivova and Koleva, \u00a7\u00a7 115-16, and Nedelcheva and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 78-82, both cited above). While acknowledging that States should be accorded a wide margin of appreciation in regulating important social and economic reforms such as the ones introduced in Bulgaria after the fall of communism (see paragraph\u00a072 above), the Court reiterates that States nevertheless remain bound to organise their judicial and administrative systems in such a way so as to guarantee the rights provided for under the Convention (see Sivova and\u00a0Koleva, cited above, \u00a7 116). In the case at hand, by requiring that the applicants participate in two procedures, first a restitution procedure and then rei vindicatio judicial proceedings aimed at specifying the rights recognised in the restitution procedure, the authorities unjustifiably delayed the effective exercise of the applicants\u2019 restitution rights.",

Moreover, it points out that the applicants were entitled to compensation in lieu of restitution (see paragraph\u00a027 above). The Court is unable to accept the applicants\u2019 claim to receive in compensation for the delays in the procedure the equivalent of the market rent for the plot, given, in particular, that the violation found in the case did not concern any defined right of the applicants to receive specific property (see Lyubomir Popov, cited above, \u00a7 138). However, the applicants must have suffered inconveniences and uncertainty as a result of the delays in the restitution process. Ruling on an equitable basis, and taking into account the amounts awarded in similar cases, the Court awards each of the applicants EUR 2,500, to cover any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the delays in the restitution procedure.",
