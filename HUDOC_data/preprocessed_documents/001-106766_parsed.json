It protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny. It is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. Administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, a public hearing contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely, a fair trial (see Gautrin and Others v.\u00a0France, 20 May 1998, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, and Pretto and Others v. Italy, 8\u00a0December 1983, \u00a7\u00a021, Series A no.\u00a071). There is a high expectation of publicity in ordinary criminal proceedings, which may well concern dangerous individuals, notwithstanding the attendant security problems (see Campbell and Fell v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0June 1984, \u00a7 87, Series A no. 80).",

Thus, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see B. and P. v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a036337/97 and 35974/97, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2001-III, with further references).\u00a0The Court\u2019s task in the present case is to establish whether the exclusion of the public from the trial in the City Court was justified.",

The Court observes that it may be important for a State to preserve its secrets, but it is of infinitely greater importance to surround justice with all the requisite safeguards, of which one of the most indispensable is the guarantee that proceedings are open to the public. Before excluding the public from criminal proceedings, courts must make specific findings that closure is necessary to protect a compelling governmental interest and limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve such an interest (see, mutatis mutandis, Hummatov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 29\u00a0November 2007, \u00a7\u00a0149, and Moser v.

The City Court did not elaborate on the reasons for holding the trial in camera. It did not even indicate what documents in the case file, if any, were considered to contain State secrets or how they were related to the nature and character of the charges against the applicant. The Court further observes that the City Court did not take any measures to counterbalance the detrimental effect that the decision to hold the trial in camera must have had on public confidence in the proper administration of justice for the sake of protecting the State\u2019s interest in keeping its secrets. The Government did not argue \u2013 and there is no indication to the contrary in the documents submitted by the parties \u2013 that it was not open to the City Court to hold the trial publicly subject to clearing the courtroom for a single or, if need be, a number of non-public sessions to deal with classified documents or information. The Court therefore finds it striking that in such a situation the Moscow City Court preferred to close the entire trial to the public (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, \u00a7 84, 4\u00a0December 2008).",

It was also important to explain why the concern for the safety of the persons involved in the trial outweighed the importance of ensuring the public nature of the trial (see Porubova v. , no. 8237/03, \u00a7\u00a034, 8 October 2009).

It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may confirm the existence of a danger justifying the denial of public access to a trial. In the present case the decisions of the domestic courts gave no reasons why they considered the risk to the safety of the \u201cparticipants\u201d to be decisive.

In particular, the Court is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by the domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention (see, among other authorities, Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7 45, Series A no.\u00a0140).",

The guarantees in paragraph 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set out in paragraph 1. In the circumstances of the case it finds it unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s allegations separately from the standpoint of paragraph 3 (b), since they amount to a complaint that she did not receive a fair trial. It will therefore confine its examination to the question of whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (see Rowe and Davis v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028901/95, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000-II). It is a fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. In addition Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see, among others, Natunen v. , no. 21022/04, \u00a7\u00a039, 31\u00a0March\u00a02009).",

The applicant\u2019s allegation concerning unjustified limitations on her ability to have knowledge of the material in the criminal case file lacks substantiation. The Court also considers that the time afforded by the authorities to study the case file was not as such insufficient and that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 have not been breached in this respect.",
