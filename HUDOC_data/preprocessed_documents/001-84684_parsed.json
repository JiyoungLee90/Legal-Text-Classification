The Senate concluded that the applicant's guilt had been sufficiently established on the basis of the extensive testimony given by the victim during the pre-trial investigation, which had been corroborated by other evidence confirming his guilt. As to the applicant's complaint about the refusal of the first and second instance courts to summon witnesses, the court noted that he had failed to specify which particular facts would have been clarified by hearing the witnesses. The court considered that the evidence against the applicant was to a large extent based on the incriminating statements of the victim, who rightly had not been summoned due to the psychologist's recommendations. However, these statements were examined and objectively assessed by the courts. In addition, there was sufficient evidence proving the applicant's guilt. The Senate considered that the applicant had asked that circumstances which were not relevant to the case be established.

The Court can accept that in principle, as submitted by the Government, in the specific circumstances of the present case the weight of the reasons for the applicant's initial detention and its extension did not decrease in the course of the time that the applicant spent in pre-trial detention and that it was necessary to keep him in detention in view of his personality, especially having regard to his criminal record and, in particular, the fact that he had committed rape of a minor previously. However, it is up to national courts to provide the reasoning in that respect and this was not done in the decisions at issue (see, mutatis mutandis, Estrikh, cited above, \u00a7 122 and Smirnova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a070). The reasons given in those decisions remained general and abstract, and were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 since, although the national courts in the impugned decisions referred generally to the applicant's previous convictions and the danger of re-offending, they did not elaborate on how this might constitute a serious social danger justifying the applicant's continued detention or why, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, the genuine public interest outweighed the right to liberty in the instant case (see Je\u010dius\u00a0v. , no.\u00a034578/97, \u00a7\u00a093, ECHR 2000IX). Furthermore, the Court notes that neither the applicant nor his lawyer was summoned on 10\u00a0January and 5 March 2001 and they thus could not make any submissions in front of the judge, unlike the public prosecutor, who gave his reasons.",

It is also normally for the domestic courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness since Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of the witnesses in the court (see S.N., cited above, \u00a7 44). The task of the Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Doorson, cited above, \u00a7 67 and Gossa v. Poland, no.\u00a047986/99, \u00a7\u00a052, 9 January 2007). All evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Asch v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0203, \u00a7\u00a027, and more recently, Klimentyev v. Russia, no.\u00a046503/99, \u00a7\u00a0124, 16 November 2006). Where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Sa\u00efdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0261C, pp.\u00a056-57, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-44; Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no.\u00a033354/96, \u00a7\u00a040, ECHR 2001II and Solakov v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no.\u00a047023/99, \u00a7\u00a057, ECHR 2001X). With respect to statements of witnesses who proved to be unavailable for questioning in the presence of the defendant or his counsel, the Court recalls that paragraph\u00a01 of Article\u00a06 taken together with paragraph\u00a03 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps so as to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see, Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2001-VIII) and \u2013 in the event that the impossibility of examining witnesses or having them examined is due to the fact that they are missing \u2013 the authorities must take reasonable efforts to secure their presence (see Rachdad v. France, no.\u00a071846/01, \u00a7\u00a025, 13 November 2003, and Bonev v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7\u00a043, 8 June 2006). However, impossibilium nulla obligatio est; provided that the authorities cannot be accused of a lack of diligence in their efforts to award the defendant an opportunity to examine the witnesses in question, the witnesses' unavailability as such does not make it necessary to discontinue the prosecution (see, in particular, Artner v. Austria, judgment of 28\u00a0August 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0242-A, p.\u00a010, \u00a7\u00a021; Scheper v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a039209/02, 5\u00a0April 2005; Mayali v.

The victim was not summoned by the first instance court because of the statement made by the psychiatric expert, advising against the victim's participation in court hearings and any confrontation with the applicant, due to the possible deterioration in the state of her health (paragraphs 27 and 47, above). The Court notes in this respect that neither the applicant nor his lawyer requested the appeal court to summon the victim, nor did they ask either the first or the second instance court to have the victim examined by the courts or his lawyer in the absence of the applicant. Recalling that under the terms of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention the Court can only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, it dismisses the applicant's complaint that he could not exercise his right guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) to examine the victim in the instant case for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
