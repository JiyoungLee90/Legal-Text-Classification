She also argued that the dictum that she was not the owner of the property at issue was in contradiction with the ground on which the court had allowed the other party's appeal, namely that the courts had no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the case. With regard to the proceedings that had ended on 30\u00a0March 1998, she pointed out that she had expressly requested the return of the whole house, considering that the nationalisation had been unlawful, both in the action for recovery of possession and the proceedings instituted under Law no.\u00a0112/1995, and pointed out that she had never acknowledged before the Romanian authorities that the house had been nationalised with valid legal title. The applicant noted, moreover, that the proceedings for restitution under Law no.\u00a0112/1995 had still been pending on the date when the Court of Appeal had delivered its judgment in the second set of proceedings for recovery of possession and that it had not therefore been in a position to conclude that she had acknowledged, even implicitly, that the house had been nationalised with valid legal title.",
