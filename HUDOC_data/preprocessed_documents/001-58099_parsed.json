It also seems that he has never shown any desire to acquire French nationality. Accordingly, even though most of his family and social ties are in France, it has not been established that he has lost all links with his country of origin other than his nationality. In addition, the applicant had a previous conviction \u2013 a sentence of thirty months\u2019 imprisonment having been imposed on him by the Annecy Criminal Court for heroin dealing in 1987 \u2013 when the Lyons Court of Appeal sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his permanent exclusion from French territory for drug use and drug trafficking (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 11 above). Once he was released, and at a time when he was unlawfully present in France, he continued to lead a life of crime and committed an attempted robbery (see paragraph\u00a013 above). The seriousness of the offence on account of which the measure in issue was imposed on the applicant and his subsequent conduct count heavily against him.",
