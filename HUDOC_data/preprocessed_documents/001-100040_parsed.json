The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on statements that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see, most recently, Makeyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a013769/04, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35, 5 February 2009, and, as a leading authority, Luc\u00e0 v.

Many people had attended the meeting but nearly all of them had been ordered to vacate the premises by the first applicant and had not seen what had been happening inside.

In the circumstances where Mr O. had entered the office in good health, had remained there in the company of the applicants who had been seen shouting at him and brandishing objects, and had later emerged from the office covered in blood, the Court is unable to find that the statements by Ms E. and her description of what she had seen through the window played a crucial role for establishing the fact that Mr O.'s injuries had been caused by the applicants. Likewise, the statement by Mr B., who had been away from the scene for a quarter of an hour, merely corroborated the other testimony and did not contain any new relevant elements.
