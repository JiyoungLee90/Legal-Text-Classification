It is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that the provisional detention order of 16\u00a0February 1999 provided a sufficient lawful basis for the applicant\u2019s detention until 26\u00a0March 1999. The order of 16\u00a0February 1999 was provisional in nature and was not attended by procedural guarantees. In particular, it was issued by a court without hearing the applicant or her representative. Its validity was limited to five days and its aim was to allow a period of time for the court to prepare for a hearing and an in-depth examination of the hospital\u2019s application with the participation of both parties. It could therefore serve as a basis for the applicant\u2019s detention only for five days after it had been issued. The Government did not point to any legal provision which permitted the applicant\u2019s detention after its expiry. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention after the expiry of the five-day time-limit established in section 34 of the Psychiatric Treatment Act and until 26\u00a0March 1999 did not have a legal basis in domestic law. This conclusion is supported by the prosecutor\u2019s letter of 1 February 2000 acknowledging that the applicant\u2019s detention from 16 to 26 March 1999 had been unlawful (see paragraph 16 above).",

In two subsequent cases, which also concerned proceedings relating to the lawfulness of detention in psychiatric institutions, the Court found Article 6 to be applicable under its civil head with reference to the Aerts judgment. It dismissed the Government\u2019s objection of incompatibility ratione materiae despite the fact that the proceedings at issue concerned only the lawfulness of the detention without involving any related pecuniary claims (see Vermeersch v.

The mere fact that experts are employed by one of the parties does not suffice to render the proceedings unfair. Although this fact may give rise to apprehensions as to the neutrality of the experts, such apprehensions, while having a certain importance, are not decisive. The requirements of impartiality and independence enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention do not apply to experts. What is decisive, however, is the position occupied by the experts throughout the proceedings, the manner in which they performed their functions and the way the judges assessed the expert opinion (see Zarb v. Malta (dec.), no. 16631/04, 27\u00a0September 2005, and Lasmane v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a043293/98, 6\u00a0June 2002).

When rejecting the applicant\u2019s claim, the court relied on the experts\u2019 finding that their colleagues had not been negligent. The Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of non-compliance with the principle of equality of arms. It took account of three factors: the nature of the task entrusted to the experts, the experts\u2019 hierarchical position in the respondent hospital, and their role in the proceedings, in particular the weight attached by the court to their opinion. As to the first factor, the Court observed that the experts were called upon to assist the court in determining the question of their employer\u2019s liability. As to the second factor, the Court noted that the experts\u2019 superiors had taken a clear stance on the issue by denying the hospital\u2019s responsibility. This fact could justifiably give rise to the fear that the experts would be unable to act with proper neutrality. As to the third factor, the Court found that the opinion given by the experts was decisive evidence in the proceedings. It concluded that as a result of the appointment of the respondent\u2019s employees as experts who played a dominant role in the proceedings, the applicant\u2019s position had not been on a par with that of the respondent hospital in the manner required by the principle of equality of arms (see Sara Lind Eggertsd\u00f3ttir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-55).",

As the applicant contested those findings, the court appointed experts to review them. Having no medical qualifications, the judges of the court were bound to attach significant weight to the experts\u2019 opinion on the medical issue decisive for the outcome of the case.
