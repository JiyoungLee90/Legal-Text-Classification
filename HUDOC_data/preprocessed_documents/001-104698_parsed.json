It noted that counsel for the applicant had withdrawn the request for a further expert report. The applicant could not therefore validly complain that she had been denied the opportunity to adduce evidence concerning the divisibility of the house. Her objections concerning the plan for the division had been discussed and rejected by the lower court. The court went on to observe that the experts and the municipal administration had found that the division could be effected without too much inconvenience and without infringing the applicable construction regulations. Therefore, the lower court\u2019s conclusion that the house was divisible was not contrary to the substantive law.",

The remedy\u2019s shortcomings had been exposed in a number of judgments of the Court. Its successor, the \u201crequest for fixing of timelimit in the event of delay\u201d under Articles 25557 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure, was irrelevant because it had been introduced after the end of the proceedings at issue in the present case and because it reproduced the shortcomings of the \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d. As evident from examples provided by the Government, the national courts routinely failed to deal with such complaints or requests within the statutory timelimits. The failure of a lower court to comply with a timelimit fixed by the higher court pursuant to such a request could not have any consequences. Moreover, in contrast to previous cases against Portugal and Austria, the statistics supplied by the Government did not show in how many cases the complaints or requests had been allowed, whether any instructions given as a result of them had been complied with, and whether that had in fact led to the acceleration of the proceedings in connection with which they had been made.",

That wording is drawn from the second sentence of Article 37 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, where it fulfils a similar function in the context of decisions to strike applications out of the Court\u2019s list of cases. It is also used in Article\u00a038 \u00a7 1 as a basis for securing a friendly settlement between the parties. The Court and the former Commission have consistently interpreted those provisions as compelling them to continue the examination of a case when that is necessary because the case raises questions of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention. Such questions would arise, for example, where there is a need to induce the respondent State to resolve a structural deficiency affecting other persons in the same position as the applicant (see Korolev, cited above).

Bulgaria. After examining the wording of Article 217a of the 1952 Code, it found that the complaint could in principle be an effective remedy, but that regard had to be had to the particular circumstances (see Stefanova v. Bulgaria, no. 58828/00, \u00a7\u00a7 68 and 69, 11 January 2007). On the facts of Stefanova it was found ineffective, because the delays there had occurred as a result of the prosecuting authorities\u2019 failure to provide relevant documents and the courts\u2019 failure duly to notify a party about the delivery of judgment \u2013 issues that could not be resolved through a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 70 and 71). In later judgments the Court identified further situations in which that remedy was unlikely to accelerate proceedings. It could not speed up civil proceedings stayed to await the outcome of criminal ones (see Djangozov, \u00a7 53, and Todorov, \u00a7 61, both cited above). It could not reduce delays due to problems with the service of summons on the defendant (see Simizov, cited above, \u00a7 55), or delays due to unjustified remittals of cases to the lower courts (see Givezov, cited above, \u00a7 38; Tzvyatkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a02380/03, \u00a7 31, 22 October 2009; Kabakchievi, cited above, \u00a7 42; KotsevaDencheva, cited above, \u00a7 28 in fine; and Rosen Petkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 3436).

Bulgaria, no. 10905/04, \u00a7 35, 18 March 2010; Kabakchievi, cited above, \u00a7 41; and KotsevaDencheva, cited above, \u00a7 28). It could not provide effective redress in respect of delays due to the failure of the courts to organise the proper examination of the case, or in situations in which the proceedings had lasted too long without there being identifiable periods of inactivity (see Deyanov v. Bulgaria, no. 2930/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06970, 30 September 2010). Lastly, it cannot reduce delays due to factors extraneous to the judicial system, such as the failure of the local authorities to provide to the parties documents needed as evidence in the case.",

During the first phase of the proceedings, which did not involve any complex issues, the Sofia District Court held no fewer than nine hearings. Four of those were adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities: a failure of the local authorities to provide the parties with plans of the properties, delay in the drawing up of the report of a courtappointed expert, and a failure duly to summon the applicant. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted more than two and a half years (see paragraphs 913 above). During the second phase the Sofia City Court held ten hearings. Three of those were adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities \u2013 delays in the drawing up of the reports of courtappointed experts. As a result, the proceedings before that court lasted about four years (see paragraphs 2028 above). It is true that at that stage the issues to be resolved were more complex. However, it does not seem that the delay could be explained by that factor alone. It was due chiefly to the courts\u2019 manner of proceeding. Much of it could have been avoided if the courts had, from the outset, tried to identify the controversial points and gather evidence in relation to them in a more efficient manner (see, mutatis mutandis, Kiurkchian v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a044626/98, \u00a7 69, 24 March 2005, and Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 59913/00, \u00a7 94, 2 February 2006). Instead, they spread out the examination of the case over a large number of hearings and gathered evidence in a somewhat haphazard manner, acceding indiscriminately to all evidentiary requests of the parties and ordering additional expert reports without a reasonable need to do so. Moreover, some of the intervals between hearings were indeed excessive: more than seven months between those on 20 March and 6\u00a0November 2002, more than six months between those on 6 November 2002 and 29 May 2003, and more than eight months between those on 29\u00a0May 2003 and 12 February 2004 (see paragraphs 2427 above). The combination of a large number of hearings and excessive intervals between some of those hearings resulted in unreasonably lengthy proceedings.",

The bulk of the breaches found by the Court related to the period preceding the adoption of that Code, and were due to a number of legal, organisational and logistic problems causing delay in the examination of civil cases. Some of those had been addressed in the new Code. The principal novelties in the Code were improvements in the rules governing service of process; increased focus on firstinstance proceedings and written submissions; limitations on the ability of parties to adduce evidence at later stages of the proceedings; the introduction of judgments by default; the scrapping of the possibility of full rehearing of cases on appeal; the introduction of limitations on the possibilities of appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court of Cassation; the introduction of simplified procedures for dealing with some categories of straightforward cases; and improvements to the acceleratory remedy existing in the old Code.

In the Government\u2019s view, that remedy fully complied with the Convention requirements. In 2007 the regional courts had dealt with 242 such requests, in 2008 with 110, and in 2009 with 142.

The number of cases completed in 2009 had increased by 15.46% in relation to those completed in 2008; that figure was chiefly due to the number coming from the district courts, where the increase had been upwards of 20%.

In 2009, the number of cases resulting in a judicial decision had increased by 19%.

The reform of the rules of civil procedure was not sufficient because it could not remedy past delays.

Nor could it be accepted that the inspectorates of the Ministry of Justice and of the Supreme Judicial Council would provide a solution to the problem.

The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the means calculated to ensure that their judicial systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see K\u00f6nig v. Germany, 28 June 1978, \u00a7 100, Series A no. 27, and, more recently, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 84, 16 November 2010). Moreover, the unreasonable length of proceedings is a multifaceted problem which may be due to a large number of factors, of both legal and logistical character. Some of those \u2013 such as an insufficient number of judges or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, or poor case management \u2013 may be internal to the judicial system, whereas others \u2013 such as the belated submission of expert reports and failures by the authorities to provide in a timely manner documents needed as evidence \u2013 may be extrinsic to that system. The Court will therefore abstain from indicating any specific measures to be taken by the respondent State to tackle the problem. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Bulgaria in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), \u00a7\u00a7 136 and 137, and Olaru and Others, \u00a7 57, both cited above, as well as Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v.

Indeed, as evident from its Interim Resolution of 2 December 2010 and the first Appendix to it, the Committee is already doing so and will continue, in cooperation with the national authorities (see paragraphs 56 and 57 above). By way of example, the Court would point to the recent adoption of statutory provisions proclaiming the right to a \u201chearing within a reasonable time\u201d (see paragraph 37 above) and the obligation for the courts to \u201cexamine and decide cases within a reasonable time\u201d (see paragraph 45 above).",

Most of its features appear similar to those of the \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d, and it was apparently modelled on the acceleratory remedy existing in Austria, found by the Court to be effective (see paragraph 49 above, and Holzinger v.  (no. 1), no. 23459/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016 and 2025, ECHR 2001I). However, in subsequent Austrian cases the Court found that the \u201cHolzinger\u201d remedy was not effective in respect of delays caused by the Supreme Court (see Meischberger v. Austria (dec.), no. 51941/99, 15 September 2003, and Potzmader v. Austria (dec.), no.\u00a08416/05, 27 November 2008). It also found that its effectiveness was unclear where the overall duration of proceedings was unreasonable without there being specific delays attributable to a particular authority or officer (see Maier v. Austria (dec.), no. 70579/01, 15 September 2003). The new Bulgarian remedy seems to suffer from the same shortcomings. According to the prevailing legal opinion, it is \u2013 like its predecessor \u2013 not applicable to delays in proceedings before the two supreme courts (see paragraph 55 above), and there are no reported examples of its being used in relation to such proceedings. It is moreover sufficiently similar to its predecessor to raise issues as to its capability of leading to the acceleration of proceedings in a number of other situations (see paragraph 87 above).",

Moreover, none of the examples contained information as to whether the use of the remedy had in fact sped up the proceedings. The same goes for the statistics provided by the Government (see paragraphs 52 and 106 above). While those statistics show that more and more people have resorted to that remedy (in 2009 it was used on more than two hundred and twenty occasions), there is no information showing in how many of those cases the higher courts have actually fixed timelimits for the lower courts to take certain procedural steps, and in how many cases the remedy has led to the actual acceleration of the proceedings (contrast Tom\u00e9 Mota v.\u00a0Portugal (dec.), no. 32082/96, ECHR 1999IX, and Ba\u0161i\u0107 v.

Indeed, in Scordino (no. 1) (cited above, \u00a7 186) the Court observed that \u201csome States, such as Austria, Croatia, Spain, Poland and Slovakia, have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation\u201d. It also stated that it is clear that for countries where lengthofproceedings problems already exist, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings \u2013 although desirable for the future \u2013 may not be adequate to redress a situation in which proceedings have clearly already been excessively long (ibid., \u00a7 185). It confirmed this position in three subsequent cases against Slovenia (see \u017duni\u010d v.  (dec.), no.\u00a024342/04, 18 October 2007; Toma\u017ei\u010d v. Slovenia, no. 38350/02, \u00a7\u00a037\u00a0in\u00a0fine, 13 December 2007; and Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no.\u00a033946/03, \u00a7 36, 21 July 2009). In view of what has been said above,  can be considered as a country in which lengthofproceedings problems already exist. The present case \u2013 where the proceedings had lasted three years by the time the \u201ccomplaint for delays\u201d became available and came to a close before the introduction of the \u201crequest for fixing of timelimit in the event of delay\u201d (see paragraphs 8, 34, 43 and 49 above) \u2013 is a good illustration of that. There is thus a clear need for the introduction of a remedy allowing redress to be made available for past delays. Indeed, the Committee of Ministers very recently invited the Bulgarian authorities \u201cto complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 56 above), and the Bulgarian authorities are now working on a draft bill in that domain (see paragraphs 57 and 109 above). The Court would add that the introduction of effective domestic remedies in this domain would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court\u2019s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system (see Kud\u0142a, \u00a7\u00a0155, and Scordino (no. 1), \u00a7 188, both cited above).",

In view of that and bearing in mind that the case, due to its pilot character, raised a range of issues which surpass the complexity of those usually raised by a normal lengthofproceedings case, the Court considers it reasonable to award the full amount claimed by the applicant in respect of lawyers\u2019 fees (EUR\u00a03,205.32). EUR 750 of that amount is to be paid to the applicant herself, and the remainder to her legal representative, Mr M. Ekimdzhiev.",
