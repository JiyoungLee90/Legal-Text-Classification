It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to examine all the circumstances arguing for or against the existence of such a requirement and to set them out in their decisions on the applications for release.  It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts stated by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3).  The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices: the Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \"relevant\" and \"sufficient\", the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \"special diligence\" in the conduct of the proceedings (see, as the most recent authority, the W. v.  judgment of 26\u00a0January 1993, Series A no. 254-A, p. 15, para. 30).

The failure to satisfy that condition required his application to be found inadmissible, even of the Court's own motion, as being incompatible with the Convention (Articles 29 and 27 para. 2) (art.\u00a029, art. 27-2).

It is for that reason that they sought to have the case struck out of the list without any ruling on the merits, because they considered that the applicant's conduct towards the Spanish courts prevented him from taking proceedings before the Convention institutions.

The presence of the applicant, an accused person provisionally at liberty, at the trial thus becomes a prerequisite of the decision (presupuesto procesal in Spanish law, Sachurteilsvoraussetzung in German law, see Rosemberg-Schwab and Gottwald, Zivilproze\u00dfrecht, Munich, 1993, pp. 535-41) when he alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3).  The unjustified failure to satisfy the conditions of provisional release therefore entailed loss of standing to take proceedings before the Convention institutions and inadmissibility of the application as being incompatible with the Convention under Articles 29 and 27 para. 2 (art. 29, art. 27-2).

Salmon, \"Des mains propres comme condition de recevabilit\u00e9 des r\u00e9clamations internationales\", Annuaire fran\u00e7ais de droit international, vol. X, 1964, pp. 225 et seq.; C.\u00a0Rousseau, Droit international public, Sirey, Paris, 1983, vol. V, pp. 171-72; M. Diez de Velasco, Instituciones de Derecho Internacional P\u00fablico, Tecnos, Madrid, 1983, vol. I, pp. 395-96).  Furthermore, human rights proceedings do not belong to the class of international disputes concerning the diplomatic protection of nationals prejudiced by acts contrary to international law which are ascribed to another State, and the applicant's unlawful conduct in the instant case did not give rise to the violation he complained of or contribute to bringing it about.

Nor do I think it possible to strike the case out of the Court's list under Rule 49 of Rules of Court A, as the Government also requested, seeing that the Convention says nothing about such a form of terminating the proceedings and in view of its exceptional nature, requiring a narrow interpretation.  All the eventualities contemplated in that Rule, paragraphs 1 and 2, concern solutions of a matter of the parties' own will - discontinuance, friendly settlement or arrangement - and relate to facts or similar circumstances such as abandonment or lapse of the action or satisfaction of the applicant's claim out of court.  Failure to comply with the conditions of provisional release in the specific case of Article 5 para. 3 (art.\u00a05-3) of the Convention is not a fact of a kind to provide a solution of the matter but a fact likely to put in issue the admissibility of the complaint.

Furthermore, it is required by the good faith that the parties must show in their conduct in Convention proceedings and the respect they must show for the international human rights institutions and for the courts of democratic societies.  The Commission member Mr Mart\u00ednez asked, at the end of his dissenting opinion: \"By what right can a person who has treated the courts of a democratic State with scorn proceed against that State in the circumstances of this case?\" That question should have received a negative reply: protection, through the Convention system, of a detained person to be tried within a reasonable time or released pending trial requires, other than for well-founded reasons, compliance with the conditions of provisional release to ensure that the person concerned appears before the court which is to try him, conditions which the applicant had formally accepted before the national courts and before the Commission.
