The claimant argued, citing Osman v. the United Kingdom (28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII), that a duty to take steps to prevent a particular patient from committing suicide arose if the authorities knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk of her doing so. The claimant sought to distinguish her son\u2019s position (an involuntary patient) from that of a voluntary patient arguing that the test for Article 2 liability in Powell did not apply to her son and equating the duty of care owed by the State to an involuntary patient with that owed to a prisoner in the criminal justice system. The High Court expressly rejected that distinction, finding that the proper test applicable to a breach of the substantive obligation under Article 2, in respect of both voluntary and involuntary patients where the relevant allegations were of clinical negligence, was the Powell test namely, that of gross negligence of a kind sufficient to sustain a charge of manslaughter (the High Court relied on the above-cited Takoushis judgment).

He found that the difference between voluntary and involuntary psychiatric patients was more apparent than real, noting that a voluntary patient who was a suicide risk was taking medication which would compromise his/her ability to make an informed decision, was likely to be detained if he/she attempted to leave and, indeed, may have consented to be a patient to avoid detention. An informal psychiatric patient\u2019s position was therefore more analogous to that of the child at risk of abuse (Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, ECHR 2001V). Accordingly, he was in no doubt that the NHS Trust owed to the deceased patient an operational duty to take reasonable steps to protect her from a real and immediate risk of suicide. On the facts, that obligation had not been fulfilled since the decision to allow her home on leave was one that no reasonable practitioner would have made.",

At one point during the evening before he died, he was found wandering outside the ISMOS Unit and encouraged by staff to return, which he did. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s son later broke a window in the Unit and fell to his death from the sixth floor of the building occupied by the Unit. The Coroner, concerned as he was about a psychiatric facility on a sixth floor, reported the incident to the NHS Trust under Rule 43 of the Coroner\u2019s Rules 1984. The windows have since been reinforced and the long term plan is to transfer the ISMOS Unit to a two-storey building. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there is an arguable claim that the position of the applicant\u2019s son was such that an operational duty arose to take reasonable steps to protect him from a real and immediate risk of suicide and that that duty was not fulfilled.",

The Government suggested that Takoushis was not clear precedent because the core dispute therein concerned the investigatory duties under Article 2. However, the Court of Appeal in Takoushis explained why its view on the applicability and scope of Article 2 protection was important in that case and subsequent domestic courts did not treat as obiter the Takoushis ruling on the Powell substantive obligation under Article 2. On the contrary, the High Court in Savage later accepted that obligation as outlined in Takoushis and went on to apply it to a case concerning the death of an involuntary patient due to alleged negligence. The County Court therefore applied this case-law from two superior courts to the present applicant\u2019s case (death of a voluntary patient due to alleged clinical negligence) and found it clear from that case-law that the parameters of the applicant\u2019s case fell outside the scope of an action under the HRA alleging a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. Indeed the County Court considered the case-law to be so certain in these respects that an appeal in the Savage case did not raise sufficient prospects of success for the applicant\u2019s case as to require it to be adjourned pending the Savage appeal. The applicant\u2019s case was not therefore rejected as failing to disclose negligence but rather as not disclosing a cause of action under the HRA and, in particular, the County Court applied contemporary domestic case-law to the effect that she had no cause of action under the HRA about the allegedly negligent care and death of her son as he was a voluntary psychiatric in-patient.",

It was not until February 2012 that the Supreme Court in Rabone definitively confirmed that an operational duty to protect could arise as regards voluntary psychiatric patients such as the applicant\u2019s son and, further, that parents would be entitled to damages for non-pecuniary loss following the death of a child in such a situation. Accordingly, while the underlying reasoning may have changed over the years, prior to February 2012 the applicant did not have an action for damages under the HRA for her non-pecuniary loss following the death of her son.",

The survival of any such action on behalf of the deceased and in favour of his estate is governed by the 1934 Act. Given the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s death (which was instantaneous), there is no evidence that he inflicted physical injury on himself before the moment of his death. While it is likely that he suffered significant anguish and fear, there is no evidence that this would be regarded as psychiatric \u201cinjury\u201d in the sense recognised by domestic law. The most therefore that could be recovered under the 1934 Act on behalf of the deceased\u2019s estate would have been the funeral expenses (as regards the 1976 and 1934 Acts, see the above-cited Keenan judgment, \u00a7 129 and Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 50196/99, \u00a7 172, ECHR 2005II).\u00a0It must be concluded therefore that the applicant had no prospect of obtaining adequate compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by her as a result of the death of her child (either directly or as a beneficiary of her son\u2019s estate).",
