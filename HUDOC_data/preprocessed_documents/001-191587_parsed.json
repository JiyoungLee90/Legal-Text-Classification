It also allowed them access to nursing care for two hours per day on weekdays and included a shelter for women and children.

He highlighted their \u201cextremely precarious\u201d living conditions: apart from the hundred women and children who took shelter at night in the Jules Ferry Centre, the vast majority of the migrants lived in cramped conditions, sleeping in rudimentary tents and shelters (made of planks or plastic tarpaulins), some without any protection at all. He further noted that the lack of infrastructure contributed to the hostile environment and the squalid living conditions: 2,500 meals were distributed only once a day, even though more than 3,500 people were living on the heath, in poor material conditions (a 500-metre queue outdoors, long waiting times without any guarantee of a meal, police surveillance and insufficient sheltered eating places). Apart from the taps and showers at the Jules Ferry Centre, which was open only from 12 noon to 7 pm, there were just three water taps on the heath; the waste collection facilities were insufficient and represented a major health risk. The report also mentioned the migrants\u2019 state of physical and mental exhaustion, pointing out that, after travelling for several months or years, they were forced to adopt a way of life that was \u201cmore like a survival experiment\u201d. They were showing signs of conditions that were characteristic of people in situations of very serious instability, combined with disorders specific to migrants and were suffering from post-traumatic syndromes linked to police violence or pressure.

In the specific case of unaccompanied foreign minors, he noted that there were four rooms in a children\u2019s home, run as a social facility, for the emergency accommodation of children under fifteen years of age for a maximum of eight days, pending the examination of their situation and their orientation to the most appropriate placement. However, he considered this system to be unsuitable, as the minors concerned often refused to go to other places because of their distance from the heath, whilst they still wanted to reach England. He made the same observation with regard to unaccompanied foreign minors over fifteen years of age, their accommodation being provided for in a centre catering for thirty, located 45\u00a0km away from Calais. The report also pointed out that the unaccompanied foreign minors without supervision were left to their own devices, with the development of risky behaviour among teenagers that was mainly linked to increased alcohol consumption.",

But he stated that he did not share this satisfaction and that he could not endorse a view of the situation which suggested that anything was better than keeping people in shantytowns, especially in the case of minors. He pointed out that clearance operations had to be anticipated, planned and coordinated in order to prevent them from further violating the fundamental rights of the migrants concerned. In particular, he submitted that the interests of minors had not been of primary concern in the operation. In his view, the solutions implemented by the authorities, even when they were purportedly humanitarian, were more influenced by considerations related to the control of migration flows than by the need to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of those concerned.",

This provision authorises the judge to order educational assistance measures if the health, safety or morals of an unemancipated minor are in danger, or if the conditions of his or her education or physical, emotional, intellectual and social development are seriously compromised. The judge may in particular receive an application from the youth himself or from the public prosecutor\u2019s office; he may also examine the matter of his own motion on an exceptional basis (see paragraph 37 above). Taking into account the applicant\u2019s situation of danger and the need to take him into shelter, the Youth Judge granted the request by a decision of 22 February 2016, which was automatically enforceable on a provisional basis and against which no appeal was lodged (see paragraph 31 above). The authorities were required to enforce this decision, without any further proceedings being required under domestic law for this purpose. They could also be required to protect and take care of the applicant from the moment they became aware of his situation. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the application to the Youth Judge gave the respondent State the opportunity to prevent or remedy the breach of the positive obligations that Article 3 of the Convention could impose on it on account of the minor\u2019s situation. Thus, in the very particular circumstances of his case, the applicant did what could reasonably be expected of him for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Greece judgment (no. 8687/08, 5 April 2011), the Court found that the failure of the national authorities to take care of an unaccompanied foreign minor constituted a breach of Article\u00a03 of the Convention in so far as they had left him to fend for himself and in general he had been taken care of solely by local nongovernmental organisations. He further emphasised that the authorities were required to take account of the extreme vulnerability of such minors. He complained that the decision on his provisional placement of 22\u00a0February 2016 had not been enforced, stressing that he had never opposed its enforcement and had absolutely no objection to being taken into shelter. He considered more generally that the authorities should have gone to the \u201cjungle\u201d to provide him with basic material support and initiate welfare formalities that would enable him to be directed to facilities where he could be taken into shelter, such as the child welfare service\u2019s accommodation. He pointed out that d\u00e9partements and the State had a particular obligation to protect unaccompanied minors and minors in situations of danger. He observed that the Government had not adduced any evidence to show that steps had been taken to trace him. He also rejected the Government\u2019s argument that his lawyer or the associations following his case should have taken physical steps, in particular by taking him and the other minors concerned to the child welfare services. Pointing out that only the prefect and the local authority (conseil d\u00e9partemental) were responsible for the organisation of the reception and placement of unaccompanied foreign minors, he took the view that it would be legally erroneous and unacceptable to shift this burden to others, adding that his lawyer would not have had the material resources to take such action. The Rahimi judgment, cited above, showed that the obligation to take care of unaccompanied foreign minors did not fall on third parties but on the authorities, and on the latter alone.",

He pointed out that the French authorities were bound by both domestic and international law to shelter and take care of them (he referred in particular to Article 20 of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 6 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v.

On 20\u00a0April 2016 he had recommended the implementation of regular and intensive socio-educational outreach by specially trained social workers, with a view to establishing a relationship of trust and allowing the stabilisation of unaccompanied minors on the site and effective care, stressing that the minor\u2019s acceptance of the protection measure should be sought but should not constitute a precondition for any attempt to find a solution.

Their access to rights and justice was limited, in particular as regards their access to the asylum procedure: an ad hoc guardian could only be appointed to represent them once they had taken steps to benefit from protection, while some steps (including withdrawal of the asylum application) could only be taken after such appointment. This procedure, in addition to the steps to be taken under the head of child protection, was complex and slow. According to the CNCDH, the difficulties encountered by unaccompanied foreign minors in the context of asylum applications or their administrative situation revealed a security logic that led to the minor being regarded first and foremost as a foreigner, while a child in danger had be covered by a protection measure regardless of his or her personal status and situation in terms of the rules on entry and residence.",

Secondly, the reception facilities were inadequate, so that between 2014 and the end of 2016 several hundred unaccompanied foreign minors had been living in appalling conditions in the Calais shantytown, characterised by squalor, deprivation and insecurity. Thirdly, their protection against the risks of trafficking and exploitation was inadequate. Fourthly, their rights to education and health were insufficiently guaranteed: even in cases of emergency temporary shelter, schooling or training had rarely been put in place; extreme and inhumane living conditions on the heath were triggering or aggravating disease, as well as traumas linked to their chaotic migration history, conditions of anxiety and depression and impaired mental health due to exhaustion and survival needs. On this last point, the CNCDH added that the significant increase in population density in the northern part of the camp caused by the clearance of the southern zone in February 2015 had considerably increased the risk of contagion of infectious diseases. The State\u2019s shortcomings and failures were all the more unjustifiable as it had been more than twenty years since the Calais area had first been confronted with a large number of migrants wishing to travel to the United Kingdom, and therefore the situation was not exceptional.",

It observed that the applicant had been left to his own devices after being released by the Greek authorities, basing its finding on reports about the lack of provision for unaccompanied foreign minors in Greece by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Greek Ombudsman and the non-governmental organisations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, together with the testimony of non-governmental organisations which had followed the applicant\u2019s case on Lesbos and in Athens. It noted in particular that his accommodation and his protection more generally had been provided for solely by local non-governmental organisations. It found that on account of the conduct of the authorities, which had been indifferent towards him, the applicant must have felt extremely anxious and worried, especially from the time of his release until he was looked after in Athens by a non-governmental organisation, which indicated that when he was admitted to the accommodation centre for minors he had trouble going to sleep without leaving the light on, had difficulty speaking and was very under-nourished.",

The applicant\u2019s statements on the latter point (see paragraph 32 above) are consistent in particular with the information reported by the D\u00e9fenseur des droits (see paragraph 58 above), by the CNCDH (see paragraph 62 above) and by the non-governmental organisation GISTI (see paragraph 65 above).",

However, the Court notes that, in the opinion of the D\u00e9fenseur des droits in particular, the reluctance of unaccompanied minors on the heath could be explained by the fact that the shelter system was unsuited to their situation, in particular because of the distance of the facilities; it further observes that, according to the D\u00e9fenseur des droits, their reluctance could not, in any event, justify the inaction of the authorities, which had an obligation to ensure their protection and therefore to find the best means to fulfil it, taking into account the specificities of the minors\u2019 situation (ibid.). In the present case the applicant stated that he himself was in favour of an alternative accommodation solution. The Court would point out that he was a child of only twelve years old who, moreover, probably had only a limited knowledge of the French language. It is not therefore persuaded by the Government\u2019s assertion that it was for the applicant himself to take the necessary steps to ensure that his protection measures were implemented. Nor does it consider that the non-governmental organisations which had provided support to the applicant on a voluntary basis, the lawyer who had represented him in the proceedings leading to the decision of 22 February 2016, and the ad hoc guardian who had been appointed on 19 February 2016, could be reproached for not having taken him to the home designated by the authorities for his placement, since this was clearly the responsibility of the State.",

On the latter point, it notes the ambiguity of the applicant\u2019s conduct: although he applied to the Youth Judge for his provisional placement, his intention was not to remain in France but to leave the country and travel to the United Kingdom. The Court further notes that the national authorities did not remain totally inactive since they took steps to enforce the decision of 22 February 2016.",
