However, it considered that while the applicants deserved compensation for the violation of their rights, namely nonpecuniary damages, the quantum established by the court of firstinstance was excessive. In its view, constitutional redress proceedings should not serve as a replacement to ordinary remedies available to the applicants. Once the requisition order was annulled (by means of a judicial review procedure), the applicants had other remedies to deal with both the eviction of Mr and Ms A. and the award of material damages before the ordinary courts. The Constitutional Court also observed that the applicants took a long time before taking action to protect their fundamental rights, namely, in 2009, around seventeen years after the violation of their rights first occurred. Therefore, as a result of this delay the Constitutional Court considered that the amount of EUR 12,000 was just and equitable as compensation for nonpecuniary damage. In relation to practical measures, the Constitutional Court considered that since the applicants still had a remedy under Article 469A, by means of which they could attack the requisition order before the ordinary courts, it was not for it to annul the requisition order.",

The applicants were thus awarded EUR\u00a0545.45 annually which had to be added to the EUR\u00a0279.52 annually which they received in rent.

While admitting that the value of the property would have been less prior to 2010, its value had increased post 2010. Thus, the difference in rent awarded and that on the market remained too wide to consider such sum to be adequate redress. Moreover, the applicants noted that out of that EUR 12,000 they had to pay EUR\u00a01,230 in costs, which thus diminished their compensation further.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. Although the scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7\u00a0157, ECHR 2000XI, and Ali\u0161i\u0107 and Others v.\u00a0Bosnia\u00a0and\u00a0Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the\u00a0former\u00a0Yugoslav\u00a0Republic\u00a0of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a060642/08, \u00a7\u00a0131, ECHR 2014).",

When assessing whether such a remedy was capable of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, it found that while there was no doubt that in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant, it was clear from the case-law brought to the Court\u2019s attention that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where a lawful requisition has imposed an excessive burden on an applicant leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action (see Apap Bologna, cited above, \u00a7\u00a08588). When examining whether such a remedy provided adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred, the Court noted that it had repeatedly found that the sums awarded in compensation by the Constitutional Court did not constitute adequate redress (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a089 and\u00a082). Moreover, awards were also often not accompanied by an adequate award of nonpecuniary damage and/or burdened with an order for the payment of the relevant costs (ibid., \u00a7 90). Thus, the Court concluded that although constitutional redress proceedings were an effective remedy in theory, they were not so in practice, in cases such as the present one. In consequence, they could not be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a013 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 concerning arguable complaints in respect of requisition orders which, though lawful and pursuing legitimate objectives, imposed an excessive individual burden on applicants (ibid., \u00a7 91).",

Thus while it surely has no bearing for the purposes of the exhaustion requirement  given that the Constitutional Court is the last step in the process of exhaustion of ordinary remedies in the Maltese context - the Court will refrain from finding that such a remedy had generally no prospects of success. Indeed, in the present case, following the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding, no such action was necessary as the tenants had already abandoned the property of their own motion. Thus, the remedy required (in the sixteen months following the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding,\u00a0i.e. before the property was also derequisitioned) would have been one which would have led to the revocation of the requisition order. The Government made no reference to the availability of such a remedy.",

Indeed, such considerations seems to be the result of the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding in the specific circumstances of the present case, which had also taken account of the structural damages to the property. This situation does not appear to be the norm. However, the Court notes that even assuming each successive remedy could have provided the relevant action attributed to it, the Court observes that it took the constitutional jurisdictions more than five years (over two instances) to decide the applicants\u2019 claims, it thus appears reasonable to consider that it could take another five years (at two instances) for the civil courts to determine the applicants\u2019 remaining claims. Thus, bearing in mind that the speed of remedial action is also relevant (see paragraph 67 above) as well as its consideration made at paragraph\u00a039 above, the Court cannot consider that the aggregate of remedies available to the applicants, in the present case, constituted effective remedies available to them in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Moreover, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that successive procedures would have further burdened the applicants with supplementary legal costs and expenses (see, mutatis mutandis, McFarlane, cited above \u00a7\u00a0124).",
