The second applicant reiterated the arguments that he had advanced at the preliminary hearing \u2013 namely, that he had actually been arrested on 26\u00a0January 2005 and held continuously in police custody, where he had been subjected to violence until he had given a confession. He also stated that when he had been brought to O., the investigator, for questioning on 28 January 2005, he had complained about the above-mentioned ill-treatment; O. had replied that if he did not reiterate his statements he would spend another night with the police officers. The applicant furthermore stated that the police officers had visited him every day and had threatened him; his family had been unaware of his whereabouts; he had given confession statements out of fear for his life; and he had not in fact committed the crime in question. The Town Court ordered that the hearing be adjourned and an inquiry into the applicants\u2019 and their co-defendants\u2019 allegations be carried out by the inter-district prosecutor\u2019s office before the next hearing on 26\u00a0July 2005.",

In refusing the applicant\u2019s request for the exclusion of the abovementioned records of the investigative actions of 28\u00a0January 2005 and 1 February 2005 the Tikhoretsk Town Court failed to carry out its own independent assessment with a view to ascertaining whether there were reasons to exclude from evidence those records containing the applicant\u2019s confession statements, which had allegedly been tainted by a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, so as to ensure the fairness of the trial. Instead of exercising the utmost care by subjecting those repeated statements to very strict scrutiny (especially after declaring the initial confession statement of 27\u00a0January 2005 to constitute inadmissible evidence on the grounds that it had been adduced in the absence of a lawyer), the Town Court relied on the investigating authorities\u2019 decisions, which the Court has found to have been based on an inquiry which did not meet the Article 3 requirements (see paragraph 106 above). This lack of a careful assessment of the quality of the impugned evidence and the circumstances in which it was obtained was not remedied by the higher courts (see paragraphs 53-54 above).",
