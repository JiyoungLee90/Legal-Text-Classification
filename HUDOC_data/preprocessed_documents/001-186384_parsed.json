Noting that there were other demonstrators who had covered their mouths and that the police documents showed that the applicant had actively taken part in the demonstration and instructed others to chant slogans, the Assize Court concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation.

The applicant denied the veracity of the public prosecutor\u2019s allegation while acknowledging that he had participated in the march and the reading out of the press statement on 30 March 2006 (see paragraph 9 above).

The Court observes that the Assize Court found that by attending and actively participating in the public gathering in question and instructing the other demonstrators to chant slogans, the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of the PKK. The court did not, however, provide an explanation as to why it considered that the applicant\u2019s acts during the march and the reading out of the press statement had constituted incitement to violence, or armed resistance or an uprising, or had been capable of incitement to violence. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file showing that the event in question was not a peaceful public gathering and that the applicant was involved in any violent acts or had the intention of inciting violence.
