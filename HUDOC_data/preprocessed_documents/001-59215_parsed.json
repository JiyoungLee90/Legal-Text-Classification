The first two applicants, who had intervened in favour of the Secretary General, claimed that this decision did not produce any legal effects because on 8 November 1991 (decision no. 9779/1991) the Court of Appeal had declared that it had been ipso jure revoked. However, the Council considered that, the decision of the appeal court notwithstanding, the administration was under an obligation formally to revoke decision no. 13580/277/87/1988 expropriating the plot. As long as this had not happened, decision no. 84888/4910/1989 could be judicially reviewed.

Between 13 September 1987 and 1 March 1988 there was a building freeze on the applicants\u2019 property. On 1 March 1988 the applicants\u2019 property was expropriated (first expropriation). On 21\u00a0May 1990 a town planning measure was adopted the legal effect of which is disputed between the parties. On 31 July 1991 the Council of State ordered the revocation of the first expropriation. On 19 August 1993 a fresh expropriation was ordered. On 10 July 1995 the Council of State quashed the order of 19\u00a0August 1993. On 9 July 1996 the municipality proposed yet another expropriation. On 14\u00a0February 1997 the authorities informed the applicants that their property was in the process of being expropriated by virtue of the decision of 21 May 1990.",

On 21 May 1990 the Prefect amended the town plan of Neo Psihiko and this amendment was considered to amount to a new expropriation. On 19 August 1993 a fresh expropriation was ordered, which would have been in accordance with the Convention, if the applicants had been paid adequate compensation. This involved allowing the applicants use of the underground area of their plot for the construction of a carpark and compensation for the use of the surface which would have been transformed into a parking building (see paragraph 25 above).

The Court observes in this connection that the administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice. Where administrative authorities refuse or fail to comply, or even delay doing so, the guarantees under Article\u00a06 enjoyed by a litigant during the judicial phase of the proceedings are rendered devoid of purpose (judgment of Hornsby v.
