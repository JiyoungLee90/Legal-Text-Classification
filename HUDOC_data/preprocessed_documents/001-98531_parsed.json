The Constitutional Court found the following functions imposed on the judge incompatible with those principles: to institute criminal proceedings and formulate charges under Article 418 of the Code (a decision of 28 November 1996); to institute criminal proceedings, in particular against a new person, and to apply a preventive measure against that person under Articles 3, 108 \u00a7 1 (vi), 109 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 and 3 (i), 112 and 115, 232 \u00a7 1 (iv) and 256 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 and 4 (a decision of 14 January 2000); to sustain charges after the prosecutor's dropping the charges under Article\u00a0248 \u00a7 4 of the Code (a decision of 20 April 1999); and to remit, of its own motion, a criminal case to the prosecutor for additional investigation in case of irreparable incompleteness of investigation, in particular if evidence was found to have been received illegally, or in the case of grounds for laying more serious charges or new charges against the defendant under Articles 232 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (i) and (iii) and 258 \u00a7 1 of the Code (the decision of 20 April 1999 and a ruling of 3 February 2000).",

In particular, it stated in its decision of 20 April 1999 that a criminal trial was based on the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of the parties, which meant first of all strict separation of the judicial function and the prosecution function, which were therefore carried out by different actors. The adversarial nature of criminal trials implied that the institution of criminal prosecution, the formulation of a charge and its sustaining before the court, were insured by competent bodies and officials, as well as victims. Imposing on the court the obligation to substitute, in one or another form, for those bodies and persons' prosecution activity, was incompatible with Article 123 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution and obstructed the independent and impartial administration of justice by the court as required by Article 120 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Constitution, as well as Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",

What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held objectively justified (ibid., \u00a7 48).",

When transferring the case for trial to Savelovskiy District Court the  prosecutor's office had requested that the case be examined with the participation of a prosecutor. The judge had ordered that the trial be held with the participation of a public prosecutor. There is no information in the case file as to whether the prosecutor had been informed of the hearing and what the reasons for his non-attendance were. Yet, the District Court decided to hold the trial in the prosecutor's absence. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court of Russia had by that time, albeit in relation to different provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, held that the institution of criminal prosecution, the formulation of a charge and sustaining the charge before the court were functions inherent for the prosecution which, if performed by a court in one or another form, would have violated the court's role, which is to administer justice independently and impartially, as required by Article 120 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution, as well as Article 6 of the Convention (see paragraphs 27-28 above).",

It then heard the applicant, who pleaded not guilty to the charge of burglary. The District Court heard the victims and other witnesses. In particular, as regards the charge of burglary, it called and questioned, of its own motion, Mr Y. who gave evidence incriminating the applicant, on which the District Court then relied in its judgment. The District Court further examined other evidence and declared certain written evidence in support of the prosecution's case inadmissible as unlawfully obtained. Against these facts, the Court cannot agree with the Government's statement that the District Court did nothing more than examining the evidence prepared for the trial by the investigating authority. In fact, the body of evidence, which the District Court put as a basis for the applicant's conviction, was changed by the taking of new incriminating evidence of the District Court's own motion, and removing certain evidence submitted by the prosecutor's office in support of the charges in the indictment, and all that without the prosecutor being present to make any statement in respect of these changes.",

His exclusive role would have been either to sustain the charges levelled against the applicant before the trial or to drop them had he become convinced that the materials of the judicial investigation no longer supported them (see paragraph 26 above). The preparatory work he had done for the trial in a form of the indictment was undoubtedly important. But it was at the oral hearing of the case before the District Court that he had either to sustain or to abandon the charges against the applicant in view of the judicial investigation as it unfolded, which, in fact, brought about the changes as to the body of evidence. It would be a speculation to suggest what course of actions the prosecutor would have chosen and how it would have affected the course and the outcome of the trial for the applicant. Moreover, this is of no importance for the present case. What is important is that by examining the case on the merits and convicting the applicant without the prosecutor the District Court confused the roles of prosecutor and judge and, thus, gave the grounds for legitimate doubts as to its impartiality. The presence of the victims at the hearing had no impact on the situation, as this was a case of public and not private prosecution.",

It follows from the Government's submissions that the District Court's decision to hold the trial in the prosecutor's absence complied fully with the domestic law on criminal procedure then in force. It can be concluded, therefore, that the Moscow City Court, which examined the case on appeal, had no ground to quash the judgment for violation of procedural law (see, for the appeal court's jurisdiction, paragraphs 30 and 31 above). Even assuming that it had the power to quash the judgment on the ground that the Savelovskiy District Court had not been impartial, it did not do so and upheld the conviction and the sentence. It did not make any separate comment in its judgment in reply to the applicant's complaint concerning the prosecutor's absence from the trial. Nor is there any other indication that it made good the shortcoming at issue. As to the subsequent supervisory review proceedings in which the Presidium of Moscow City Court altered the conviction and the sentence, there is nothing in the material before the Court to indicate that the supervisory review remedied the defect in question.",

However, even assuming that the applicant may be considered to have waived his right by failing to air his disagreement during the trial, the Court considers that waiver of rights guaranteed by Article 6 cannot depend on the parties alone where the right in issue is of essential importance, such as the fundamental right to an independent and impartial tribunal in view of the public interest involved, notably the importance of the requirements of independence and impartiality for confidence in judicial system (see Pfeifer and Plankl v.\u00a0Austria, 25 February 1992, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, Series A no. 227; Bulut v.
