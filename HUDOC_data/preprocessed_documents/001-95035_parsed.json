There are three particular elements to be considered in relation to the compatibility of an applicant's health with his stay in detention: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention; and (c) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of the applicant (see Mouisel v.\u00a0France, no. 67263/01, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42, ECHR 2002IX).",

The\u00a0penitentiary had a medical unit, where the applicant was placed when required, and his conditions could to a certain extent be treated in that unit. When the need arose, he was transferred to another hospital in Dnipropetrovsk, where he received supplementary treatment (see paragraph 17 above). The\u00a0Court notes that the applicant did not dispute or criticise the comment of the prison administration of August 2006, according to which he was being provided with medical treatment in accordance with the established diagnoses (see paragraph 19 above). His\u00a0disagreement with the diagnoses issued by the prison doctors stems not from an allegation of inadequacy of the medical treatment, but rather from his frustration over the fact that they did not make him eligible for potential early release.",

The Court finds it difficult to establish whether and to what extent the applicant's health deteriorated in prison and to what extent that deterioration was due to the standard of health care provided as opposed to the applicant's aging and the natural course of his illness. It notes, however, that the applicant did receive some specific treatment for the condition at issue and that he objected to being examined by independent doctors within the Dnipropetrovsk region.

France, judgment of 22 September 1994, Series A no. 296-A, p. 18, \u00a7 33). Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made - at least in substance - to the appropriate domestic body in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Cardot v. France, judgment of 19\u00a0March\u00a01991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0200, p.\u00a018, \u00a7\u00a034). However, only effective remedies are required to be exhausted. The remedy must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see, for example, \u0130lhan v.  [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 97, ECHR\u00a02000-VII). The term \u201ceffective\u201d is also considered to mean that the remedy must be adequate and accessible (see Vidas v. Croatia, no.\u00a040383/04, \u00a7 34, 3\u00a0July\u00a02008, and Paulino Tom\u00e1s v. Portugal (dec.), no.\u00a058698/00, ECHR\u00a02003-VIII). Moreover, to be effective, a remedy must be independent of any discretionary action by the authorities and must be directly available to those concerned (see Gurepka v. Ukraine, no.\u00a061406/00, \u00a7\u00a059, 6 September 2005).",

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Mente\u015f and Others v. Turkey, 28\u00a0November 1997, \u00a7 57, Reports 1997VIII). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see e.g. Dankevich v. Ukraine, no.\u00a040679/98, \u00a7\u00a0107, 29\u00a0April\u00a02003). A mere doubt as to the prospect of success is not sufficient to exempt an applicant from submitting a complaint to the competent court (see, for example, Plyatsevyy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 8783/04, 25\u00a0November 2008).",

Therefore, the Court considers that in the circumstances of this case there are no prima facie doubts as to the accessibility of this remedy in practice, which might be the case should the jurisdiction delimitation lack clarity. The Court further notes that the administrative courts had sufficient powers to recognise the impugned interference with the applicant's correspondence unlawful, to oblige the prison administration to abstain from such interferences in the future and to charge compensation for the damage should any be found. It follows that this remedy was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaint and offered reasonable prospects of success.",

This has not been the case with this application, where the applicant was provided access, albeit with some delay, to the case file and was eventually able to submit to the Court all the documents he deemed to be of relevance, while the Registry of the Court, in turn, never indicated a need for any such documents for the examination of the application.",
