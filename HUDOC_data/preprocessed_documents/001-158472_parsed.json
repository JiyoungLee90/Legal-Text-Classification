The court went on to hold that the case fell under Article 78a \u00a7 1 of the Code (see paragraph 42 below) and that the officers\u2019 criminal liability was therefore to be waived and replaced by administrative fines ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN). In fixing the quantum of the fines, the court found that the officers\u2019 good character and their having caused the applicant the least serious type of bodily harm under the Code were mitigating factors, whereas their having acted jointly and having infringed the applicant\u2019s rights under the Convention were aggravating ones. It also took into account the officers\u2019 family and financial situation, noting in particular that the monthly salary of the first was BGN 800 and those of the other two BGN 600 each. Based on all that, it held that the aims of the punishment could be attained by giving each of the officers a fine of BGN\u00a02,000 (the equivalent of 1,023 euros (EUR)). There was no need additionally to disqualify them from working as police officers under Article\u00a078 \u00a7 4 of the Code (see paragraph 42 in fine below). The fines were sufficient to make them rethink their conduct and refrain from resorting to violence in the future.",

The only exception was treaties requiring the criminalisation of certain acts or omissions. This was because these treaties usually did not define precisely the elements of the offences or set out the applicable penalties, leaving that to States Parties. For instance, the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (see paragraph 45 below) defined the term \u201ctorture\u201d and required all States Parties to criminalise all forms of torture but did not set out specific offences or penalties. Another thing to bear in mind in that connection was that under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the Convention, offences had to be defined by law. The terms and expressions used in treaties could however, in as much as they featured as elements of an offence set out in domestic criminal law, serve as an aid in the interpretation of that law. In that limited sense, treaties requiring the criminalisation of acts or omissions were part of domestic law.",

The court also upheld the suspended sentence of eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment (below the statutory minimum) imposed by the lower courts, finding that since there were many mitigating factors in favour of the officer, such as a clean criminal record, good character and good professional record, a suspended sentence was sufficient for the purposes of deterrence. The high degree of dangerousness of offences under Article\u00a0287 was clear, but the sentencing court was duty-bound to balance that against the characteristics of the specific offender. If it had duly established that the offence had been a one-off rather than demonstrative of an enduring tendency in the officer\u2019s work, it was not open to it to increase the sentence or refuse to suspend it simply by reference to considerations relating to general deterrence. When going on to deal with the victim\u2019s claim for damages, the court found that the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected had caused him not only psychical pain but also fear and helplessness, greatly intensified by the use of the electroshock prod. In those circumstances, and bearing in mind that the ill-treatment had broken his will and caused him to confess, it was not exaggerated to say that it had amounted to torture (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 150 \u043e\u0442 15.09.2014 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116 344/ 2014\u00a0\u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, II \u043d. \u043e.).",

Higher fines, coupled with a temporary ban on the right to work as a police officer \u2013 a penalty capable of being imposed under Article 78a \u00a7 4 of the Code \u2013 would have perhaps been acceptable. That state of affairs was due to both the conduct of authorities dealing with the case against the officers and the applicable legislation. The Kazanlak District Court had construed Article 287 of the Code too strictly, finding it only applicable to persons formally charged with a criminal offence or having a formal capacity as a witness, and had failed sufficiently to take into account the intention behind the ill-treatment. The prosecution had not appealed against that court\u2019s judgment. Moreover, Article 287, as currently worded, gave no protection to those who did not fall within the limited categories envisaged by it, for instance persons interrogated by the police before the institution of formal criminal proceedings, whereas Article 131 \u00a7 1 (2), which was of general application, did not provide for adequate penalties.",

However, under Article 19 of the Convention and the principle that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective, the Court has to ensure that a State\u2019s obligation to protect the right of those under its jurisdiction not to be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 is adequately discharged, and that national authorities do not allow such treatment to go unpunished.

This, coupled with the general rule of Bulgarian criminal law that first-time wilful offenders whose acts have left no outstanding pecuniary damage and whose offence is punishable by less than three years\u2019 imprisonment must have their criminal liability waived and replaced by an administrative penalty, ensured that the officers only stood to be punished by administrative fines, possibly coupled with occupational disqualification (see paragraph 42 above).

Nor is it within its province to determine whether the Bulgarian criminal courts were correct to apply Article 78a \u00a7 1 of that Code in the officers\u2019 case, whether they properly fixed the quantum of the fines that they gave the officers in terms of Bulgarian law, or whether they were right to refrain from disqualifying the officers from working in the police under Article\u00a078a \u00a7 4. However, it is competent to examine whether the way in which Bulgarian law was applied in this case gave rise to results at odds with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention. In the event, the officers were given fines amounting to two and a half monthly salaries in the case of Mr N.K. and just below three and a half monthly salaries in the cases of Mr I.K. and Mr T.A. The Court does not overlook that in setting the fines the Bulgarian courts took into consideration a number of mitigating factors, nor the point, recently made by the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Cassation in another case, that general deterrence should not invariably be allowed to trump the mitigating factors in an individual case (see paragraph\u00a039 above). However, in the light of its rulings in similar cases (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 124; Darraj v. France, no. 34588/07, \u00a7 49, 4\u00a0November 2010; Austrianu v.

They did not appropriately reflect the gravity of acts of torture and could not be regarded as having the necessary dissuasive effect on State agents who feel they can abuse the rights of those under their control with impunity.",

The Court is, for its part, not persuaded that this course of action was plainly open to these authorities. It has in the past found, albeit in a different context, that an extensive interpretation of Article 282 to the detriment of a suspect can be in breach of the Convention\u2019s requirement of lawfulness (see Lukanov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 20 March 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, Reports 1997-II). It is true that in a more recent case it criticised the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities for failing to consider whether to bring charges under Article 287 in a clear case of ill-treatment of a suspect in the course of custodial interrogation which had led to confessions later used in the trial against him (see Lenev, cited above, \u00a7 123, as well as Velev v. Bulgaria, no. 43531/08, \u00a7 61, 16\u00a0April 2013). However, in the present case the judge rapporteur at the Kazanlak District Court addressed the applicability of that Article in his reply to the applicant\u2019s request that the case be referred back to the prosecuting authorities, noting that it could not be interpreted as applying to persons who did not have the capacity as accused or witnesses in already instituted criminal proceedings, and that criminal law provisions were to be construed strictly (see paragraph 18 above). It is not for the Court to say whether this was correct in terms of Bulgarian law. However, it does not appear devoid of legal basis (see paragraphs 36 and 38 above). It should be noted in this connection that the national authorities cannot be expected to discharge their positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention by acting in breach of the requirements of its Article 7, one of which is that the criminal law must not be construed extensively to an accused\u2019s detriment (see, among many other authorities, Ba\u015fkaya and Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, \u00a7 36, ECHR 1999-IV; Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, \u00a7\u00a0185, ECHR 2010; and Del R\u00edo Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, \u00a7 78, ECHR\u00a02013).",

Indeed, a similar point was made by the UN Committee against Torture in its General Comment\u00a0No. 2 on the implementation of Article 2 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (see paragraph 46 above). It is for that reason that that Committee, as well as the UN Human Rights Committee, have repeatedly called on Bulgaria to put in place a free-standing offence of torture (see paragraphs\u00a047, 48, 49 and 52 above), and that the Bulgarian authorities, apparently aware of this lacuna in the country\u2019s criminal law, have twice attempted to fill it (see paragraphs 34, 40 and 41 above).",
