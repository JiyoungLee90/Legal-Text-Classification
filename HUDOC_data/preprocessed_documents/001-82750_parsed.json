It held that no persuasive arguments had been adduced to show that Article 417 of the Civil Code could at that time be relied on for the purpose of seeking compensation for excessive length of proceedings or that such action offered reasonable prospects of success (see Skawi\u0144ska v\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a042096/98, 4\u00a0March 2003, and Malasiewicz v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a022072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14 October 2003).
