However, the Supreme Court looked at the applicant\u2019s motives for the offence, which it considered particularly base, and thus carried out an assessment of the applicant\u2019s personality and character. Moreover, what was at stake for the applicant was a possible reduction in sentence. Having regard to the nature of these issues before the Supreme Court, the Court does not consider that the case could have been properly examined without gaining a personal impression of the applicant.
