As to his conviction of 18 August 2001, it was decided by the Youth Court (Jugendgerichtshof) of Vienna, which had been misled by the first applicant as to his identity and age (see paragraph 6 above). In reality, he committed the offence in question as an adult, when he was already 29. Accordingly, it was not a matter of juvenile crime. The offence was not punished very seriously, by just four months\u2019 imprisonment. It was established that the first applicant had been carrying only a small amount of cocaine. Moreover, he was given a suspended sentence. The Court thus finds that this conviction should be seen for what it is.",

He stayed in the country until August 2006, when he was arrested and taken into custody in Germany. On 5 May 2008, after serving his sentence and benefitting from early release, he went back to Switzerland and has been living there to date (see paragraph 12 above). When the Federal Court delivered its judgment, on 8 January 2009, he had thus been in Switzerland for over three and a half years. Today, at the time of the adoption of the present judgment, if the removal order has not been enforced, the total length of his residence in Switzerland will have amounted to seven and a half years, which is a considerable length of time in a person\u2019s life. There does not seem to be any doubt that Switzerland has, for quite a long time, been the centre of the first applicant\u2019s private and family life.",

However, it can been seen, in particular, from the first applicant\u2019s letters of 21 August and 31 December 2012 that he has endeavoured to maintain regular contact with his children. The divorce-related judgment of 27\u00a0September 2012 from the Liestal District Court further shows that custody of the two children was awarded to the mother but that the first applicant was granted access rights, currently limited to one afternoon at least every two weeks. Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicants are entitled to rely on Article 8 of the Convention; moreover, the principal offence was committed by the first applicant after the two children had been conceived; in other words, his wife could not have been aware of it at the time when the family relationship was created, this being a factor of considerable importance in the assessment of the present case. However, as regards the first applicant\u2019s relationship with his new girlfriend and the birth of a child from that relationship, those facts cannot be taken into consideration in the Court\u2019s examination, given that they occurred at a time when his right to stay in Switzerland was already insecure.

By contrast, he was not very well integrated in Switzerland, neither professionally nor socially, and did not speak German very well. It is not for the Court to call into question those allegations, which are not a matter of dispute between the parties. It would simply point out that the Federal Court recognised the efforts made by the applicants to overcome their reliance on benefits and that it did not rule out that the first applicant\u2019s illness (tuberculosis) might have contributed to the fact that he had no real gainful activity.",

In any event, the Court takes the view that it is in the daughters\u2019 best interests to grow up with both parents and, as the latter are now divorced, the only way for regular contact to be maintained between the first applicant and his two children is to authorise him to remain in Switzerland, given that the mother could not be expected to follow him to Nigeria with their two children.",

As to the possibility for the applicants to request a temporary or indefinite suspension of the expulsion measure, a possibility that arose from the said decision (see paragraphs\u00a018\u00a0and 21 above), the Court takes the view that, even if the competent authorities were to grant such a request, the temporary measures could by no means be regarded as replacing the applicants\u2019 right to enjoy their right to live together, which constitutes one of the fundamental aspects of the right to respect for family life (see, mutatis mutandis, Agraw v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a03295/06, \u00a7\u00a051, and Mengesha Kimfe v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a024404/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-72, both of 29\u00a0July 2010).",

Prior to his arrival he had been convicted in Austria of a drugs offence and given a suspended sentence of four months\u2019 imprisonment. After his application for asylum was rejected by the Swiss authorities he left Switzerland at an unknown date, but returned in September 2003 and, shortly afterwards, married a Swiss national with whom he has twin daughters, born the same year. Less than three years later he was detained and convicted in Germany on a serious charge of drug trafficking, for which he was sentenced to three years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. After his release on licence in May 2008 he returned to live in Switzerland with his wife and daughters. He separated from his wife in 2010 and they got divorced in October 2012.",

Thus, the Court has often in the sphere of drug dealing stressed its understanding of the domestic authorities\u2019 firmness as regards those actively involved in the spread of this scourge (see, for instance, Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2008). We also attach importance to the fact that the first applicant arrived in Switzerland as an adult and under a false identity, that his stay in that country prior to his conviction in Germany was relatively short and that he has now lived apart from his Swiss wife for some years. We totally agree with the majority that the fact that he is now living with another woman, with whom he had a daughter in August 2012, cannot be taken into account.",
