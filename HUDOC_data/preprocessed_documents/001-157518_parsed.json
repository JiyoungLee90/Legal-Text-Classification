He also claimed that fourteen out of twenty-seven cheques that he had allegedly issued without having the necessary funds in the companies\u2019 accounts had been issued after 25\u00a0June 2003, while he had been abroad. He also contended that he had issued the cheques and the promissory notes before the companies\u2019 accounts had been frozen and contested other elements of fact considered by the court of appeal in its decision of 23 December 2005, such as the date on which the public procurement contract had been cancelled.

The Convention leaves Contracting States wide discretion as regards the choice of the means implemented to ensure that their legal systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article\u00a06. The Court\u2019s task is to determine whether the result sought by the Convention has been achieved. In particular, the procedural means offered by domestic law and practice must be shown to be effective where a person charged with a criminal offence has neither waived his right to appear and defend himself nor sought to escape trial (see Somogyi v.
