While acknowledging the complexity of the case, the Court nevertheless notes that there had been considerable periods of inactivity in the proceedings, such as the period between the submission of the bill of indictment and the first hearing (see paragraph 7 above). Having examined all the material submitted to it and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that, despite the rather complex nature of the proceedings, in the instant case the length of the proceedings was nevertheless excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.
