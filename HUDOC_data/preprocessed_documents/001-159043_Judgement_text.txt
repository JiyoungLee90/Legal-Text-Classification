The case originated in four applications (nos. 47032/06, 6415/07, 39249/08 and 39251/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants complained inter alia of the quashing of binding and enforceable judgments by way of supervisory review in 2003-2008.
On various dates these complaints were communicated to the respondent Government.
The applicants are pensioners. On various dates they successfully sued the authorities for miscalculating and adjustment of their pensions. The judgments became final.
On various dates the Presidia of Regional Courts or the Supreme Court of Russian Federation allowed the defendant authorities’ applications for supervisory review and quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants’ favour, considering that the lower courts misapplied the material law.
Some of the judgments remained unenforced or partially enforced until the date of their quashing or were enforced with delay.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure from 2003 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
