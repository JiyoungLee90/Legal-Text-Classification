Such a decision had to be confirmed by a panel of three doctors and the patient had the right to challenge the decision in court. However, the vulnerability of persons with alleged mental disorders and the fact that they are under the control of the psychiatric facility personnel, requires clear effective guarantees against arbitrary involuntarily hospitalisation (see, mutatis mutandis, M.S. v. Croatia (no. 2), no. 75450/12, 19 February 2015), especially when, as in the present case, the confinement was initiated by a prosecutor exclusively on the basis of the applicant\u2019s letters to State bodies in the absence of any known complaints about the applicant\u2019s behaviour from other persons. Moreover, in the present case the panel of psychiatrists was composed of four doctors, two of whom were the same doctors who had initially decided to admit the applicant to hospital (see paragraph 13 above). This undermined the guarantees of independence of the health-care professionals, whose decision was the only basis for the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty. With all respect to their professional expertise, the broad powers vested in health-care professionals are to be counterbalanced by procedures aimed at preventing indiscriminate involuntary hospitalisation (see H.L. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 121, and L.M. v.

The applicant stated that he had not received the sum awarded. However, he did not complain of the lengthy non-enforcement of the court decision in his favour, but expressly stated that the examination of his case by the domestic courts had been too lengthy. Although the court proceedings and the enforcement proceedings are stages one and two in the total course of proceedings (see, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 197), given the applicant\u2019s unambiguous complaint about the excessive length of the court proceedings, the Court considers that the total length of the proceedings complained of is therefore six years, four months and twelve days (between 2 October 2001 and 12 February 2008) for examination by the courts at three instances.",

In view of the above, the Court concludes that the State authorities bear the primary responsibility for the excessive length of the proceedings in the present case.",
