Furthermore, the legislation does not impose any terms and conditions to be fulfilled and procedures to be followed. That was confirmed by the Administrative Court (see paragraph 13 above). Similarly, no provision clearly specifies the body that has jurisdiction to decide such a request (unlike a request for a change of a personal name \u2013 see paragraph 28 above). That the respondent State has no regulatory framework regarding legal recognition of gender reassignment was confirmed by relevant international fora (see paragraphs 35 and 61 above) and acknowledged by the Court in its analysis of comparative law (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a032). The same appears to have been acknowledged in the impugned proceedings (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 16 above).",

In this connection the Government maintained that the Act \u2013 in particular section 22(2)  permitted the rectification and modification of entries in the civil status register and vested the Registry with authority to decide on both matters in two different ways: errors could be rectified directly by the Registry and entries could be altered on the basis of a separate decision by a body with the relevant authority, as a prerequisite for the change sought. Since the applicant sought to change the gender that had been assigned at birth and recorded as such in the birth register, it would appear that it fell to be examined under the latter procedure described above. That was the approach applied by the Registry, which refused on two occasions to change the applicant\u2019s sex/gender marker in the birth register from a female to a male one owing to the absence of documentary evidence attesting to his altered sex (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above). However, the Registry did not specify the nature of that evidence, despite it having lodged requests with the relevant authorities for information in this respect (see paragraph 16 above). The Administrative Court referred to that omission in remitting the case for reconsideration (see paragraph 13 above). The Court attaches weight to the fact that the Government did not present any evidence that those issues, including the procedure for obtaining the relevant evidence, were regulated by law or that there was established judicial practice regarding the matter. In so far as it may be inferred from the Government\u2019s submissions that a judicial declaration by the Administrative Court acknowledging the applicant\u2019s new gender identity could be relied upon by the Registry in making the change sought (see paragraph 30 above), it is to be noted that that court did not decide on the applicant\u2019s case on the merits, even though it had examined it on two occasions (see paragraphs 13 and 20 above). Lastly, it is not without relevance that the Registry, in its last decision of 28\u00a0February 2018 \u2013 namely six and a half years after the applicant had initiated the impugned proceedings \u2013 declared that it did not have authority to decide on the applicant\u2019s claim (see paragraph 22 above).",

Among them is the existence and nature of any requirement that a claimant needs to fulfil in order to have the sex/gender marker in the official records changed. As noted in paragraph 67 above, the domestic law does not address that issue. Furthermore, it was not argued \u2013 and the Court was not presented with any evidence \u2013 that there was any (let alone settled) jurisprudence specifying any such requirement. The applicant argued that he had been compelled to undergo complete gender reassignment surgery in order to have the sex/gender marker changed in the birth register. Assuming that the early findings of the administrative authorities may have pointed to such a conclusion, the Court observes that no definitive position was taken on the matter. It is to be noted that the applicant\u2019s claim to be granted a new male sex/gender marker was not finally dismissed, and the impugned proceedings are still pending (see, conversely, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7 64). Accordingly, and having regard to the arguments stated above, any conclusion as to whether the applicant, as a pre-operative transsexual who has undergone partial surgery, will be allowed to have his preferred gender legally recognised would\u00a0veer\u00a0precariously close to speculation.",

Therefore Article 8, as interpreted by the Grand Chamber, is not applicable to the specific claims raised by the applicant. In any event, even assuming that these claims could encompass at least a prima facie obligation of the State to act, the grievances raised under Article 8 should have been declared manifestly ill-founded.",

We also note that the Administrative Court did not have the opportunity to examine the substance of the applicant\u2019s claim. Its judgments had a very limited scope: they quashed the decisions made by the domestic authorities on technical grounds \u2013 first because the applicant\u2019s request had not been in the case file and the decision of the Minister was not properly reasoned and second because the applicant\u2019s file was not forwarded to the Court (see paragraphs 13 and 20). It is true that the Administrative Court\u2019s judgment of 28 February 2013 addressed the issue of the requirements for a sex change, but in any event an erroneous interpretation of the relevant substantive provisions was not the reason for quashing the administrative decision.",

The majority note the lack of domestic case-law on this issue. This only implicitly confirms that the claim of the applicant in respect of the sex marker does not have any legal basis in domestic law. There is no case-law because of the general awareness that potential claims will be rejected as groundless. The two judgments of the Administrative Court cited in paragraph 30 further uphold that the principle that the right to have the new sex registered and the personal code modified is limited to persons who have undergone sex reassignment surgery. In any event, it is not acceptable to find a lack of a \u201cregulatory framework\u201d ensuring a Convention right before a first claim raised by a person concerned has ever been decided on the merits by a final judicial decision.",
