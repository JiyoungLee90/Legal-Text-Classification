Nonetheless, several elements cast doubt on the veracity of the applicants\u2019 claims. The Court observes in the first place that the medical reports dated 1 May 1999 do not indicate any signs of ill-treatment on their bodies. Furthermore, although the applicants were released the day after the incident, they did not submit any further medical reports in support of their complaint or adduce any material which could add probative weight to their allegations. There is therefore nothing in the case file to show that these applicants were injured as alleged during the incident (see Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others v.

However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Salman v.
