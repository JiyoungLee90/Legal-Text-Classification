The rule prescribing night-time sleep was obligatory for each prisoner, including the applicant, who had an opportunity to pray at different times set aside for that purpose by the prison schedule. According to the Government, given the variety of religious beliefs among detainees, it would be highly impractical to draw up tailormade schedules for individuals or to make special exceptions to the general schedule for each group of believers. The Government also submitted that the prison authority could not tolerate the applicant\u2019s conduct. A decision not to institute proceedings against a prisoner for a breach of discipline could result in disobedience among prisoners and lead to an increase in risks to the personal safety of the prisoners and prison staff.",

This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that makes up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, S.A.S. v.

This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article\u00a09 of the Convention, namely to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article\u00a09 \u00a7\u00a01, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one\u2019s belief, alone and in private but also to practise in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Leyla \u015eahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2005XI). Since the manifestation by one person of his or her religious belief may have an impact on others, the drafters of the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of religion in the manner set out in Article 9 \u00a7 2. This second paragraph provides that any limitation placed on a person\u2019s freedom to manifest religion or belief must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set out therein (see Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2013).",
