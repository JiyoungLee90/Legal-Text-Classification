Its reasoning included the following considerations. The applicant had violated sections 25 (on visa requirements) and 47 (1)(b) (according to which the provision with intent or gross negligence of essentially false or manifestly misleading information in a matter falling within the Act is punishable by fines or up to six months\u2019 imprisonment or both), with reference to section 44 (on identity document requirements) of the Immigration Act 1988. She had travelled to Norway four months after having been expelled from  with a two year re-entry ban. In practice, unlawful travel to the country would always be considered a serious breach of the Immigration Act. The Board further noted that the applicant had requested a residence permit by using a false identity and false documents in order to obtain such a permit. The applicant had violated the Immigration Act seriously and repeatedly. In the Board\u2019s view the applicant\u2019s expulsion would not be a disproportionate measure either with regard to the applicant or her closest family members. In this connection the Board had regard to the serious nature of the applicant\u2019s offences and the general preventative interests in expelling her, her personal links to  as compared to her home country as well as her relationship with her children. The latter could not be decisive.",

The system must to a great extent be based on trust that the Immigration Act is complied with by those to whom it applies, including that persons who need a residence permit submit an application and provide correct information to the authorities.

If gross or repeated contraventions of the Immigration Act were to be left without consequences it may undermine respect for the legislation and have an unjust effect on those who abide by the law.

When assessing the weight to be attached to this consideration in expulsion cases, it is of interest that the Immigration Act 2008, which will enter into force from the beginning of next year, contains a provision on proportionality, corresponding to that of section 29(2) of the Immigration Act [1988], which states expressly that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in cases affecting children. In Proposition No. 75 (2006\u20132007) to the Odelsting, the Ministry has stated at page 292 that the proportionality provision is a continuation of the law as currently applicable, but that the addition concerning the best interests of the child is intended to ensure particular awareness of this factor. The majority of the Parliamentary Standing Committee which considered the bill, stressed the need to ensure that sufficient regard be had to the best interests of the child in cases concerning expulsion, and requested the Ministry to consider issuing regulations to ensure that the best interests of the child be safeguarded to an even greater extent in connection with expulsion cases, cf. the Standing Committee\u2019s Recommendation No. 42 (2007\u20132008), point 14.2.",

It had not been until the expiry in March 1998 of the first re-entry ban that the spouses could have resided together in  lawfully. Nor did she dispute that, since the first prohibition on re-entry had been an obstacle to obtaining lawful residence, the residence permits issued to her on the basis of her marriage to a Norwegian citizen from 1996 onwards had been issued on erroneous grounds due to her failure to provide correct information.

In October 1996 she married a Norwegian national and obtained a residence permit having informed the immigration authorities that she had not previously resided in  and had no criminal record. On the basis of her misleading information, she was granted a work permit in January 1997 and a settlement permit in April 2000.

Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State\u2019s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest (see G\u00fcl, cited above, \u00a7 38; and Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, \u00a7 39). Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.; Ajayi and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 27663/95, 22 June 1999; Solomon v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5\u00a0September 2000). Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious (see Jerry Olajide Sarumi v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43279/98, 26\u00a0January 1999; Andrey Sheabashov c. la Lettonie (dec.), no. 50065/99, 22\u00a0May 1999). Where this is the case the removal of the non-national family member would be incompatible with Article 8 only in exceptional circumstances (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali, cited above, \u00a7 68; Mitchell v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24 November 1998, and Ajayi and Others, cited above; Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, ibid.).",

Whilst such offences could normally also lead to criminal liability, it was deemed advantageous in the interest of procedural economy to authorise expulsion even in the absence of a criminal conviction. Since it would be impossible for the authorities to exercise effective control of all immigrants\u2019 entry into and stay in , to a great extent the system would have to be based on trust that the immigration law be respected by those to which it applied, notably the expectation that foreign nationals provide correct information when applying for residence. If serious or repeated violations of the immigration law were to be met with impunity, it would undermine the public\u2019s respect for that law. Since an application for a residence permit would be rejected in the event of failure to meet the conditions for residence, a refusal of such an application would not in itself constitute a sanction for the provision of false information. Therefore, the possibility for the authorities to react with expulsion would constitute an important means of general deterrence against gross or repeated violations of the Immigration Act. In the Court\u2019s view, a scheme of implementation of national immigration law which, as here, is based on administrative sanctions in the form of expulsion does not as such raise an issue of failure to comply with Article 8 of the Convention. Against this background, the applicant\u2019s argument to the effect that the public interest in an expulsion would be preponderant only in instances where the person concerned has been convicted of a criminal offence, be it serious or not, must be rejected (see Darren Omoregie and Others v. , no. 265/07, \u00a7 67, 31 July 2008; Kaya v. the Netherlands (dec.) no 44947/98, 6 November 2001).",

They would have difficulty in understanding the reasons were they to be separated from their mother. Pending her expulsion and the two-year re-entry ban she would probably not return to Norway and it was uncertain whether they would be able to visit her outside . The Court has taken note that, as observed by the Supreme Court\u2019s majority, Mr\u00a0O. stated that, in the event that the applicant were to be expelled, he would facilitate contacts between the children and her, notably during summer and Christmas holidays. According to the Supreme Court\u2019s majority, there was no reason to assume that it would not be possible to maintain contact between the children and the applicant during the expulsion period. Nevertheless, the Court observes that, as a result of the decisions taken in the expulsion case and in the custody case, the children would in all likelihood be separated from their mother practically for two years, a very long period for children of the ages in question. There is no guarantee that at the end of this period the mother would be able to return. Whether their separation would be permanent or temporary is in the realm of speculation. In these circumstances, it could be assumed that the children were vulnerable, as held by the minority of the Supreme Court.",

Reference is made in this context also to Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, according to which the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions taken by public authorities concerning children (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.  [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7 135, ECHR 2010...). The Court is therefore not satisfied that the authorities of the respondent State acted within their margin of appreciation when seeking to strike a fair balance between its public interest in ensuring effective immigration control, on the one hand, and the applicant\u2019s need to be able to remain in Norway in order to maintain her contact with her children in their best interests, on the other hand.",

Within three months of this subterfuge she married (on 11 October 1996) a Norwegian national, and six days later she applied for a residence permit. On the basis of her declaration that she had not previously visited  and that she had no previous criminal convictions, she was granted residence, work and settlement permits. Not only, therefore, had this residence in  from day one been \u201cprecarious\u201d (a term normally applied to non-nationals who are granted permission to remain in a country for a definite period of time) but it had also been tainted by, and based entirely upon, deliberate deception. After separating from her husband, the applicant started co-habiting with Mr O, who, like her, originated from the  and who had a (valid) settlement permit. The couple had two daughters, born in 2002 and 2003. It is against this backdrop that the case unfolds after the Norwegian authorities became aware of the applicant\u2019s true identity, and proceedings were commenced to have her work and other permits revoked.",

The decision of the Directorate of Immigration was reviewed by the Immigration Appeals Board (\u00a7\u00a7 14, 15 and 19), by the Oslo City Court (\u00a7 20), by the Borgarting High Court (\u00a7\u00a7 20 and 21) and by the Supreme Court (\u00a7\u00a7 22 et sequens). At all these levels the domestic courts took into account and examined all the submissions advanced by the parties for and against the deportation order. We find it difficult to understand how and why, given the considerable margin of appreciation given to States in connection with immigration policy, and the fact that the domestic courts are best suited to appreciate the particular local exigencies on the one hand and the actual situation of the persons affected by the authorities\u2019 decision on the other hand, the Court found it necessary in this case to interfere in the final decision of the Supreme Court and go against it. In our view, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on relevant and sufficient reasons and considerations. It is true that the Borgarting High Court quashed the Board\u2019s decision of the 23 February 2007. However it is clear that this is due to the fact that Norwegian law (section 29(2) of the Immigration Act 1988, see \u00a7\u00a026) required a twofold and separate assessment of the proportionality or otherwise of the deportation measure \u2013 one vis-\u00e0-vis the foreign national to be deported, and another vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cthe closest members\u201d of his/her family. This dichotomy is artificial in the light of what must necessarily be a unitary concept of family life in Article 8. In any case, although the Borgarting High Court found that the measure would not be disproportionate as regards the applicant but that it would be disproportionate as regards the children, it nonetheless \u201cassumed that the decision of the 23 February 2007 was not incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention.\u201d (\u00a7 20).",

This in itself is a very serious offence in terms of immigration law. In this case it is difficult to believe that Mr O, being himself a Dominican, was not aware of the applicant\u2019s true identity and therefore unaware that she was in  abusively. But even if, which we do not for a moment believe, he did not know, neither is there anything to indicate that he at least attempted to verify his partner\u2019s situation before he decided to \u201cset up family\u201d with her. For this reason the general principles, namely that an \u201cimportant consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious\u201d and that \u201c[w]here this is the case the removal of the non-national family member would be incompatible with Article 8 only in exceptional circumstances\u201d, apply.",

As already indicated, we do not agree with the majority\u2019s finding that the measure in question -- the applicant\u2019s two year expulsion -- would be disproportionate. Having regard to the respondent State\u2019s margin of appreciation (which we consider must be wider in the context of illegal immigration than it would be in the context of legal immigration or residence), we are of the opinion that the Norwegian Supreme Court\u2019s decision -- based on the rule that where a foreign national had committed a particularly serious criminal offence, the expulsion would be disproportionate only if it would entail an extraordinary burden for the children -- ought to have been respected in the present case. Upon an objective and dispassionate examination of the facts and of the legal principles applicable, we cannot but consider that the expulsion and two-year re-entry ban are neither disproportionate nor do they impose an extraordinary burden on the children. The fact that the applicant\u2019s re-entry ban is limited in time and that she would have the possibility to apply for re-entry is of particular importance in the whole balancing exercise. It is true that one could say that there is no absolute guarantee that the applicant would be allowed to re-enter after the two-year period, but she would have the possibility to seek judicial review of any eventual negative decision, which in effect makes the applicant\u2019s position not hypothetical and theoretical but reasonably certain and definite both procedurally and substantively.",

Now, apart from the fact that with to-day\u2019s means of communication it can be argued that expulsion placed a lesser burden in this respect than would have been the case had a prison sentence been imposed, the domestic courts, during the custody proceedings, had formed a favourable impression of the children\u2019s father as a care person, finding that, of the two parents, he was the one more capable of assuming their care. Moreover, the father had during the custody proceedings undertaken an obligation to facilitate contact between the children and the applicant. Finally, there was nothing to suggest that the children had stronger links to their mother than to their father, or that the father\u2019s ability to assume care would be reduced in the immediate future. In any case, were that to happen, the applicant could apply for a dispensation from the re-entry ban.",
