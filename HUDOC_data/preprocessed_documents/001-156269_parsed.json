Moreover, the Government submitted that the present case concerned organised crime (see paragraph 44 above), which by definition presents more difficulties for the investigating authorities and, later, for the courts in determining the facts and the degree of responsibility of each member of the group. However, the Court notes that the applicant had not been charged with organising a criminal group or participating in organised crime which is further evident from the fact that the investigation in the present case had not been conducted by the Office of the Special Public Prosecutor for Organised Crime (compare Lukovi\u0107 v.
