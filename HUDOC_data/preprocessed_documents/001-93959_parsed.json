In view of the housing situation in , the new law was meant to protect persons occupying premises as their ordinary residence for a certain period of time from being evicted. The law also allowed for the rent to be reviewed as mentioned by the first-instance court.

However, the sum was higher than that payable under other rent laws in force in the country.

This was not so in the present case. A decision by the RRB regarding the rent would be futile if the act of deprivation was found to be null and void. Moreover, it was established by law that the amount of rent the RRB could grant could not exceed MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420). The applicant further submitted that the second remedy proposed by the Government, was not applicable to the present proceedings, according to section 12(3) of the Housing Decontrol Ordinance (see paragraph 24 above). However, even if it were, it appeared from domestic case-law that such proceedings did not generally have prospects of success. The applicant argued that it was for the Government, who were better placed to acquire the relevant information, to prove that any other property owned by a tenant was fit for use as accommodation.

In fact, Act XXIII only limited the already existent protection of tenants to Maltese citizens occupying the premises as their ordinary residence. Moreover, the applicant had inherited an undivided half-share of the premises from his late father in December 1995 and the rest in 1997. Thus, at the time the applicant had acquired possession, the property was already governed by the new law. What he had inherited was the \u201csubdirectum dominium\u201d of the premises, which granted him the right to receive the ground rent previously established. This had also affected the duty on succession, since at the time when he had acquired full ownership on the basis of these conditions the premises as a whole were valued at MTL 13,000. Moreover, he retained ownership of the property, albeit subject to a tenancy in favour of Mr and Mrs P., with limited possibilities of inheritance.

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and\u00a0Others\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098, \u00a7 37; Beyeler v.

In that sphere decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has on many occasions declared that it will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cgeneral\u201d interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 165-166).",

In cases concerning the operation of wide-ranging housing legislation, that assessment may involve not only the conditions of the rent received by individual landlords and the extent of the State\u2019s interference with freedom of contract and contractual relations in the lease market, but also the existence of procedural and other safeguards ensuring that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord\u2019s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable.

However, the Court recalls that this margin is still subject to European supervision and what might have been justified eighteen years ago, the Commission decision having been delivered in 1991, will not necessarily be justified today. As stated by the Government, Act XXIII of 1979 had as its aim to prevent large-scale evictions in the 1950s and 1960s. Thus, in its balancing exercise the Court will have to determine whether such a degree of tenant protection, to the detriment of owners, is still justified fifty years later. It notes that, as stated by the Government, the minimum wage in 2007 was approximately EUR 600 per month, while back in 1974 (the date when  adopted a national minimum wage), it amounted to less than EUR 100 per month.",

It notes that the applicant could not exercise his right of use in terms of physical possession as the house was occupied by the tenants and he could not terminate the lease. Thus, while the applicant remained the owner of the property he was subjected to a forced landlord-tenant relationship for an indefinite period of time. It has already been established that the applicant did not have an effective remedy enabling him to evict the tenants (see, a contrario, Velosa Barreto, cited above), either on the basis of his own need or that of his relatives or on the basis that Mr and Mrs P. were not deserving of such protection, as they owned alternative accommodation. Consequently, the application of the law itself lacked adequate procedural safeguards aimed at achieving a balance between the interests of the tenants and those of the owners. The Court further considers that the possibility of the tenant leaving the premises voluntarily was remote, especially since the tenancy could be inherited. The Government\u2019s contention that transfer of the tenancy by inheritance was improbable was not substantiated and remains to be considered as pure speculation. It follows that these circumstances inevitably left the applicant in uncertainty as to whether he would ever be able to recover his property.",

Moreover, the applicant would not have been subjected to such restrictions and impositions in respect of any such contracts entered into after 1 June 1995, the date on which the law was amended.
