This had restricted him from leaving his place of residence without permission throughout that time. Even though this restriction might have initially been warranted, it does not appear to have ever been reviewed with the passage of time. As to the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant failed to comply on several occasions, it is not based on any evidence other than the investigator\u2019s rulings which were eventually quashed as unfounded (see paragraphs\u00a014, 20 and 25 above). In sum, the length of the restriction on the applicant\u2019s freedom of movement in the present case was excessive and its mere duration is sufficient to conclude that it was disproportionate (see Ivanov v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 95-97, and Nikiforenko v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60).",
