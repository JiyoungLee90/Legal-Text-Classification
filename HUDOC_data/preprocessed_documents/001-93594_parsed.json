In contrast to the views expressed by legal writers, it was the Supreme Court's established caselaw that this time-limit was absolute and, therefore, also binding in a case like the present one where the debtor had not been capable of participating in the proceedings and had not been represented. Consequently, the sale of the applicant's apartment had become final and it was no longer possible to claim the nullity of the proceedings.

Such individuals could not be treated like persons with legal capacity, who were able to defend their interests in underlying civil proceedings and could later appeal against a decision granting enforcement. In the present case, the interests of the applicant in declaring the sale of her apartment null and void had to prevail over the interests of the purchaser and the creditors.

Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2000VIII). The Court notes that the appointment of a guardian under domestic law prevents a person lacking legal capacity from validly entering into contracts or conducting proceedings. Thus it serves, inter alia, to protect the person concerned from disposing of his or her rights or assets to their own disadvantage. In Convention proceedings the need for a person lacking legal capacity to be represented by a guardian is less obvious. In certain circumstances it may therefore be justified to allow a person lacking legal capacity under domestic law to conduct Convention proceedings in his or her own right. Indeed, under Article 34 of the Convention the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. There is no obligation in general, or for persons lacking legal capacity in particular, to be represented at the initial stage of the proceedings.",

She made it sufficiently clear that the apartment at issue had been her place of residence and that she had not only lost her property but had lost her home as a result of the judicial sale and the subsequent eviction (see above, paragraph 21). She even advanced an argument on the lack of proportionality of the interference with her rights on the one hand and the creditors' and purchaser's interests on the other hand. In her application to the Court, although relying on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, she also mentioned not only that she had lost her property but that she had been left without an apartment as a result.",
