In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. In cases concerning the press, it is circumscribed by the interest of a democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press (see, for instance, Dalban v.  [GC], no.\u00a028114/95, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 1999VI). The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Dichand and Others v.\u00a0Austria, no. 29271/95, \u00a7 38, 26 February 2002, with further references).",

The main thrust of the applicants\u2019 criticism was not directed at their private activities but rather at their conduct in professional capacity and the manner in which they discharged the public functions which had been entrusted to them. Moreover, Mr T. and Mr V. were an elected public official and a career politician, respectively, who occupied positions of a certain prominence and visibility.

They confined their analysis to the discussion of the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 reputation without giving any consideration to the applicants\u2019 journalistic freedom or to the plaintiffs\u2019 status as public officials acting in an official capacity. In the Court\u2019s view, the Russian courts did not seem to recognise that the proceedings in the present case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation (see Dyundin v. , no. 37406/03, \u00a7 33, 14\u00a0October 2008). It does not appear that the domestic courts carried out an analysis of whether or not the contested publications sought to make a contribution to a debate on matters of general interest or public concern. The Court reiterates in this respect that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest and that very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions (see Godlevskiy v.\u00a0, no. 14888/03, \u00a7 41, 23 October 2008, Krasulya, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Feldek v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 29032/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2001-VIII).",

The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article\u00a010 (see Lingens v. , 8 July 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 103; Oberschlick v.

The Court has on many occasions pinpointed the structural deficiency of the Russian law on defamation which made no distinction between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to \u201cstatements\u201d (\u201csvedeniya\u201d), and proceeded from the assumption that any such \u201cstatement\u201d was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see Novaya Gazeta v Voronezhe, cited above, \u00a7 52; Andrushko v. , no. 4260/04, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, 14 October 2010; Fedchenko v. , no. 33333/04, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41, 11 February 2010; Dyuldin and Kislov, cited above, \u00a7 47; Karman v.\u00a0, no. 29372/02, \u00a7 38, 14 December 2006; Zakharov v.

The Ivanovo Region courts held that the applicants failed to prove that Mr V. had acted \u201ccynically, loudly, shamelessly\u201d, that he had \u201ccreated nothing, done nothing for [his] fellow townsmen\u201d, that his professional activity as a State official had \u201cbrought nothing but harm\u201d, or that he had lacked \u201cwisdom, will, aspiration to promote unity in society by renouncing, at least temporarily, [his] ambitions and passion for wealth\u201d (see paragraph 16 above). Likewise, in the contemporaneous proceedings instituted by Mr K. (see paragraphs 6-13 above), the District Court insisted on a factual and literal reading of the applicants\u2019 phrase that Mr K. had \u201cdeclared war\u201d on an indebted family and held this sentence to be untrue in the absence of an actual declaration of war (see paragraph 9 above). In the Court\u2019s view, those expressions were examples of value judgments that represented the applicants\u2019 subjective appraisal of the moral dimension of Mr V.\u2019s and Mr K.\u2019s activities. In that sense they were no different from the claim about the governor having no \u201cshame or scruples\u201d, which the Russian courts, in other proceedings, held to be a statement of fact whose veracity the journalist had failed to prove (see Grinberg, cited above, \u00a7 31, and also compare with Krasulya, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042). In their submissions, the Government expressly acknowledged that the courts did not distinguish between value judgments and statements of fact because the then effective law, as interpreted and applied at the material time, did not require them to draw such a distinction (see paragraph 59 above).",

In particular, paragraph\u00a09 of the resolution required the Russian courts to distinguish between statements of fact, on the one hand, and \u201cevaluative judgments, opinions and convictions\u201d, on the other hand, which were to be seen as an expression of the author\u2019s subjective view not actionable in defamation (see paragraph 54 above).

The Court agrees with the domestic courts that those expressions must be considered statements of fact. Noting that the applicants were unable to adduce sufficient evidence in support of those allegations, it sees no reason to disagree with their assessment that the accusations were of such a nature and gravity as to be capable of causing considerable harm to the reputation of Ms S.",

Although the applicants only cited the affair as an illustration of their thesis that the governor cared more about his private life than he did about his official duties \u2013 which could have been taken as a value judgment \u2013 the Court reiterates that even a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10 and that the difference between a value judgment and a statement of fact finally lies in the degree of factual proof which has to be established (see Dyuldin and Kislov, cited above, \u00a7 48, and Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. Austria, no. 39394/98, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2003XI). Although the journalists must be afforded some degree of exaggeration or even provocation, especially when it comes to critical reporting about politicians or public figures, the Court accepts the findings of the Russian courts in this connection and considers that the frivolous and unverified statements about Mr T. private life must be taken to have gone beyond the limits of responsible journalism (compare T\u00f8nsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v.\u00a0Norway, no.\u00a0510/04, \u00a7 92, 1\u00a0March 2007).",

The T. and S. proceedings indicate that its application in practice by Russian courts was not immediately unproblematic. Thus, the domestic courts did not examine whether the statements about the governor Mr T. \u201cbringing discredit upon himself\u201d or turning people into \u201czombies\u201d (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above) or the statements about Ms\u00a0S. \u201chiding her real face from public\u201d and \u201cmaking fun of President Putin\u201d (see paragraph 41 above) could have been value judgments not amenable to proof in civil proceedings. The Court considers that those statements did not contain any factual allegations and were value judgments rather than statements of fact. Moreover, it notes that the applicants did produce in the domestic proceedings some evidence capable of showing that their evaluation of Mr T.\u2019s unimpressive performance in the governor\u2019s position or Ms S.\u2019s incomplete compliance with the disclosure requirements was not unjustified (see paragraphs 32 and 41 above). In these circumstances, the Court finds that the requirement to prove their truth was incompatible with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression which includes possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or provocation.",

These amounts are not significant even by the regional standard of living. Nevertheless, the Court does not consider it decisive that the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature and that the final awards were relatively small. What is important in the instant case is that the domestic courts in all four sets of proceedings \u2013 albeit to a varying degree \u2013 held the applicants responsible for failing to prove the truthfulness of value judgments, that they did not assess the issue whether or not the publications contributed to a debate on a matter of public interest or general concern, and that they failed to recognise the wider limits of permissible criticism in respect of State officials and employees.
