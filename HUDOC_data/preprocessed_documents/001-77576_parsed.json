In 1999 the State budget had provided only 25.4% of the sum requested for prisoners' nutrition requirements, and in 2000 this sum had been reduced to 14.5%, which had resulted in the allocation of UAH 0.38 a day per person for food. The applicant alleged that, at the time of his incarceration, the Kyiv Regional Investigative Isolation Unit no. 1 (SIZO no.\u00a013) had received only UAH\u00a00.08 per day per detainee for expenditure from the State budget and that it accordingly had not been possible to treat the applicant for a disease such as his ulcer whilst in detention.

It notes that it cannot establish with certainty the conditions of the applicant's detention, which occurred some time ago. Nevertheless, it notes at the outset that the Government did not contest the applicant's submissions, so that they can be accepted by the Court as undisputed (see paragraphs 66-69 above). Furthermore, taking into account that the applicant's submissions are consistent, thorough and correspond in general to the inspections of the pre-trial detention centres in Ukraine conducted by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture of the Council of Europe and the Commissioner of Human Rights of the Ukrainian Parliament (see Nevmerzhitsky, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-61 and 66) and the 1999 Report of the State Accounting Chamber \u201con the results of inspecting the budgetary allocations for the maintenance of the State Department for the Execution of Sentences and its facilities and institutions\u201d (see paragraph 69 above), the Court concludes that the applicant was detained in unacceptable conditions, the State failing, inter alia, to provide required nutrition and subsistence expenses for detainees, as envisaged by law (see paragraph 69 above).",

Koval, who had stood bail for him and was co-owner of the sum involved, had not been summoned to take part in the trial or to give evidence on the question of forfeiture, as required by Article 154-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, even though she had been present in court throughout the trial. The applicant maintained that he had never been informed that the issue of the confiscation of bail was on the agenda of the Kyiv City Court on 27\u00a0December 1999 and that he had therefore not had adequate time and facilities to prepare his defence. Moreover, he had not known of his forfeiture of bail until the judgment had been delivered. He alleged that the Supreme Court had failed to review these issues properly. The applicant concluded that the failure of the domestic courts to hear evidence from his wife concerning the forfeiture of bail had led to a serious breach of his defence rights as laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Article 6 of the Convention, read as a whole, guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial. It is the fundamental aspect of the right to a fair trial that criminal proceedings, including the elements of such proceedings which relate to procedure, should be adversarial and that there should be equality of arms between the prosecution and defence (see Rowe and Davis v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028901/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2000-II). In deciding whether there has been a violation of Article 6, the Court must consider whether the proceedings in their entirety, including the appeal proceedings, as well as the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see Edwards v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series\u00a0A no. 247-B, pp. 34-35, \u00a7 34).",

It will therefore consider the complaint under the two provisions taken together (see, among other authorities, Asch v. Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0April 1991, Series A no. 203, \u00a7\u00a025). The Court reiterates that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and, as a rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court's task is to ascertain whether the proceedings considered as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was taken, were fair. All the evidence must normally be produced in the presence of the accused at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. The Court notes in particular that Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03\u00a0(d) of the Convention does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of all or any witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a particular witness, such as the bail surety in this case.",

The initial decision to confiscate bail, given by the investigator of the General Prosecution Service on 19 January 1999, was reviewed on five successive occasions: by the Pechersky District Court on 27\u00a0November 1998; the Presidium of the Kyiv City Court on 30\u00a0November 1998; the Kyiv City Court, when it examined the charges against the applicant on their merits and convicted him on 27 December 1999; the Supreme Court, which heard the applicant's appeal on 27 April 2000; and the Plenary Supreme Court of Ukraine, which on 6 April 2001 found no grounds for changing the initial decision of the court, finding it to have been lawful and substantiated.
