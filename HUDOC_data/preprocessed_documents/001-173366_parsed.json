What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Convention institutions of the notion of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d by applying the Engel criteria have underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law (see Jussila, cited above, \u00a7 43).
