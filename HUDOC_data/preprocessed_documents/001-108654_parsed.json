He argued that, since the crimes imputed to the applicant had taken place in January 2005, in accordance with Article 165-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine (hereafter \u2013 \u201cthe CCP\u201d) the investigating authorities had been under an obligation to seek a judicial order in order to arrest the applicant. In addition, he noted that Article 434 of the CCP allowed the detention of minors only in exceptional circumstances, which were absent in the applicant\u2019s case.",

Having held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and her advocate, the court authorised the measure requested. In its reasoning the court noted that the applicant had been charged with serious offences and had absconded from the investigating authorities, and that this justified her placement on the wanted list. Furthermore, her mother, who had been deprived of her parental rights, was unlikely to be able to ensure that the applicant would appear before the investigating authorities, as she herself had a criminal record and suffered from alcoholism. In addition, the court referred to a report from the staff responsible for the applicant\u2019s welfare at the boarding school where she was officially residing, which stated that the applicant had behavioural problems, including a proneness to run away from the school. In the light of these findings the court concluded that if not detained the applicant might commit another crime or obstruct the investigation. The court\u2019s decision bore no reference to the applicant\u2019s advocate\u2019s complaint about the unlawfulness of her arrest and detention between 19 and 21 April 2005.",

He alleged, in particular, that the District Court had failed to analyse the applicant\u2019s situation from the angle of Article 434 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allowed for the placement of a minor in detention pending trial only on condition that there existed \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. He submitted that in the circumstances of the present case the detention was unwarranted. In particular, the crimes with which the applicant had been charged were not exceptionally serious and the findings that she might abscond, obstruct the investigation or commit another offence were speculative. In particular, no evidence had been presented that during the three months which had passed since the applicant\u2019s alleged offences she had attempted to commit another crime or obstruct the investigation. Moreover, by April 2005 the evidence had been largely collected, which made it improbable that the applicant would obstruct the investigation. As regards the allegation that the applicant had already absconded, which justified her placement on the wanted list, the authorities had presented no evidence that the applicant had ever been subpoenaed to appear for questioning either at her school or at her mother\u2019s address. She had been placed on the wanted list on the day the order to bring her in for questioning had been issued. Eventually she had been arrested at her mother\u2019s address, which was her permanent address and whose location was well known to the police. In the meantime, the applicant\u2019s health and well-being was likely to be seriously endangered by detention in an ordinary pre-trial detention facility, as she was suffering from tuberculosis and had a history of in-patient treatment for psychiatric disturbances. Mr Tokarev also noted that he had not been given a copy of the decision of 21 April 2005 and requested that the applicant be invited to participate in the appeal hearing in person.",

It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2000-III). The expression \u201clawful\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 essentially refers back to national law and lays down an obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. The Court may review whether national law has been observed for the purposes of this Convention provision; however, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Oleksiy Mykhaylovych Zakharkin v. Ukraine, no. 1727/04, \u00a7 84, 24 June 2010). The Court further reiterates that the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary, but not always the decisive element. The Court must, in addition, be satisfied that the detention, during the period under consideration, was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary manner (see Yeloyev v. Ukraine, no. 17283/02, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 6\u00a0November 2008).",

It notes, on the other hand, that according to the police report of 19 April 2005, the legal basis for the applicant\u2019s arrest was Article 115 of the CCP (see paragraph 23 above). This provision does not enumerate the exhaustive grounds for an arrest and refers, instead, to several other CCP provisions, none of them having been cited by the police in the applicant\u2019s case. It is therefore unclear from the report, which of the provisions of the domestic law served as the exact basis for the applicant\u2019s arrest. Furthermore, the report presented the reasons for the applicant\u2019s arrest in a formalistic and standardised way, without explaining why it was necessary in the particular circumstances. Insofar as the applicant raised a complaint about arbitrariness of her arrest with the domestic judicial authorities, it appears that no reasoned decision on the matter has ever been produced. Absent clear indication of the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s arrest and reasons making application of the relevant legal provisions necessary, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s arrest was not free from arbitrariness.",

There was no evidence that she had engaged in any other criminal activities within this period; thus the argument that if left at liberty she would re-offend, relied upon by the District Court, was speculative. Thirdly, the argument that the applicant might abscond was also speculative. There was no evidence that she had ever made any attempt to interfere with the investigation or evade questioning. The applicant had been living with her mother at the time and the police were well aware of that fact. They had never attempted to summon the applicant for questioning in an official manner before placing her on the wanted list. Fourthly, the courts had taken no account of the numerous medical certificates concerning the applicant\u2019s poor health, in particular, that she suffered from tuberculosis and psychiatric disturbances, which could be aggravated by detention in an adult detention facility. She had run away from the school because she had been feeling abandoned and ill-treated. The negative character references provided to the court by those responsible for her care at the school (whose role in the proceedings was supposed to be to defend her interests) indicated that they were much more interested in ridding themselves of a disturbed child than in creating the conditions for her adequate supervision. Treating their references as the cornerstone of the reasoning for detaining her was unfair and arbitrary, particularly given that the investigation had been suspended several days after her detention on account of her state of health and that soon afterwards (on 30 May 2005) she had been released on health grounds on an undertaking not to abscond.",

Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2005-..., with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. Equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order effectively to challenge the lawfulness, in the sense of the Convention, of his client\u2019s detention (Kehayov v.
