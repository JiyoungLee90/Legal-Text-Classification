There is therefore no indication she was in fact clearly offered legal representation for the hearing as opposed to the assistance of a friend/layperson. In addition, given the applicable domestic law and practice (outlined in the Ezeh and Connors judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 59-62), any outline of the legal presentation \u201cpossibilities\u201d, in the event of such an affirmative response from her, would not have indicated with any certainty that such representation would be available. Moreover, any choice would have been put to her at the adjudication hearing itself at which she was unassisted. Furthermore, she would have been required to respond to the Governor who conducted the hearing and who was charged with maintaining prison discipline and was responsible for the pursuit of the charges against her, for determining guilt or innocence and for fixing her sentence. The Court does not consider that, even accepting the Government\u2019s submissions, the circumstances demonstrate that any choice by the applicant as regards legal representation could be considered unambiguous and free. Accordingly, and in so far as such a waiver would be permissible and not run counter to any important public interest, it is not established to have been unequivocal and accompanied by guarantees commensurate to its importance (the Thompson judgment, at \u00a7 44).",

My understanding is that in this exceptional case the authorities failed to handle what was a very specific situation adequately and with the necessary flexibility. The physical and mental particularity of the applicant was evident, established by doctors and known (or at least should have been known) to the prison staff. Under these circumstances, the rigidity in the application of the rules was simply unnecessary.",
