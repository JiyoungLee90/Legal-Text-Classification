The case originated in four applications (nos. 9898/02, 10425/02, 6255/02, and 9863/02) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Moldovan nationals, Ms Sofia Pasteli, Ms Nadejda Cernicov, Mr Pavel Caretchi and Ms Maria Caretchi (“the applicants”), on 24 December 2001, 12 December 2001, 10 January 2002 and 10 January 2002 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr Victor Constantinov, acting on behalf of the “Lawyers for Human Rights”, a non-governmental organisation based in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicants complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that, because of the non-enforcement of the judgments of 25 August 2000, 29 September 2000, 6 December 2000, 25 August 2001 and 25 August 2001, their right to have their civil rights determined by a court had been violated and that they had been unable to enjoy their possessions, and thus their right to protection of property under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention was violated.
The applications were allocated to the Fourth Section. On 4 February 2003 a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.

On 29 July 1994 and on 16 February 1995 the Government and the Parliament passed two decisions according to which the deposits of certain categories of persons at the Savings Bank have to be index-linked. According to the decisions, the Ministry of Finance was supposed to allocate the necessary funds to the Savings Bank. However it failed to do so and the Savings Bank could not carry out the decisions of the Parliament and of the Government.
In 2000 and 2001 the applicants lodged with the Râşcani District Court civil actions against the Ministry of Finance in which they sought compensation.
By judgments of 25 August 2000 and 29 September 2000 the court awarded Ms Sofia Pasteli compensation of MDL 734 and MDL 1,466 respectively. No appeal was lodged and the judgments became final.
By judgment of 6 December 2000 the court awarded Ms Nadejda Cernicov compensation of MDL 4,398. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final.

By judgment of 25 August 2001 the court awarded Ms Maria Careţchi compensation of MDL 5,876. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final.
On unspecified dates the applicants lodged complaints about the non-enforcement of the judgments with the Ministry of Justice and the Enforcement Authority. In its replies, the Ministry of Justice and the Enforcement Authority informed them that the judgments could not be enforced, as no funds had been provided for the enforcement of judgments by the relevant legislation within the annual State budget.
On 22 April 2003, after the cases were communicated to the Government, the judgments were executed by the Ministry of Finance.
