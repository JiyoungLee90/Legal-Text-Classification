On 15\u00a0October 2003 a forensic medical examination revealed that the first applicant had abrasions on his left shoulder, and bruises on both ears and on the back of his thorax, and the third applicant had bruises on his left hip and under his jaw. The expert concluded that those injuries had been sustained the day prior to the examination (see paragraph 7 above). The first applicant was subsequently discovered to have superficial cuts on his left forearm on 21 October 2003 and a cut on his neck on 4\u00a0November 2003; and the third applicant was taken to hospital on 12\u00a0November 2003 and diagnosed with a fracture of the right upper arm, and thorax and spinal cord contusions (see paragraphs 14, 16 and 18 above).",
