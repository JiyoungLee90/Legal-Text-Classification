Despite that, and more than six months later, the enforcement court had nevertheless issued a decision awarding his share in the property to I.M., as if the debt had not been paid (see paragraph 25 above). The domestic courts\u2019 view that even in those circumstances his share in the property had to be awarded to I.M. (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above) was grossly unfair and contrary to the purpose of enforcement proceedings, the aim of which was to satisfy the creditor\u2019s claim, not deprive the debtor of his property. He also found it important to emphasise that his share in the property had not been bought by a third party, but by the enforcement creditor himself, who had acted in bad faith by insisting on the enforcement and sale continuing even after he had paid the debt. He also stressed that the property in question was his only real estate, which included the house he had been born in and had inherited from his father, where he had been living with his wife since retirement. He added that if the partition of ownership occurred in the manner sought by I.M. (see paragraphs 36-40 above), that is by a judicial sale and distribution of the proceeds between the co-owners, he and his wife would be left homeless as they would not have enough money to buy out I.M.\u2019s share in the house.",

They rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that after 2 May 2011, when he had made the last payment, the enforcement court should have discontinued the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 69 above). In their view, the court could not have done so because the applicant\u2019s share in the property had already been sold before that date, on 17 March 2011 when the second public auction had been held (see paragraph 21 above). It was then that the applicant had lost his share in the property and the enforcement had essentially been completed. The decisions rendered later had only represented implementation or \u201ctechnical\u201d rulings, aimed at formally ending the proceedings. The applicant, who had been represented by an advocate throughout the enforcement proceedings, must have been aware of that.

In this connection, they first highlighted that I.M.\u2019s claims against the applicant stemmed from final judicial decisions (see paragraphs\u00a07-9 above) and as such represented possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. It was the State\u2019s obligation under the Convention to make use of all available legal means at its disposal in order to enforce those decisions. In discharging that positive obligation, the State had been faced with disruptive conduct on the part of the applicant, who had done everything to avoid, or at least delay paying the debt as long as possible. That was evident from the fact that he had only commenced settling the debt after the first public auction had been scheduled, that is, three years after the enforcement proceedings had been instituted (see paragraphs 10 and 15-16 above). The Government found it implausible that during those three years the applicant had not had enough means to settle the debt and then, when the enforcement had reached its final stages, and when it had become certain that his share in the property would be sold, he had suddenly paid a large portion of the debt within a few months. Even when he had started settling the debt, the applicant had not respected the self-imposed time-limits, but had spread out the payments so that they had occurred after the enforcement court had already undertaken the next step in the proceedings, closer to the full satisfaction of the creditor\u2019s claim. The crucial proof of this bad faith was that only after his share in the property had been sold had the applicant paid off the debt in full, save for the costs of the proceedings (see paragraphs 21-23 above).",

In particular, the mere fact that the State, through its judicial system, provided a forum for the determination of such a private-law dispute does not give rise to an interference by the State with property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Kucha\u0159 and \u0160tis v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no.\u00a037527/97, 21 October 1998).

The fact remains that, as a result of that decision, the applicant\u2019s share in his only real estate, which was also his home, worth HRK\u00a0131,200, was sold to his creditor for one-third of the market value and only to cover the costs of enforcement proceedings amounting to HRK\u00a010,703.12, that is, for some 8% of the price (see paragraphs 14, 21, 25 and 32 above).

The county court did not refer to the moment when I.M. would legally become the owner, that is when he would have paid the purchase price (on 7 March 2012, as would later be ascertained by the court in its conclusion of 24 April 2012 on the transfer of the property).",

I have no difficulty understanding why the domestic courts came to that finding. Irrespective of the moment when I.M. would legally become the owner of the share in the property, he had bought that share at the auction. From that moment on, he held rights as a buyer of the share, which at the very least generated a legitimate expectation that he would effectively receive that share upon payment of the purchase price.",

Indeed, the procedure as it is set up by the Enforcement Act, leaves ample opportunity to the debtor to settle his or her debt until and up to the second auction, but once the auction has taken place and it has been established that the buyer satisfies the conditions to be awarded the property, the case is over for the debtor. I agree with the Government that in the Croatian system the decisions rendered by the courts after the auction represent only \u201cimplementation or technical rulings, aimed at formally ending the proceedings\u201d (see paragraph 74 of the judgment).",

They refer in this respect to Section 49 read in combination with Section 46 (1) subparagraph 9 of the Enforcement Act (see paragraph 79 of the judgment, referring to paragraph 43). However, as far as I understand the Enforcement Act, Section 49 has nothing to do with the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings.

The applicant argues that the domestic courts should have applied that provision (see paragraph 69 of the judgment). The majority do not discuss this argument. For my part, I note that the county court explicitly held that the fact that the debtor had settled the debt after the second auction was not a ground for discontinuation of the enforcement procedure (see paragraph 27 of the judgment).
