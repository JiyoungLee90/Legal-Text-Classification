In particular, in the complaint against the decision of 21\u00a0February 2005, which was examined by the President of the Novosibirsk Regional Court on 29 May 2006, the grandfather cited the applicant\u2019s diagnosis and the impossibility for him of being detained in the absence of medical advice.

Since the only concrete answer he received to that complaint was through the judgment of 29\u00a0May 2006 when, in essence, he was told that there was no point in complaining any further as the applicant\u2019s detention had already ended, the Court considers that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the six-month period should be calculated from that date, as further complaints to the authorities would have had no prospects of success.

The second set \u2013 the proceedings deciding on the placement of the applicant in the temporary detention centre, conducted in accordance with Chapter 3.1 of the Minors Act \u2013 did not require a pre-investigation inquiry to be conducted and were not limited in scope to information obtained during the inquiry. Thus, the outcome of the first set of proceedings did not, in itself, constitute a decisive ground for initiating the second set of proceedings, as exemplified in the applicant\u2019s case where only the last two inquiries, out of five, had been followed by the second set of proceedings for his placement in the temporary detention centre, and then because it had become obvious that other preventive measures had been unsuccessful. Hence, the Government found no grounds for treating the two sets of proceedings as a single process, as the Chamber had done in its judgment, and argued that the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 6 should be examined separately in respect of each set of proceedings in question.",

In particular, the domestic courts gave as the main reason for the applicant\u2019s placement in the temporary detention centre that he had committed a delinquent act punishable by the Criminal Code. The District Court referred at length to the witness statements made by S. and his mother in its judgment, and relied on those and the pre-investigation inquiry\u2019s findings when making its ruling (see paragraph 27 above). Moreover, both the District Court and the Regional Court found that the placement of the applicant in the temporary detention centre was necessary to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts, which shows that the placement was a direct consequence of the outcome of the pre-investigation inquiry.",

These children were particularly vulnerable to violations of their rights and had additional needs which had to be protected through stringent and effective safeguards. The MDAC referred to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (adopted on 13 December 2006, UNTS 2515 \u2013 \u201cthe CRPD\u201d) and in particular its main object to ensure equality and non-discrimination in all domains (Article 5 \u00a7 2). It further referred to the CRC, emphasising that the best interests of the child should always be a primary consideration and that States Parties undertook to ensure the child such protection and care as was necessary for his or her well-being (Article 3 \u2013 see paragraph 81 above). Moreover, Article\u00a023 of the CRC specifically related to children with disabilities and the MDAC observed that the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its General Comment No.\u00a09 (2006), set out further guidance as to the treatment of children with disabilities in conflict with the law. Thus, the Committee stated that \u201cchildren with disabilities in conflict with the law should not be placed in a regular juvenile detention centre by way of pre-trial detention nor by way of a punishment\u201d (see paragraph 83 above). The MDAC emphasised that the Court had held that States had an obligation to take particular measures to provide effective protection of vulnerable persons from ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (they referred to Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2001-V).",

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is a relative one, depending on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see M.S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24527/08, \u00a7 38, 3 May 2012, and Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001VII).",

The Court reiterates that the mere fact that a detainee is seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical assistance was adequate (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7 116, 29 November 2007). The authorities must also ensure that a comprehensive record is kept concerning the detainee\u2019s state of health and his or her treatment while in detention (see Khudobin, cited above, \u00a7 83), that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate (see Melnik v. Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a7 104-06, 28 March 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115), and that, where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainee\u2019s health problems or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Popov, cited above, \u00a7 211; Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; and Amirov v. Russia, no. 51857/13, \u00a7 93, 27 November 2014). The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Holomiov v. Moldova, no. 30649/05, \u00a7 117, 7 November 2006, and Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 116). Furthermore, medical treatment provided within prison facilities must be appropriate, that is, at a level comparable to that which the State authorities have committed themselves to provide to the population as a whole. Nevertheless, this does not mean that every detainee must be guaranteed the same level of medical treatment that is available in the best health establishments outside prison facilities (see Cara-Damiani v. Italy, no. 2447/05, \u00a7 66, 7 February 2012).",

Russia, no. 46468/06, \u00a7 140, 22 December 2008). When dealing with children, the Court considers that, in line with established international law, the health of juveniles deprived of their liberty shall be safeguarded according to recognised medical standards applicable to juveniles in the wider community (see, for example, Rules 57, 62.2, 62.5, 69.2, and 73 (d) of the 2008 European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions or measures, Article 3 \u00a7 3 of the CRC, and Rules 49-53 of the Havana Rules in paragraphs 79, 81 and 87 above). The authorities should always be guided by the child\u2019s best interests, and the child should be guaranteed proper care and protection. Moreover, if the authorities are considering depriving a child of his or her liberty, a medical assessment should be made of the child\u2019s state of health to determine whether or not he or she can be placed in a juvenile detention centre.",

In assessing evidence, the Court has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Nachova and Others v.

Having regard to the considerations set out above (see paragraphs 142-43 above) concerning the documents submitted by the Government and the lack of any other convincing evidence, the Court finds that the Government have failed to show that the applicant received the medical care required by his condition during his stay at the temporary detention centre where he was kept for thirty days without the right to leave and entirely under the control and responsibility of the staff at the centre. In these circumstances, the authorities were under an obligation to safeguard the applicant\u2019s dignity and well-being, and are responsible under the Convention for the treatment he experienced (see M.S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the applicant has not submitted sufficient prima facie evidence to show whether and, if so, to what extent he suffered from enuresis on admission to the temporary detention centre and whether the personnel at the centre were, or should have been, aware of it. Since most of the medical certificates and files from the temporary detention centre concerning the applicant have been destroyed, it appears difficult to obtain any clarification on this point. On the other hand, the Court has already found it established that the applicant suffered from ADHD.",

In this connection, the Court considers that, in order to avoid gaps in their education, schooling in line with the normal school curriculum should be standard practice for all minors deprived of their liberty and placed under the State\u2019s responsibility, even when they are placed in a temporary detention centre for a limited period of time,. This is also supported by international instruments dealing with the deprivation of liberty of minors (see, for instance, Rules 77, 78.3 and 78.5 of the 2008 European Rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions and measures; Guidelines 21 and 28 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice; Rule 26.2 of the Beijing Rules; and Rule 38 of the Havana Rules. All of these sources are cited above in paragraphs 79, 80, 86 and 87 respectively). Consequently, while the Court accepts that some schooling was provided in the centre, it considers that this does not substantiate the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s placement was \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of educational supervision.

In fact, the Court observes that the purpose of \u201cbehaviour correction\u201d coincides with the aims of criminal punishment found in Article 43 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and in Article 87 \u00a7 2 of the Code for minors between 14 and 18 years of age (see paragraphs 57-58 above).",

They referred to sections 22(2)(4) and 31.1(2) of the Minors Act and to the domestic court rulings of 21 February 2005 and 29 May 2006. In their view, these sources confirmed that the purpose of the applicant\u2019s placement in the temporary detention centre had been to prevent him from committing further offences, by correcting his behaviour, and not to punish him for the latest offence he had committed. Thus, the domestic courts had examined not only the circumstances of the latest offence, but the entire record of the applicant\u2019s anti-social and delinquent behaviour, as well as his living conditions and family situation, and had concluded that he lacked the necessary supervision and that the preventive measures previously put in place had been inadequate. Consequently, the domestic court could not, and had not, established the applicant\u2019s guilt in respect of a crime but had merely assessed the sufficiency of the evidence confirming his commission of an act prohibited by the Criminal Code. This could not amount to a \u201cdetermination of a criminal charge\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. Furthermore, the court hearing of 21 February 2005 had been conducted in accordance with the procedure foreseen by the Minors Act, not by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation had expressly stated that this procedure under the Minors Act constituted a type of civil proceedings (finding of 14 May 2013, no. 690-O).",

The Court\u2019s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a \u2018criminal charge\u2019 within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, in particular, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31, ECHR 2006XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 2003X).",

It has already recognised that States, in the performance of their task as guardians of the public interest, are entitled to create or maintain a distinction between different categories of offences for the purposes of their domestic law and to draw a dividing line between what belongs to the criminal sphere and what does not. By removing certain forms of conduct from the category of criminal offences under domestic law, the law-maker may be able to serve the needs of the proper administration of justice, as well as the interests of the individual, as in the present case for example, by exempting minors under a certain age from criminal liability for their actions according to the level of development of their mental and intellectual capacities. Nevertheless, the legal characterisation of the procedure under national law cannot be the sole criterion of relevance for the applicability of Article 6. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 73; Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, \u00a7 68, Series A no. 80; Ezeh and Connors, cited above, \u00a7 83; and Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, \u00a7 45, 30 May 2006). In view of the above, the fact that the proceedings against the applicant were not classified as criminal under Russian law has only a formal and relative value; the \u2018very nature of the offence is a factor of greater import\u2019 (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a091).",

At the same time, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the criminal charges against the applicant were not pursued on the ground that he had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility. It is, however, not necessary to decide whether, despite the indisputably criminal nature of the imputed offence, the fact that criminal prosecution of the applicant was legally impossible because of his age removed the proceedings against him from the ambit of the criminal limb of Article 6.

The LIGA also stressed that the right to legal assistance, referred to in various international instruments, applied from the very outset of a procedure, including the police questioning stage, involving children and those under the age of criminal responsibility. Since children below the age of criminal responsibility were often subject to very paternalistic proceedings on the grounds that the proceedings were not penal but protective, the traditional procedural safeguards were often not applied. That approach was based on the theory of welfare juvenile justice systems which had emerged in the United States of America and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and had been systematically criticised by a number of scholars for its overall paternalistic approach to children, typically suppressing their procedural rights and treating them as objects of care and discipline.",

The right of a juvenile defendant to effective participation in his criminal trial requires that the authorities deal with him with due regard to his vulnerability and capacities from the first stages of his involvement in a criminal investigation and, in particular, during any questioning by the police. The authorities must take steps to reduce, as far as possible, the child\u2019s feelings of intimidation and inhibition and ensure that he has a broad understanding of the nature of the investigation, of what is at stake for him, including the significance of any penalty which may be imposed as well as of his rights of defence and, in particular, of his right to remain silent (see Martin v.

On no account may a child be deprived of important procedural safeguards solely because the proceedings that may result in his deprivation of liberty are deemed under domestic law to be protective of his interests as a child and juvenile delinquent, rather than penal. Furthermore, particular care must be taken to ensure that the legal classification of a child as a juvenile delinquent does not lead to the focus being shifted to his status as such, while neglecting to examine the specific criminal act of which he has been accused and the need to adduce proof of his guilt in conditions of fairness. Processing a child offender through the criminal-justice system on the sole basis of his status of being a juvenile delinquent, which lacks legal definition, cannot be considered compatible with due process and the principle of legality (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v. France [GC], no.\u00a067335/01, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, ECHR 2006IV, relating to the legal classification of recidivism).

Therefore, the Court has held that the particular vulnerability of the accused at the initial stages of police questioning can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. Indeed, this right presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. It is further important to protect the accused against coercion on the part of the authorities and contribute to the prevention of miscarriage of justice and ensure equality of arms. Accordingly, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as soon as a suspect is questioned by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction \u2013 whatever its justification \u2013 must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced where incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used to secure a conviction (see Panovits, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-66, and Salduz v.

He was thus well below the age of criminal responsibility set by the Criminal Code (fourteen years) for the crime that he was accused of, namely, extortion. In view of this, he was in need of special treatment and protection by the authorities, and it is clear from a variety of international sources (see, for instance, Council of Europe Recommendations No. R (87) 20 and Rec(2003)20; Guidelines 1, 2, and 28 to 30 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice; Article\u00a040 of the CRC, and General Comment No. 10, point 33; and Rule\u00a07.1. of the Beijing Rules, all cited above in paragraphs 77, 78, 80, 82, 84 and 86 respectively) that any measures against him should have been based on his best interests and that, from the time of his apprehension by the police, he should have been guaranteed at least the same legal rights and safeguards as those provided to adults. Moreover, the fact that the applicant suffered from ADHD, a mental and neurobehavioural disorder (see paragraph 12 above), made him particularly vulnerable and thus he required special protection (see Guideline 27 of the Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice, and Article 23 of the CRC, and General Comment No. 9, points 73-74, all cited above in paragraphs 80 and 82-83 respectively).",

The written statement signed by his grandfather on the same day could, as claimed by the applicant, have been signed later, after the applicant had been questioned by the police officer, and thus does not prove his presence during the questioning.

In this regard, the Court emphasises that the confession statement, made in the absence of a lawyer, was not only used against the applicant in the proceedings to place him in the temporary detention centre but actually formed the basis, in combination with the witness statements of S. and his mother, for the domestic courts\u2019 finding that his actions contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion, thus providing the ground for his placement in the centre.",

At the hearing, the applicant, his grandfather and court-appointed counsel were present, as were a prosecutor and the officer from the Juveniles Inspectorate who had ruled on 12 January 2005 not to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant.

The Court reiterates that the applicant had retracted the confession and had claimed that it had been obtained under duress. Moreover, as found above, the applicant did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during the questioning at the police station, which irremediably affected his defence rights. Furthermore, the grandfather also claimed that the applicant had been at a doctor\u2019s surgery earlier on the relevant day. However, the Court observes that neither S. nor his mother was called to the hearing to give evidence and provide the applicant with an opportunity to cross-examine them, despite the fact that their testimonies were of decisive importance to the pre-investigation inquiry\u2019s conclusion that the applicant had committed a delinquent act, namely, extortion.",

Moreover, in view of the fact that the applicant had retracted his confession, the Court considers that it was important for the fairness of the proceedings that S. and his mother be heard.

In fact, no efforts were made by the authorities to secure the appearance of S. and his mother in court, even though the Minors Act does provide for the possibility of hearing witnesses, as acknowledged by the Government.

Instead, the Minors Act was applicable to the applicant. This Act provided for significantly restricted procedural safeguards (see paragraph 68 above) since it was intended as protective legislation for minors. According to the Court, and as also noted by the LIGA in its submission (see paragraph 192 above), this is where, as illustrated by the present case, the legislature\u2019s intention to protect children and ensure their care and treatment comes into conflict with reality and the principles set out in paragraph 196 above, since the child is deprived of his liberty without having the procedural rights to defend himself properly against the imposition of such a harsh measure.",

As is clear from the relevant international materials before the Court (see paragraphs 77-89 above), this has been established in many international documents. It has also been emphasised by the third-party interveners. Thus, the Court is convinced that adequate procedural safeguards must be in place to protect the best interests and well-being of the child, certainly when his or her liberty is at stake. To find otherwise would be to put children at a clear disadvantage compared with adults in the same situation. In this connection, children with disabilities may require additional safeguards to ensure that they are sufficiently protected. The Court would point out that this does not mean, however, that children should be exposed to a fully fledged criminal trial; their rights should be secured in an adapted and age-appropriate setting in line with international standards, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child.",

It is true that the applicant\u2019s delinquent conduct as a minor was the basis for the request to place him in a temporary detention centre for juveniles, but that cannot, in and of itself, be a relevant argument for finding Article 6 applicable to the proceedings leading up to that detention. It is very often, although not exclusively, the case that measures taken by member States to deprive persons temporarily of their liberty, as permitted under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, are based on those persons having acted in a manner that may be socially disruptive or criminal in nature.

His placement in the juvenile detention centre was based only on the provisions of the Minors Act to further the public interest in preventing further instances of his possible destructive behaviour. We emphasise here that section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act, which was the sole legal basis for the detention order, explicitly states that detention for up to thirty days is permitted when a minor has committed \u201ca delinquent act before reaching the statutory age of criminal responsibility\u201d, inter alia, for the purpose of protecting \u201chis life or health or to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts\u201d. The provision makes no mention of the need to assess whether the delinquent act in question corresponds to the objective elements of a criminal act. Consequently, although we agree with the majority that there was a factual link between the two proceedings as to the underlying events that triggered the pre-investigation inquiry, on the one hand, and the placement proceedings, on the other, and thus it was justified on that basis to reject the Government\u2019s objection as to the admissibility of the Article 6 complaint for the purposes of the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 116-19 of the present judgment), we firmly disagree that there was a close link between the two proceedings as a matter of domestic law justifying the conclusion that the placement proceedings fall under the criminal limb of Article 6.",

In no way does it suggest that every measure under domestic law in the form of temporary deprivation of liberty, thus falling in principle under Article 5 of the Convention, is to be presumed to be criminal and thus to engage the full fair-trial guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention, which can only be rebutted \u201cexceptionally, and only if those deprivations of liberty [cannot] be considered \u2018appreciably detrimental\u2019 given their nature, duration or manner of execution\u201d (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, \u00a7 126).

                        "content": "16.\u00a0\u00a0The detention was for a period of thirty days and took place in a juvenile detention centre. It goes without saying that any form of deprivation of liberty within a State institution is a difficult and troubling experience for the individual upon whom such a measure is imposed. Thus, no one doubts that detention on remand under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), detention in a mental institution under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e), or indeed the temporary detention of a foreigner, such as an asylum-seeker, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), usually takes place in institutions or centres that may necessarily impose a \u201cquasi-penitentiary regime\u201d and a system of disciplinary measures. The case-law of this Court is rife with such examples. However, the fact that a deprivation of liberty under Article 5 has these inherent characteristics cannot justify the conclusion that the detention imposed contains \u201cpunitive elements\u201d, unless that label applies to all detention measures under Article\u00a05, thus automatically triggering the applicability of Article 6 whenever they are imposed. It is the legal basis and purpose of the detention that is crucial in the assessment under the Engel criteria and not the physical placement of the individual in a detention centre as in the present case. If a person is liable to be incarcerated in a prison or a penal institution for punitive, retributory purposes following a conviction for a criminal act, that detention falls under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention and cannot be imposed unless the person in question has had a fair trial in conformity with Article 6. That principle does not however apply, in our view, to other detention measures which do not, directly or indirectly, have punitive purposes, as is the case when minors, mentally unstable individuals or foreigners are detained to further other legitimate public interests as well as, in some cases, the personal interests of the detainee, in particular children. In sum, and in the light of the above arguments, we cannot agree with the majority that the detention of the applicant contained \u201cpunitive elements\u201d within the meaning of the third Engel criterion for the Article 6 applicability analysis.",

Article 5 \u00a7 4, however, is a far more suitable vehicle for providing a minor with sufficient procedural protections to challenge the lawfulness of a measure in the form of temporary detention and, moreover, better conforms to the structure and interrelationship between Articles 5 and 6 (see Ichin and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 28189/04 and 28192/04, \u00a7 43, 21 December 2010). Importantly, the application of Article 5 \u00a7 4 is also in greater harmony with the nature and purpose of a child-friendly system of juvenile justice as recently developed in relevant international instruments, as we will now explain.",

As the applicant\u2019s statement confessing to the act in question during that stage, which he later retracted and alleged had been taken under duress, was adduced as evidence in the placement proceedings, it is clear that in the review of lawfulness under Article 5 \u00a7 4 the lack of legal assistance during that stage was highly prejudicial to the applicant in his quest to challenge the legality of the detention measure under section 22(2)(4) of the Minors Act.",

That is the material and very problematic difference between applying the fundamentally adversarial fair-trial provision of Article 6, as the majority do, in cases of this nature, and not, as we suggest, Article 5 \u00a7 4 which is specially formulated to take account of the inherent features of the particular type of review of lawfulness of detention that is involved in a particular case. Thus, in detention proceedings where a request is made to temporarily detain a minor to protect his life or health and/or to further certain public interests, it is certainly incumbent on the court to act proprio motu to secure the introduction of all relevant evidence so as to give the minor and his legal counsel a real and effective opportunity to challenge the probative value of such evidence. Therefore, in our view, the majority\u2019s reasoning on this issue at paragraph 214, requiring that the domestic court in the present case should have acted of its own motion within the context of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), does not sit well with the existing case-law on this provision.
