He described the house in question and stated that the applicant lived on the first floor and his parents on the ground floor. He submitted that sometimes he would pick up the drugs from V.V.

He said that he had known D.N. very well and that he had been present when V.V. had given him 10 or sometimes 30 grams of cocaine. V.V. had told him that D.N. had not actually been paying for the cocaine. Instead, D.N. had promised to give the applicant his flat in Zagreb. I.G. furthermore submitted that in 2006 he had stopped communicating with the applicant and V.V. and had stopped using cocaine. He had ended his relations with the applicant because he had learned that the applicant had reported him to the police for possessing 20 grams of heroin. He had been angry with the applicant for betraying him, so several days after the police had found heroin in his flat he had slapped the applicant and jumped on his car and damaged it. He lastly submitted that in 1988 he had undergone a five-day psychiatric treatment.

He would give the money to the person from whom he would pick up the drugs. He submitted that he had sold his flat in Zagreb to the applicant\u2019s sister, and his land in Hvar to the applicant.

He retracted the part of his statement concerning his buying cocaine from the applicant. He submitted that after he had been brought to the police station he had been physically and psychologically ill-treated and had been coerced into giving such a statement to the investigating judge. He explained that once he had been brought to the police station he had immediately confessed being an intermediary in the selling of amphetamines. However, when the police had started questioning him about the applicant and the cocaine, he had asked for a lawyer. Police officer L.D. had told him that D.H., the lawyer, had arrived at the entrance of the police station but had not been allowed to come in. Goran Kova\u010devi\u0107 then apologised to the applicant, stating that it was because of the false statement that he had given to the investigating judge that the applicant had ended up in pre-trial detention.",

Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.\u00a0Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2001\u2011II, and Sievert v.

Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR\u00a02000\u2011XII); to overcome that presumption, the Court must have a stronger evidence of personal bias than a series of procedural decisions unfavourable to the defence (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v.

The stronger and weightier the arguments advanced by the defence, the closer must be the scrutiny and the more convincing must be the reasoning of the domestic courts if they refuse a defence\u2019s request for the examination of a witness (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 164-66).",
