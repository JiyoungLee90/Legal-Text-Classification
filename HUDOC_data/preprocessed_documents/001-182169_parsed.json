For the Supreme Court, the statement was another unnecessarily pompous statement by Judge A.K. which was not in itself proof of his lack of impartiality. It also noted that the defence had not reacted to this statement by requesting that he be removed from the case. Likewise, before the start of the trial the defence had not raised the issue of any of the members of the trial bench possibly having a negative attitude towards the second applicant.

The law on limitation periods set the time-limits within which a criminal court could exercise its competence to classify a given act as an offence and impose the related penalty. The introduction of limitation periods was thus inextricably linked to the adjudication of an offence and the criminal sanction for its commission. The Constitutional Court held that the provisions of the 2005 Amendment, while extending limitation periods, did not change the grounds of criminal liability for specific acts carrying a penalty, but modified the temporal limits of that liability which had to be taken into account by the court examining the case.",

However, they could not expect to benefit from any particular criminal policy of the State, since depending on the nature of the threats linked to particular offences, that policy could be subject to modification. The Constitutional Court underlined that a defendant could not argue that the extension of a limitation period adversely affected his situation, since an offender could not foresee that a limitation period would be modified (referring to its judgment of 25 May 2004). It also noted that the change to a limitation period did not have an effect on the criminalisation of a given act or the penalty that could be imposed. Rules setting out limitation periods did not provide any guarantees for the perpetrator of an offence, but were established for the sake of punishment. The retroactive extension of a limitation period could be assessed in the light of the rule of law; however, it was not related to a violation of vested rights or the protection of citizens\u2019 trust in the State in respect of criminal legislation.",

The domestic courts, having analysed extensively the statement in the context in which it was made, found that it did not indicate a lack of impartiality (see paragraphs 64 and 74 above). Secondly, the applicants objected to certain passages in the trial court\u2019s reasoning. One such passage concerned the issue of the alleged financing of political parties by the FOZZ (see paragraph 30 above). The other passage was related to the important but unknown role played by the second applicant in the functioning of the FOZZ (see paragraph 31 above). With regard to the first passage, the trial court itself held that the issue was irrelevant for the determination of the case. The Court of Appeal found that the second applicant had not substantiated how that passage, recounting the evidence of some witnesses, could show that Judge A.K had had a negative attitude towards him. With regard to the second passage, the Court of Appeal criticised the trial court for characterising the second applicant\u2019s role as such without factual grounds for doing so. However, it noted that the assertion concerned hypothetical behaviour of the second applicant and was unrelated to the charges against him. Having analysed the statements complained about by the applicants in the context in which they were made, the Court finds that they could not be considered indicative of Judge A.K.\u2019s personal prejudice or bias.",

It noted that the flaw had not resulted in a trial bench with a composition unknown in the law or a judge being assigned who had not been authorised to hear a case in a regional court. The Supreme Court further noted that the lack of impartiality of a judge would have to manifest itself in restrictions on the procedural rights of a party, improper gathering of evidence or the imposition an unjust sentence.

Even assuming that he participated in the parliamentary debate in an advisory capacity \u2013 which, in any event, has not been established \u2013 he did not carry out both advisory and judicial functions in the same case.

The situation obtaining in the applicants\u2019 case was somewhat similar to the case of Pabla Ky v.

It found that the provision had not been violated \u201csince it could not be interpreted as prohibiting an extension of limitation periods through the immediate application of a procedural law where the relevant offences have never become subject to limitation\u201d (\u00a7 149). In the judgment, the Court classified the rules on limitation periods as procedural laws. It later confirmed that it was reasonable for domestic courts to apply the tempus regit actum principle with regard to procedural laws (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, \u00a7 110, 17 September 2009). The rules on limitation periods did not define the offences or corresponding penalties and could be construed as merely laying down a prior condition for the examination of a case (see Previti v. Italy (dec.) no. 1845/08). In that sense, the rules on limitation periods had no bearing on the exercise of the right to a fair hearing.",

Nevertheless, this is, in principle, an appropriate, and often the most appropriate, way of putting an end to the violation and affording redress for its effects (ibid., \u00a7 52). More specifically, where an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation. However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order for it to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the Court\u2019s judgment in that case, and with due regard to the Court\u2019s case-law (ibid., \u00a7 50).",

Having regard to the nature of its finding and the reasons underlying it (see paragraphs 138-142 above), the Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, it is not for this Court but for the domestic courts to decide whether a reopening of the criminal proceedings is necessary or not to give effect to the present judgment (compare Henryk\u00a0Urban and Ryszard Urban v.
