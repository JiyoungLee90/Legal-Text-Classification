Furthermore, the investigation has been resumed by the prosecuting authorities themselves a number of times due to the need to take additional investigative measures. However, they still failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations properly. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative steps that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.

The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities\u2019 conduct (see Orhan, cited above, no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a0358, and Imakayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0164).",
