However, they testified about a number of other circumstances in relation to the charges, for example similarities in the way the trees had been cut down on the first applicant\u2019s land and on that of the injured party, traces of the transport of trees, the fact that the first applicant had regularly sold wood and that he had also cut down unmarked trees on his own land. One of the witnesses also testified that he had seen the first applicant and another person, B.K., transporting trees over the injured party\u2019s land. Another witness, the injured party\u2019s husband, testified that B.K. had indirectly confirmed his involvement in cutting down the trees in question. B.K., however, stated that he believed that he had only cut down marked trees on the first applicant\u2019s land. The court also appointed an expert, who estimated that the value of the allegedly stolen wood amounted to 2,028 euros (EUR).",

In respect of the first charge, the second applicant maintained that he had mistakenly thought that he had been cutting down trees on his own land, whose borders had been shown to him by the former owners, F.H. and J.H., who also appeared as witnesses in the proceedings. The husband of the injured party, M.P., stated that they had found out about the stolen wood six months after the event and that neighbours had told them that the second applicant had been seen in the forest at the time, while another person, I.T., had been seen transporting the wood. He also testified that the second applicant had admitted to him that he had cut down the trees, thinking that they had belonged to his land but that they had failed to agree on how much the second applicant should pay M.P. in compensation. I.T. stated that he had helped the second applicant transport the wood and that he had been told by him that the land belonged to him, which I.T. had found suspicious. Another witness, S.P., stated that he had helped I.T. load the truck with the wood. As to the second charge, the second applicant argued that he had had an agreement with the injured party in that case, F.B., that he could cut down trees in exchange for wine. The judge questioned the injured party, who denied the existence of such an agreement. The court also appointed an expert, who estimated that the value of the beech and hornbeam trees cut down amounted to EUR 457 and that of the acacia trees at EUR 440.",

In her reasoning, the judge relied on the records of the hearings, the transcript of the inspection of the location and other documents in the file. The judge did not believe the applicant\u2019s version of events and dismissed B.K.\u2019s statements as biased because he had been working for the first applicant. She also found his testimony to be in contradiction with some of the other witness statements. The court relied heavily on the finding that while B.K. had cut down the trees professionally on the applicant\u2019s land, witness testimony showed that certain trees had been cut down in an unprofessional manner on both the applicant\u2019s and the injured party\u2019s land, and that the first applicant and B.K. had been seen transporting trees over the injured party\u2019s land.",

In particular, the judge considered the statements of two witnesses, F.H. and J.H., to be unpersuasive. On the other hand, the judge relied on the statements of the injured party and her husband, supported by other evidence, for example, the expert\u2019s opinion, the statements of the witnesses S.P. and I.T and the copy of the land register map showing that M.P.\u2019s land did not border on the second applicant\u2019s. As to the second charge, the court relied predominantly on the statement of the injured party, F.B., who denied that he had had an agreement with the second applicant. Other evidence, such as the expert\u2019s opinion and photographs, confirmed that F.B. was indeed the owner of the land and indicated the number of trees that had been cut down.",

The higher court emphasised that the impugned judgments had been based on facts established in adversarial proceedings and on evidence given at hearings which the applicants had been able to challenge by presenting their own versions of the events at issue. The first-instance judgments had been given orally by Judge A.K. who had presided over both applicants\u2019 hearings, had questioned the applicants and heard the witnesses. Moreover, the written grounds had disclosed on what evidence the judges providing them had relied and how they had assessed the reliability of the applicants\u2019 statements. In the higher court\u2019s opinion, the written grounds had been clear and reasonable. As regards the first applicant, the higher court reassessed the evidence, including the witness statements, and came to the same conclusion as the first-instance court. As to the second applicant, the higher court noted that the first-instance court had truthfully and accurately established all the relevant facts of the case, and that it had been proven that the second applicant had intended to commit the second offence.",

As a rule, the written grounds of a judgment were given by the judge who had conducted the trial and pronounced the verdict. However, in certain situations, such as when a judge was absent for a long time or died, the law had to be interpreted as permitting another judge to give the written grounds. In such cases, the judge who wrote the judgment based it on logical reasoning and the evidence in the file. The Supreme Court found that while the principle of immediacy required that a verdict should be given by the judge who had participated in the trial, the act of writing a judgment, was not, strictly speaking, part of the trial. Moreover, if the written grounds for a judgment were not convincing, a defendant had a better chance of succeeding with his or her appeal. Having regard to those considerations, the Supreme Court took the view that the applicants\u2019 rights of defence had not been violated.",

All the evidence in the present case had been presented at the main hearing, which had been presided over by A.K. The latter had pronounced her verdict and had given brief reasons for it orally, as required by the procedural law (see paragraph 22 above.)

A judge asked to draft the written grounds in such exceptional circumstances based them on documents, including the records of hearings, and not on a direct assessment of witnesses\u2019 credibility.

However, it cannot agree with that assertion. It reiterates that although the grounds for the decision are indeed relevant in that they make it possible for the accused to exercise usefully the right of appeal (see Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, no.\u00a012945/87, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 252), that is to make full and proper use of that right, they are also important in a more general sense in that they ensure the proper administration of justice and prevent arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Lhermitte v. Belgium [GC], no. 34238/09, \u00a7 67, 29 November 2016). In particular, the Court notes that a judge\u2019s awareness that he or she has to justify his or her decision on objective grounds provides one of the safeguards against arbitrariness. The duty to give reasons also contributes to the confidence of the public and the accused in the decision reached (see, mutatis mutandis, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2010, and Lhermitte, cited above, \u00a7 67) and allows for possible bias on the part of the judge to be discerned (see, for instance, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 130-133, ECHR 2005XIII), and remedied by, for instance, a rehearing before another judge or judges.",

By contrast, Judge A.K.\u2019s verdict was not based on documents only. In particular, Judge A.K. heard the applicants during the trial, examined a number of witnesses and must have formed an opinion as to their credibility. She must also have made an assessment of the elements of the alleged offences, including the subjective element, namely the applicants\u2019 intention to commit them, for which the direct hearing of the applicants was particularly relevant (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above, and Cutean v.

It should therefore in principle have been possible to take measures either for her to finish the applicants\u2019 cases alone or to involve another judge at an early stage in the proceedings. Moreover, it notes that the case was not a particularly complex one and that the applicants gave notice of their intention to appeal as soon as the verdict was pronounced (see paragraph 12 above). That means that Judge A.K. was immediately aware that she would have to provide written grounds. The Court therefore cannot agree with the Government that there were good reasons to depart from the procedure to which the accused were entitled under domestic law. Furthermore, it is particularly striking that despite a statutory time-limit of thirty days, the written grounds were not provided for about three years after the pronouncement of the verdicts, during which time the case files were lost and had to be reconstituted (see paragraphs 13 and 23 above). Those factors raise further concerns about the way the applicants\u2019 cases were handled by the domestic courts.",

However, it notes, first, that it follows from the considerations in the above paragraph that no such factors arose in the present case. Secondly, even if they had arisen, the only way to compensate for Judge A.K.\u2019s inability to produce reasons justifying the applicants\u2019 conviction would have been to order a retrial, by, for instance, the second-instance court remitting the cases to the first-instance court for a new hearing (see paragraph 26 above). The reason for that is because when Judge A.K. retired the verdicts had already been pronounced and the applicants\u2019 statements and witness testimony constituted relevant evidence for them (see paragraphs 40 to 43 above).",
