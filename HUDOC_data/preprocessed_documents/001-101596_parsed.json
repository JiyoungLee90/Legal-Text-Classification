The Government stressed that there exists an effective judicial practice of tort actions in the  by which detainees are able to obtain compensation for damage resulting from their detention in unsatisfactory conditions.

Moreover, in the case of Nazarov v.\u00a0 (no. 13591/05, \u00a7 77, 26 November 2009) the Court has dealt with the Government's argument on the basis of the reference to the award made by the Russian courts in favour of a Mr D. The Court noted that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant's detention had apparently been of a structural nature, for which no effective domestic remedy had been shown to exist, and that the case to which the Government had referred did not concern detention in overcrowded cells but rather a detainee's infection with scabies. The Court finds no reason to depart from its previous findings in the present case. Accordingly, it dismisses the Government's objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

At the same time they did not refer to any original source of information on the basis of which their assertion could be verified. In this connection the Court notes that on several previous occasions when the Government have failed to submit original records it has held that documents prepared after a considerable period of time cannot be viewed as sufficiently reliable, given the length of time that has elapsed (see, among recent authorities, Novinskiy v. Russia, no. 11982/02, \u00a7 105, 10 February 2009, and Shilbergs v. Russia, no. 20075/03, \u00a7 91, 7 December 2009).

It also did not contain any indication as to the method of the calculation of the authorised period of the applicant's detention (see paragraph 8 above).

In these circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that in the absence of any indication that on 11 April 2003 the Town Court had erred in application of the domestic law and had incorrectly calculated the two-month period by failing to include the three days of the applicant's detention in April 2003, it was not until 8 June 2003, when, as the parties confirmed, the two-month period of the detention had expired and no further detention order had been issued, that the applicant had learnt about the alleged violation of his right. It is therefore not surprising that he only raised his grievances before the domestic courts for the first time in June 2003, while arguing against a further extension of his detention.

This means that the competent court has to examine \u201cnot only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in domestic law but also the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention\u201d. A court examining the lawfulness of detention must provide guarantees of a judicial procedure. The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person. Equality of arms is not ensured if counsel is denied access to those documents in the investigation file which are essential in order effectively to challenge the lawfulness of his client's detention (see Nikolova v.

Having acknowledged that the scope of the obligation under Article 5 \u00a7 4 is not identical in all circumstances or for every kind of deprivation of liberty, the Court has already held on a number of occasions that it is the nature of the proceedings and the capabilities of an applicant which determine whether legal representation is required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention in an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure (see Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, \u00a7 59, 10 December 2002, and Bouamar v. Belgium, 29 February 1988, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 129, with further references). For instance, in the case of Bouamar (cited above) the Court found it to be essential that a lawyer be present at the hearing where the applicant, a juvenile, had been remanded in custody in prison, otherwise an essential safeguard would be denied. The same findings were made by the Court in the case of Megyeri v. Germany (12 May 1992, Series A no. 237A), concerning a person detained on the ground of mental illness, and the case of Sanchez-Reisse v. Switzerland (21 October 1986, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 107) pertaining to the detention of a foreigner unfamiliar with the State's legal system. In addition, in the case of Woukam Moudefo v.

That risk was formulated by the prosecutor and the court in general terms and its existence was inferred from the nature and gravity of the charges and the assessment of the applicant's character and personal situation (his employment status and sources of income). Given that the hearing did not involve any discussion of complex legal or factual issues, the Court is satisfied that the applicant's presence was sufficient to ensure that the proceedings were adversarial and the principle of equality of arms was respected. The applicant did not argue that he had been unable to effectively follow the proceedings or to respond to the prosecution's arguments. The same issues had been previously discussed on two other occasions in the applicant's and his counsel's presence and the applicant had had an opportunity to familiarise himself with the position of the prosecution and the arguments advanced by his lawyer in favour of his release.
