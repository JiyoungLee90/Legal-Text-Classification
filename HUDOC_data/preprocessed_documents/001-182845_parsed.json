However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Jalloh v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2006IX). Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a034, Series\u00a0A no. 336, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 87, ECHR 1999V). Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of individuals within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the version of events given by the victim. In the absence of such an explanation, the Court can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the Government. That is justified by the fact that those in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them (Bouyid v. Belgium ([GC], no.\u00a023380/09, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2015).",

His confession was recorded by the police in the form of a \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d, allegedly given voluntarily after he had reported himself to the police station, whereas in reality he had been taken there by police officers after the search. The Court has previously found that obtaining a voluntary \u201cstatement of surrender and confession\u201d from a de facto suspect without a lawyer needing to be present is a violation of the suspect\u2019s right to legal assistance, and the use of such a statement as evidence renders a trial unfair (see Turbylev v.

The records of those statements have not been submitted to the Court and it remains unclear whether they were collected during an interview by officers from the ORB police unit, as on 8\u00a0June 2004 (see paragraph 70 above). However, given the nature of those statements under domestic law, that is to say a voluntary confession to a crime collected by a law-enforcement official without a lawyer needing to be present (ibid.), the fact that, after pleading his innocence when officially questioned as a suspect and accused in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant made such confession statements at IK-14 in the absence of his lawyer and outside of an official interview with the investigator adds credibility to his account of events.",
