A limitation may be prescribed, inter alia, to prevent the terrorist indoctrination of individuals and/or groups who are easily influenced, the aim of the indoctrination being to make them act and think in a particular manner. The Court thus accepts that certain forms of identification with a terrorist organisation, and especially apologia for such an organisation, may be regarded as a manifestation of support for terrorism and an incitement to violence and hatred. Similarly, the Court accepts that to disseminate messages praising the perpetrator of an attack, to denigrate the victims of an attack, to raise money for terrorist organisations, or to engage in other similar conduct, may constitute acts of incitement to terrorist violence (see Yavuz and Yaylal\u0131 v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 12606/11, \u00a7 51, 17 December 2013).",

It is for that reason that we voted under operative paragraph\u00a06 for the award of just satisfaction to the applicants. However, we are of the opinion that the Court should have examined the applicants\u2019 complaints \u2013\u00a0primarily\u00a0\u2013 under Article\u00a011 of the Convention and not, as it did, under Article\u00a09.",

Thus, in most of the relevant cases, the Court has taken the view that the facts relied upon by the applicant fell more specifically within the scope of Article 11 and it has therefore examined the complaints only under that provision (see, for example, Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7\u00a0125, ECHR 1999-III, and Sidiropoulos and Others v.\u00a0Greece, 10 July 1998, \u00a7\u00a052, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; as an exception, see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a030985/96, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2000XI). In the case of Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a041340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2003II), for example, the Grand Chamber analysed the dissolution of a political party in Turkey under Article 11 and took the view that it was not necessary to examine separately the allegation of a violation of Articles 9, 10, 14, 17 and 18 of the Convention because the complaints in question concerned the same facts as those considered under Article\u00a011 (see also Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP) v. Turkey [GC], no. 23885/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR\u00a01999VIII). That case-law was developed by the former European Commission of Human Rights, which stated, for example, in the case of Rai, Allmond and \u201cNegotiate Now\u201d v. the United Kingdom (no. 25522/94, 6\u00a0April 1995, Decisions and Reports 8I-B, p. 151): \u201cThe problems of freedom of thought and belief and freedom of expression cannot in this case be separated from that of freedom of assembly. The Commission therefore considers that Article 11 takes precedence as the lex specialis for assemblies and will in its examination under this provision have regard to Articles 9 and 10 in interpreting Article 11\u201d. We do not see any reason for the Court to depart from that approach in the present case.",

It was held in memory of members of the PKK who had been killed by the security forces. It is not in fact apparent from the case file whether or not an imam or a hoca, who would normally be present at such a ceremony, took part in the mevl\u00fbt. Whilst the exact number of participants in the mevl\u00fbt has not been made known, the public prosecutor brought criminal proceedings against seventeen individuals, including the applicants. Furthermore, the political dimension of the service can also be seen from the following speech, given by the DTP\u2019s regional representative at the ceremony:",

Russia, nos. 76836/01 and 32782/03, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2009).",
