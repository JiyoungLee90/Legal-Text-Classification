The applicant further raised his allegation of illtreatment on 27 June 2000 during the first hearing of the case against him (see paragraph 12 above). The national authorities however failed to initiate an investigation into the applicant\u2019s claim that he had been coerced by the police into signing his statements and his allegations of illtreatment despite the fact that under Article 153 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time, a public prosecutor who had been informed of a situation that gave rise to a suspicion that an offence had been committed was obliged to investigate the facts by conducting the inquiries necessary to identify the perpetrators (see \u0130lhan v.

While the applicant may be considered to have been in a vulnerable position as a prisoner and his inactivity may be deemed understandable up until 11 October 2004, the date on which he was released pending trial, from that date onwards he could and should have contacted the national authorities with a view to seeking information about the outcome of his complaints and lodged a formal complaint with the prosecuting authorities had he learned that there had been no investigation. What is more, in his appeal filed with the Court of Cassation on 24 June 2009, the applicant did not pursue his allegations of ill-treatment. The Court therefore finds that the applicant failed to comply with the obligation of diligence to take steps to inform himself whether an investigation had been initiated into his allegations of ill-treatment and, if so, to keep track of it.",

In the Court\u2019s view, the judicial authorities\u2019 failure to fulfil their obligation to investigate must have become apparent to the applicant by 13\u00a0February 2008 at the latest, the date the Diyarbak\u0131r Assize Court rendered its judgment in the case against him (see Baytap v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a017579/05, 29 April 2010).",

The Court further observes that at that stage the applicant had not based his petition on any new information or new evidence. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, he should have known that his petition to the public prosecutor\u2019s office would not give rise to an effective investigation and that the one initiated was doomed to failure. The Court considers as a result that the petition the applicant lodged on 25\u00a0October 2010 did not warrant the interruption of the initial six-month period or revive the national authorities\u2019 procedural obligation to investigate his allegations of ill-treatment (see Manukyan v. Georgia (dec.), no.\u00a053073/07, 9\u00a0October 2012; and Akhvlediani and Others v.

Turkey no.\u00a044021/07, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 13 March 2012, where the Court dismissed the Government\u2019s objection regarding the six-month time-limit, noting that the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment had been examined on their merits by the prosecuting authorities although the applicant had waited for more than seven years before lodging a separate complaint).
