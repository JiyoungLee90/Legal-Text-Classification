However, the district court\u2019s decision to reject the defence lawyer\u2019s request to have access to all the material submitted to the court by the prosecutor was based on the grounds that such disclosure of that information might undermine the success of investigation. For the Government, this was clearly understandable, given the complexity of the criminal case and the high level of conspiracy between the suspects charged with the crime of contract killing in the context of the activities of one of the biggest criminal gangs that ever operated in Lithuania. It was not unlikely that revealing factual data concerning the pre-trial investigation material, such as the testimonies of key prosecution witnesses, would not only have undermined but would most probably have ruined the pre-trial investigation.",

Moreover, pressure had later been exerted upon G.B.\u2019s family members, who had received phone calls from unknown men, and a funeral wreath had been laid at the door of a cafe owned by G.B.\u2019s wife (see paragraphs 27 and\u00a032 above). That being so, the Government expressed their concern that the desire of the defence to be granted full access to the pre-trial investigation file, including the evidence incriminating the applicant, might actually have been based not solely upon procedural but quite probably on other interests. Taking into consideration the above, one can only conclude that the disclosure of the information requested by the defence lawyer could have resulted in the total collapse of the pre-trial investigation.",

When submitting an appeal on 13 June 2005 against the initial decision to place his client in detention, the defence lawyer had invoked arguments alleging an insufficiency of incriminating evidence and had challenged the credibility of G.B.\u2019s testimony (see paragraph 28 above). Those defence arguments were duly reviewed and dismissed by the Vilnius Regional Court on 27 June 2005 and also later, when the courts extended the term of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention (see paragraphs 29, 31 and 33 above).

On the contrary, according to the Government\u2019s understanding of the Vilnius District Court\u2019s decision of 26\u00a0May 2005, the main procedural grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention were the facts that the applicant was suspected of having organised a very serious crime endangering the life of another person and that he could be sentenced to life imprisonment. The applicant\u2019s argument that this search \u2012 which represented the main reason for his detention \u2012 lacked a legal basis since he never had been in hiding, was accordingly irrelevant. This was also supported by the conclusion of the Attorney General, who held that the main grounds for holding the applicant in detention were the gravity of the crime and the possible life sentence, as well as the applicant\u2019s connections abroad (see paragraph 43 above).",

In the Court\u2019s view, it is hardly possible for an accused to challenge the reliability of such an account properly without being made aware of at least some concrete evidence on which the charges are based.

Accordingly, it is safe to assume that both the documentation relating to G.B.\u2019s testimony and the documents forming the basis for the search had been duly submitted by the prosecutor to the Vilnius Second District Court, which, for its part, concluded that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the crime in question on the basis of the contents of the criminal investigation file.",

However, while the prosecutor and the district court were familiar with the contents, their precise nature had not at that stage been brought to the applicant\u2019s or his counsel\u2019s attention. As a consequence, neither of them were able to inspect anything in the file to have an opportunity to adequately challenge the findings referred to by the prosecutor and the district court, in particular by questioning the reliability and conclusiveness of the statements made by G.B., who had a previous conviction for the murder of R.G. At this juncture the Court observes that the testimony given by G.B. was later twice considered inconsistent, not credible and contradictory by the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 36 and 39 above). In this context the Court reiterates that the appraisal of the need for a remand in custody and the subsequent assessment of guilt are too closely linked for access to documents to be refused in the former case when the law requires it in the latter case (see Lamy, cited above, \u00a7 29). Furthermore, even though it is not for the Court to resolve the question of whether G.B. acted in complicity with the prosecutor and testified against the applicant in order to improve his situation, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the Court of Appeal\u2019s observation that the prosecutor\u2019s and G.B.\u2019s request for mitigation of G.B.\u2019s sentence was not in accordance with the law (see paragraph 36 above).",

In this connection the Court cannot reasonably see how the evidential material relating to that search, if divulged to the defence during the court hearing, would have obstructed the pre-trial investigation. Indeed, as noted by the applicant, it was only later, when the merits of his case were being decided, that the Court of Appeal established that documents such as the summons and the search file itself had never in fact existed (see paragraph 40 above) \u2013 circumstances which the applicant was potentially prevented from pointing out to the court which had sanctioned his detention. Indeed, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal, the search for the applicant, and the European Arrest Warrant had constituted one of the main grounds for ordering his pre-trial detention and subsequently prolonging it (see paragraph 41 above). Given that the Government have not proved that the requisite access to search materials was indeed made available to the applicant, the burden of proof in this connection being incumbent on the Government (see X.Y. v. Hungary, no.\u00a043888/08, \u00a7 52, 19 March 2013), the Court thus finds that this was another measure of procedural justice which the applicant was denied.",

That notwithstanding, it considers that that ground was merely consequential to the fact that it was the applicant who was suspected of having put out the contract on R.G. As the Court has already concluded above, at the time when the matter of his detention was being decided by the Vilnius City Second District Court, no concrete elements connecting the applicant to that murder had been shown to the defence counsel, which would have enabled him to subject it to cross-examination to test the strength of the prosecutor\u2019s case.",
