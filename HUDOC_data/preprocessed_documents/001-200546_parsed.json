It established that the accident had happened in an unfinished school building that had been the municipal property of the Tolyatti mayor\u2019s office since 1997. The right of economic control (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) of that building had been transferred to a municipal enterprise, Invest-Proyekt, in 2007 for the purposes of the completion of the construction work. No construction work had been carried out since the transfer of the unfinished building \u2013 the state of completion of which was assessed at 54% \u2013 to Invest-Proyekt. Nor had any construction work been undertaken earlier, from the time of the transfer of the unfinished building to the municipal property in 1997. The Tolyatti mayor\u2019s office had denied any responsibility for the building and had argued at a hearing before the District Court that in the absence of ongoing construction work there had been no need for any protective measures. The District Court rejected those arguments, concluding that \u2013 under the Town Planning Code of the Russian Federation \u2013 during the period that the construction work had been on hold it had been the mayor\u2019s office, as owner of the unfinished building, that had been responsible for taking all measures necessary to exclude threats to people\u2019s life and health. However, as had been established by the wording of the decision of 6 July 2009 not to institute criminal proceedings, the construction site had not been entirely closed off and had been freely accessible from one side of the school. The building had had no windows or doors. The Tolyatti mayor\u2019s office had failed to undertake, in line with the relevant regulations, any protection measures in respect of the unfinished building.",

The District Court held that there had been a cause-and-effect connection between the failure of the mayor\u2019s office\u2019s to act \u2013 notably its failure to undertake measures to restrict access to the unfinished building \u2013 and the damage to the applicant\u2019s health.\u00a0While Invest-Proyekt had also been responsible for the accident in so far as it had failed to obtain the necessary permits for construction work, it had been the responsibility of the mayor\u2019s office to exercise control over it, which it had not done. In so far as the mayor\u2019s office blamed the previous owner (from which it had received the unfinished building in the state in which it had been at the time of the accident), the mayor\u2019s office had been free to demand that the previous owner undertake protection measures for the \u201cconservation\u201d of the unfinished building, or to refuse to receive it without such measures being first put in place.",

The court also took into account (i) the applicant\u2019s own negligence \u2013 that is to say his entering a dangerous place and not exercising caution despite a warning from a friend about the hole in the floor, and (ii) the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s failure to exercise parental responsibility \u2013 given that she should have exercised more control over her minor son\u2019s activities, his visits to the construction site (of which she had been aware before the accident) and given her failure to prevent his visit to the construction site on the day of the accident (which had occurred at the weekend).

On 9\u00a0December 2010 the Samara Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal. It agreed with the first-instance court that those responsible for providing compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage were the mayor\u2019s office, as the owner of an unfinished building that was a source of increased danger (\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438), and Invest-Proyekt, which had the right of economic control over the building. Their failure to act had led to the applicant suffering serious bodily harm and disability. The first-instance court had rightly ordered the mayor\u2019s office, which had been responsible for exercising control over its property, to pay the larger part of the compensation. From the time of the transfer of the unfinished building to the municipal property in 1997 no construction work had been undertaken. Nevertheless, protection measures for the \u201cconservation\u201d of the unfinished building, such as fencing and guarding the unfinished building, had not been undertaken.

The applicant had been in a place dangerous for children\u2019s games and sporting activities. His friend had warned him about the danger. He should have been able to understand the possible negative consequences of his imprudent behaviour. The Government furthermore stated that the applicant\u2019s mother should have exercised more control over him and should have prevented his visiting an unfinished construction site. The Government argued that the Court should not act as a fourth-instance court, and that Article 2 should not be interpreted as guaranteeing a person an absolute level of safety within the context of any activity that could pose a danger to that person\u2019s right to life \u2013 including when such a person exposed himself or herself to unreasonable danger and should therefore bear a certain degree of responsibility for any ensuing accident.",

This substantive positive obligation entails a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life.

Furthermore, she cannot be required to lodge a court appeal against the refusal to institute criminal proceedings of 6 July 2009, as the Government seem to suggest.

It should also be noted that the responsibility to carry out an initial investigation (aimed at securing evidence and eliminating or minimising any risk of omissions that might later undermine the possibility of establishing liability and of holding to account the person(s) responsible) lay with the authorities and could not be left to the initiative of the victim or his or her next-of-kin (see paragraph 34 above).",

It was established in the civil proceedings (and not disputed between the parties) that the Tolyatti mayor\u2019s office, as owner of the unfinished building, had been responsible under the domestic law \u2013 for as long as the construction work had been on hold \u2013 for taking measures aimed at protecting people\u2019s life and health, in particular by closing off the unfinished building; it was also established that there had been a causeandeffect connection between its failure to do so and the applicant\u2019s sustaining grave bodily harm and disability. The civil courts found that the mayor\u2019s office had disregarded its duty for a long period of time \u2013 since the transfer to it in 1997 of the unfinished building \u2013 until the applicant\u2019s accident in 2008, despite the particular danger it had created for children, given its close proximity to the local school. The unfinished building (the state of completion of which at the time of its transfer to the municipal property in 1997 had been assessed at 54%) (i) had had no windows or doors, (ii) had presented such dangers as a heap of bricks and a hole between floors (iii) had not been guarded (iv) and had been readily accessible from the side of the school. Accordingly, the Tolyatti mayor\u2019s office was held accountable for its failure to take safety measures, which had resulted in 2008 in applicant\u2019s grave injury and disability. InvestProyekt was held accountable in so far as it had failed to obtain construction permits. However, the domestic courts acknowledged the failure of the mayor\u2019s office to exercise control over InvestProyekt, and emphasised the primary responsibility of the mayor\u2019s office for the applicant\u2019s accident.",

The circumstances of each case were different, which creates a certain difficulty in identifying and applying general principles.\u00a0In two cases (T\u0103nase and Zinatullin) the criminal proceedings were discontinued on the grounds that not all the elements of an offence had been established, but the Court assessed those circumstances differently.",

In the T\u0103nase case the investigators concluded that the applicant\u2019s car was moving at high speed and that the injuries were caused mainly by the applicant himself. In other words, the applicant created the substantive risk. In the present case the owner of the building did not comply with safety rules and left the construction site freely accessible, creating the substantive risk of potential injuries. The fall was caused by the partial destruction of the unfinished building and the absence of barriers therein to prevent the fall. Thus, the behaviour of the child and his mother (they allegedly did not take care to avoid an accident) was not a decisive (sufficient) element for establishing a causal link and not a convincing reason for the national courts to discontinue criminal proceedings.",
