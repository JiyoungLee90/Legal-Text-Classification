The merchant ship suddenly changed course and began to steer a course that was dangerous both for the frigate and for members of the armed forces who had boarded a speedboat. While the Winner refused to answer the attempts of the commander of the frigate to establish radio contact, its crew jettisoned a number of packages into the sea; one of the packages, containing about 100 kilos of cocaine, was recovered by the French seamen. After several warnings and warning shots fired under orders from France\u2019s maritime prefect for the Atlantic went unheeded, the French frigate fired a shot directly at the Winner. The merchant ship then answered by radio and agreed to stop. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team used their weapons to open certain locked doors. When a crew member of the Winner refused to obey their commands, a \u201cwarning shot\u201d was fired at the ground, but the bullet ricocheted and the crew member was wounded.

In addition to the fact that the Winner did not fit into any of those categories, it noted that the Law of 15 July 1994 had been amended, inter alia, so that it no longer referred only to States Parties to the Vienna Convention. It also considered that the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of and compliance with the legal provisions concerned was based on a contradiction, as they had submitted that at the time of the interception the Winner had been flying no flag, while at the same time asserting that the French authorities had previously sought confirmation from the Cambodian authorities that the ship was registered in their country and that the ship had been identified as the Winner before the operations commenced.",

Strictly speaking, this consisted solely in stopping the ship at sea or on arrival in port to make certain verifications (concerning its identity and its nationality, for example): it did not extend to searches or arrests on board the ship. Yet that was what had happened in this case: the applicants had been arrested and confined to their cabins for thirteen days. Their detention on board the Winner and their judgment in another country had not been authorised by Cambodia. The applicants thus challenged the existence of any ad hoc agreement justifying the stopping of the Winner and considered that even if there had been such an agreement, it did not justify the detention of the crew following the French military operation.",

First of all, the Convention was completely silent about maritime matters and the Government argued that it was possible to draw a parallel with the solution adopted by the Court in cases concerning the handing over of persons by one State to another in the context of extradition (see \u00d6calan v.

When the Winner was spotted off Cape Verde on 13 June 2002, the frigate issued several warnings and fired warning shots, before firing directly at the merchant ship, under orders from France\u2019s maritime prefect for the Atlantic. When they boarded the Winner, the French commando team were obliged to use their weapons to defend themselves, and subsequently kept the crew members under their exclusive guard and confined them to their cabins during the journey to France, where they arrived on 26 June 2002. The rerouting of the Winner to France, by a decision of the French authorities, was made possible by sending a tug out of Brest harbour to tow the ship back to the French port, escorted by another warship, the frigate Commandant Bouan, all under orders from the maritime prefect and at the request of the Brest public prosecutor.",

It is an undisputed fact that the meeting of the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le H\u00e9naff and the Winner owed nothing to chance. The Winner was under the observation of the American, Spanish and Greek drug control agencies when the Central Office Against Illegal Drug Trafficking (\u201cthe OCRTIS\u201d), which suspected it of transporting a large quantity of drugs for the European market, requested authorisation to intercept it. The ship\u2019s nationality being known in fact as early as 7 June 2002, the French embassy requested Cambodia\u2019s consent to the French authorities\u2019 intervention; that agreement was given in a diplomatic note of 7 June 2002 and the Ministry of Defence in Paris was immediately informed. Thus, by 7 June 2002 at the latest the Winner had been precisely identified as a ship flying the Cambodian flag, as expressly stated in the diplomatic note sent by the Cambodian authorities. As to the frigate Lieutenant de vaisseau Le H\u00e9naff, it had been at anchor in Brest harbour, and had already been assigned another mission off the African coast when, instead, it was specially instructed to set sail immediately to intercept the Winner. In order to carry out this clearly defined mission it took on board a French navy special forces team specialised in boarding vessels at sea, as well as three experts from the OCRTIS.",

The circumstances of the case do not support such an assertion.

The fact remains that when a flag State, like Cambodia in this case, is not a party to the Montego Bay or Vienna Conventions, the insufficiency of such legal instruments, for want of regional or bilateral initiatives, is of no real consequence. In fact, such initiatives are not always supported by the States in spite of the fact that they afford the possibility of acting within a clearly defined legal framework. In any event, for States that are not parties to the Montego Bay and Vienna Conventions one solution might be to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements, like the San Jos\u00e9 Agreement of 2003, with other States. Having regard to the gravity and enormity of the problem posed by illegal drug trafficking, developments in public international law which embraced the principle that all States have jurisdiction as an exception to the law of the flag State would be a significant step in the fight against illegal trade in narcotics.

They maintained that the purely formal criterion relied on by the Government was ineffective in the light of the functional criterion developed by the Court in its case-law, as confirmed in the Chamber judgment. Thus, unlike the Spanish authorities in the Rigopoulos case, where the deprivation of liberty had been decided by the Central Investigating Court, an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, by means of a promptly issued, duly reasoned detention order, the French authorities had made no attempt to regularise the applicants\u2019 situation. Yet their ship was not an \u201carea outside the law\u201d, especially considering that an investigating judge could have been contacted by radio, and the crew could have been informed of their rights and allowed to contact a lawyer and alert a family member. In addition to the resulting alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the applicants, referring to the partially dissenting opinion expressed by three of the Chamber judges, pointed out that they had had to wait another two or three days to be brought before the liberties and detention judge.",

It would not be logical, however, to interpret this note so narrowly as to exclude the possibility for the French authorities to take control of the ship and its crew were the inspection to reveal (as it did) the presence of a consignment of drugs. A less literal interpretation was not only confirmed by Cambodia in an explanatory note in 2008 \u2013 which there is no reason to believe was mendacious or spurious \u2013 but it also seems to be the most reasonable in our opinion, in the context of cooperation between States in the fight against drug trafficking.

It may be too soon to affirm that new principles of customary international law exist in the field of international drug trafficking (see paragraph 85 of the judgment). But all civilised nations clearly agree that drug trafficking is a scourge, that States must work together to combat it, and that offenders must be arrested and punished, at least where the applicable domestic law so provides, which is evidently the case here. Cambodia\u2019s diplomatic note reflects this will to cooperate and to take legal action against a ship flying its flag but sailing a long way from its coastline (off Cape Verde).",

But an exchange of diplomatic notes is usually confidential, and must be so if it is to be effective in circumstances such as those in the present case. Nor can foreseeability be appraised in the ordinary manner. The attitude of the Winner (described in paragraph 13), shows that the crew, or at least their leaders, knew the risks they were running in view of the cargo they were carrying: the ship was flying no flag; it suddenly changed course and began steering a course that was dangerous for the French vessel and armed forces; attempts to contact it by radio received no reply; a number of packages were thrown overboard, one of which was recovered and found to contain about 100 kilos of cocaine; and finally, the resistance put up by the crew obliged the French forces to use their weapons. In such conditions, how is it possible to say that the interception, boarding and inspection of the Winner, and the confinement of the crew to their quarters, were unforeseeable?",

Cambodia was not party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (\u201cthe Montego Bay Convention\u201d) and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (\u201cthe Vienna Convention\u201d); but that did not prevent it from concluding, as it did, a bilateral agreement with France, as acknowledged in paragraphs 97 and 98 of the judgment. That being so, and bearing in mind that under domestic law the offences of which the applicants were suspected were punishable offences, and that it was not in dispute that the applicants were punished in the proper legal manner, is it necessary to apply the same criteria of \u201clawfulness\u201d to the legal basis provided by the diplomatic note as are applied in much less exceptional situations? We think not. We believe that the deprivation of liberty imposed on the applicants was not arbitrary, which is, of course, what Article 5 requires above all (see, for example, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24\u00a0October 1979, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 33, among many other authorities). We believe that the requirement of legal certainty, which was decisive in the finding reached in the judgment (see, by analogy, Baranowski v. Poland, no.\u00a028358/95, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2000-III) was, in the circumstances, construed too narrowly. Lastly, is it necessary to point out that although the Winner \u2013 with the agreement of the flag State \u2013 was undeniably within the jurisdiction of France for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention, that is no reason to draw conclusions that stretch logic? When there is sufficient concurring evidence to suspect that a ship on the high seas, thousands of miles from the State thus authorised to board it, is engaged in international trafficking to which all countries want to put a stop, it is without a doubt legitimate not to place as narrow an interpretation on the legal basis as one would inside the territory of the State concerned.",

In that case, the Spanish customs authorities, in the context of an international drug trafficking investigation, intercepted on the high seas a vessel flying the Panamanian flag and its crew was detained for as long as it took to escort the vessel to a Spanish port. In our view, however, the facts in Rigopoulos are entirely distinguishable from those of the instant case. Most significantly, in Rigopoulos, there was an independent Central Investigating Court and not a public prosecutor supervising the proceedings on board the ship on the day of interception. The very next day its crew members were informed of their situation and advised of their rights. Within two days the court had ordered the crew to be remanded in custody. On the following day they were apprised of that decision and invited to name the persons they wanted to have informed of their detention. This information was communicated to the respective embassies of the States of which the crew members were nationals. Three days after the boarding, the independent investigating court issued an order regularising the crew\u2019s situation in accordance with the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure. One week after the interception, the applicant had access to the services of a lawyer. Finally, it must be noted that the lawfulness of the detention with regard to Article 5 \u00a7 1 was never in issue in the Rigopoulos case.",
