Yet in the present case the criminal courts had exonerated the second applicant, the publishing director of Radio , of all responsibility for the first bulletin, broadcast live on France Info; the applicants' convictions had been based on the later bulletins only. In doing so the courts had made a reasonable interpretation of the concept of \u201cprior fixing\u201d, adapting the case-law to the changing situation, through reasoning which was purely teleological and devoid of any analogy. The Government further submitted that the text of section 93-3 of the 1982 Act made no distinction between live broadcasts and pre-recorded programmes. It followed that the domestic courts had not extended the normal scope of that provision to cover a situation not provided for in the legislation. Parliament had deliberately used the concept of \u201cprior fixing\u201d rather than that of \u201cprior recording\u201d, the former being broader than the latter. The word \u201cfixation\u201d in the French language referred to \u201cwhat is determined in advance\u201d, which could therefore be checked.

In the Court's opinion, the facts of the present case fall halfway between recording and live broadcasting. On the one hand, the offending statement was not recorded; on the other, in view of the way France Info operated, it was intended to be repeated live-to-air at regular intervals. As there had been no \u201cprior fixing\u201d, the criminal courts absolved the publishing director of all responsibility in respect of the first of the bulletins broadcast on France Info; on the other hand, they held that that first broadcast had constituted a \u201cprior fixing\u201d of the statement's content as regards subsequent broadcasts. They therefore ruled that from the second broadcast onwards the publishing director could be considered to have been placed in a position to check its content beforehand.

On this last point, the Government admitted that by section 35 of the 1881 Act defendants could not seek to establish proof of the truth of the defamatory statement where, as in the present case, the events concerned had taken place more than ten years before. However, they could plead good faith, which was a valid defence. The second and third applicants had indeed put forward that defence in the criminal courts, and the fact that their arguments were not accepted did not mean that proof of good faith was impossible. It was also open to defendants to plead compliance with a statutory requirement (l'ordre de la loi) or necessity (force majeure), both defences under ordinary law.

Firstly, it came into play only with regard to the offences defined in Chapter IV of the 1881 Act, concerning the offences of defamation and insult. Secondly, the legal responsibility of each defendant was determined in strict proportion to the part he or she had actually played, with a legal distinction being drawn according to whether or not the content of the information had been fixed prior to its communication to the public. Where that was not the case, the publishing director, not having been in a position to intervene to prevent the broadcast, could not be prosecuted as a principal. Lastly, the Government submitted that the way in which section 93-3 of the 1982 Act had been applied in the present case had been compatible with the presumption of innocence. Firstly, the domestic courts had fully established the defamatory nature of the statements broadcast.

Thirdly, the second applicant's conviction as principal did not infringe the \u201cprinciple of individual responsibility\u201d, since the criminal responsibility contemplated in section 93-3 arose not from producing the statement but from publishing or broadcasting it, which formed part of the responsibilities of the publishing director; above all, in the present case, by emphasising that \u201ca rolling news bulletin may be monitored and controlled ... by making the necessary arrangements to that effect\u201d, the Paris Court of Appeal had in a sense established intent on the part of the second applicant even though in law it did not actually need to do so in order to find him guilty.",

The presumption of responsibility established by that section was indeed therefore irrebuttable. According to the Court's case-law, Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention required States to keep presumptions of fact and of law within reasonable limits which took into account the gravity of what was at stake and maintained the rights of the defence; but there was no criminal policy consideration of any particular gravity which militated in favour of the presumption in issue in the present case. Moreover, although the applicants did not deny that necessity was a defence under ordinary law capable of qualifying the irrebuttable character of a presumption of responsibility, they could not see what might constitute a case of force majeure excluding the publishing director's responsibility under section 93-3 of the 1982 Act.",

Thus, as the Paris Court of Appeal observed in its judgment of 17\u00a0June 1998, the applicants could have established the third applicant's good faith by proving that the allegations complained of had been made in pursuit of a legitimate aim, without any personal animosity, after a serious investigation and in temperate language.",

On the first point, the Government said that the domestic courts had conducted a detailed examination of the case and the parties' arguments before finding that the information broadcast on France Info had damaged Mr Junot's honour and good name. In particular, the order requiring Radio  to broadcast an announcement by way of civil reparation had appropriately reflected the circumstances of the case. On the second point, the Government argued that the conviction of the second and third applicants had been proportionate on account of the particular gravity of the damage to Mr Junot's honour and good name \u2013 the bulletin complained of had been broadcast a large number of times on a station with a very large audience, it had incautiously referred without comment to unverified facts and it had suggested a parallel with the Papon case (which betrayed a lack of impartiality) \u2013 and of the moderate nature of the fines and the awards of damages. Nor was the order against Radio France disproportionate: the domestic courts had limited its obligation to the requirement that it broadcast the announcement every two hours for twenty-four hours (a total of twelve times, as compared with around sixty repetitions of the offending statement), and the content of the announcement had responded point by point to the defamatory imputations broadcast on France Info. The applicants' argument that this measure had unduly reduced the editorial space of France Info was invalid, since news was broadcast round the clock on that channel. Moreover, since the operation of France Info depended on public funds, it could not be affected by the broadcasting of a dozen announcements over a period of twenty-four hours.",

Firstly, the applicant company's civil liability for defamatory remarks broadcast on the radio channels it runs is founded on Article 1382 of the Civil Code, which provides: \u201cAny act committed by a person that causes damage to another shall render the person through whose fault the damage was caused liable to make reparation for it\u201d. Secondly, it is established French case-law that the trial courts alone have power to determine the manner in which damage is to be made good and that they may order reparation in kind. On this last point, although the Government have not established that the courts regularly order measures of this type in cases involving audiovisual communication \u2013 they merely mentioned a first-instance judgment but did not provide a copy or a reference \u2013 the publication of announcements about judicial decisions is nevertheless, in France, one of the usual forms of reparation for damage caused through the medium of the press (see, mutatis mutandis, Prisma Presse v.

The Court of Appeal went on to say: \u201cCalumnious imputations are deemed to be in bad faith unless it can be established that they were made in pursuit of a legitimate aim, without any personal animosity, after a serious investigation and in temperate language\u201d, and found that, although the first two of those conditions had been satisfied, the same was not true of the other two. As regards the third condition, the Court of Appeal found that the third applicant had broadcast the bulletin complained of when Le Point had only just come out, had used as his only sources three press agency dispatches reporting the article in that publication \u2013 a fact which did not show that he had checked the information \u2013 and a television programme in which Mr Junot had taken part, and had gratuitously asserted that Mr Junot admitted that his conduct had been blameworthy. As regards the fourth condition, the Court of Appeal held that the imputations contained in the information broadcast had been disproportionate in relation to the objective material which the applicants claimed to have had at their disposal. It considered that the use of the conditional tense and \u201cthe mention \u2013 very late in the day \u2013 of Mr Junot's denials\u201d did not attenuate \u201cthe gravity of the allegations made in dispatches broadcast several dozen times\u201d, and that the content of the documents quoted in Le Point did not justify the construction that had been placed upon them in the news bulletins. On that point, it said: \u201cAll these texts portray an official dedicated to fulfilling his functions of maintaining public order and defending the political interests of the government. They do not support, without overstating the case, an assertion that Mr Junot supervised the camps or played a role in the deportation of the Jews.\u201d",
