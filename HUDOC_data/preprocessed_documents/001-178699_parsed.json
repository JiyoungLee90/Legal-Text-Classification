Furthermore, his request for the questioning of C.M. at the trial had been dismissed even though that could have elucidated the circumstances in which he had been contacted by the undercover agents. The applicant also contended that he had been incited by the undercover agents to commit the offences at issue. There was in particular no explanation why he had not been arrested following the first illicit transaction. In the applicant\u2019s view, although it could have been justified to continue with the simulated purchases after the first illicit transaction if it had been necessary to arrest further individuals involved in the offences (the \u201cbuy and walk operation\u201d technique), in his case no activity to that effect had been undertaken by the police. He therefore considered that the sole purpose of conducting several simulated purchases had been to incite him to commit further more serious offences of currency counterfeiting. In the applicant\u2019s view, the investigating judge had failed to supervise the work of the undercover agents effectively and to prevent the abuse of police powers.

This was apparent from the information obtained by the police concerning the uttering of counterfeit currency by C.M. and his connection with the applicant. Moreover, the use of undercover agents had been justified by the need to identify other individuals involved in the currency counterfeiting operation. That had been a legitimate investigative technique under the Court\u2019s case-law. The Government also submitted that the undercover agents had merely declared themselves to be potential buyers of counterfeit euros, which had been justified and necessary given the nature of their work and the circumstances surrounding the criminal offence at issue. In the Government\u2019s view, the introduction of a second undercover agent in the police operation had been necessary in order to investigate the extent of the applicant\u2019s already known criminal activity. The Government also stated that a number of procedural safeguards had been put in place as regards the use of evidence obtained by the undercover agents. In particular, the use of special investigative measures had been authorised by a valid order issued by the investigating judge, the applicant and his lawyer had both had the opportunity to question the undercover agents and full access to the case file, and they had been also able to put forward all the relevant arguments, which had been duly examined by the domestic courts.",

Relying on the Malininas case-law, the Court found that the significant amount of money offered by the undercover agent to the applicant\u2019s accomplice had also represented \u2012 in respect of the applicant \u2012 an inducement to produce narcotics which amounted to an entrapment contrary to Article 6.",

The Court considered that by engaging in such conduct \u201cthe investigating authorities clearly abandoned a passive attitude and caused the applicant to commit the offences\u201d. The Court therefore concluded that the undercover measure in question went beyond the mere passive investigation of pre-existing criminal activity and amounted to police incitement, contrary to Article 6.",

The Court observed that the police informant had indeed asked the applicant prior to the third drug transaction whether he could supply him with larger amounts of drugs. However, the exact quantity of drugs ordered had been fixed only after the applicant had explained that he could supply the informant with as many drugs as the latter wanted. The Court therefore held that the applicant had not been subjected to undue pressure by the informant, who was acting on the police\u2019s instructions, to commit the drug offences of which he was subsequently found guilty. In these circumstances, the Court concluded that the police had investigated the applicant\u2019s activities in an essentially passive manner and had not incited him to commit drug offences he would not have committed had an \u201cordinary\u201d customer approached him instead of the police.",

Although the Court found that the applicant had demonstrated the ability to obtain more drugs at short notice, it considered that the significant role played by the undercover agent in arranging the next deal ran counter to the requirement of passivity on the State agent\u2019s part.
