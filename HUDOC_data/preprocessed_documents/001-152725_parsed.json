While this is an obligation of means rather than that of a result, a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in it (see, e.g., Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0175-177, ECHR 2005; Merkulova v. Ukraine, no. 21454/04, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51, March 2011 and Yuriy Slyusar v.

It took them about one month to initiate criminal proceedings and to develop the relevant action plan (see paragraphs 7-8 above). According to the findings of the national authorities, this delay was unjustified and led to the deterioration of evidence (see paragraph 20 above). It has also been recognised at the domestic level that, notwithstanding the plurality of actions taken, the entire proceedings were marked by protractions, poor record-keeping, repeated failures of the police officers to abide by the instructions of their supervisors and patchy approach towards the collection of evidence (see paragraphs 15, 17, 20, 27 and 28 above). Based on the information available to the Court, the investigation is still pending after over ten years and without foreseeable progress.",
