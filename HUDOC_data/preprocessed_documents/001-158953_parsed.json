The Committee is gravely concerned by the case of Azimjan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek human rights defender prosecuted on criminal charges in connection with the death of a police officer in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, which has been raised by several Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (A/HRC/22/47/Add.4, para.\u00a0248; A/HRC/19/55/Add.2, para.\u00a0212). Mr.\u00a0Askarov has alleged that he was beaten severely by police on numerous occasions immediately following his detention and throughout the course of the criminal proceedings against him, and that he was subjected to repeated violations of procedural safeguards such as prompt access to a lawyer and to an effective, independent medical examination. The Committee notes that independent forensic medical examinations appear to have substantiated Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s allegations of torture in police custody, and have confirmed resulting injuries including persistent visual loss, traumatic brain injury, and spinal injury. Information before the Committee suggests that Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s complaints of torture have been raised on numerous occasions with the Prosecutor\u2019s office, as well as with the Kyrgyz Ombudsman\u2019s office, and with Bazar-Korgon District Court, the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court. To date, however, the State party\u2019s authorities have declined to open a full investigation into his claims, relying on allegedly coerced statements made by Mr.\u00a0Askarov while in police custody that he had no complaints. The Committee understands that the State party is presently considering the possibility of further investigating these claims. The Committee is concerned by the State party\u2019s refusal to undertake full investigations into allegations of torture regarding other cases raised during the review, including those of Nargiza Turdieva and Dilmurat Khaidarov (arts.\u00a02, 12, 13 and 16).",

In a previous case concerning extradition to Kyrgyzstan it found that in 2012 the situation in the south of the country was characterised by torture and other illtreatment of ethnic Uzbeks by law-enforcement officers, which had increased in the aftermath of the events of June 2010 and remained widespread, aggravated by the impunity of law-enforcement officers. Moreover, the Court established that the issue ought to be seen in the context of the rise of ethnonationalism in the politics of Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the south, the growing inter-ethnic tensions between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, continued discriminatory practices faced by Uzbeks at institutional level and the underrepresentation of Uzbeks in, amongst others, law-enforcement bodies and the judiciary (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 72). As is clear from reports by UN bodies and reputable non-governmental organisations, in 2012-13 the situation in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan had not improved. In particular, various reports are consistent when describing biased attitudes based on ethnicity in investigations, prosecutions, condemnations and sanctions imposed on ethnic Uzbeks charged and convicted in relation to the events of June 2010. The reports also describe a lack of full and effective investigations into the numerous allegations of torture and ill-treatment imputable to Kyrgyz lawenforcement agencies, arbitrary detention and excessive use of force against Uzbeks allegedly involved in the events of June 2010 (see paragraphs 21-26). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the current overall human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan remains highly problematic (see Gayratbek Saliyev v. Russia, no. 39093/13, \u00a7 61, 17\u00a0April 2014).",

It reiterates in this respect that where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group that is systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment, the protection of Article 3 enters into play when the applicant establishes \u2013 where necessary on the basis of information contained in recent reports by independent international human rights protection bodies or non-governmental organisations \u2013 that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned. In those circumstances the Court will not insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features (see Saadi v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 132, ECHR\u00a02008, and NA. v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no.\u00a025904/07, \u00a7 116, 17 July 2008). The Court considers that this reasoning is of particular relevance in the present case, where the applicant, an ethnic Uzbek, is charged with a number of serious offences allegedly committed in the course of the violence of June 2010 (see, by contrast, Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 73). Given the widespread use by the Kyrgyz authorities of torture and illtreatment in order to obtain confessions from ethnic Uzbeks charged with involvement in the inter-ethnic riots in June 2010, which has been reported by both UN bodies (see paragraphs 21-22 above) and reputable NGOs (see paragraphs 23-26 above), the Court is satisfied that the applicant belongs to a particularly vulnerable group, the members of which are routinely subjected to treatment proscribed by Article\u00a03 of the Convention in the requesting country.",

In view of the above, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s arguments in respect of the risk of ill-treatment were not addressed properly at the domestic level. As for the extradition proceedings, the Court notes the reasoning put forward by the Supreme Court and its failure to take into account materials originating from reliable sources, such as reports by international NGOs (see paragraph 13 above). In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the issue of the risk of illtreatment was subjected to rigorous scrutiny in the asylum or extradition proceedings (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0148).",
