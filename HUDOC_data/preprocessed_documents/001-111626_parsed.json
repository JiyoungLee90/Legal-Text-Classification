However we consider them to be more in the nature of value judgments, which express in a simple, crude or perhaps even angry way the applicant\u2019s subjective appraisal of Mr. G.J. as a journalist. In either case, whether viewed as mere statements of fact or as value judgments, it is not in dispute in the present case that the Mr. G.J. was at the relevant time a journalist for the S .Tar TV. It is also established as a fact that Mr. G.J. was present at the broadcast of the TV debate described in \u00a7 18 of the judgment. Regardless of Mr. G.J.\u2019s role as a camera operator during this particular broadcast, his presence there and his position as a journalist at the TV station are facts susceptible of being legitimately interpreted in such a way as the applicant did. In other words, regardless of whether the applicant\u2019s appraisal of Mr.\u00a0G.J.\u2019s qualifications as a journalist is right or wrong, the existence of these facts is, in our considered view, a sufficient factual basis to explain the applicant\u2019s resentment towards Mr. G.J., and thus his appraisal of him as a journalist. Moreover the domestic courts, and in particular the Tarnow Regional Court (see \u00a7\u00a017), relied heavily on the negative connotations of the words \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201ccollaboration\u201d in Polish society while at the same time apparently ignoring the wider reality of the media\u2019s agendas and their ability of, and the necessity for, selective reporting and nuanced presentation of facts if only to survive in a highly competitive and increasingly global market. The observation by Jock Young that the mass media \u201cselects events which are atypical, presents them in a stereotypical fashion and contrasts them against a backcloth of normality which is overtypical\u201d is as valid today as when it was first made in the early 1970\u2019s. The parochial approach of the domestic courts in this case is in direct contradiction to the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre of an international regional instrument safeguarding the right to freedom of expression.",

Bearing in mind the importance of the media and the possible impact the media and journalists can have on public debate, the media, and journalists in particular, must be ready, like politicians, to tolerate and accept criticism and commentary to a far greater extent than private individuals (see Petrina v.\u00a0Romania, no. 78060/01, \u00a7\u00a019, 14 October 2008, \u00a7\u00a040). A journalist, just like a regular blogger on the internet, becomes to a greater or lesser extent a\u00a0public figure. In the same way as the applicant, as a politician and participant in public debate, was expected to be thick-skinned enough to allow his every word and act to be critically examined, so also Mr. G.J., as a",

Moreover, it is also highly relevant that as a\u00a0journalist Mr. G.J. had ample opportunity to reply publicly to any insinuations which allegedly were directed at him concerning his work as a\u00a0journalist, rather than resorting to defamation proceedings to suppress or punish such criticism.
