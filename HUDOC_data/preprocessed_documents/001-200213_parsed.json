For instance, in the case of Naydyon v. Ukraine (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64-69) the Court found a violation of Article 34 of the Convention on the grounds that the authorities had failed to ensure that the applicant, who had been dependent on them (a prisoner without a lawyer), had been provided with the opportunity to obtain copies of documents which he had needed to substantiate his application before the Court. In the case of Vasiliy Ivashchenko v. Ukraine (cited above, \u00a7 123) the Court also found that the\u00a0Ukrainian legal system did not provide prisoners with a clear and specific procedure enabling them to obtain copies of case documents after the completion of criminal proceedings. The Court later reaffirmed its conclusions in various cases, most recently, in the case of Yakuba v.\u00a0Ukraine (no.\u00a01452/09, \u00a7\u00a7 54-57, 12 February 2019).",

The Court observes that the letter does not mention a possibility of authorising a representative who in his or her turn could have obtained documents from the applicant\u2019s case file. The Court notices that the explanations at issue were written in a rigid legal language, which prevented the applicant from understanding its contents. In particular, the applicant interpreted those explanations as if the Crimea Court of Appeal had asked for the Rules of the Court, which he attached to his request of 13\u00a0March 2012. The Court concludes that the Crimea Court of Appeal failed to explain clearly the procedure which the applicant should have followed and that the Government\u2019s argument related to the letter of 29 February 2012 should be dismissed (compare Vasiliy Ivashchenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105).",

The Court notes that the applicant had no source of income, no legal aid was available to him and that, according to his initial submissions, he could not afford to pay that fee at the relevant time.\u00a0The Government did not provide any evidence to the contrary. The Court further notes that for a considerable period of time the domestic authorities, without any valid excuse, refrained from taking measures which were indispensable for the effective exercise by the applicant of his right of application under Article 34 of the Convention (compare Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, \u00a7\u00a7 157-59, 26 July 2012).",
