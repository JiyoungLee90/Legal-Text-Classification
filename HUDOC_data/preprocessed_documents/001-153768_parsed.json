The Court observes that the proceedings were of considerable complexity, regard being had to the extensive evidentiary proceedings and to the victims\u2019 vulnerability, given the nature of the offences committed by the applicant (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 34 above). The prosecution authorities completed the investigation within the period of one year and some six months (see paragraphs 6 and 10\u00a0above). Subsequently, after the initial period needed to prepare the trial, the Kalisz District Court held the hearings in the applicant\u2019s case regularly and at short intervals (see paragraph 11 above).
