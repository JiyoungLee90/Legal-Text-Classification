The court also found that he had not been kept in less than 2.5 square metres of personal space, which had been the minimum requirement under domestic law at the material time. The court was of the view that the applicant\u2019s detention in cells with less than 3 square metres of personal space had been degrading within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention. However, the applicant had had the right to a walk for an hour a day and the use of a gym once a week. Moreover, for most of the period under consideration (720 days) he had been in an open section (cell no. 15), where he had been required to stay in the cell only at night. He had therefore been able to move freely around the section during the day. He had spent nineteen days in a punishment cell, and had also been engaged in several social programmes. Taking the above factors into consideration, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim for damages as unfounded because the violation of his rights had not reached the minimum level of severity to justify monetary compensation.",

According to the reasoning of the Supreme Court, the prison administration itself had confirmed in many domestic proceedings that lack of personal space was a result of a general problem of overcrowding in prisons and it was not in the prison administration\u2019s power to resolve the issue. If a prison administration had any remedies to reduce the impact of overcrowding, it was obliged to use them on its own motion. It had not been shown that this had been done. Using preventive remedies would therefore not have had any reasonable prospect of success. Failure to use such remedies could not be held as grounds for refusing to award compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The Supreme Court maintained that position in subsequent judgments. In its decision of 15 June 2016 (case no. 3-3-1-16-16) it reiterated that as the prison administration itself had explained, it did not have the means to afford prisoners more personal space, and allocating prisoners to other prison facilities was impeded.

The Supreme Court stated that the running of the time-limit in the event of a continuous situation may start at a different time depending on when the injured person became aware or should have become aware of the damage and of the physical or legal person causing it. In the event of inhuman or degrading conditions of detention, a claim for damages was inseparably related to the duration of such treatment. Both the overall duration of the detention and the duration of particular periods of time had to be taken into account, as the conditions in different periods might differ and have different effects on the detainee. Lastly, the particular circumstances of each case, the gravity of the violation and its cumulative effect had to be taken into account. Detention was a continuous action during which circumstances might change. It was therefore not always possible to determine when the detainee had become or ought to have become aware of the damage caused.",

Damage was caused to the applicant throughout this period and the final extent of the damage appeared only after the end of the continuous action.

This Court is concerned with the supervision of the implementation by Contracting States of their obligations under the Convention. It should not take on the role of Contracting States, whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined therein are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is based on the assumption \u2013 reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged violation. The rule is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies therefore requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of his or her Convention grievances. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v.

Once this burden has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 77).",

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6\u00a0November 1980, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 40). This means, amongst other things, that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case (see Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 65-68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01996IV).",

In the event of an unfavourable outcome, the applicant can pursue his complaints before three levels of jurisdiction in the domestic courts. In accordance with domestic case-law (see paragraph 99), the courts may examine a claim for damages lodged by a prisoner only insofar as the applicant has undergone the mandatory pre-action procedure before the prison administration. Therefore, when deciding whether to hear a claim, the court first verifies whether the application for damages lodged with the prison administration is compatible with the claim lodged with the court.",

The practice of the Supreme Court of Estonia is that the time-limit for lodging a claim in cases of inadequate conditions of detention usually starts running when the continuous situation ends. It may start running before the end of the continuous situation in exceptional circumstances if it is clear that the person already became aware or should have become aware of the damage (see paragraph 103). The Court observes that this approach is in principle consistent with its own case-law on calculating the running of a time-limit in continuous situations, such as in cases of inadequate conditions of detention. In particular, the Court has held that the period of an applicant\u2019s detention should be regarded as a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d, as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural measures would have no bearing on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant\u2019s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d (see Seleznev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 15591/03, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36, 26 June 2008; Sudarkov v.

The Court observes that in the instant cases the domestic courts did not assess the actual nature or circumstances of the applicants\u2019 detention, including the regime they had been subjected to and the conditions in which they had been placed, but relied merely on a specific event, such as their placement in the relevant prison and concluded that the time-limit started running from the beginning of their detention. The Court reiterates that it does not question the interpretation of domestic law by the national courts, save in the event it is arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see paragraph 137). The Court finds that requiring applicants to bring their claim for compensation against the State before the end of the three-year period provided for in Section 17 (3) of the State Liability Act in a situation of continuous nature imposes an unreasonable procedural burden on detainees. Such a requirement does not take into account the vulnerability of prisoners who are kept in inadequate conditions and whose main concern is to try to meet basic needs, maintain their health, safety and dignity on a daily basis. Restricting the period of admissibility of the claim requires that the starting point of the running of the time-limit is fixed precisely relying on objective criteria. However, this seems very difficult given not only the continuous nature of the inadequate conditions, but also of the lack of prospects for improvement of those conditions, particularly as there was no preventive remedy foreseen in Estonia, and the damage that ensues.",

This has also been explained by the Supreme Court of Estonia (see also paragraph 106). No other exceptional circumstances was pointed out by the domestic courts, nor by the Government, which would enable to precisely establish the starting point of the running of the time-limit before the end of the situation of continuous nature. It follows that even though the Court would normally not question the domestic time-limit and the established practice concerning its application (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 72), which are in itself reasonable, the Court is of the view that the domestic courts in the instant cases, when placing an unreasonable procedural burden on the applicants failed to examine their grievances as a whole and take into account the cumulative effect of their placement in conditions contrary to Article\u00a03. Their conclusion thus put the applicants in a situation that unreasonably denied them their rights under the Convention. The Court is therefore unable to accept the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

It held in that case that the area available to the applicant consisting of less than 3\u00a0square metres of floor space, which also included space under furniture, had been so limited as to create in itself a strong presumption that the conditions of his detention had amounted to degrading treatment. The Court considered that the applicant had been confined in the cell round the clock, with the exception of one hour of daily outdoor exercise in a yard measuring about 15 square metres, which he had had to share with his cellmates. It found that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention had amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. That conclusion was not affected by the fact that the applicant had not raised complaints about other aspects of the detention conditions in his cell or in the prison in general.\u00a0The Court observes that the applicants in the instant cases were also held in cells providing less than 3 square metres of personal space in conditions similar to those the Court has already had occasion to assess.

As to the first of those factors capable of rebutting the presumption, which need to be cumulatively met, the Court notes that the periods of detention in cells in which the applicants\u2019 personal space fell below 3\u00a0square metres were of a considerably long duration, amounting to almost half the relevant periods. Mr Nikitin was placed in such conditions for a total of more than two years and Mr Tarasovski for more than one and a half years.

The Court notes that during that period the applicant was detained in Tallinn Prison as a remand prisoner. The Court has already concluded that for inmates who were subjected to the regime for remand prisoners there were no other relevant factors which could alleviate the lack of sufficient personal space, namely sufficient freedom of movement outside the cell and adequate out-of-cell activities (see paragraph 166). The Court therefore concludes that for the period of those fourteen days the applicant was subjected to conditions in which he had less than 3\u00a0square metres of personal space at his disposal.

The applicant claimed that he had therefore starved for more than two years. The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention requires the State to protect the physical integrity of persons deprived of their liberty. In particular, the Court considers that the obligation of the national authorities to ensure the health and general well-being of an inmate implies, inter alia, the obligation to feed the prisoner properly (see Ebedin Abi v. Turkey, no. 10839/09, \u00a7 33, 13 March 2018). However, for ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3 it must attain a minimum level of severity. Allegations of such ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. Based on those principles, the Court concludes that as the applicant himself did not make any such allegations before the Court and the evidence he submitted contained no information as to the extent of his suffering or the detrimental effects on his physical health, or the risk of such effects or suffering due to inadequate nutrition, this factor in itself does not imply that there has been a violation of Article\u00a03.

A finding that conditions of detention were incompatible with the requirements of Article 3 is of a factual nature and creates a strong legal presumption that such conditions have caused the applicant non-pecuniary damage. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the question whether the applicant received reparation for the damage caused \u2013 comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention \u2013 is an important issue. The Court has already had occasion to indicate that an applicant\u2019s victim status may depend on the level of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2006V, with further references). Whether the amount awarded may be regarded as reasonable, however, falls to be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case. These include also the value of the award judged in the light of the ordinary living standards and the general level of incomes in the State concerned and the fact that the remedy in the national system is closer and more accessible than an application to the Court (see Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 268, and Shilbergs v. Russia, no. 20075/03, \u00a7 72, 17 December 2009). The amount of time spent by the person concerned in those conditions is, however, the most important factor for assessing the extent of the damage. The Court is mindful that the task of making an estimate of damages to be awarded is a difficult one. It is especially difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim. There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and mental distress and anguish can be measured in terms of money. The domestic courts should, in each case, attempt to assess the cumulative effect which the conditions of detention have on the applicant\u2019s well-being (see, mutatis mutandis, Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2001-II) and determine the level of physical suffering, emotional distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the prisoner by reason of his detention in those conditions (see Nardone v. Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25\u00a0November 2004). The level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases.",

Mr\u00a0Villems was awarded EUR 100 for the 100 days he spent mostly in less than 3\u00a0square metres of personal space, with the aggravating fact that he had been unable to take walks in fresh air separately from smoking inmates. Mr\u00a0Jeret was awarded EUR 1,100 for being placed in overcrowded cells for 416 days. Mr\u00a0Kaziks\u2019 placement in overcrowded cells for only thirteen\u00a0days was seen as not severe enough to justify awarding monetary compensation. Mr Tarasovski was awarded EUR 200 for having been placed in cells with less than 3 square metres of personal space (excluding the lavatory) for seventy-five days.",

When conducting its assessment, the Court took into account a relatively longer period of suffering caused to the applicants as a result of being held in conditions that were so poor as to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3. Accordingly, the Court cannot but conclude that the damages that were awarded by the domestic courts were not sufficient to remove the applicants\u2019 victim status.",

A decision to award lower or no compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage can be justified only by exceptionally compelling and serious reasons (see Ananyev and Others, \u00a7 230, and Neshkov and\u00a0Others, \u00a7\u00a0288, both cited above). In the instant case the domestic courts attached significant importance to the fact that Mr Nikitin had enjoyed extensive freedom of movement outside the cell. In particular, he had been placed in an open section where the cells had been locked only at night and he had therefore been able to move around the section throughout the day; he had also been allowed to take a daily one-hour walk in fresh air and could use the sports hall once a week. The Court of Appeal also considered that Mr\u00a0Nikitin had been participating in social programmes and had worked. The Court observes that Mr Nikitin was engaged in what appears to be a full-time job in the prison. It takes cognisance of those particular circumstances as factors that can be considered when deciding on the appropriate amount of compensation, but notes that the domestic court\u2019s reasoning overlooks the fact that for a period of six months the applicant had been placed in a closed section where he lacked the above-mentioned privileges. The Court is of the view that the mere acknowledgment of a violation cannot therefore be considered as appropriate redress for the applicant\u2019s grievances under Article\u00a03.",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 157).",

In this context, the effectiveness of the remedy was undermined by the domestic courts\u2019 restrictive approach to its scope (see, mutatis mutandis, Krawczak v.\u00a0Poland, no. 40387/06, 18 March 2008) which resulted in failure to examine a significant period of the applicants\u2019 complaints with regard to their placement in inadequate conditions. This amounted to periods of one year and one year and seven months respectively. The Court reiterates in this connection that to be Article 13 compliant, a remedy must be capable of effectively dealing with the substance of the complaints under Article 3 (idem., \u00a7 39).",

When making its assessment with regard to the applicants\u2019 claim, the Court considers that the length of stay in inadequate conditions of detention is an important factor for the assessment of the extent of non-pecuniary damage (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 172). The Court takes into account the circumstances of each case, including the fact that a violation of Article 3 has been found with regard to the relatively long periods in which the applicants had less than 3 square metres of personal space at their disposal. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, and considering the sums already awarded and paid by the respondent State, the Court finds it appropriate to make the following awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage: EUR 8,000 to Mr Nikitin; EUR\u00a08,925 to Mr Tarasovski; EUR\u00a08,375 to Mr Villems; EUR 4,625 to Mr\u00a0Kaziks; EUR 9,975 to Mr Jeret; EUR 4,575 to Mr Savva; and EUR\u00a06,525 to Mr Karp, plus any tax that may be chargeable.
