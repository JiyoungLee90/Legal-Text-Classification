The Court observes that, out of the five examples of domestic practice concerning claims against the State in compensation proceedings (see paragraphs 56-57 above), only one of them pertained specifically to legal regulation (case SKA-726/2012). The Court is not persuaded that that case \u2013 which concerned an infringement of rights allegedly caused by an existing legal provision \u2013 could attest to the effectiveness of the proposed remedy in a different context, such as that of the present case, which pertains to the possibility of obtaining compensation in the context of alleged lacunae in the legal regulation of the safety of private flights. Moreover, the Government have not indicated against which public body such civil proceedings could be directed or even what specific acts or failure to act could be examined in such proceedings, in particular, in view of the Government\u2019s argument that there was no legal obligation on the State to introduce more extensive regulation (see paragraph 77 below).

The Government referred to the information provided by the Civil Aviation Agency (see paragraph 40 above), and submitted that the applicable legislative acts at the material time had provided for an aircraft owner\u2019s responsibility for maintaining the airworthiness of an aircraft, while operational safety had had to be ensured by the pilot-in-command. Thus, an owner had been responsible for technical maintenance, but the responsibility of ensuring a safe flight had only rested on a pilot. At international level, responsibility of an aircraft owner had only been introduced in 2010. Therefore, the recommendation which the TAIIB had addressed to the Civil Aviation Agency (see paragraph  above) following the accident could not be interpreted as creating an assumption that the State had failed to perform its duties or that it should be at fault for the accident. In this connection, the Government added that not every risk to life could entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk (they referred to \u0130lbeyi Kemalo\u011flu and Meriye Kemalo\u011flu v.

Since the parties have referred to the Chicago Convention and the domestic courts have analysed it in the domestic proceedings, the Court will also examine the obligations arising thereof, bearing in mind that the particular flight in the present case pertained to a domestic rather than international domain. The Court cannot discern from the Chicago Convention an obligation to provide in principle for the responsibility of an aircraft owner in the area of private flights at the material time. Indeed, as established by the domestic courts, prior to 18\u00a0November 2010 the Chicago Convention only provided for the responsibility of a pilot (see paragraphs 30 and 36 above). The Latvian Civil Aviation Agency also confirmed that the applicable European standards provided for a pilot\u2019s responsibility for safety during a flight and an aircraft owner\u2019s responsibility for ensuring that the aircraft was maintained (see paragraph 40 above). Therefore, the legal regulation of the safety of private flights in the respondent State did not fall short of the international or European standards in this regard at the material time. In view of the wide margin of appreciation afforded to the contracting States in such a difficult technical sphere as aviation safety (see paragraph 81 above), the Court considers that the Convention does not go as far as to require that the States introduce higher standards than those recognised under international or European law. That being said, member States may choose to provide a higher standard of protection than that provided for in international or European law. Accordingly, the Court will next examine the scope of the legislative framework in the field of aviation safety for private flights in Latvia.",

The applicant, who held a pilot licence himself, must have been aware of those differences in the legal framework, as one of a pilot\u2019s duties is to ensure flight safety in accordance with the law (see paragraph 51 above).

First, there is a duty to put in place a legislative and administrative framework providing for effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see Iliya Petrov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 19202/03, \u00a7\u00a055, 24\u00a0April\u00a02012).",

The sole responsibility for ensuring that an aircraft was operated by a sufficiently qualified pilot lay with the pilot himself. Neither the owner of an aircraft nor any other authority was obliged to verify that a pilot had the proper qualifications prior to handing over the aircraft to him (see paragraphs 31 and 33 of the judgment).",

However, in view of the inherent dangerousness related to the operation of an aircraft, both types of activities \u2013 private and commercial flights \u2013 bear comparable risks of potentially serious consequences in case of an accident caused by unqualified crew members.

However, the Civil Aviation Agency cannot establish such a procedure if there is no underlying obligation imposed by the competent institution on the aircraft owner.
