The applicant\u2019s mother, who signed the authority form in the name of Ms\u00a0Kostromina, was also one of the applicant\u2019s representatives before the trial court.

The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument that the statement cannot be accepted in evidence since the applicant\u2019s cell-mates were not medical professionals. However, one does not need to have professional knowledge to say that an injection was not given by a staff member of the prison hospital.

Further, the Government did not make clear whether the applicant had received the medication prescribed by the civilian doctors (see paragraph 24 above).

On one occasion the applicant, who had a high fever, was placed in a hospital cell with suppurative patients.

Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000IV). The Court accepts that a reasonable suspicion against the applicant could have warranted the initial detention. It recalls, however, that the gravity of the charge cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention pending trial. Nor can it be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a066, 7 April 2005; Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, \u00a7 102, 8 February 2005; and Letellier, cited above). The Court notes in this respect that after 30\u00a0October 1998 the applicant\u2019s detention was extended several times and lasted over a year. Moreover, in December 1998 the investigation was completed and the case was transferred to the trial court.

In Baranowski v. Poland (no. 28358/95, ECHR 2000III), it took the domestic courts five months to examine an application for release. The Government showed that the domestic court had commenced the examination of the first application for release as early as the day after it had been submitted and that, subsequently, it had on five occasions adjourned the examination of the relevant applications because evidence had to be taken from three experts. However, despite these arguments, the Court found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4. In the Samy v. the Netherlands case (no.\u00a036499/97, decision of 4\u00a0December 2001) concerning aliens\u2019 detention for the purposes of expulsion, the Court found that a period of 25 days was compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4.

In principle, the Court\u2019s case-law does not preclude reliance, at the investigation stage of criminal proceedings and where the nature of the offence so warrants, on evidence obtained as a result of an undercover police operation (see, for instance, L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238). However, the use of undercover agents must be restricted; the police may act undercover but not incite (see Teixeira de Castro, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

The Court has previously considered the use in criminal proceedings of evidence gained through entrapment by State agents. Thus, in the case of Teixeira de Castro, cited above, the applicant was offered money by undercover police officers to supply them with heroin. Although having no previous criminal record, he had contacts for obtaining drugs. Tempted by the money, the applicant accepted the officers\u2019 request. He was subsequently charged and convicted of a drug offence. In finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1, the Court distinguished the officers\u2019 actions in that case from those of ordinary undercover agents, who may conceal their identities in order to obtain information and evidence about a crime without actively inciting its author to commit it. The Court noted that \u201cwhile the rise in organised crime undoubtedly requires that appropriate measures be taken, the right to a fair administration of justice nevertheless holds such a prominent place [...] that it cannot be sacrificed for the sake of expedience\u201d (\u00a7 36). The Court stressed a number of features in that case, in particular the fact that the intervention of the two officers had not been part of a judicially supervised operation and that the national authorities had had no good reason to suspect the applicant of prior involvement in drug trafficking: he had no criminal record and there was nothing to suggest that he had a predisposition to become involved in drug dealing until he was approached by the police (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 37-38).",

Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238; also see, mutatis mutandis, Klass and Others v. Germany, judgment of 6 September 1978, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-56, Series A no. 28). In the present case the police operation had been authorised by a simple administrative decision of the body which later carried out the operation. It transpires from the materials of the case that the text of that decision contained very little information as to the reasons for and purposes of the planned \u201ctest buy\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the operation was not subjected to judicial review or any other independent supervision. In the absence of a comprehensive system of checks accompanying the operation (see paragraph 60 above), the role of the subsequent supervision by the trial court became crucial.",

The policemen involved in the \u201ctest buy\u201d have never been questioned by the court, although the defence sought to have them heard. Nor was G., who had sold the heroin to the applicant and had been convicted of that act, questioned in those proceedings. Finally, the Court is particularly struck by the fact that the applicant himself was not heard by the court on the subject of incitement: the applicant was absent from the hearing of 11\u00a0November 1999 at which the court examined the events of 29\u00a0October 1998.",
