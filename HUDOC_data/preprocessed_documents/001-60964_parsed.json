In such cases regard should be had, in addition to the compliance with the obligation to have one\u2019s permanent residence registered, to all relevant circumstances of the case such as the ability of the person concerned to settle in Czechoslovakia, his or her personal situation, his or her ties both in Czechoslovakia and abroad as well as to the aim of the laws on restitution of property.
