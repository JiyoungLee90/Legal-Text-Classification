Moreover, according to the record, he also stated that he did not want a lawyer or to remain silent. In his statement, which was fifteen pages long, the applicant admitted that he had become a member of the PKK/KADEK in 1996 and gave a detailed account of all the activities he had carried out for that organisation since then, including the killing of M.Y., opening fire on a police armoured vehicle during a demonstration organised in the aftermath of Abdullah \u00d6calan\u2019s arrest, and receiving training at the organisation\u2019s camp in Iraq.

The lawyer, therefore, pleaded the applicant\u2019s innocence and applied for his release. At the end of the hearing, the court held, inter alia, that there was no need to summon S.N. as a witness as he had already testified in case no. 1999/285 and he had not had much information about the killing of M.Y. in any event.

In other words, there was no blanket restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer during his police custody since at the time of his arrest Law no. 3842, which had provided for a systemic restriction on access to a lawyer in respect of people who had been accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, had already been amended. Thus, from 15 July 2003 onwards it was legally possible for such suspects to have access to a lawyer when giving statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, subject to the condition that they asked for one.",

It is common ground between the parties that the applicant saw his lawyer on 16 November 2003, that is to say after his police statements had been taken and prior to his appearance before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge. The applicant did not allege that his lawyer had failed to inform him of his rights or that she had been ineffective in any other way.

Moreover, the applicant also stated that he had been told by the police that he had no rights and that his statements before the police had been taken without informing him of any of his rights. What is more, the applicant reiterated the same grievance to the doctor who performed his medical examination on 17 November 2003. In the eyes of the Court, these facts undermine the credibility of the above-mentioned documents, on the basis of which the Government alleged that a valid waiver had been established in the present case.",

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy.

In that connection, the Court notes that Turkish law sets out a very strong procedural safeguard in Article 148 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure capable of remedying the procedural shortcomings in relation to the use of police statements taken without a lawyer present, irrespective of whether a suspect had waived his right to legal assistance or not.
