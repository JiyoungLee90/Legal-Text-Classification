The recent copy of his passport demonstrates that it has not been invalidated or confiscated by the authorities and that the applicant is in contact with his representative. Given that the Court is not an expert in graphology, it is unable to make a conclusion on the veracity of the applicant\u2019s signature in the documents in its possession, particularly bearing in mind that the signature may have changed to some extent over the years between the issuance of the applicant\u2019s passport in 2002 and the present day. In the absence of an expert conclusion on the issue, it cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument in that regard. The Court further considers that their objection raises issues concerning the effectiveness of the investigation which are closely linked to the merits of the applicants\u2019 complaints. It therefore decides to join this objection to the merits of the case and considers that the issue falls to be examined below.",

Thus, in Nakani (no.\u00a010229/10) the perpetrators made a stop at the local police station and then passed unrestrictedly through the checkpoint showing a special laissez-passer, and several hours later the police officer who had been absent from the police station at the time of the abduction returned with traces of blood on his shoes (see paragraphs 15, 29, 35 and 43 above). In Rashidov (no. 22751/10) the abductors arrived in several vehicles and acted as an organised group. Moreover, just like the police officers who had searched the house several days earlier, they knew the layout and the location of the light switches in the house (see paragraphs 48 and 49 above). In Dzeytova (no. 35915/10), Gazdiyev (no. 46142/11) and Sigauri (no.\u00a038378/12) the abductions occurred at a time when special operations were being carried out in the area (see paragraphs 110, 121 and 170 above). Moreover, in Dzeytova (no. 35915/10) several police officers had been seen waiting for someone near the applicant\u2019s house on the day of her son\u2019s disappearance (see paragraph 79 above). In Gazdiyev (no. 46142/11, and Sigauri (no. 38378/12) the applicants\u2019 relatives disappeared after having been seen surrounded by a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms (see paragraphs 122 and 171 above). In Nakani (no. 10229/10), Dzeytova (no.\u00a035915/10), and Gazdiyev (no. 46142/11) various law-enforcement officers or State officials confirmed unofficially to the applicants or their relatives that their sons had been arrested by State agents (17, 84, 85, 124, 125, and 126 above).",
