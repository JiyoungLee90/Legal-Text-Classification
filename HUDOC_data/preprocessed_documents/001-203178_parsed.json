Roskomnadzor requires Internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to the website and web hosting service providers to take down illegal content. Roskomnadzor\u2019s notification must specify the website\u2019s domain name, network address and the URL of the webpages permitting illegal content to be identified (subsection (2)).

States frequently adopted anti-extremism laws that were so broad as to give excessive discretion for authorities to restrict online expression, contrary to the lawfulness requirement. Such legislation prioritised restrictions on, rather than protection of, free expression as the primary State responsibility, and failed to define precisely limitations on online expression and justifications for those limitations. The wholesale blocking of websites rarely, if ever, satisfied the criteria for permissible limitations on freedom of expression, taking into account that permissible restrictions should be content-specific and should not target websites solely because they were critical of the government or political system. Finally, the Special Rapporteur emphasised that digital censorship through unaccountable and excessive website blocking was unacceptable and detrimental to the rule of law in the digital age.",

Vague and overly broad definitions of \u201cextremism\u201d had allowed States to suppress legitimate public dissent and criminalise speech and expression in opposition to the government. Blocking access to entire websites was an extreme and disproportionate measure which was incapable of distinguishing between lawful and unlawful content and, as such, should never be required by law. Even where blocking was permissible, the law should provide for the following minimum standards: (i) blocking should be ordered by a court or an independent adjudicatory body; (ii) interested parties should be given the opportunity to intervene in proceedings in which a blocking order was sought; (iii) all victims of blocking orders should have the right to challenge, after the fact, the blocking order; and (iv) anyone attempting to access a blocked website should be able to see the legal basis and reasons for the blocking order and information about avenues of appeal.

On 14\u00a0March 2014, the telecoms regulator, Roskomnadzor, blocked access to their websites after the Prosecutor General had identified a portion of the content as being illegal. The Court reiterates that measures blocking access to websites are bound to have an influence on the accessibility of the Internet and, accordingly, engage the responsibility of the respondent State under Article 10 (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053). The measure which prevented visitors to the applicants\u2019 websites from accessing their content amounted to \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the right to receive and impart information, since Article 10 guarantees not only the right to impart information but also the right of the public to receive it (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 55, and Cengiz and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a048226/10 and 14027/11, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). The Court reiterates that interference will constitute a breach of Article 10 unless it is \u201cprescribed by law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 10 \u00a7\u00a02 and is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve those aims. In the present case the questions of compliance with the law and of the existence of a legitimate aim cannot be dissociated from the question of whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. The Court will therefore examine them together (see Kablis v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 48310/16 and 59663/17, \u00a7 85, 30 April 2019).",

Subsection (2) of section 15.3 set out requirements in respect of the contents of Roskomnadzor\u2019s notification, which had to specify, in particular, the URL of the web page permitting illegal content to be identified (see paragraph 12 above). The actual notices which Roskomnadzor had despatched in the instant case deviated from that requirement in that they listed the website\u2019s entire domain, rather than a particular problematic webpage (see paragraph 7 above). Not only did that failure run counter to the requirement that the information provided by Roskomnadzor should permit identification of the content to be taken down, but it also deprived the applicants of the opportunity to remedy the supposed breach by removing the offending content. By failing to specify the URL of the webpages they considered problematic, the Russian authorities acted in an arbitrary manner which prevented the applicants from making an informed choice between taking down or modifying the specific content and formulating a legal objection to the Prosecutor General\u2019s demand by reference to particular webpages.",

The Prosecutor General interpreted those articles as amounting to calls for participation in unauthorised public events. The Court has previously found that the concept of \u201cpublic events held in breach of the established procedure\u201d in section 15.3 is excessively broad. It allows the Prosecutor General to impose a blocking order for any breach of the procedure for conducting public events, no matter how trivial or innocuous, without having to establish a risk of disorder or of any real nuisance to the rights of others (see Kablis, cited above, \u00a7 93). It has also found that the Prosecutor General invoked that particular ground to target content which did not feature any such calls (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 98-101).

Russia, no. 74568/12, \u00a7\u00a7 81-142, 5\u00a0January 2016; Yaroslav Belousov v. Russia, nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, \u00a7\u00a7 155-83, 4 October 2016; and Razvozzhayev v. Russia and Ukraine and Udaltsov v. Russia, nos. 75734/12 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 274-99, 19 November 2019). For many years afterwards, ongoing trials were a matter of intense public interest in Russia. Court hearings were attended by members of the public and politicians; some of them were arrested by the police, without justification, on the charge of participation in an unauthorised public event (see Navalnyy v.\u00a0Russia [GC], nos.\u00a029580/12 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a7 35-42 and 125-26, 15\u00a0November 2018). The applicants\u2019 media outlets, www.ej.ru and grani.ru, reported on the developments in the proceedings and the arrests made by the police, consistent with their journalistic duty to keep the public informed on issues of general interest and to offer different perspectives, including those which may be critical of official policy (see S\u00fcrek and \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23927/94 and 24277/94, \u00a7 61, 8 July 1999). The Prosecutor General\u2019s blocking request failed to identify any parts of the publications mentioning planned public events, whether authorised or otherwise, or inviting the public to participate in them (contrast with Kablis, cited above, \u00a7 102). Voicing support for people who had been put on trial in connection with the Bolotnaya events or for those who found ways of showing their solidarity with the defendants cannot be treated as calls for unauthorised public events. Reiterating that expression on matters of public interest is entitled to strong protection, the Court finds that the interpretation adopted by the Prosecutor General had no basis in fact and was therefore arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.",

The Prosecutor General\u2019s decision did not specify the nature of the allegedly unlawful actions, the elements which rendered them unlawful or the authority that allowed a Russian prosecutor to determine which conduct by non-Russian nationals living outside the Russian jurisdiction should be considered unlawful. In any event, the generic term of \u201cunlawful actions\u201d did not fall within any of the three categories of prohibited content defined in section 15.3. It follows that the Prosecutor General\u2019s decision regarding the content on www.kasparov.ru did not have a legal basis.",

Such a measure deliberately disregards the distinction between the legal and illegal information the website may contain, and renders inaccessible large amounts of content which has not been identified as illegal. Blocking access to the entire website has the practical effect of extending the scope of the blocking order far beyond the illegal content which had been originally targeted (compare Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7 63).",

Blocking access to legitimate content can never be an automatic consequence of another, more restricted blocking measure in the way in which section 15.3 allows the authorities to extend a limited blocking request to encompass an entire website. Any indiscriminate blocking measure which interferes with lawful content or websites as a collateral effect of a measure aimed at illegal content or websites amounts to arbitrary interference with the rights of the owners of such websites. The Government did not put forward any justification for the wholesale blocking order. They did not explain what legitimate aim or pressing social need the Russian authorities sought to achieve by blocking access to the applicants\u2019 online media. The applicants\u2019 claim that the true objective of the Russian authorities was to suppress access to the opposition media outlets gives rise to serious concern. The UN Human Rights Committee and Special Rapporteurs have emphasised that targeting online media or websites with blocking measures because they are critical of the government or political system can never be considered a necessary restriction on freedom of expression (see paragraphs 16 and 25 above). Lacking any justification for the wholesale blocking orders targeting the applicants\u2019 websites, the Court finds that they did not pursue any legitimate aim.",

The dangers inherent in prior restraints are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court and are justified only in exceptional circumstances. This is especially so as far as the press is concerned, for news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Association Ekin v. France, no.\u00a039288/98, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2001-VIII; Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v.

In cases of prior restraints on the operation of media outlets such as the present one, a legal framework is required to ensure both tight control over the scope of bans and an effective Convention-compliant judicial review (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, \u00a7\u00a064, and Kablis, \u00a7\u00a092, both cited above).",

Both the Prosecutor General\u2019s original decision and Roskomnadzor\u2019s implementing orders had been made without advance notification to the parties whose rights and interests were likely to be affected. The law did not require the authorities to carry out an impact assessment of the blocking measures prior to their implementation or justify the urgency of their immediate enforcement without giving the interested parties the opportunity to remove the illegal content or apply for a judicial review. The blocking measures had not been sanctioned by a court or other independent adjudicatory body providing a forum in which the interested parties could have been heard.",

There is no indication that the judges considering their complaints sought to weigh up the various interests at stake, in particular by assessing the need to block access to the entire websites. In the Court\u2019s view, this shortcoming was a consequence of the domestic courts\u2019 failure to apply the Plenary Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling no.\u00a021 of 27 June 2013, which required them to have regard to the criteria established in the Convention in its interpretation by the Court (see Lashmankin and Others v. Russia, nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, \u00a7 217, 7\u00a0February 2017). In reaching their decision, the courts confined their scrutiny to establishing that the Prosecutor General and Roskomnadzor had exercised the discretion which the legislation had afforded them (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). However, in the Court\u2019s view, a Convention-compliant review should have taken into consideration, among other elements, the fact that such a measure, by rendering large quantities of information inaccessible, substantially restricted the rights of Internet users and had a significant collateral effect (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066).",
