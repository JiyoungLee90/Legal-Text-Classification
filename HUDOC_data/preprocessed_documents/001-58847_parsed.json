They did not deny the existence of a dispute, but maintained that no civil rights had been at stake. The exclusion order had been made against the applicant as a result of his failure to comply with an order for his deportation from France and the main issue, therefore, had been his right to stay in France. Accordingly, the measure was based on public-order considerations that did not concern civil law. The Government pointed out that the Commission had consistently expressed the view that proceedings relating to the entry, stay and deportation of aliens were outside the scope of that Article in so far as it concerned disputes over civil rights and obligations, the reason being that the acts in issue in such proceedings were governed by public law and represented the exercise of public-authority prerogatives. The fact that deportation orders generally had pecuniary or family implications for those concerned could not suffice to bring them within the civil limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1, as that would mean that all measures concerning immigration control were caught by the scope of that provision since they produced similar consequences for those on whom they were imposed. The Government concluded that litigation relating to exclusion orders, like all litigation concerning immigration control, could not be a civil dispute for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The Government agreed with that analysis, which was based on the elementary observation that exclusion orders were not penalties, but administrative measures, even if, unusually, the legislature had assigned the task of making such orders to the criminal courts. Indeed, that observation was supported by the fact that under the laws of most States the administrative authorities were also competent to make such orders, the purpose being not to punish a specific act but to deter foreign nationals from further infringing the legislation on the entry and stay of aliens. The aim of exclusion orders was therefore essentially preventive. It was that special characteristic that made it possible to request the rescission of such orders, no equivalent remedy being available for criminal penalties in the strict sense. Referring to the criteria established by the Court\u2019s case-law for determining whether a particular penalty was criminal in character, the Government contended that it appeared clear that an exclusion order could not be regarded as a penalty or as criminal in character for the purposes of the Convention. It was a measure peculiar to immigration control and one far removed from the context of ordinary criminal proceedings.",

Such proceedings did not entail any decision by the relevant court on the merits of the charge. The court did not decide whether the applicant was guilty of the offence forming the basis of the exclusion order. Indeed, the arguments generally relied on by applicants when seeking rescission of an exclusion order showed that the debate focused on the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances, which, by definition, did not concern the validity of the earlier conviction. The court to which the application for rescission was made merely had to decide whether or not it should remain in effect. Indeed, when applications for rescission were lodged, the applicant was no longer a \u201cperson charged\u201d since such applications were precluded unless the conviction had become final. Therefore applications for rescission of exclusion orders did not concern the penalty itself, but its enforcement. That observation had, moreover, led the Commission to express the opinion that the criminal limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable to disputes concerning applications for the rescission of such orders.",

In that connection, it notes that their characterisation within the domestic legal order is open to different interpretations. In any event, the domestic legal order\u2019s characterisation of a penalty cannot, by itself, be decisive for determining whether or not the penalty is criminal in nature. Other factors, notably the nature of the penalty concerned, have to be taken into account (see Tyler v. the United Kingdom, application no. 21283/93, Commission decision of 5 April 1994, DR 77, pp. 81-86). On that subject, the Court notes that, in general, exclusion orders are not classified as criminal within the member States of the Council of Europe. Such orders, which in most States may also be made by the administrative authorities, constitute a special preventive measure for the purposes of immigration control and do not concern the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The fact that they are imposed in the context of criminal proceedings cannot alter their essentially preventive nature. It follows that proceedings for rescission of such measures cannot be regarded as being in the criminal sphere either (see, mutatis mutandis, Renna v.\u00a0France, application no. 32809/96, Commission\u2019s decision of 26 February 1997, unreported).",

My conclusion that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is not applicable in the circumstances of this case, despite the fact that the impugned sanction is of a criminal nature, is founded on the consideration that the proceedings for the rescission of the deportation order are not criminal, i.e. they do not determine a criminal charge. Indeed, it seems to me, that they do not belong to the phase of the determination of a criminal charge, but to the phase of the execution of the sanction imposed; and consequently, following Strasbourg\u2019s constant case-law, are outside the ambit of protection of the Convention\u2019s guarantees.",

However, those guarantees concern expulsion, and then only of aliens who are lawfully resident in the territory. Yet, here, the measure in respect of which Mr Maaouia prays in aid Article 6 \u00a7 1 is not the expulsion of a lawfully resident alien but, as indicated in paragraph 25 of the judgment, an application for the rescission of an exclusion order made against him by the criminal courts because he had failed to comply with a deportation order and was, on the contrary, unlawfully present in France. In other words, even supposing that Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 constitutes the lex specialis that, in principle, operates as an exception to the lex generalis constituted by Article\u00a06 of the Convention, it still has to be shown that the lex specialis was applicable in the present case.

The answer is that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable when a court determines \u201cany criminal charge\u201d against a person who relies on that provision. Is it possible to maintain that a person who seeks rescission of an exclusion order is asking the Court to hold that the charge forming the basis of the order was unfounded? That seems to me to be a very wide, indeed artificial, interpretation. The aim of proceedings for the rescission of exclusion orders is not to have the penalties imposed by the criminal courts quashed. Such proceedings do not take the form of an appeal, an appeal on points of law or even an application for judicial review. Their aim is to persuade the trial court (in this case the court of appeal) to discontinue, for reasons of humanity, the effects of the exclusion order, but not to call into question either the operative provision or the reasoning contained in the judgment. This is illustrated in the instant case by the fact that Mr Maaouia had unsuccessfully challenged the exclusion order imposed by the court of appeal both on appeal to the Court of Cassation and by an application for judicial review. The exclusion order was therefore irrevocable and its validity was not called into question by the judgment of the same court which, ultimately, granted the applicant\u2019s request for rescission. It is for that reason that I was bound, not without regret, to vote in favour of the operative provision and to hold that, as Article 6 \u00a7 1 was inapplicable, it could not have been infringed.",

In my opinion, they constitute double punishment, not of course within the meaning of the non bis in idem rule, reflected in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 cited above, as there is nothing in the Convention to prevent a court imposing both a substantive and an ancillary penalty for the same offence. It is nonetheless double punishment in the humane sense of the term. Although already deprived in general of all the guarantees afforded nationals (see also paragraph 38 of the judgment), aliens who seek to avoid the consequences of deportation orders are liable by statute to a term of up to three years\u2019 imprisonment. Is it also necessary to impose statutory banishment on them? I should like to repeat what Mrs Tulkens and I said in our joint dissenting opinion in Baghli v. France (no. 34374/97, ECHR 1999-VIII), which concerned Article 8 of the Convention: this statutory increase in the debt which aliens owe to society does not appear necessary, to me, in a democratic society.",

In this regard, I see no reason to depart from the constant case-law of the Commission that, because of the substantial discretionary and public-order element in such decisions, proceedings relating to them are not to be seen as determining the civil rights of the person concerned, even if they inevitably but incidentally have major repercussions on his private and family life, prospects of employment, financial position and the like. Some support for this view is, as the Court points out, to be found in the Article 1 of Protocol No. 7. While I agree with Judge Costa that justification for the non-applicability of Article 6 cannot be found in the Protocol alone, I consider that the provisions of Article 1 of the Protocol at least serve to confirm the understanding of the Contracting Parties, based on the Commission\u2019s case-law, that decisions to deport a person do not in general involve a \u201cdetermination of civil rights and obligations\u201d so as to attract the procedural guarantees provided by Article 6.",

However, neither point leads me to conclude that the Commission\u2019s constant case-law should not be applied or to find that there the proceedings involved a determination of the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d. There was in my view a close relationship between the deportation order made by the Minister of the Interior and the exclusion order, the latter being dependent on the refusal of the applicant to comply with the former. Moreover, the proceedings to rescind the order and thereby regularise the applicant\u2019s immigration status in France must be seen as related to the \u201cstay\u201d of an alien and as falling within the established case-law, notwithstanding the fact that the decision to rescind can only be taken by a court.",

The same is true of the making of an exclusion order following the applicant\u2019s conviction for refusing to comply with the deportation order made against him: the proceedings leading to imposition of the order were required to comply with Article 6 of the Convention, whether the order is to be regarded as a penalty or as essentially a preventive measure.",

I believe that if a term allows more than one interpretation, the one which enhances individual rights is more in line with the object and purpose of the Convention and should always be preferred. Even the Court in following its restrictive approach has felt the need to extend the application of the terms \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d to matters that do not ordinarily belong to the sphere of private law. For instance, the Court held that a dispute between an applicant and a public authority concerning the grant of a licence to which the applicant claimed to be entitled was a determination of a civil right in spite of the applicability of rules of public law in such cases3. One could add here the examples of claims for social security and social assistance4, for a judge\u2019s pension5, etc. Generally, the trend of the Court has been to include more and more situations within the terms \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, even though such situations cannot be explained by reference to the criterion of private law.

It would be absurd to accept that the judicial safeguards were intended only for certain rights, particularly those between individuals, and not for all legal rights and obligations, including those vis \u00e0 vis the administration, where an independent judicial control is especially required for the protection of individuals against the powerful authorities of the State.
