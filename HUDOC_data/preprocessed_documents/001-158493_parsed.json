Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives ...

In the second case, by judgment of 4 August 2011, the Elizovskiy District Court of the Kamchatka Region found in favour of Mr D., who had contracted tuberculosis while in detention and had not received treatment in a timely fashion. The Government claimed that the applicant\u2019s complaint had not been based on any known structural problem and that he was therefore required to put his grievances before the domestic authorities prior to lodging his application with the Court (here they referred to Ismatullayev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 29687/09, 6\u00a0March 2012).",

The floor plan indicates that the dormitory of the applicant\u2019s unit measured 164 square metres. It follows that, even if the lower occupancy figure were to be accepted, the available personal space per prisoner fell even below the domestic statutory requirement of two square metres. In previous cases against Russia concerning conditions of detention in correctional colonies, the Court has found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in similar circumstances (see Sergey Babushkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056; Yepishin v.

This arrangement obviously left inmates with very little space in which they could easily move around.

Reporting on the conditions of detention in correctional facilities in Eastern Europe, the CPT found in particular that large-capacity dormitories frequently accommodated prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions and inevitably entailed a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives (see Fetisov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, \u00a7 137, 17 January 2012, and also the relevant extracts from the CPT reports cited in paragraph 20 above). In Fetisov and Others, the Court did not find a violation of Article 3 in connection with the accommodation of a large number of prisoners in the same dormitory because it could not be established that it was filled beyond the intended capacity. However, in cases where the applicants were housed, together with dozens of other inmates, in a dormitory in which they had at their disposal only minimal personal space, the Court held that the level of privacy available to them was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention (see Yepishin, cited above, \u00a7 65; Kulikov, cited above, \u00a7 37; Iacov Stanciu v. Romania, no.\u00a035972/05, \u00a7 177, 24 July 2012, and Samaras and Others v. Greece, no.\u00a011463/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-66, 28\u00a0February 2012). The circumstances of the present case, in which the applicant shared the cramped dormitory with at least eighty inmates, are relevantly similar to the latter cases.",

While access to prison work is not a requirement under Article\u00a03 or any other provision of the Convention, the Court concurs with the CPT that the possibility of engaging in purposeful activities of a varied nature, including work, training, education and sport, is of crucial importance to the wellbeing of sentenced prisoners and conducive to their rehabilitation and reintegration (see Iacov Stanciu, cited above, \u00a7 178, and point 33 of the CPT\u2019s 11th General Report cited in paragraph 20 above). In the applicant\u2019s own submission, in the daytime the detainees were excluded from the dormitory and had the choice between staying outdoors and going to the recreation room. That room measured less than fifty square metres and the equipment was limited to a single TV set and a few writing desks and stools. Given the size of the room and the number of prisoners in the applicant\u2019s unit, it is obvious that in cold or rainy weather the recreation room would be severely overcrowded, even more so than the dormitory. This further exacerbated the overcrowding problem in the daytime.",
