In the case of Victoros v. Christodoulou, (1992) 1 A.A.D. 512 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment at first instance because it had been issued 5 years and 3 months after the completion of the hearing, without any justification by the trial court. For this reason the Court of Appeal also judged that the delay was detrimental to the rights of the parties and consequently there was a violation of the provisions of Article 30 (2) of the Constitution. Of course, in the case we are examining nothing of this kind has occurred. In a recent decision of the Court of Appeal in the civil appeal no. 9520 Nikos Shacolas and Federal bank of Lebanon (S.A.L.), of 7.7.98, extensive mention is made of the most recent jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, with particular reference to the case of The Police v. Akis Fantis and others (1994) 2 A.A.D. 160 and The Republic v. Alan Ford and another (no.2) (1995) 2 A.A.D. 232.",

Stavros Nathanael (1993) 1 A.A.D. 893, in which the damages awarded in cases of slander and libel were increased. Independently of what we have already stated, the above suggestion of the appellants' advocate is erroneous in law. The right of the claimant to damages arising from a civil wrong is created at the perpetration of the wrong. The calculation of the damages is made, according to settled jurisprudence, on the day of the trial, when consideration is given to all the factors which have intervened and affect the calculation of the damages which, whatever they are, go back to the time when the right arose. Theoretically the damages can also be reduced according to the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court\u201d.",

The appellant claimed that the judge in question had participated in another appeal against another interim decision in the context of the same recourse. The Supreme Court by interim judgment of 27 June 2003 found that the application was unfounded and that the mere participation of the judge in question in a previous appeal procedure with a bench of a different composition did not exempt him from the present procedure. The issues in question were completely different and concerned interim procedures. The substance of the recourse which would be the subject matter of the hearing had not yet been examined.

To recapitulate, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant's status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State's interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in the Pellegrin judgment, a \u201cspecial bond of trust and loyalty\u201d between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article\u00a06 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (Vilho Eskelinen and Others\u00a0v.

The Supreme Court did not examine constitutional matters ex proprio motu. The Government pointed out that the Supreme Court, as an appeal court, had the power to set aside judgments, to order a retrial or deliver any judgment it considered appropriate. This was applicable whether it sat as an appeal court in an administrative recourse or a civil case. In this respect the Government relied on the Supreme Court's judgment in the case of A.

However, the only remedies to be exhausted are those which are effective. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time (see, inter alia, Vernillo v.

However, firstly, it is obvious that this remedy cannot expedite the determination of an applicant's case. Secondly, this case does not indicate whether and if so, how an applicant could in reality obtain compensatory relief in respect of his or her length complaint by raising this complaint in the context of his appeal. In particular, in the case cited by the Government the Supreme Court did not find a violation of this right and its judgment does not clearly indicate, in the event of the finding of a violation, that this remedy could provide an applicant with adequate redress for delays that had already occurred. The Government did not supply any example from domestic practice showing that, by using the means in question, it was possible for the applicant to obtain such a relief (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 159).

Furthermore, the mere fact that the bench that examined the appeal against the first instance judgment (appeal no. 3190) included two judges that had also been part of the bench that had decided the interim appeal (appeal no.\u00a02594), does not in the Court's view, in the circumstances of the present case, constitute a ground for requiring their exclusion from deciding on the merits of the case. In particular the Court observes that the issues the judges examined when considering the interim appeal in relation to the preliminary objection were not the same as those which were examined and decided by the final judgment. The question that was examined by the Supreme Court at the interim appeal proceedings was whether an appeal could be lodged against the relevant interim decision. The interim appeal was rejected on the basis that the interim decision was not determinative of the rights or obligations of the litigants and that the interim decision could be considered in the context of an appeal against the first instance judgment. The Supreme Court's judgment was confined to this question; it did not consider the matter raised by the applicants as to whether the recourses had been out of time (see paragraph 21 above). This question was considered by the Supreme Court in the main appeal proceedings (see paragraph 34 above).",

Thus, future income cannot be considered to constitute \u201cpossessions\u201d unless it has already been earned or is definitely payable (see, inter alia, Anheuser-Busch Inc.\u00a0v.
