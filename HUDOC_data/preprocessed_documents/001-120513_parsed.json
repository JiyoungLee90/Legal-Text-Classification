In particular, the Court notes that Mr K., the lawyer who had represented the applicant at trial, was apparently prepared to continue defending the applicant in the subsequent proceedings. However, the applicant turned down his assistance without providing an acceptable explanation and sought to have him replaced by a lawyer who had previously represented one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants. Both the Odessa Court and the Supreme Court examined the applicant\u2019s pleas in this regard and found that there were no grounds for replacing Mr K. or for allowing the applicant\u2019s wife to take part in the proceedings as the applicant\u2019s defence counsel. The Court does not discern any reason to disagree with those findings (see, for instance, Vasiliy\u00a0Ivashchenko v. Ukraine, no. 760/03, \u00a7 91, 26 July 2012). Although the applicant argued before this Court that he had not had sufficient means to engage Mr K. for the proceedings on appeal in cassation, the Court notes that the applicant did not make such a statement before the domestic authorities (compare and contrast with Maksimenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a039488/07, \u00a7 26, 20 December 2011). The applicant did not give any details of the arrangements on the basis of which Mr K. had represented him, including the cost of the lawyer\u2019s services. The fact that Mr K. did not attend the hearing on 10 July 2003 before the Supreme Court might have been linked to the applicant\u2019s failure to cooperate with him and cannot be imputable to the State. In any event, the Court notes that the applicant was not precluded from obtaining legal advice prior to that hearing from Mr K., who was familiar with the case and who had had sufficient access to the case file. Although the Court has previously found that the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 did not provide for a procedure by which a lawyer providing free legal representation in proceedings before the Supreme Court might be appointed (see Maksimenko, cited above, \u00a7 31), in the present case it has not been demonstrated that this shortcoming led to any disadvantage for the applicant\u2019s defence.",
