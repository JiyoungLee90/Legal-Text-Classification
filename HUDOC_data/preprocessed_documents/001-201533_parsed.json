Slovenia (no.\u00a040938/16, \u00a7 99, 30 October 2018), where the Court found that the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental rights had not been based on her psychiatric diagnosis, but on her consequent inability to take care of her child, which had been confirmed by all the expert reports produced in the domestic proceedings. In the present case, the Court finds that no evidence was produced to support the allegation that the applicant was unable to care for his daughter. It also notes that the child-protection authority, which interviewed both parents, did not make such assertions in its report, but merely recommended that the court take into consideration the child\u2019s best interests (see paragraph 11 above). The Court does not find, in the domestic courts\u2019 decisions, any reasoning that would allow it to conclude that X\u2019s allegations as to the applicant\u2019s inability to care for his child (see paragraph\u00a08 in fine above) had been sufficiently explored by the domestic courts (see, mutatis mutandis, X v.

The Court cannot find any arguments in the domestic decisions indicating the benefits for the child of such a contact arrangement.

Only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or \u201cstatus\u201d, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article\u00a014 (see F\u00e1bi\u00e1n, cited above, \u00a7 113 and the references therein). In this context, the Court reiterates that the words \u201cother status\u201d have generally been given a wide meaning in its case-law (see Carson and Others [v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a042184/05, ECHR 2010], \u00a7 70) and their interpretation has not been limited to characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, \u00a7\u00a7 56-59, 13 July 2010). For example, a discrimination issue arose in cases where the applicants\u2019 status, which served as the alleged basis for discriminatory treatment, was determined in relation to their family situation, such as their children\u2019s place of residence (see\u00a0Efe v. Austria, no. 9134/06, \u00a7\u00a048, 8\u00a0January\u00a02013). It thus follows, in the light of its objective and nature of the rights which it seeks to safeguard, that Article 14 of the Convention also covers instances in which an individual is treated less favourably on the basis of another person\u2019s status or protected characteristics (see Guberina v.
