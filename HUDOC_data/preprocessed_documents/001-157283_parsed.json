They considered that these circumstances increased the risks of absconding, tampering with the witnesses and destroying the evidence. The Court cannot discern any link between the administrative offence and the declared risks for want of any details. As regards the risks of absconding and re-offending, if any, they could have been effectively dealt with by other preventive measures.",

It is not clear, however, why the applicant had to remain in detention to do so. Certainly, if released, he could have accessed the file under the same arrangements as persons to whom the pre-trial detention had never been applied. Moreover, the Court has previously found that the provisions of Russian law concerning the extension of detention pending study of case file by a defendant were not foreseeable in their application, in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Tsarenko v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05963, 3 March 2011; Suslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 75-79; and Pyatkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 86-91, 13 November 2012).

Each time, having found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3, the Court has noted a number of deficiencies in the reasoning employed by the Russian courts to authorise keeping an applicant in custody. From case to case it has pointed out the following major defects in the courts\u2019 arguments: reliance on the seriousness of the charges as the primary source to justify the risk of the applicant absconding; reference to the applicant\u2019s travel passport, financial resources and the fact that his alleged accomplices are on the run as the basis for the assumption that he would follow suit; a suspicion, in the absence of any evidence, that he would interfere with witnesses or use his connections in State bodies to obstruct justice; and a failure to thoroughly examine the possibility of applying another, less rigid preventive measure, such as release on bail.",

They gave no heed to important and relevant facts supporting the applicants\u2019 petitions for release and reducing the above risks, such as clean criminal record, permanent place of residence and the numerous positive references and personal guarantees. There was no evidence that either applicant had ever tried to contact the victims or witnesses in the course of the criminal proceedings, or that they had intended to abscond. Furthermore, the courts gave no reason for dismissing the applicants\u2019 requests for an alternative preventive measure, in particular, a bail, personal guarantee, or house-arrest.",

Conversely, when the applicants\u2019 criminal case files were submitted to court, it extended their detention by means of collective detention orders of 6 June 2013 and 19 November 2013 (in respect of the first and the second applicants), and of 14 April 2014 (in respect of the third applicant), having dispensed with proper regard to each applicant\u2019s individual circumstances. The Court has previously found this practice incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention in so far as it permitted the continued detention of a group of persons without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds or compliance with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Shcheglyuk v.

By failing to address specific facts underpinning the existence of such risks or consider alternative preventive measures and by relying essentially on the gravity of the charges, the courts extended the applicants\u2019 detention on grounds which cannot be regarded as relevant and sufficient in order to justify the length of the detention; these omissions only aggravated as the proceedings progressed.

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003IV). In this context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

In Ananyev and Others, cited above, the Court set out the relevant standards for deciding whether or not there has been a violation of Article 3 on account of a lack of personal space. In particular, the Court has to have regard to the following three elements: (a)\u00a0each detainee must have an individual sleeping place in the cell; (b)\u00a0each must dispose of at least 3\u00a0square metres of floor space; and (c)\u00a0the overall surface area of the cell must be such as to allow detainees to move freely between items of furniture. The absence of any of the above elements creates in itself a strong presumption that the conditions of detention amounted to degrading treatment and were in breach of Article\u00a03 (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0148; see further Olszewski v. Poland, no. 21880/03, \u00a7\u00a098, 2 April 2013).",
