Ukraine, no. 22313/04, \u00a7 65, 28 October 2010). The Court observes that the possibility of a retrial as requested by the applicant in the present case is envisaged in Ukrainian legislation (see Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v. Ukraine, no. 42310/04, \u00a7 297, 21 April 2011). It emphasises that such a trial must observe the substantive and procedural safeguards enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention (ibid.).",
