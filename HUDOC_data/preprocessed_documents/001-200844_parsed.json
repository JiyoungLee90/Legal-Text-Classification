The Court is of the view that given the subject matter (see paragraph 11 above) the proceedings could not be considered complex, nor can the applicants be blamed for delays which were not attributable to them. Further, the Court reiterates that it holds a State responsible under the \u201creasonable time\u201d aspect of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 for delay by judges in delivering their judgments (see McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, \u00a7 121, 10 September 2010 and the case lawcited therein). Save for three months which were attributable to the applicants\u2019 request (see paragraph 12 above) no explanation whatsoever has been given for the period of over five years for the judge to deliver a firstinstance decision, which in itself suffices to find a violation. Thus, even assuming that some of the delay in the proceedings was attributable to the two applicants in the present case, having examined all the material submitted to it, and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that seventeen years to obtain the examination of, inter alia, a complaint concerning the length of prior proceedings is particularly long. It follows, that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",

The amount awarded to the applicant was based solely on the exercise by the domestic court judges\u2019 of their discretion as to what might constitute appropriate pecuniary redress in the circumstances of the applicants\u2019 own case. The mere fact that the amount of compensation given was low does not render the remedy in itself ineffective, although it does have an impact on the Court\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s victim status concerning the length of proceedings complaint (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Zarb, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051, and \u015aliwi\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a040063/06, \u00a7\u00a036, 5\u00a0January 2010 respectively) as also happened in the present case (see paragraph 27-28 above). In particular, the Court notes that, in the present case, the Constitutional Court awarded EUR 5,000 for sixteen years over two jurisdictions, an award which is significantly lower (around 25%) of what the Court would have awarded in a similar case. Further, the Court observes that the two cases indicated by the applicants related to proceedings concerning \u201creasonable time\u201d, support their claim that, as happened in the present case, the Constitutional Court generally awards sums which do not constitute adequate redress (compare, Apap\u00a0Bologna, cited above, \u00a7\u00a089, in relation to pecuniary awards in property cases). In particular, in the first case no compensation whatsoever was awarded for a delay of more than twenty-years over two instances, and in the second case the Constitutional Court awarded EUR\u00a02,000 for a delay of forty-three years at one instance, which represents less than 7\u00a0% of what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. The cases brought forward by the Government (see paragraph 54 above) do not dispel such concerns - quite the opposite, in particular the first case shows that the Constitutional Court made awards which were significantly lower (between 20 and 40\u00a0% of the amount), and the second case that it made awards which were manifestly unreasonably lower (as low as 8% of the amount) than what the Court would have awarded in those circumstances. Thus, the material brought forward by the parties appears to be sufficient evidence to show that the remedy at issue does not fulfil this criterion due to a regular practice of significantly or unreasonably low compensation awards in such cases, as happened in the present case, or even no compensation at all.",

In particular, the Court has held that to conform with the reasonable time principle, a remedy for length of proceedings should not in principle and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, last more than two and half years over two jurisdictions, including the execution phase (see Gagliano Giorgi v. Italy, no. 23563/07, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2012). The Court notes that quite apart from the fact that in the present case the proceedings before the constitutional jurisdictions lasted unreasonably long, the cases brought forward by the Government also indicate a substantial delay, as for example five years for one-instance (see paragraph\u00a054 above). In the absence of any examples showing a timely assessment of such complaints the Court has serious doubts about the speediness of the remedial action itself.",
