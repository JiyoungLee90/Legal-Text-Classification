As to the rest, it reiterated that while it was true that the first steps of the extradition process had been in accordance with the 1939 Convention and the subsequent ones with the 1957 Convention; it was also true that  had made a reservation, when ratifying the 1957 Convention, to the effect that its bilateral agreement would prevail. However,  had not made such a reservation or acknowledged the  one. This, thus, led to a situation where for  the 1939 Convention applied and for  the 1957 Convention applied. This was clearly unworkable. Thus, it was obvious that the reservation could only apply if both States had coinciding declarations. As to the decision to keep the applicant in preventive detention the court found that the CL\u2019s decision had been a legitimate exercise of discretion in which the CL had considered the seriousness of the offences, the evidence presented and any other conditions relevant to the aim of successfully extraditing the applicant. Therefore, the conditions for the application of such a measure were fulfilled under both Conventions. Moreover, it could not be said that the extradition process had caused the applicant prejudice at any time. The process had been in conformity with the Italian request and the relevant Conventions at different stages. This constituted a legitimate basis for the entire extradition proceedings including the duration of the detention. Thus, it further confirmed the order of arrest of 12 August 2009 and the decision of the appeal judge of 7 September 2009, which were thereby definitive.",

The applicant stated that he was appealing the decision of 23 November 2009 which had rejected his appeal of \u201c5\u00a0October\u00a02009\u201d. He argued, inter alia, that he had been extradited without being heard and without being notified of the authorisations relevant to such procedure except for the order of 18 September 2009, and pointed to other irregularities which vitiated the request such as the application of two Conventions which had different formal requirements, and the issues raised in his submissions of 24 August 2009. In consequence he considered that the extradition had to be considered invalid.",

The court held that, as to the notification, both the applicant and his lawyers had been informed of the arrest order dated 12\u00a0August 2009 on the same day, and the Italian ordinance on which the arrest order was based had been notified the subsequent day. Following that, the applicant\u2019s lawyers had had full access to him while in detention and to all the relevant documents in the proceedings. The applicant had been heard in a hearing and had made use of multiple remedies in respect of every step of the proceedings. The court reiterated that all these proceedings had been governed by the 1957 Convention, as the prevailing instrument and that any order based on the 1939 Convention had not prejudiced the applicant in his right to liberty. On the substance it considered that there had been sufficient logical and juridical justification to accept the Italian request for extradition which had been submitted including all the relevant and necessary elements according to the relevant international legal texts. Lastly, the Terza Istanza Penale noted that the appeal judge had upheld the prosecutor\u2019s objections that there had been nothing new in this application which was therefore inadmissible. Bearing in mind all the above, it considered the appeal manifestly ill-founded and confirmed the order of 18 September 2009 for the applicant\u2019s extradition.",

The Court does not accept the applicant\u2019s submission as to the distinct nature of the subject matter of those proceedings. Indeed in both proceedings he reiterated the same points in respect to his two complaints, namely the preventive detention and the extradition order. It follows that the matter was brought twice before the same jurisdictions, reiterating, in substance, the same arguments. However, the Court observes that the judgment of 20 November 2009 had rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint against the extradition order as being premature, the complaint being still pending before the judge in the second set of proceedings. Thus, in respect of that complaint, the Court is of the view that the applicant had legitimate grounds to wait for the end of the second set of proceedings. Therefore, the Court considers that the second set of proceedings was repetitive and devoid of prospects of success (see Barc Company Ltd v Malta, (dec). no. 38478/06, 21 September 2010) only in so far as it regarded the complaint regarding the preventive detention before the extradition order which had been decided definitely in the first set of proceedings.",
