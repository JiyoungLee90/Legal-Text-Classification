After social attitudes had changed, the system had been altered with effect from 1 April 1985 and gave married women an independent right to insurance and benefits under the Act. As changes in social attitudes occurred gradually, it was virtually impossible to indicate with precision when a change had taken place in society that eliminated a justification derived from social attitudes. However, the question of whether periods were insured had to be answered on the basis of the provisions that applied at the material time.

In the applicant's opinion other legislation could have been brought in. As to the point in time when social attitudes had changed, the applicant argued that even in 1957 the principle of equality and the resulting prohibition on discrimination were a general principle of both national and international law. In that connection, she referred to Article 1 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which stated that \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights\u201d. She further referred, inter alia, to Article 14 of the Convention (1950), the Netherlands Act of 14 June 1956 abolishing the legal incapacity of married women, and Article 12 \u00a7 4 of the European Social Charter (1961), by which the Contracting States undertook to ensure equal treatment of their own nationals with nationals of other Contracting Parties in respect of social-security rights.
