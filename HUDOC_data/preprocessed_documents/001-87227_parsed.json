The applicants accordingly argued that following their arrest Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov had been under the control of the State. They stressed that their relatives had been apprehended in life-threatening circumstances and contended that the fact that Apti Isigov and Zelimkhan Umkhanov were not listed among those being held in detention centres proved that their lives had been endangered after their arrest, since it was widespread practice in Chechnya for people apprehended by State agents to be deprived of their lives either immediately, or shortly afterwards. Relying on Article 2 of the Convention, they thus argued that the fact that their relatives had remained missing since 12 May 2001 proved that they had been killed. They also claimed that the special operation carried out on the aforementioned date had not been properly planned and supervised by the authorities to ensure that it met the requirements of Article 2.",

Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities' reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan v. , no. 25656/94, \u00a7\u00a0358, 18 June 2002; and Bitiyeva and X\u00a0v. , nos.\u00a057953/00 and 37392/03, \u00a7\u00a0152, 21\u00a0June 2007).",

Having regard to its above conclusions, there is indeed a direct causal link between the violation of Article\u00a02 in respect of the applicants' family members and the loss by the applicants of the financial support which they could have provided for them. The Court finds that the loss of earnings also applies to dependants and considers it reasonable to assume that the applicants' family members would eventually have had some earnings and that the applicants would have benefited from these. Having regard to the applicants' submissions, the Court awards the first applicant EUR 5,000 and the third, fourth and fifth applicants jointly EUR\u00a015,000 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on those amounts.",
