The report states that \u201caccording to the bilateral agreements, migrants caught entering Poland, Slovakia and Hungary without permission can be summarily returned if caught within 48 hours of a crossing. The launching of an appeal in Slovakia and Hungary does not suspend the return and returnees do not have access to minimal information on arrest and return. In practice, Human Rights Watch found that migrants were often tricked into believing they would not be returned, were asked to sign papers they did not understand, and were not always given an opportunity to contact a lawyer, NGOs or UNHCR.\u201d Specifically with regard to Slovakia, Human Rights Watch stated that \u201cthe most common complaint heard from migrants who had been returned from Slovakia was that their asylum claims were ignored and that they were treated in summary fashion [and] quickly sent back within hours of apprehension in Slovakia, with little opportunity to make any claim to remain.",

The fact that a number of aliens are subject to similar decisions does not in itself lead to the conclusion that there is a collective expulsion, if each person concerned has been given the opportunity to put arguments against his or her expulsion to the competent authorities on an individual basis (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0239; see also M.A.\u00a0v.

However, Article 4 of Protocol\u00a0No. 4 does not guarantee the right to an individual interview in all circumstances, as the requirements of this provision may be satisfied where each alien has a genuine and effective possibility of submitting arguments against his or her expulsion, and where those arguments are examined in an appropriate manner by the authorities of the respondent State (see Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7 248; N.D. and N.T. v.

The Court also reiterates the right of States to establish their own immigration policies, potentially in the context of bilateral cooperation or in accordance with their obligations stemming from membership of the European Union (see Georgia v. Russia (I), cited above, \u00a7 177; Sharifi\u00a0and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0224; and Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0241). Furthermore, the Court has previously emphasised the challenges facing European States in terms of immigration control as a result of the economic crisis and recent social and political changes which have had a particular impact on certain regions of Africa and the Middle East (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, \u00a7 223; Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 122 and 176; and Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0241). Nevertheless, the Court has also stressed that the problems which States may encounter in managing migratory flows or in the reception of asylum-seekers cannot justify recourse to practices which are not compatible with the Convention or the Protocols thereto (see Hirsi\u00a0Jamaa and Others, cited above, \u00a7 179; N.D. and N.T. v.

However, according to the case-law cited in paragraph 57, this fact cannot in itself be decisive. In the Court\u2019s view, the relatively simple and standardised nature of the expulsion orders can be explained by the fact that the transcripts of the applicants\u2019 interviews do not contain any statement regarding any possible ill-treatment in the event of their readmission to Ukraine or regarding the existence of any other legal obstacles to their expulsion. It is therefore not unreasonable for those orders to have been justified merely by the fact that the applicants were third-country nationals who had committed an administrative offence by unlawfully crossing the Slovak border, and by the absence of any of the situations provided in section 81 of the Aliens Act (see paragraph 10 above).",

According to these transcripts, all the interviews were carried out on 17\u00a0November 2014 between 9.10 and 12.30, lasted exactly ten minutes and were conducted by two police officers in the presence of the interpreter (see paragraph 8 above). It is true that the official times of some interviews overlapped, which the Government explained by the fact that there could have been some errors in the recording of those interviews owing to the fact that the interviews had taken place in the night and early morning hours. Even if, in the Court\u2019s view, such an explanation does not appear entirely plausible, given that the interviews took place between 9.10 and 12.30, it is not in itself sufficient to justify the applicants\u2019 view that the interviews were not conducted on an individual basis. Moreover, the Court has already held that Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 does not guarantee the right to an individual interview in all circumstances (see paragraph 57 in fine above).",

As a rule, the fact that a complaint has been declared admissible is a strong indication that it can be regarded as arguable for the purposes of Article 13, even if the Court ultimately finds no breach of the substantive provision in issue (see, for example, Hatton and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2003VIII).
