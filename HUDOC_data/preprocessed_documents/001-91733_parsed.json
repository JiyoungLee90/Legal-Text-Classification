The investigation into the abduction of Salakh Elsiyev, Iskhadzhi Demelkhanov, Adam Boltiyev, Dzhabrail Debishev, Lom-Ali Abubakarov, Ramzan Mandiyev, Akhmed Demilkhanov and Aslambek Agmerzayev had been opened seven days after the events and had then been suspended and resumed six times \u2013 thus delaying the taking of the most basic steps \u2013 and the applicants had not been properly informed of the most important investigative measures.

The investigation in case no.\u00a075089 was instituted on 11 September 2002, that is, seven days after the abduction of Salakh Elsiyev, Iskhadzhi Demelkhanov, Adam Boltiyev, Dzhabrail Debishev, Lom-Ali Abubakarov, Ramzan Mandiyev, Akhmed Demilkhanov and Aslambek Agmerzayev. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect an investigation into kidnappings in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that a number of essential steps were subsequently delayed or were not taken at all. For instance, the crime-scene examination at the place where the filtration point had been located during the special operation took place only in January 2006 (see paragraphs 109-110), three and half years after the events. Even though within the first few days of the investigation the district prosecutor\u2019s office identified the military and law-enforcement units which had been involved in the security operation and the officers in charge of the operation (see paragraphs 41 and 44-47), the investigators failed to question either the commanding officers or the servicemen who had participated in the operation. Furthermore, the Court notes that, as can be seen from the decision of the Shali District Court, after receiving the information confirming the involvement of military servicemen in the abduction of the applicants\u2019 relatives, the investigators tried to transfer the criminal case to the military prosecutor\u2019s office on two occasions (see paragraph 136 above), but the latter returned the case to the district prosecutor\u2019s office without having taken any investigative measures. Further, even though the investigation established that the \u201cAvtoZak\u201d vehicle in which the applicants\u2019 relatives had been detained at the filtration point belonged to the Ministry of Justice (see paragraph 125), the investigators failed to identify and question the servicemen who had used this vehicle during the security operation. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays and omissions, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",
