The case originated in an application (no. 3945/10) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Klavdiya Nikolayevna Sukhonosova (“the applicant”), on 14 December 2009. An additional application form was submitted on 12 September 2010.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Khoroshev, a lawyer practising in Krasnoyarsk. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 20 September 2017 the Government were given notice of the complaints concerning the alleged unlawfulness of the applicant’s detention and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Krasnodar.
On 23 August 2005 the applicant was convicted of two episodes of aggravated embezzlement and given a suspended sentence of four years’ imprisonment.
On 9 April 2009 the applicant was convicted of (a) smuggling banned substances and (b) illegal procurement, possession and supply of banned substances. The applicant was sentenced to a four-year prison term. The custodial sentence had the legal effect of annulling the suspensive clause of the first sentence. The cumulative sentence was that of a five years’ imprisonment. The applicant was taken into custody in the courtroom.
On 30 June 2009 the appellate court upheld the judgment of 9 April 2009.
On 15 September 2009 the Presidium of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, acting on the applicant’s supervisory-review application modified the judgment of 23 August 2005. It removed the aggravating element and reduced the applicant’s sentence. She was immediately exempted from serving it because, by that time, the statute of limitations had expired.
On 1 June 2010 the Presidium of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, in the supervisory-review proceedings, quashed the appeal judgment of 30 June 2009 and remitted it for a new appeal hearing.
On 12 August 2010 the appellate court pronounced a partial acquittal of the applicant on the charge of smuggling and also removed a reference to the first conviction. As a consequence, the sentence was reduced to one and a half years’ imprisonment. As by that moment the applicant had served a longer time, the appellate court ordered her immediate release.
The applicant was released on the following day, 13 August 2010.
