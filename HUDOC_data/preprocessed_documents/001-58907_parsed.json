The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see the Ruiz Torija v. Spain and Hiro Balani v. Spain judgments of 9 December 1994, Series A nos. 303-A and 303-B, p.\u00a012, \u00a7 29, and pp. 29-30, \u00a7 27; and the Higgins and Others v.

Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court\u2019s decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the Helle v. Finland judgment of 19\u00a0December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p.\u00a02930, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60).",

It went on to say that it likewise endorsed the legal reasoning of the impugned decision in so far as it was not incompatible with its own findings. On that point, it held that there was not the slightest evidence in the case file to prove that the applicant had acted as counsel in summary foreclosure proceedings no. 843/81, although he might have performed non-contentious services.

In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see the Schenk v. Switzerland judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p.\u00a029, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46).",

In the judgment at the appeal stage the Audiencia Provincial endorsed the statement of the facts and the legal reasoning set out in the judgment at first instance in so far as they did not conflict with its own findings.
