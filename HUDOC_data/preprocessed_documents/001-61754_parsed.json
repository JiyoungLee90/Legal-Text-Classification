Acknowledging that incidental friction between the available and necessary capacity of custodial clinics could not be wholly excluded, the National Ombudsman further held that an additional delay of no longer than three months at the very most might still be acceptable.

According to the Netherlands Government, efforts were being made to improve/accelerate the outflow of TBS patients to mainstream psychiatric facilities and the new statutory provision for the conditional lifting of TBS orders was expected both to increase the outflow of TBS patients as well as to reduce the number of patients entering custodial clinics.",

In these experiments, therapists attached to forensic outpatient departments offered a form of preparatory therapy designed to alleviate anxiety about the eventual TBS treatment and to reduce the growing hostility felt by these people towards the justice system. According to the Government, the initial results of these experiments were encouraging in that the persons involved \u2013 therapists, prison staff and inmates \u2013 had all responded positively, and there was a growing demand among prisoners awaiting admission to a TBS institution for this kind of support (pp. 40-41).",

This order, being initially valid for two years and comprising confinement in a custodial clinic, took effect on 5 February 1998. Although the applicant had served his prison sentence on that date, the subsequent period of his deprivation of liberty remained covered by the judgments of 21\u00a0January and 16 September 1997. Accordingly, the applicant's detention between 5 February 1998 and 5 February 2000 falls within the scope of both sub-paragraphs (a) and (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The fact that the authorities were facing practical difficulties in finding accommodation for the applicant in such a clinic and had to keep him in a remand centre until 17 May 1999 cannot by itself justify a deviation from the terms of the judgment in question which, as already pointed out, was the only lawful basis for depriving the applicant of his liberty.

It also creates a risk of arbitrariness. I would note that the Court has repeatedly held in respect of the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement under Article 6 of the Convention that the authorities cannot rely on practical difficulties to justify unreasonable delays and that the High Contracting Parties are expected to organise their judicial system in such a way as to meet the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Andrzej and Barbara Pi\u0142ka v.

The  found the applicant to represent a threat to public safety and in order to protect society it imposed a confinement order on him. The confinement order implied that the applicant should not be released on the date on which he became eligible for early release but should remain in detention for a further period of, initially, two years. It followed from the legislation in force that the applicant would not have been placed immediately in a custodial clinic. A time-limit of six months was provided for under the law, with the possibility of further extensions of three months. The fact that the confinement order was aimed at having the applicant undergo treatment of his mental disorder did not affect in my view the main ground for his detention, namely the protection of society after a conviction for serious crimes (see, mutatis mutandis, Bizzotto v. Greece, judgment of 15\u00a0November 1996, Reports 1996-V). The prolongation decisions taken in the present case were examined on appeal by the Appeals Board, which took into consideration the available capacity, an indication of the average duration of transitory stays in remand centres, a report in relation to the applicant's mental condition, and a statement by a doctor on the question whether the applicant, in view of his mental condition, was able to stay any longer, on a transitory basis, in a remand centre. I cannot follow the Court in finding both the law in general and the decisions of the Appeals Board arbitrary. In my view the applicant's detention in a remand centre was justified under sub-paragraph (a) of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.",
