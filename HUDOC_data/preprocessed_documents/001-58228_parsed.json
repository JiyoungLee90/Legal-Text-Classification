Thus, the applicant had a permanent address where she lived with her husband and two daughters. Also, the applicant had known about the criminal charges against her for more than six months prior to her arrest but had made no attempt to abscond or obstruct the investigation. Furthermore, the evidence against the applicant was weak, it having been established that six other persons had been in possession of a key to the cashier\u2019s office. The prosecutor had blindly followed the conclusions of the auditors who had pointed to the applicant on the sole ground that she had been the person in charge. However, there was nothing to show that the applicant had been the author of the false entries in the accounting books. The applicant\u2019s lawyer also invoked his client\u2019s medical condition and enclosed medical certificates.",
