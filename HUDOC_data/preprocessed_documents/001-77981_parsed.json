In any claim against a public authority for financial compensation in respect of past discrimination it must be remembered that the general public (often the general body of taxpayers) will be footing the bill. In determining the requirements of just satisfaction, just as in the application of the Convention as a whole, regard should be had not only to the victim\u2019s rights but also to the interests of the public generally. Take a case where A establishes discrimination on the basis that he should have been placed in the same class as B, both of them advantaged financially over class C. To compensate A for his past financial disadvantage vis \u00e0 vis B would be costly for C (the non-benefiting class of taxpayers)\u2014disproportionately so if class A is large, classes B and C comparatively small. Whether this would be fair to C would depend upon the justification for advantaging A and B over C in the first place and indeed for doing so to the extent that B was originally advantaged over A and C. It might well be fairer overall to leave A uncompensated in respect of the past discrimination against him. At the very least, bearing in mind that class A are taxpayers too, fairness to C might require that class A\u2019s compensation be reduced to reflect the fact that they too would have had to pay more tax to fund their own additional benefits. Just these considerations, indeed, may yet arise in the parallel case of Hooper were a claim for just satisfaction now to be advanced in .",

It could not then reasonably be argued that the men\u2019s excess wages represented an unjustified windfall which should not properly be paid to the women also. Such an argument, indeed, would almost certainly fail even if the employer proved that, had all employees been paid the same, this would have been at the women\u2019s (lower) rate\u2014a plausible case if, say, the women employees substantially outnumbered the men.

The critical feature of the Van Raalte case which to my mind distinguishes it from the employee case is that the complainant in Van Raalte was in essentially the same position as all other contributors to the scheme (save only for the wrongly exempted group). Realistically the discrimination was no more against him than against the others: there was simply no case for exempting anyone. It would thus have been most unfair to the general body of contributors (category C) to have required them to subsidise not merely the exempted class of women but also the equivalent men. That, however, is not the position in employment cases. In the postulated employment case the discrimination can clearly be seen to have been against the less well-paid women. If the men doing the same work were thought to be worth the higher wage, so too were the women. There can be nothing unfair in making the employer compensate the women in respect of the past discrimination against them (although, of course, in the case of a public authority, the compensation will indirectly fall to be paid by the general public).",

Furthermore, the ECJ approach avoided the need for undesirable speculation as to what the legislature\u2014or employer\u2014would have decided if it had not decided to introduce discrimination.

It should not be open to judges to re-write history in this way.\u00a0It was notable that in Wilkinson neither the IR Commissioners nor Lord Hoffmann were able to cite any authority from the extensive corpus of domestic and EC discrimination law in favour of the proposition that no remedy should be awarded.

The European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) cases relied on by the applicants were not relevant, and the context in which questions of compensation for discriminatory treatment arose before the ECJ was quite different, as was the impact of a decision to \u201clevel up\u201d. In the present cases, the advantage provided to widowed women did not provide the only, or even an appropriate, reference point for measuring the treatment which should properly be afforded to widowed men, who were in the same position as all other tax-payers. Darby v. Sweden and P.M. v. the  were not comparable to the present cases since each had concerned a discriminatory failure to extend to the applicant a justifiable tax relief or exemption.",

As shown by the judgment in Van Raalte (cited above), it does not inevitably follow from a finding of a violation of Article 14 that an award of just satisfaction must be made to reflect any pecuniary damage allegedly suffered as a result of the differential treatment. Whether such an award is made will depend on all the circumstances of the case, including the field in which the discriminatory treatment arose; whether the applicant belongs to a similarly affected class of persons; the size of any such class; the nature of the legislative provision, if any, giving rise to the discriminatory treatment; and, where such discrimination has been eliminated as the result of an amendment of the relevant provisions, the nature of, and reasons underlying, the amendment.",

The applicants, as widowers, belonged to a large class of persons who were similarly denied the allowances granted to widows during that period. The allowances were, as noted above, originally introduced in 1980, when married couples were taxed as a single entity, to enable widows to claim the equivalent of the married man\u2019s allowance in the year of bereavement and thus to equate their position with that of widowers. However, when the independent taxation of married men and women was introduced, the underlying purpose of the WBA ceased to exist and the allowance was removed in the 1999 Act as being an anomalous feature of a tax regime abandoned in 1994, which had unduly favoured widows, not only over widowers, but also over other taxpayers.",
