The principle will be violated if a judicial decision concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved guilty according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court regards the accused as guilty (see Minelli v.\u00a0Switzerland, 25\u00a0March 1983, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027 and\u00a037, Series A no. 62).",

Azerbaijan, no.\u00a016133/08, \u00a7\u00a7 168-170, 14 March 2013, Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, \u00a7\u00a7 642-648, 25 July 2013). It is true that in an Armenian case, where a metal cage in the courtroom was a permanent feature used as a dock for all criminal cases before an appeal court, the Court was satisfied that the holding of the applicant in such a cage, although constitutive of degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3, did not give rise to a violation of Article 6 as it did not place him at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the prosecution or suggest that the appeal court regarded him as guilty (Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, no. 34334/04, 15\u00a0June 2010, \u00a7\u00a7138-139). However, the Court has since taken care to point out that the holding of an accused, who is to be presumed innocent, in a cage or a \u201ccell within the courtroom\u201d may raise issues not only under Article\u00a03 as to degrading treatment but also under Article 6. In order for this to be so, \u201cthe applicants must have had objectively justified fears that their exposure in a cage during hearings in their case would convey to their judges, who were to take decisions on the issues concerning their criminal liability and liberty, a negative image of them as being dangerous to the point of requiring such an extreme physical restraint, thus undermining the presumption of innocence\u201d (Svinarenko and Slyadnev v. Russia [GC], nos.\u00a032541/08 and 43441/08, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). In Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no. 1704/06, 27 January 2009, in the context of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the Court considered that the applicants\u2019 confinement inside a barred dock, which looked like a metal cage, and the presence of \u201cspecial forces\u201d in the courthouse \u201ctainted the presumption of innocence\u201d (see \u00a7 132). In that case, the Court noted, at \u00a7 129, that \u201cthe applicants were placed in a caged dock at the far end of the court room in complete disorder and surrounded by guards\u201d. Furthermore, \u201c[t]hey could hardly communicate with their lawyers, could not properly hear the prosecutor and the judge and could hardly make their submissions audible due to the turmoil in the room\u201d.",

Nevertheless, the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right (see, for example, Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no. 26839/05, \u00a7 187, 18 May 2010). In any criminal proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the accused. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01. Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, for example, U\u017eukauskas v. Lithuania, no. 16965/04, \u00a7 46, 6 July 2010).",

The defence had therefore been able to cross-examine him about the telephone call between \u201cN\u201d and the Belgian shipping agents. Furthermore, although the applicant had been unable to cross-examine VO, in the statements admitted in evidence he clearly referred to a telephone call he had received from a woman at Premier Molasses (presumably the aforementioned \u201cN\u201d), who told him that the contents of the container were not to be imported to the United Kingdom but instead sold to a Dutch company (see paragraph 23 above). As VO did not attend the trial, this evidence, which, as the Court of Appeal pointed out (see paragraph 49 above), was of assistance to the applicant, was never subject to cross-examination.",

In addition, the Court\u2019s primary concern under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Schatschaschwili v.

It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see G\u00e4fgen, cited above, \u00a7 162, and the references therein).",

In a letter to VO, the prosecution offered various options to him, including giving evidence via live video link from his home in Belgium.
