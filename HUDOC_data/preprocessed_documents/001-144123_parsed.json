The case was then assigned to doctor U., a German national, who had recently been recruited by TCN through an agency on a self-employed basis to provide out-of-hours care. U., at the time aged 65, had qualified as a doctor in Germany in 1972 where he was practising as an aesthetic surgeon but where he was also formally qualified as a GP. For the purpose of working as a locum doctor in the United Kingdom he had obtained registration with the British General Medical Council (GMC) in 2006 and had applied to be admitted to one of the Medical Performers Lists maintained by each of the local PCTs. Once a GP is admitted to a PCT\u2019s Performers List he may work in the area of any other PCT in England. U. had withdrawn a first application to join Leeds Performers List after being notified that he had not reached a sufficient score in the required English language test. However, the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly PCT authorities, unaware that U. had already tried to register with another PCT, approved a subsequent application and admitted him to their Performers List in July 2007 without verifying his English language skills.",

The investigations focussed on the authenticity of the certificates U. had submitted to the English health authorities as evidence of his medical qualifications as well as on the question whether U.\u2019s treatment of the deceased had amounted to medical malpractice. At the request and in the presence of officers of Cambridgeshire police, German police officers heard, inter alia, representatives of U.\u2019s professional indemnity insurance company, of the public health authorities at the Arnsberg District Government and the Westphalia-Lippe Medical Association (\u00c4rztekammer) as witnesses. The originals of the protocols of the witness hearings conducted as well as the material obtained in the course of the investigations were handed over to Cambridgeshire police. On 10 July 2008 German and British police officers visited U. at his surgery in Witten, Germany, and informed him that criminal investigations were pending against him in Germany and the United Kingdom. U. availed himself of his right not to testify. He also declined a subsequent request by the Cambridgeshire police to be interviewed in the United Kingdom.",

He presented his preliminary findings to representatives of Cambridgeshire Constabulary on the occasion of one of their visits to Germany in September 2008. In his final report issued on 18 September 2008 the expert confirmed that the cause of Mr Gray\u2019s death had been an overdose of diamorphine. He pointed out that notwithstanding the fact that the therapeutical use of diamorphine was in general not permitted in Germany and therefore doctors in Germany were as a rule not trained in its use, U. had not sufficiently investigated the cause of Mr Gray\u2019s acute pain and had not verified whether the medication administered and its dosage had been an appropriate therapy under the circumstances. The expert concluded that U.\u2019s treatment of the deceased had thus been inadequate and had violated basic principles of medical care.",

An Inquest into the circumstances of the incident was held by the Cambridgeshire Coroner from 14 January to 4 February 2010. The latter not only returned the verdict that the deceased had been unlawfully killed as a consequence of the inadequate treatment administered by U. but also pointed explicitly to the deficiencies in the recruitment, training and supervision of foreign locum doctors in the United Kingdom. These deficiencies were at the origin of a subsequent report by the Coroner to the Secretary of Health and resulted in investigations by the House of Commons Health Committee as well as in an independent inquiry by the Care Quality Commission, a public body overseen by the Department of Health, which came to similar conclusions as the Inquest and identified related shortcomings in the British health system. Moreover, on the occasion of proceedings conducted by the General Medical Council regarding U.\u2019s fitness to practice in the period from 2 to 18\u00a0June 2010, the circumstances of Mr Gray\u2019s death were further investigated and additional evidence from expert witnesses and the deceased\u2019s next of kin was considered. The GMC Fitness to Practice Panel considered that U. had breached several of the basic principles of good medical practice and decided to formally strike U.\u2019s name from the medical register in the United Kingdom. In addition, in 2009 the applicants brought civil claims for damages for unlawful killing arising out of negligence with the High Court against U., TCN as well as Cambridgeshire PCT in the United Kingdom. The applicants\u2019 compensation claims were settled with respect to all three defendants by consent orders of December 2009, January and August 2010.",

Within the scope of the ensuing preliminary criminal proceedings in Germany the cause of death and U.\u2019s involvement in the underlying events were conclusively established in due course by the German investigative authorities. In cooperation with their British counterparts, German police officers heard, inter alia, representatives of U.\u2019s professional indemnity insurance company, of the public health authorities at the Arnsberg District Government and the Westphalia-Lippe Medical Association as witnesses with a view to assessing U.\u2019s medical qualifications and to establishing whether U.\u2019s treatment of the deceased had amounted to medical malpractice. Further written evidence was provided by the Cambridegshire police, such as the post mortem report of 25 June 2008 as well as depositions made by Mr Gray\u2019s partner following the latter\u2019s death. The prosecution authorities also had regard to an expert opinion from a professor of Essen university hospital on the question whether the treatment of the deceased by U. had complied with medical standards and which opinion had been established having regard to the information contained in the Cambridgeshire police\u2019s investigation files. The German prosecution authorities also made an attempt to interview U., who, however, availed himself of his right not to testify.

The description of the incident given in his apology letter of 10 July 2008 to the deceased\u2019s partner and the first applicant as well as in his letter of 11 March 2008 to his professional indemnity insurance company had been consistent with the testimonies obtained from the further witnesses and experts examined during the investigations.",

Having regard to the available body of evidence taken together, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s finding that the prosecution authorities\u2019 decision to apply for U.\u2019s conviction in summary proceedings without a main hearing had been justified and that the Witten District Court had available sufficient means of evidence to proceed to a thorough assessment of the circumstances of the case and U.\u2019s guilt. It further notes that there is nothing to suggest that the penal order proceedings were not conducted in accordance with domestic law or that the evidentiary conclusions reached by the prosecution authorities or the trial court had been unfounded. The Court also notes the Government\u2019s argument that in view of the fact that there was nothing to establish that U. would commit a similar error of treatment when practicing as a medical doctor in Germany, there had been no grounds to exceptionally hold a main hearing with a view to enabling an enhanced public scrutiny for preventive purposes in the instant case.",

The Court reiterates in this context that it has previously held that in situations where the responsibility of State agents in connection with a victim\u2019s death had been at stake, Article 2 \u00a7 1 required that within the scope of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the underlying events \u201cthe next of kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests\u201d (see Hugh Jordan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 109, ECHR 2001III (extracts), and Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, \u00a7 98, 4 May 2001). It notes that, by contrast, the present application does not concern a case where an involvement of State agents in the victim\u2019s death is at issue or where the circumstances surrounding the death were suspicious or unclear. The Court further recalls that in the sphere of medical negligence the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy and that it may therefore be arguable whether and to what extent the applicants\u2019 involvement as next of kin is required in the event the prosecution authorities have recourse to such a remedy on their own initiative as in the present case. The Court notes that, even assuming similar considerations as in its above cited case-law applied in the instant case, the applicants have been involved in the criminal proceedings against U. in the following manner.",

Having reiterated his request by letter of 23 October 2008, counsel was informed by the prosecution authorities about the pending preliminary proceedings and forwarded copies of excerpts of the investigation file. The Court further notes that within the course of the preliminary proceedings the applicants had the opportunity to contribute to the investigations.

As contended by the Government there had thus been no need for the prosecution authorities to provide further information to the applicants in this respect, in particular in view of the fact that the latter had been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings. Having regard to the fact that U. confessed from the outset that he had negligently caused Mr Gray\u2019s death through medical malpractice, it must have been evident to counsel that according to German criminal procedure U.\u2019s conviction by means of a penal order had been an option in the instant case.",

In this respect the Court refers to the Government\u2019s submissions that as a consequence of the domestic authorities\u2019 justified decision to have recourse to summary proceedings and to refrain from scheduling a main hearing (see \u00a7\u00a7 84 and 85 above) the applicants\u2019 right to join the prosecution as plaintiff had not become effective pursuant to Article 396 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Relevant domestic and international law and practice above). The Court further accepts the Government\u2019s argument that, since the circumstances of the case had been sufficiently established in the course of the investigative proceedings, a participation of the applicants in a potential main hearing, even if it might have a cathartic effect for the victim\u2019s next of kin, could not have further contributed to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the case. It notes in that context that the applicants have not specified which aspect of U.\u2019s responsibility for medical negligence causing the applicants\u2019 father\u2019s death has not been sufficiently clarified. Moreover, even in the event a hearing had been scheduled, pursuant to Article 400 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicants would not have had the right to contest the trial court\u2019s judgment with the objective of a heavier penalty being imposed on U.",

The Court would point out in this respect that the procedural guarantees enshrined in Article 2 do not entail a right or an obligation that a particular sentence be imposed on a prosecuted third party under the domestic law of a specific State. It reiterates in this connection that the procedural obligation under Article 2 is not an obligation of result but of means only (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2002II, and Gray v.\u00a0Germany and the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095).",

Furthermore, as a consequence of the disciplinary proceedings instituted against U. before the M\u00fcnster Administrative Court on the initiative of the Westphalia-Lippe Medical Association, the latter was reprimanded for having committed a grave error in the treatment of Mr Gray and imposed a fine.
