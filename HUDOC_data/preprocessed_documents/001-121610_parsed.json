The applicant complained of lower back pain on his right side and said that he was unable to move his right leg because of the pain. Following an examination by a specialist, the applicant was diagnosed with the following: i) a hyperextension injury and contusion to the lower back; ii) a transverse process fracture (resulting from rotation or extreme lateral bending) to the L3 vertebra, iii) a compression fracture (flexion fracture pattern) to the L1 vertebra, previously fused by transperpendicular fixation surgery, the metal implant having become dislodged and screws in the Th12 and L3 vertebrae having been broken, and iv) intoxication. An Xray revealed that the fracture to the applicant\u2019s L1 vertebra had been fused and fixated with rods and eight screws. Four screws in the applicant\u2019s Th12 and L3 vertebrae had been broken. The metal implant had become dislodged. While at the hospital, the applicant received various types of medication.",

In her decision, she noted that the applicant had been arrested on 10 September 2001 for a traffic offence, and that the police officers had found a firearm in his jacket pocket. She also noted the applicant\u2019s submissions about his alleged illtreatment and the fact that the traffic officers had denied the allegations. Lastly, she noted that although a forensic medical examination had been ordered, it had not yet been carried out. As it was her view that the results of the examination would not affect the qualification of the applicant\u2019s offence, she separated the materials concerning the alleged ill-treatment from the case file and sent them to the Olaine police for additional review.",

In this connection, the Government noted that the applicant had been able to lodge a complaint with the doctor of the Prison Hospital around the same time, and moreover that he had been represented by counsel in the criminal proceedings, who could have lodged complaints on his behalf. In any event, the Government argued that the applicant had not complied with the sixmonth time-limit, since he had lodged his application with the Court on 31\u00a0January 2003, whereas the final decision had been adopted on 27\u00a0November 2001. It was their view that the trial court could not be considered an effective remedy, considering the lapse of time of almost nine months between the moment the alleged violation took place and the moment the issue was raised before the trial court. The Government argued that even if the trial court had instituted criminal proceedings, they could only have sent the case materials to the prosecutor\u2019s office for a repeated investigation.",

He considered the remedy ineffective. Firstly, the decision had contained a reference to section 212 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, which was incorrect since the relevant provision at that time had been section 112. The Government\u2019s reliance on sections 220 and 222 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure was also misguided, since those sections referred only to challenging the actions of investigators and not to refusals to institute criminal proceedings at all. In any event, the applicant submitted that he had not been informed of his rights to complain about the decision. Secondly, at the time the decision had been adopted, the applicant had been in the Prison Hospital suffering from severe pain, and it had been extremely difficult for him to challenge the decision on account of the state of his health. Since the applicant did not consider this remedy effective, he had brought his complaints to the attention of the trial court within the criminal proceedings against him. Referring to the judgment of 4 June 2002, the applicant pointed out that the Jelgava Court had in fact examined his allegations of ill-treatment, but had found the police officers\u2019 statements and the results of the forensic examination sufficient to reject them. The applicant pointed out that under section 257 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court had the competence to institute criminal proceedings against third parties. It was therefore his view that the trial court had been the proper remedy in his case and that he had submitted his application within the requisite six-month time-limit.",

The Court has found in a number of cases against Latvia that minimum standards of an independent investigation have not been respected where the police was charged with investigating allegations relating to its own officers (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, \u00a7 75, 21 December 2010; Timofejevi v. Latvia, no.\u00a045393/04, \u00a7\u00a098, 11\u00a0December 2012, and Vovru\u0161ko v. Latvia, no. 11065/02, \u00a7 50, 11\u00a0December 2012). Bearing in mind that the Olaine police sent the case material to the prosecutor for bringing the firearm charge against the applicant on the 8th day after the events and that they took no additional investigative steps after the prosecutor sent back the case material in relation to the allegations of ill-treatment for additional review on 5 November 2001, the Court considers it sufficient to note that the investigation by the Olaine police in this regard can hardly be considered showing the necessary diligence for the following reasons.",

However, there were discrepancies between police officer E.\u0160.\u2019s statement and his own report about the arrest as to where exactly a bullet was found, either together with a gun in the applicant\u2019s pocket or inside the car. The Olaine police did not look into this. It appears that this conflicting statement was not admitted as evidence in the applicant\u2019s trial concerning the firearm charge. Further discrepancies were present in the forensic reports as concerns the place where the bullet was found. These discrepancies were not examined further, which undermines the thoroughness and reliability of the pre-trial investigation. It appears that the investigation by the Olaine police had consisted of a questioning of the police officers and the applicant, and some forensic examinations which did not yield any results.

The Court refers in this connection to other cases against Latvia, where it has found various shortcomings in the exercise of the prosecutorial supervision at the material time (see Timofejevi, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0101\u00a0and\u00a0103, and Vovru\u0161ko, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-53, cited above). In the case at hand, the Court notes that the prosecutor was the same person who brought the formal firearm charge against the applicant and issued the final bill of indictment in that regard (see paragraphs 37 and 45 above). The Court further notes that on two occasions, the same prosecutor rejected the applicant\u2019s request to terminate the criminal proceedings against him on the basis that his guilt had been duly established (see paragraph 46 above). The Court considers that the prosecutor relied to a considerable extent on the statements of the police officers who had been implicated in the events, and fully accepted their denial of having assaulted the applicant, as evidenced by the scarcely reasoned decision to refuse the institution of proceedings. This is sufficient to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the prosecutor\u2019s supervision of the investigation in the applicant\u2019s case, particularly as she did not carry out any assessment of the statements given by the police officers and the applicant, and did not provide reasons why she considered the police officers\u2019 statements more credible.

Nor did the prosecutor ensure that the forensic expert examined the applicant in person (see, for an example of similar shortcomings in an investigation the above-cited Vovru\u0161ko case, \u00a7 49), thereby making it impossible to discover any physical marks or injuries on the applicant\u2019s body, if there had been any and that they could have remained visible two months after the events. The prosecutor also endorsed the forensic expert\u2019s disregard of the first diagnosis made by doctors at the specialist hospital concerning the hyperextension injury because \u201cthey were not confirmed by visible bodily injuries\u201d. The Court does not agree that only visible injuries on an individual\u2019s body could serve as a proof of illtreatment. It further notes that the conclusions made by the specialist hospital (about the broken screws and dislodging of the metal implant) were based on an X-ray of the applicant, which the prosecutor appears to have omitted to take into consideration when examining the case. Moreover, it appears that the prosecutor failed to take any steps to obtain any eyewitness accounts, which could have shed some light on the disputed circumstances of the arrest, given that it had taken place next to an apartment building in a residential area.",

The prosecutor had an obligation under domestic law to explain these rights to the applicant, which she failed to do, thereby causing confusion as to the applicable procedures for complaint. The Government further argued that the applicant\u2019s counsel could have lodged a complaint to a higher-ranking prosecutor on his behalf, if the applicant himself was not capable of doing so on account of his state of health. That counsel, however, appears to have been appointed only in the connection with the criminal proceedings against the applicant, and it remains unclear whether she had the authority to lodge any complaints relating to the criminal proceedings against the police officers. There is no information that she was actually informed about the refusal to institute the criminal proceedings against the police officers.",

The Court reiterates that at the material time pursuant to section\u00a0109 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure a court had to accept any material concerning criminal offences and to institute or refuse to institute criminal proceedings, or forward that material to the competent authority (see paragraph 84 above). The Court has already noted that domestic courts had such competence and that that they could forward the complaint of ill-treatment by the police raised during the trial to the prosecutor\u2019s office (see Timofejevi, cited above, \u00a7 104). Likewise, the Court has noted that where representations of ill-treatment were raised during the trial in the presence of a representative of the prosecutor\u2019s office, the latter could not remain passive and had to ensure that an investigation was carried out (see Sorokins and Sorokina v. Latvia, no. 45476/04, \u00a7\u00a7 98-99, 28 May 2013). The applicant in the present case pursued his complaint before the national courts, but they did not give any credence to his allegations. No official investigation was triggered. The Court therefore considers that the final decision in relation to the applicant\u2019s complaint of ill-treatment was adopted on 2\u00a0December 2002, when the Senate of the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law in the criminal proceedings against him, whereas his complaint to the Court was lodged on 31 January 2003.",

The applicant submitted, but provided no proof, that in P\u0101rlielupe Prison he had been unable to access the toilets and had not had access to fresh air. He failed to provide more information as to the location and accessibility of the toilets and exercise yard from his prison cell or from other areas in the prison. The only piece of evidence in support of his allegations was a handwritten request to the administration of P\u0101rlielupe Prison to provide information about his state of health, which did not indicate that he had any problems with mobility or with using or accessing any prison facilities (contrast with the evidence submitted in support of his complaint in relation to Valmiera Prison, see paragraphs\u00a07075). The applicant himself, in his observations in reply to those of the Government, focused on the facilities in Valmiera Prison and did not specifically refer to those in P\u0101rlielupe Prison. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint does not contain sufficient detail for the Court to consider that he has raised a prima facie arguable complaint under Article 3 of the Convention about the adequacy of prison facilities in P\u0101rlielupe Prison. The Court concludes that his complaint in that regard is manifestly ill-founded and must therefore be dismissed in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In his view, it was a serious issue under Article 3 of the Convention that a disabled person such as himself had to endure concerns and worries about the inaccessibility of qualified medical assistance in an emergency. He argued that he had been dependent on the goodwill of other detainees to assist him, which had put him in a situation of uncertainty, and had caused him physical and mental suffering and distress. The applicant disagreed with the Government\u2019s distinction between the facts of the present case and those in Farbtuhs. He considered that the Government\u2019s analysis of the Farbtuhs case in relation to the appropriateness of the detention itself was irrelevant.

Hungary, no. 46857/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027 and 30, 20\u00a0May 2010).",

The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s state of health following his release is irrelevant for the purposes of the present complaint under Article 3 of the Convention and will therefore not examine the parties\u2019 submissions in this regard. Nor shall any importance be attached to the Government\u2019s suggestion that the applicant might have faked his physical disability while in detention, since the diagnosis of his medical condition lies within the competence of the domestic authorities. The Court considers that there can be no question over the adequacy of medical assistance in the absence of a timely and accurate diagnosis. It is important to note that when the applicant was placed in detention he could walk; his paraplegia was first recorded in prison and his Category 1 disability was subsequently confirmed by the relevant domestic authority. Had there been any imprecision on their part in establishing an accurate diagnosis of the applicant\u2019s medical condition, or indeed had the domestic authorities subsequently failed to detect any changes in the applicant\u2019s condition, the State would have to bear responsibility for such an omission as it is its obligation to ensure that persons deprived of their liberty receive the requisite medical assistance.",

The Government insisted that the applicant had been placed in a special unit for inmates with health problems, yet these facilities do not appear to have had less architectural or technical barriers than the facilities in the ordinary wings of that prison. The Court notes that a ramp had been installed to facilitate the applicant\u2019s access to the outdoor yard. Yet other areas, such as the canteen, toilets, sauna, library, shop, gym, meeting room and telephone room, remained inaccessible for the applicant in a wheelchair, a fact which the Government did not deny. Special arrangements had been put in place to alleviate the hardships of the accessrelated problems, but only in relation to the canteen and not the other facilities. While it appears that the applicant was not locked up in his cell during daytime and could move around in the living area of his unit, his ability to use any facilities therein was restricted owing to his paraplegia.",

Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 150). In the present case, the applicant submitted, and the Government did not deny, that his physical disability had prevented him from being able to access the toilets and sauna. While, according to the Government, the toilets had been adapted to the applicant\u2019s special needs, the Court notes that it can hardly be considered as alleviating his hardship, given that these facilities themselves remained inaccessible without the help of other inmates. Moreover, it appears that the only possibility for the applicant to wash himself had been during the weekly sauna visits, facilities which were also inaccessible to the applicant without the help of others. Nor does it transpire from the case materials that the sauna facilities had been adapted for the applicant\u2019s special needs. The Court considers such a state of affairs unacceptable. It has already found that restricting prisoners\u2019 access to showers once a week did not allow them to wash themselves properly and that this shortcoming had contributed to the cumulative effect of conditions of detention in the Prison Hospital in violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see \u010cuprakovs v. Latvia, no.\u00a08543/04, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, 18\u00a0December 2012). The international standard in this respect currently stands at least at twice a week (see paragraph 83 above), to which the CPT has also invited the Contracting States to adhere. In the present case, the applicant did not have access to a shower at all. The Court considers that weekly sauna visits did not provide him with an adequate opportunity to maintain his personal hygiene, given their inaccessibility and limited availability (contrast with the above-cited Todorov case, where the applicant had daily access to common showers and later had an en suite toilet and shower).",

Latvia, no.\u00a021780/07, \u00a7 28, 3\u00a0July 2012). Acknowledging that the Convention does not require the Contracting States to make provisions for such visits (see Epners-Gefners, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062), the Court nevertheless notes that they have to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity. In exercising their wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether or not to allow conjugal visits, the States have to have due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (ibid.). The Court finds that placing the applicant, who is confined to a wheelchair, in facilities where he cannot properly wash and use the toilet, even if only for a limited period of time, could be hardly considered compatible with respect for his human dignity.",

While the Court recognises that the administration of Valmiera Prison had made certain efforts to lessen his inability to move about in the prison, the fact remains that he had to rely on the help of his cellmate to enter and leave the living area of his unit; he also had to rely on the help of other inmates to access various facilities, such as the toilets, sauna, library, shop, gym, meeting room and telephone room, as they were inaccessible to him in a wheelchair. Although the medical staff visited the applicant in his cell for ordinary medical check-ups, they did not provide any assistance with his daily routine (contrast with the above-cited cases of Turzynski, \u00a7\u00a040, and Todorov, \u00a7 65).",

The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s cellmate had voluntarily agreed to assist him in case of necessity. The Court is not persuaded by such an argument and does not consider that the applicant\u2019s special needs were thereby attended to and that the State has complied with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in that respect. The Court has already stressed its disapproval of a situation in which the staff of a prison feel relieved of their duty to provide security and care to more vulnerable detainees by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with daily assistance or, if necessary, with first aid (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaprykowski v. Poland, no.\u00a023052/05, \u00a7 74, 3\u00a0February 2009). It is clear that in the present case the help offered by the applicant\u2019s cellmate did not form part of any organised assistance by the State to ensure that the applicant was detained in conditions compatible with respect for his human dignity. It cannot therefore be considered suitable or sufficient in view of the applicant\u2019s physical disability (see the above-cited cases of Farbtuhs, \u00a7 60, and D.G. v. Poland, \u00a7 147). While it is true that the Convention does not guarantee as such a right to social assistance, the Court considers that the State\u2019s obligation to ensure adequate conditions of detention includes provision for the special needs of prisoners with a physical disability such as the present applicant (see paragraph 151), and the State cannot merely absolve itself from that obligation by shifting the responsibility to the applicant\u2019s cellmate.",
