The property in issue, however, had been declared a cultural monument, and had been expropriated to be used as such, thus the expropriation had been in breach of the law. The fact that no construction work had ever been envisaged had to be assimilated to a situation where no public works within the meaning of the Restitution Act had ever been commenced. In addition, the renovation work carried out after the expropriation did not represent \u201cpublic works\u201d either, as it had only aimed to preserve the building.

The courts examining the rei vindicatio claims gave two reasons for concluding that they had jurisdiction to review the matter and that the judgment of 2 October 1998 had no res judicata effect in the proceedings before them (see paragraph 13 above). Firstly, they pointed out that that judgment was replacing the mayor\u2019s administrative decision on the applicants\u2019 request for restitution, which meant that it was open to indirect judicial review. Secondly, they considered that the defendants to the rei vindicatio action had not participated in the initial judicial proceedings.

It must take into account the fact that the judgment of 2 October 1998 was the result of contentious proceedings before two levels of jurisdiction, including the Supreme Administrative Court.

The salient question is thus whether the same parties were involved in the reexamination. In answering this question, the Court will not consider the Fund\u2019s participation in the second set of proceedings determinative, in view of the fact that it was only renting a room in the disputed building, did not claim any property rights, and that its interest in the proceedings was the defence of its possession of that room (see, a contrario, Tantilovi v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39351/05, 13 January 2015, where the tenant combatting a rei vindicatio claim had rented the building in question for many years and had made substantial improvements to it).

The Court considers this latter question irrelevant. What matters is that, in the subsequent domestic proceedings, the courts did not rely on any failure on the part of the applicants to return the compensation received. It is also significant that in 2001 the applicants obtained a notarial deed naming them as the property\u2019s owners (see paragraph 11 above).

The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion on the facts of the instant case.
