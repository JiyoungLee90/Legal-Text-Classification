The applicant was represented by Mr R. Battenstein, a lawyer practising in Düsseldorf. The German Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice.
On 29 January 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).

On 26 March 1999 the Social Court of Appeal commissioned a report by an orthopaedic expert, S., which was submitted on 20 May 1999 and stated that the applicant’s disease had not been caused by his work as a lorry driver.
On 14 July 1999 the applicant applied under section 109 of the Social Courts Act (see paragraph 44 below) for a fresh medical report by another expert. He also put additional questions to the expert S. which were answered on 23 July 1999.
On 25 August 1999 the Social Court of Appeal commissioned a report by B.-A., an expert specialised in occupational medicine.
On 17 September 1999 the Court of Appeal ordered the applicant to pay a further advance to cover the costs of additional examinations which B.-A. considered necessary. On 14 October 1999 the applicant advanced those costs.
On 15 December 1999 the applicant cancelled his appointment with B.-A. scheduled that day.
On 22 March 2000 B.-A. submitted a report finding that the applicant’s disease had to be considered as being work-related.

On 9 July 2001 the Social Court of Appeal set the appeal down for hearing on 18 September 2001. At the hearing the court ordered the taking of further evidence.
On 8 October 2001 the defendant submitted an expert report prepared by its own technical supervisory service challenging B.-A.’s conclusions.
On 18 October 2001 the Court of Appeal commissioned the preparation of a further report by a consultant surgeon, B., who submitted his report on 19 November 2001.
On 22 January 2002 the applicant requested inter alia the preparation of a further expert report under section 109 of the Social Courts Act.

On 27 October 2003 the applicant appointed a new legal representative who asked the court for access to the case files on 2 December 2003.
On 12 December 2003 the Social Court of Appeal postponed the hearing scheduled for 16 December 2003 because the applicant’s counsel had failed to return the case files.
On 23 March 2004, after a hearing, the Social Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. Considering that the relevant questions had been sufficiently examined by the experts B., S., and V., it did not find it necessary to seek a further expert opinion, as had been requested by the applicant.

Section 88 of the Social Courts Act exempts applicants from the requirement to await the outcome of the preliminary administrative proceedings and allows them to lodge a court action directly with the  if the administrative authorities fail without sufficient justification to decide the administrative appeal within a reasonable time, in general three months.
Section 109 of the Social Courts Act provides that the insured person may request a further expert report. This request can only be rejected if granting it would delay the proceedings and if the court is satisfied that the request has been made in an attempt to delay the proceedings or was not submitted earlier due to gross negligence. The commissioning of the expert report may be made conditional on the applicant advancing the costs.
Section 44 of the Social Code no. X provides that if social benefits are rejected on the basis of an unlawful administrative act, the competent authority shall, under certain circumstances, revoke that act with retrospective effect even after it has become final. In such cases the grant of social benefits is limited to a period of four years preceding the date of the application for supervisory review.
