In the case of the expulsion of a rejected asylum-seeker who had been arrested after his arrival and allegedly tortured in Turkey, the Federal Court held in its judgment BGE 119 Ib 208 that, following the conclusion of the appeal proceedings, the [impugned] decision had become final and was thus not amenable to review ...

Specific evidence available to them included not only the applicant\u2019s own submissions but also the parallel case of Mr Y, who had been deported on 25 July 2013 to Sri Lanka, where he had been detained and subjected to ill-treatment resulting in his hospitalisation.
