The case originated in an application (no. 3046/03) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Aleksandr Grigoryevich Shlepkin (“the applicant”), on 15 December 2002.
The applicant was represented by Ms V.A. Gerasimova, a lawyer practising in Inza in the Ulyanovsk Region. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 February 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in the village of Troitskoe in the Ulyanovsk Region.
On 23 March 2001 the Chernovskiy District Court of Chita partly allowed the applicant's claim against the State enterprise “Stroitelniy Kompleks” (государственное предприятие “Строительный Комплекс”) for recovery of the unpaid amount of compensation for a work-related injury. The court awarded him 7,500 roubles (“RUR”) in respect of the period from 1996 to 1999. The judgment was not appealed against and became enforceable on 3 April 2001.
As the applicant had not been able to attend the hearing, on 6 April 2001 the District Court sent a writ of execution to the Chita bailiffs for enforcement. It appears that some time in May 2002 the applicant was informed for the first time that the judgment had been adopted and that the writ had been sent to the bailiffs.
In the meantime, on 21 June 2001 the Commercial Court of the Chita Region ordered liquidation of the State enterprise “Stroitelniy Kompleks” because it had gone bankrupt.
On 31 May 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint concerning the non-enforcement of the judgment with the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which forwarded it to the Chita local authorities.
Having examined the issue, in July 2002 the local authorities discovered that in 2001 the writ of execution had been lost and had never reached the Chita bailiffs' service.
On 23 July 2002 the District Court sent a duplicate writ of execution to the bailiffs.
On 9 September 2002 the bailiffs commenced the enforcement proceedings.
On 20 May 2003 the Chernovskiy District Court discontinued the enforcement proceedings as the debtor company had ceased to exist. The applicant did not appeal against that judgment.
It appears that the judgment of 23 March 2001 remains unenforced to date.
In the meantime, on 30 September 2002 the Inzenskiy District Court of the Ulyanovsk Region awarded the applicant the unpaid amounts of compensation for the period from 2000 to 2002, payable by the local social insurance foundation. It appears that this judgment was duly enforced by the national authorities.
