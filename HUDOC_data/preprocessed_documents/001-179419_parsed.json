This is because it has been clear from the information available that at that time, and for a considerable time to come, the applicant would not be at risk of being expelled and subjected to treatment allegedly in breach of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, and because the applicant could challenge a future removal before the domestic authorities (see F.G. v.

Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08081). The Court notes that the applicant in fact participated in two expulsion hearings, firstly using his brother\u2019s name, which he had assumed, and then his own (see the Appendix for details). He did not submit an ordinary appeal against the expulsion order of either 12 May 2015 or 13\u00a0July 2015. His submissions indicate that he failed to appeal because he could not effectively follow the expulsion proceedings, as they were conducted in Russian and he did not have a good command of it. However, according to the text of the removal decisions, the applicant was assisted by interpreters, A.M. and N.M. respectively, during the two hearings in question. There appear to be no grounds for the Court to doubt either the authenticity of those decisions or the quality of A.M. and N.M.\u2019s interpreting. Nor did the applicant challenge those decisions or complain about the interpreters. Moreover, as of 2\u00a0September 2015 the applicant was represented by M., who visited him in the detention centre and assisted him in applying for temporary asylum. The Court also observes that as early as September 2015 M. was able to request that the time-limit for submitting an appeal against the expulsion decision be restored. However, M. failed to do so at that time, and he did not provide any explanation to the Court as to why he had requested to reopen the appeal proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case only five months later, in February 2016. Lastly, the applicant did not contend that an ordinary appeal had been otherwise unavailable to him, or that it would have been an ineffective remedy in his case.",

In certain cases the detention lasted more than two years, and for some applicants it is still continuing (see the Appendix for details). N.K. and the members of his family were detained for less than three months, whereas A.A. was detained for about seven months. Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s view, and given its findings of recurrent violations of Article 5 of the Convention in respect of foreigners detained in Russia with a view to administrative expulsion (see L.M. and Others v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 141-42 and 149-52, with further references, and S.K. v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0108-09 and \u00a7\u00a0116), the length of detention in all of the applicants\u2019 cases, except that of N.K. and the members of his family and that of A.A., exceeded what was reasonably required for the purpose pursued. Furthermore, again, apart from N.K. and the members of his family and A.A., it does not appear that the applicants had access to judicial and periodic reviews of their continued detention, in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",
