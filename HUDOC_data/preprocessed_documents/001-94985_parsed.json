The task of the Court is rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by the national authorities in the exercise of their powers (see, mutatis mutandis, Bronda v. , judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1491, \u00a7 59).",

In particular, whilst the limitation of the applicant's legal capacity (involving his inability to independently take part in legal actions, file for a disability pension, decide about his own medical treatment, or even get a loan) has been very serious, the procedure on the basis of which the domestic courts had so decided had itself been fundamentally flawed (see paragraphs 127 and 128). Moreover, some four years later and despite repeated requests to this effect, the applicant's legal capacity has yet to be re-assessed on the merits by a court of law (see paragraphs 134 and 135). Finally, the Court acknowledges that a legal system must be allowed to protect itself from vexatious litigants, but considers that it is up to the domestic authorities to set up an effective judicial mechanism of dealing with such litigants' claims, without necessarily having to resort to additional measures affecting their legal capacity.",
