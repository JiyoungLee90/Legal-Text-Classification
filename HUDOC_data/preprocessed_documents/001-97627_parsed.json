Thereafter, the prosecutors and the courts did not advance any grounds whatsoever for maintaining the applicant's detention, simply stating that the previously chosen preventive measure was correct. However, Article 5 \u00a7 3 requires that after a certain lapse of time the persistence of a reasonable suspicion does not in itself justify deprivation of liberty and the judicial authorities should give other grounds for continued detention (see Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no.\u00a033492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000, and I.A. v. France, no. 28213/95, \u00a7\u00a0102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII).

Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, 26 July 2001, and many subsequent cases). A similar concept of automatically presumed necessity to deprive a person of his liberty is reflected in the provisions of the Ukrainian Code of Criminal Procedure concerning the continuation of detention at the same intervals and whenever a permission for continuation of the time-limits for finalizing investigation is granted as well as in the automatic continuation of detention during the time necessary for the accused to acquaint himself with the investigation file in the absence of any decision to continue the measure of detention. Any concept of automatic lawfulness of deprivation of liberty is incompatible with the Convention principles and there is no doubt that Article 5 \u00a7 4 is the procedural guarantee and remedy against such detention.",

Each time the court came to a conclusion that it was the right preventive measure and that it was necessary to continue his detention on remand.... The grounds for his further detention were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d in view of the existence of a reasonable suspicion and that he was likely to abscond from investigation or court (\u00a7\u00a7 90 and 91 of his Observations). The same rulings were criticized by the Court under Article 5 \u00a7 3 in that the courts failed to \u201cadvance any grounds whatsoever for maintaining the applicant's detention, simply stating that the previously chosen measure was correct\u201d. In my view these conclusions are equally relevant for the applicant's complaints of the formal character and limited scope of the performed review. Article 274 of the 1960 CCP did not require the domestic courts to provide any reasoning in \u201capproving\u201d the initially determined measure. Its second paragraph limits the scope of their review by referring it to the criteria applicable in the process of the initial determination of the measure. In the applicant's case they were considered several years ago and the outlined scope of review could not involve any subsequent circumstances such as the length of his detention up to this moment and/or the authorities' diligence in this period. Having joined the majority in the views on the formal nature and the limited scope of the performed review in Article 5 \u00a7 3, I cannot see how the same criticized rulings as the result of proceedings met the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.",

The question in the present case is not whether the applicant requested to be released, but whether any request or provision of the law effectively \u201centitled him to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful\u201d. The Court never failed to note that \u201cthe existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Van Droogenbroeck v.

The general right of an accused \u201cto lodge requests and make observations on the requests of other parties to the proceedings\u201d under Article 263-3 of the CCP is not comparable to the habeas corpus proceedings required under Article 5 \u00a7 4.
