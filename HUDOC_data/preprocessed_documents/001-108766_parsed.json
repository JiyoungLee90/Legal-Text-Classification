The courts likewise refused to grant the applicant permission to leave  for a short period of time to see his children and to take care of his most urgent affairs.

As regards the Court\u2019s case-law relied on by the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer pointed to two crucial differences between the circumstances of the case of Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia and the present case. Firstly, in the case relied on by the Government one of the applicants was twice granted permission to leave her place of residence for a short period of time. Secondly, in the present case, the applicant was a citizen of another country, who had been forced to remain in  for over six years (including the period of his pre-trial detention). The applicant\u2019s lawyer submitted that the application of the preventive measure to the applicant for such a long period of time constituted a disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of movement.",

This approach was followed in subsequent cases, where the duration of an obligation not to leave the territory of the respondent State varied between more than five years (Prescher v. Bulgaria no. 6767/04, \u00a7 47, 7 June 2011) and more than ten years (see Riener v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a046343/99, \u00a7\u00a0106, 23 May 2006).",
