Thus, the Court will accept the judgment of the domestic authorities as to what is necessary in a democratic society unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation, that is, unless the measure employed is manifestly disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

The availability of alternative solutions does not in itself render the termination of a tenancy unjustified; it constitutes one factor, among others, that is relevant for determining whether the means chosen may be regarded as reasonable and suited to achieving the legitimate aim being pursued. Provided the interference remained within these bounds \u2013which, in view of its above considerations (see paragraph 66 above), the Court is satisfied that it did \u2013 it is not for the Court to say whether the measure complained of represented the best solution for dealing with the problem or whether the State\u2019s discretion should have been exercised in another way (see, mutatis mutandis, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, op. cit., p.\u00a035, \u00a7\u00a051).",
