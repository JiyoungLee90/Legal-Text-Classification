There was also evidence in support of other factual allegations. Critical assessment of those facts by some village inhabitants was not susceptible of proof and constituted reasonable value judgments on their part, for which the applicant could not be held responsible.

G.Sh. had earlier been found administratively liable for corrupt acts, and the fact that he had been engaged in illegal business transactions while occupying a post of responsibility within the municipality had been widely discussed. Unfortunately, the domestic courts had refused to question some witnesses and examine some of the evidence presented by the applicant in support of his position.

In addition to that, the interference had not been disproportionate to the aim pursued. The disputed statements had contained numerous factual allegations, the accuracy of which the applicant had been unable to prove during the domestic proceedings. Those statements had therefore been defamatory. Accordingly, it had fallen to the applicant to verify their accuracy before disclosing the content of the letter at a public meeting. The applicant had not known the identities of all the authors of the disputed letter, and those identities could also not be discerned during the meeting. Accordingly, the domestic courts had correctly classified the letter as an anonymous application by citizens, which the applicant had had no right to read publicly, especially without verifying the facts. In view of the applicant\u2019s conduct, the defamatory statements had been widely disseminated in the small village where G.Sh. lived with his family. Thus,\u00a0he had experienced considerable emotional distress, and his reputation as a civil servant had been negatively affected.

Regard being had to the subject matter of the presentation, the public status of the speaker, and the chosen forum, the applicant\u2019s discourse represented political speech in the strict sense, the restriction of which calls for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Kar\u00e1csony and Others v.

However, with regard to the Convention, it is of secondary importance whether or not the true identities of all the authors of the disputed letter were known or discernable. In deciding to make public the letter addressed to him personally, the applicant consciously and willfully provided its authors with a medium for presenting their views, thus playing a full part in disseminating the relevant statements (see mutatis mutandis Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, \u00a7 22, ECHR 2004IV, with further references, and Andrushko v. Russia, no.\u00a04260/04, \u00a7\u00a042, 14\u00a0October 2010).",

Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR\u00a01999I). In this connection, it is necessary to bear in mind that political invective often spills over into the personal sphere; such are the hazards of politics and the free debate of ideas, which are the guarantees of a democratic society (see Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2000-X, and Andrushko, cited above, \u00a7 48). However, a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult (see, mutatis mutandis, Ska\u0142ka v.

The Court accepts that certain expressions used by the voters to formulate their views were couched in very strong terms, and their comments were severely critical. At the same time, the evidence and other submissions made by the parties before the national courts in the course of the domestic proceedings indicate that the accusations against G.Sh. were based on certain true facts and events which had generated public discussion (see paragraph\u00a012 above). It appears that the authors of the letter were frustrated and enraged by G.Sh.\u2019s conduct, as perceived by them based on the available factual information. There is no reason to doubt that they voiced their indignation in good faith, as confirmed, for instance, by the fact that Mrs\u00a0A., who was present at the meeting, openly claimed to be one of the authors of the letter (compare with Andrushko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a047).",

In addition, the letter was read out in G.Sh.\u2019s presence, and he was given the floor to respond. Accordingly, he was afforded an appropriate opportunity to dispel any allegation which he considered to be untrue and present his own version of the relevant facts before the same audience (compare with Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a04977/05, \u00a7 44, 4 April 2013, and contrast with Siredzhuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a088).",

They did not give any consideration to the context and the manner of dissemination of the disputed statements or to the status of the speaker and the person targeted in his presentation, discussed in paragraphs 27-31 above. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic judicial authorities failed to recognise that the present case involved a conflict between the right to protection of reputation and freedom of political expression and to carry out the relevant balancing exercise. Accordingly, they did not apply standards in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and did not adduce relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the necessity of the interference with the applicant\u2019s freedom of political expression (see, for similar reasoning, Dyundin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 37406/03, \u00a7 33, 14\u00a0October 2008, and Andrushko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049 and 57).",
