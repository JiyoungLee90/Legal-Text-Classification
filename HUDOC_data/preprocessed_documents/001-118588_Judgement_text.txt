On 10 March 2005 the Oktyabrsky District Court of Kharkiv sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment on two counts of robbery.
On 24 October 2006 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed this decision and remitted the case to a first instance court for fresh consideration. It further decided to leave the previously selected measure of restraint without changes.

The police officers denied that they had ill-treated the applicant. The prosecutor further noted that the applicant had not requested any medical assistance at that time.
In 2004 the applicant again complained to the prosecutor about ill-treatment by the police officers. On 22 July 2004 the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the applicant’s complaint. The prosecutor questioned police officers who denied the applicant’s allegations. There was also no medical evidence in support of the applicant’s complaints and it was not possible to examine the applicant since the events in question had happened two years ago. It was further mentioned that the applicant’s co-accused did not make any similar allegations. On 18 March 2005 the Chervonozavodskiy District Court rejected the applicant’s appeal against this decision. On 4 August 2005 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 18 March 2005.
