The Constitutional Court's examination of individual human rights complaints being limited by statute to the summary of the complaint, as formulated by the defendant (see Obluk v. Slovakia, no.\u00a069484/01, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and 61, 20 June 2006), the Constitutional Court was prevented from examining the proceedings as a\u00a0whole, that is, including the first-instance and appeal phases. The Court finds that, by failing to formulate her constitutional complaint in accordance with the applicable procedural rules and established practice (see\u00a0Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021893/93, \u00a7\u00a06, ECHR\u00a01996-IV) so as to allow the Constitutional Court to examine the overall length of the proceedings in issue (see Obluk, cited above, \u00a7 62), the applicant failed to\u00a0exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in relation to the first-instance and the appeal proceedings. The Court has reached this conclusion after having taken into account the information concerning the relevant domestic practice in interpretation and application of Article 127 of the Constitution, as most recently submitted by the respondent Government (see, for example, Jakub v. Slovakia, no. 2015/02, \u00a7\u00a7 34-38, 28 February 2006), which is more comprehensive than the information made available to the Court in this respect in the past (see, for example, \u013d.R. v.
