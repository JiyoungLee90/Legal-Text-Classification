All adoptions must thus be preceded by a placement and fostering relationship of a certain duration. An imperative condition for adoption, this measure serves to justify the subsequent establishment of a parent-child relationship, to allow a probationary period for those concerned, and to provide the opportunity and means to ensure that the adoption will further the child\u2019s welfare (ATF [Federal Court judgments] 125 III 161 point 3a p. 162 and citations). Under Article 316 of the Civil Code, the placement of children with foster parents is subject to the authorisation and supervision of the supervisory authority or another office for the place of residence of the said parents, as designated by cantonal law (\u00a7 1); where the child is placed with a view to its adoption, a single cantonal authority is competent (\u00a7 1 bis, as in force since 1 January 2003); the Federal Council stipulates the requirements for implementation (\u00a7 2).",

In this form of adoption, the parent-child relationship is established with a single parent. As a result of that situation, the adoptive parent must, on his or her own, assume the duties that meet the child\u2019s needs and remain available to care for the child to a degree that exceeds that required of each parent in a couple adopting jointly. Accordingly, the authority must particularly take into account the child\u2019s interest where the applicant is not married, or where he or she is unable to adopt jointly with his or her spouse (Article 11b \u00a7 3 (b) OPEE). The legislature\u2019s intention was that joint adoption should be the rule and adoption by a single parent the exception (ATF 111 II 233 point 2cc p.\u00a0234/235). It may indeed be considered that the child\u2019s interest, which is paramount, consists in principle of living in a complete family. Nevertheless, the law does expressly permit adoption by a single person, without subjecting him or her \u2013 unlike those wishing to adopt an adult or a person deprived of legal capacity (Article 266 \u00a7 1 Chapter 3 of the Civil Code) \u2013 to the existence of \u2018valid reasons\u2019. In any event, where the requisite conditions for the child\u2019s welfare are satisfied, and the adoption by a single person meets all the requirements for the child\u2019s fulfilment and personality development, the adoption will be granted; in such cases, at the preliminary placement stage, the conditions laid down in Article 11b of the OPEE will be satisfied, and the placement authorisation must be granted (ATF 125 III 161 point 4b p. 165 and citations).",

The home study report (Article 268a Civil Code and Article 11d OPEE) is drawn up according to the age and origin of the child, factors that the applicant must indicate (Article 11g \u00a7 2 (a) and (c) OPEE). The Youth Office thus quite rightly, in its findings on the cantonal appeal, found that this document had been \u2018drawn up on the basis of an application for the adoption of a child aged between 1 and 3 at the time of its arrival\u2019. Any finding to the contrary would suggest that an application could be changed as and when the case so required, for a reduction of the age difference in this instance. It follows that the criticism of the cantonal court for not having granted an \u2018authorisation for an older child, in order to reduce the age difference\u2019 appears ill-founded. The fact that the Convention between Switzerland and Vietnam on cooperation in matters of child adoption came into force while the case was pending on appeal, that is to say on 9 April 2006 (RO 2006 p. 1767), is immaterial; moreover, the appellant does not show that she would satisfy the conditions laid down in that agreement, or even \u2013 notwithstanding the opinion of the Youth Office\u2019s representative (see record of individual hearing on 5 April 2006) \u2013 that her project would in fact be feasible.",

In the light of the Federal Court\u2019s case-law such a difference appears excessive (see judgment 5A.6/2004 of 7 June 2004, point 3.2, published in FamPra.ch 2004 p. 710: single person \u2018of almost 50 years\u2019 wishing to adopt a \u2018girl under 5 years old\u2019; see also the references cited in ATF 125 III 161 point 7a, p. 167/168). As the cantonal authority rightly pointed out, even an age difference of forty-five years is too great. In that case the appellant would, at over 60, find herself the single parent of two teenagers, who, in addition to the problems arising in that period of life, may well face particular difficulties as adopted children (see, for example, judgment 5A.21/1999 of 21\u00a0December 1999, point 3d, published in FamPra.ch 2000 p. 546), especially as the future child might have specific needs. The appellant is thus wrong to rely on Federal Court judgment 125 III 161 (age difference between forty-four and forty-six years), where, moreover, the adoption of a single child was at stake (see point 3.4 below).",

Whilst it may be admitted, from a theoretical standpoint, that the presence of a sister or brother may have beneficial effects in emotional and social terms (see judgment 5A.25/1996 of 1 May 1997, point 6b, unpublished, in SJ 1997 pp. 597 et seq.), that assessment should be nuanced as far as adopted children are concerned. The home study report noted that A., after enjoying exclusive maternal attention, faced the risk of \u2018reactivating a feeling of abandonment\u2019; the positive effects of a new adoption on her situation (Article 264 in fine of the Civil Code, section 9(b) LF-ClaH [Federal Law on the Hague Convention], and Article 11b \u00a7 1 (a), in fine, OPEE) are not therefore certain (see, in general, L\u00fccker-Babel, Adoption internationale et droits de l\u2019enfant, Fribourg 1991, p. 44; this author observes that \u2018it is in families that have a number of adopted children or a number of biological children [and only one adoptive child] that the failure rate is the highest\u2019). In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the second child might have difficulties related to the deprivations suffered by children who have been abandoned (judgment 5A.9/1997 of 4 September 1997, point 4b, published in RDT 1998 p. 118), and this might complicate the arrangements made by the appellant. These findings are consistent with those of the Jura Social Action Department in its additional report of 11 June 2003.",

Those criticisms appear unjustified. Given that the placement authorisation precedes the adoption decision, the authority must inevitably make a prognosis. In view of the characteristics of an adoption by a single person and the dramatic consequences that a failed adoption would have for the child (see, on this subject, L\u00fccker-Babel in RDT 1994 pp. 86 et seq.), the court below cannot be reproached for its rigour (see Breitschmid, op. cit., n.\u00a019 ad Article 264 of the Civil Code and the literature cited), as was in fact required of it by Article 11b \u00a7 3 of the OPEE (\u2018most particularly\u2019). It is not for this Court to substitute its own conception of the child\u2019s welfare for that of the cantonal authority and of the investigators (see FamPra.ch 2006 p. 178, point 3.2 in fine and citations), but solely to ascertain whether relevant circumstances have not been taken into consideration or, indeed, whether crucial factors have been overlooked. Notwithstanding the appellant\u2019s categorical denials, that is not the case here.",

The appellant\u2019s brother, who has no children \u2013 and it is not known whether his wife has a professional activity \u2013 could admittedly help her with the future child, as he has already done with A.; however, the brother lives in Lausanne. Similarly, the person intended to become the adopted child\u2019s godfather lives in Lyons. Lastly, the support of neighbours in her building and of her very close friend, together with the presence of A.\u2019s godfather and godmother, does not change anything, as the important criterion is the availability of the appellant herself; moreover, the education of children always rests with the parents, and it is easier to express an intention of assistance in the abstract context of a procedure than in everyday life and for some twenty years.",

Whatever the appellant may claim, the cantonal authority did not minimise the involvement of her family and friends by preferring \u2018theoretical assertions\u2019. The Court had occasion to observe this in a recent case, where, in spite of her \u2018extended family\u2019, a mother applying for a second adoption had had to entrust her adopted daughter to a neighbour when she went into hospital (FamPra.ch 2006 ibid.). As to the possibility of having to care for her father, she merely asserts that her brother \u2018would be present\u2019, but the latter has not corroborated this claim and in addition is supposed to make up for any deficiencies of the appellant. Moreover, the child\u2019s interest cannot be measured solely in terms of the availability of the parent who is seeking to adopt alone (Meier/Stettler, ibid.).

On the basis of research it has carried out, the Court notes that such a right is not guaranteed in all the member States of the Council of Europe, at least not in an absolute manner. Certain legislations permit adoption by a single person on an exceptional basis and only subject to certain conditions (paragraphs\u00a023-25 above). The European Convention on the Adoption of Children, in its 24 April 1967 version, stipulates that the laws of the States Parties may permit a child to be adopted by one person, but it does not make this mandatory (see paragraph 36 above), unlike the Revised Convention of 27\u00a0November 2008, Article 7 \u00a7 1 (b) of which will oblige States Parties thereto, once it has come into force, to authorise adoption by a single person.",

Most of the Council of Europe\u2019s member States require a minimum age for prospective adopters, an age that continually decreased throughout the twentieth century (see paragraph 26 above). In addition, Article 264 (b) of the Swiss Civil Code sets the minimum age for a person wishing to adopt alone at 35 (see paragraph 21 above), which is consistent with Article 7 of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children of 24 April 1967. It can be seen from the Explanatory Report on the Revised Convention that such a limit appeared too high and it was therefore reduced to 30 in the new version. The Court observes that this development does not undermine the Government\u2019s position in the present case, as the applicant did not complain that this minimum age had prevented her from adopting a second child.",

Admittedly, some States have set the maximum age at 60 (see paragraph 27 above), but the Court finds that no obligation can arise for Switzerland from those isolated cases. It should also be taken into account that neither the Convention of 1967 nor that of 2008 prescribes a maximum age-limit for adopters. The Court notes that the same applies to the age difference between adopter and adoptee. It would point out that the Federal Court found, in the light of its own case-law, that an age difference of between forty-six and forty-eight years was in the present case excessive. In the Court\u2019s view, such a conclusion is not per se incompatible with Article 14, even though some legislations, albeit few in number, allow for an even greater maximum age difference (see paragraph 32 above). The 1967 Convention does not lay down any fixed rule in this connection and Article 9 \u00a7 1 of the 2008 Convention simply provides that there should be \u201can appropriate age difference\u201d.",

Those decisions contained detailed reasoning and were based in particular on the in-depth enquiries carried out by the cantonal authorities. They were inspired not only by the best interests of the child to be adopted, but also by those of the child already adopted. Moreover, the Court finds it noteworthy that the criterion of the age difference between adopter and adoptee is not laid down by Swiss law in the abstract but has been applied by the Federal Court flexibly and having regard to the circumstances of each case. In particular, the Court does not find unreasonable or arbitrary the argument of the domestic bodies that the placement of a second child, even of a similar age to the first, would constitute an additional burden for the applicant. Nor would it disagree with the point that problems are more numerous in families with more than one adopted child (see Federal Court judgment, point 3.4, paragraph 20 above). It is clear in this type of case that the use of statistical data is necessary and that a degree of speculation is inevitable.",
