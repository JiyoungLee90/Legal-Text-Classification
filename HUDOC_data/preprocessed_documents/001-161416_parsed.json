Human Rights Club was a non-governmental and noncommercial organisation. The Law on State Registration only prohibited commercial legal entities from operating without State registration. In contrast, there was no such prohibition in domestic law in respect of non-commercial legal entities. This had previously been confirmed by the Government and various domestic authorities both at domestic level and before the Court. Accordingly, Human Rights Club could legally operate in the absence of State registration, and the noncommercial nature of its activities could not be classified as illegal or commercial activities on that ground. In this connection, the applicant also referred to reports by the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights and the Venice Commission, which stressed the cumbersome nature of State registration of NGOs and made reference to how this inevitably drove a number of NGOs to operate on the fringes of the law, and which also stressed that new amendments introduced to the Law on State Registration and the NGO Law since 2009 had overturned previous efforts to meet the requirements of international standards.",

Domestic NGOs faced difficulties, especially with regard to the restrictive application of the regulations on registration, which could result in long delays or the absence of any formal decision on registration. Moreover, the 2013 amendments to the Law on NGOs, the Law on Grants and the Code of Administrative Offences further restricted the operations of NGOs. Those amendments required NGOs to sign a formal grant agreement for any funding exceeding AZN 200. A failure to submit a copy of the grant agreement to the Ministry of Justice could result in the management of an NGO being fined an amount between AZN\u00a01,500 and 2,500, and between AZN 5,000 and 7,000 in the case of legal entities. The NGO itself could also face fines and confiscation of property. In accordance with the amendments, the only way for an NGO to receive funding exceeding AZN 200 was by bank transfer. This created a problem for NGOs which were unregistered and consequently unable to open bank accounts. Cumbersome requirements for registration inevitably drove a number of NGOs to operate on the fringes of the law. The Commissioner had stated in his 2013 report that those amendments made the already onerous reporting obligations for NGOs even more onerous.",

In this connection, at the outset, the Court considers it necessary to have regard to the general context of the facts of this particular case. Having assessed the submissions by the third parties (see paragraphs 99-113 above) and the opinions of the Venice Commission (see paragraphs 81-82 above), the Court agrees that in recent years the legislative environment regarding the operation of nongovernmental, non-commercial organisations, including the regulation of matters relating to their State registration, funding and reporting requirements, has grown increasingly harsh and restrictive. A number of recent amendments to various legislative instruments introduced additional registration and reporting procedures and heavy penalties. There have been long-standing problems with the State registration of NGOs in Azerbaijan (in this connection, see also Ramazanova and Others v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a044363/02, 1 February 2007; Nasibova v. Azerbaijan, no. 4307/04, 18\u00a0October 2007; Ismayilov v. Azerbaijan, no. 4439/04, 17 January 2008; and Aliyev and Others v. Azerbaijan, no. 28736/05, 18 December 2008, in which cases the Court found violations of Article 11 of the Convention). Even following the reforms to the registration procedures regulated by the Law on State Registration, the Court has been receiving new applications concerning allegedly arbitrary delays in State registration of NGOs. Indeed, one of those applications was lodged by Human Rights Club, the NGO founded by the applicant, and has been communicated to the respondent Government (see application no. 27309/14). Furthermore, the abovementioned sources were of the view that the new onerous regulations, coupled with the reportedly intransigent and arbitrary manner in which they were applied by the authorities, made it increasingly difficult for NGOs to operate. The Court takes note of the third parties\u2019 argument that the above circumstances drove a number of NGOs to operate on the fringes of the law in order to continue securing funding for their activities. While the Court is not called upon to give a judicial assessment of the general situation outlined above in the context of the present complaint, it nevertheless considers that this background information is extremely relevant to the present case and calls for particularly close scrutiny of the facts giving rise to the charges brought against the applicant.",

In particular, the description consisted of a single sentence spanning about one page of printed text. It can be discerned from that description that the applicant was accused of operating an NGO lacking State registration and receiving a number of grants during the period between 2010 and 2014 which he had failed to register with the Ministry of Justice as required by law. The financial and other activities involving the grant money were considered \u201cillegal entrepreneurial activity\u201d because the grants had not been registered. Furthermore, all of the grant money received during that period (AZN\u00a0147,900.85, later adjusted to AZN 150,170.62) was deemed to be \u201cprofit\u201d acquired by the applicant from this illegal entrepreneurial activity, on which he had allegedly failed to pay simplified tax at the rate of 4% under Articles 218, 219 and 220 of the Tax Code and in the amount of AZN\u00a06,162.24 (later adjusted to AZN 6,257.11), as such committing a criminal offence of tax evasion.

As such, all previous decisions ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been based solely on the original charges under Articles 192.2.2, 213 and 308 of the Criminal Code, and therefore the new charges were of no significance to the assessment of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the applicant\u2019s detention during the period falling within the scope of the present case, and the Government have not expressly argued otherwise.",

There was additional information regarding alleged deficiencies in some service contracts concluded by the applicant and amounts paid under these contracts. Presumably, this was the basis for the suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of \u201cforgery by an official\u201d under Article 313 of the Criminal Code. However, the Government again failed to produce before the Court any specific evidence or information which could constitute the basis for the prosecuting authorities\u2019 suspicions in this regard. As for the charge of embezzlement under Article\u00a0179.3.2 of the Criminal Code, the Court cannot characterise it as anything other than spurious, given that the money was given to the applicant voluntarily by donors under grant agreements and that the donors expressed complete confidence that the money had been spent properly for the purposes for which it had been allocated. Taking into account the manifest unreasonableness of the original three charges against the applicant (see paragraph 130 above) and the heightened level of scrutiny required by the specific context of the present case (see paragraph 120 above), the Court considers that the respondent Government also failed to satisfy the Court that the applicant was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offences under Articles 179.3.2 and 313 of the Criminal Code.",

He did not complain of an isolated incident, but tried to demonstrate that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State had been misused ab initio, and that from beginning to end the authorities had been acting in bad faith and with blatant disregard for the Convention. In essence, the applicant tried to persuade the Court that everything in his case was contrary to the Convention, and that the criminal proceedings against him were therefore invalid. That allegation was a serious one, because it assailed the general presumption of good faith on the part of the public authorities and required particularly weighty evidence in support. None of the accusations against the applicant were political. He had not been an opposition leader or a public official. The acts which had been imputed to him were not related to his participation in political life, real or imaginary \u2013 he had been prosecuted for common criminal offences, such as tax evasion, fraud, and so on. The Government submitted that the restrictions imposed by the State in the present case pursuant to Article 5 of the Convention had not been applied for any purpose other than one envisaged by that provision, and strictly for the proper investigation of serious criminal offences allegedly committed by the applicant.",

As the Court has previously held in its case-law, the whole structure of the Convention rests on the general assumption that public authorities in the member States act in good faith. Indeed, any public policy or individual measure may have a \u201chidden agenda\u201d, and the presumption of good faith is rebuttable. However, an applicant alleging that his rights and freedoms were limited for an improper reason must convincingly show that the real aim of the authorities was not the same as that proclaimed or which could be reasonably inferred from the context. A mere suspicion that the authorities used their powers for some other purpose than those defined in the Convention is not sufficient to prove that Article\u00a018 was breached (see Khodorkovskiy, cited above, \u00a7 255).",

As a consequence, there are only a few cases where a breach of that Convention provision has been found. Thus, in Gusinskiy (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78), the Court accepted that the applicant\u2019s liberty had been restricted, inter alia, for a purpose other than those mentioned in Article 5. It based its findings on a signed agreement between the detainee and a federal Minister for the Press, from which it was clear that the applicant\u2019s detention had been imposed in order to make him sell his media company to the State. In Cebotari v. Moldova (no.\u00a035615/06, \u00a7\u00a7 46 et seq., 13 November 2007) the Court found a violation of Article 18 of the Convention where the applicant\u2019s arrest was obviously linked to an application pending before the Court. In Lutsenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 6492/11, \u00a7\u00a7 108-09, 3 July 2012) the prosecuting authorities seeking the applicant\u2019s arrest explicitly indicated that the applicant\u2019s communication with the media was one of the grounds for his arrest, such reasoning clearly demonstrating that his arrest was an attempt to punish him for publicly disagreeing with accusations against him. In Tymoshenko v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 49872/11, \u00a7 299, 30\u00a0April 2013) the reasoning formally advanced by the authorities suggested that the actual purpose of the detention was to punish the applicant for a lack of respect towards the court, which it was claimed she had been demonstrating by her behaviour during judicial proceedings. Furthermore, both the Lutsenko and Tymoshenko cases were similar in their circumstances, in that both applicants \u2013 who were former high-ranking government officials and leaders of opposition parties \u2013 were, soon after the change of power, accused of abuse of power, and the authorities\u2019 actions against them were considered by the public to be part of the politically motivated prosecution of opposition leaders in Ukraine. However, in both cases, the Court chose to look at the matter separately from the general context of the allegedly politically motivated prosecution, because in each case it was possible to discern other specific features (described above), which led to a finding of a breach of Article 18 (see Lutsenko, cited above, \u00a7 108, and Tymoshenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 296 and 298-99). In Ilgar Mammadov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014243), the Court found that the standard of proof was satisfied because the combination of the relevant case-specific facts clearly demonstrated that the actual purpose of the measures taken by the authorities had been to silence or punish the applicant for criticising the government and attempting to disseminate what he believed was true information that the government were trying to hide.",

In particular, the Court considered that Article 34 of the Convention had been breached where: an applicant had been unable to discuss issues concerning an application before the Court with his representative without their being separated by a glass partition (see Cebotari, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058-68, 13\u00a0November 2007); an applicant had been unable to communicate with his representative before the Court during his treatment in hospital (see Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, \u00a7 140, ECHR 2008); and where an applicant\u2019s contact with his representative before the Court had been restricted on the grounds that the representative was not a professional advocate and did not belong to any Bar association (see Zakharkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 1555/04, \u00a7\u00a7 152-60, 10 June 2010). The Court has, however, accepted that compliance by a representative with certain formal requirements might be necessary before obtaining access to a detainee, for instance for security reasons or in order to prevent collusion or some action to pervert the course of the investigation or justice (see Melnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a023610/03, \u00a7 96, 14\u00a0January 2010). At the same time, excessive formalities in such matters, such as those that could de facto prevent a prospective applicant from effectively enjoying his right of individual petition, have been found to be unacceptable. By contrast, where the domestic formalities were easy to comply with, no issue arose under Article\u00a034 (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 119, 25\u00a0October 2007).",

The only reason given for refusing to allow the applicant\u2019s representative to meet him was that his licence to practise law had been suspended on 10 December 2014 (see paragraph 49 above). However, the Court notes that the suspension of Mr\u00a0Bagirov\u2019s licence, which under domestic law prevented him from representing applicants in domestic criminal proceedings, could not be interpreted as a measure limiting his rights in the representation of applicants before the Court. Given that permission to represent an applicant may be granted to a non-advocate under Rule 36 \u00a7 4 (a) of the Rules of Court, Contracting States must ensure that non-advocate representatives are allowed to visit detainees who have lodged or intend to lodge an application with the Court under the same conditions as advocates (see Zakharkin, cited above, \u00a7 157).",

In particular, the applicable domestic law specifically provides that detainees also have the right to meet with persons other than advocates who are authorised to provide them with legal assistance (see paragraph 77 above).",

The Contracting Party\u2019s procedural obligations under Articles 34 and 38 of the Convention must be enforced irrespective of the eventual outcome of the proceedings, and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential chilling effect on the applicants or their representatives (see Janowiec and Others v.
