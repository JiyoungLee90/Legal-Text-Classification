On 11 January 2012 the Asylum Court (Asylgerichtshof) quashed that decision pursuant to Article 66 \u00a7 2 of the Code of General Administrative Procedure (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz) on the grounds that the facts had not been established exhaustively. It stated that the Asylum Office had failed to update its country information regarding the risk of refoulement of asylumseekers from Hungary to Serbia.

In addition to general information on the situation of asylum-seekers in Hungary, the Asylum Office referred to information obtained from the Austrian Embassy in Hungary dated 25 January and 2\u00a0February 2012. According to that information, the detention of minors could not be ordered in Hungary. If a detained refugee claimed to be a minor, an age assessment was ordered and the minor was released if his or her age was confirmed. As regards the evaluation of Serbia by Hungary as a safe third country, the Hungarian authorities stated that they did not have a list of safe third countries and evaluated each case individually. However, in most cases Serbia was considered to be a safe third country. Hungary expelled asylum-seekers to Serbia, if their first asylum proceedings were terminated and there was no obstacle under the non-refoulement rule. A person lodging a subsequent asylum request was not allowed to remain in Hungary. The same applied for Dublin returnees if their first asylum proceedings were terminated. If asylum proceedings were discontinued after an asylum-seeker left Hungary, an asylum request after his or her return under the Dublin regulation was considered a subsequent asylum request. It was further established that appeals against asylum decisions at first instance and during the first proceedings had automatic suspensive effect. However, appeals against decisions in subsequent asylum proceedings did not. It was in any event possible to lodge an appeal against the expulsion order itself. It was then up to the judge\u2019s discretion to award the proceedings suspensive effect.",

It further held that the information had shown that Hungary did not practise refoulement to Serbia. Finally, the Hungarian authorities had assumed jurisdiction over the applicant\u2019s asylum request under Article 16 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Dublin\u00a0II Regulation, which proved that the applicant still had access to asylum proceedings on the merits in Hungary.

It pointed out that the Hungarian authorities had informed the Asylum Office that they had planned an age assessment, but could not carry it out because the applicant had left the country. Thereupon, on 24 October 2011 the Hungarian authorities had discontinued his proceedings. However, the Asylum Court assumed that because of Hungary\u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction under Article 16 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Dublin\u00a0II Regulation the applicant would have access to asylum proceedings on the merits in Hungary. In its reasoning the Asylum Court took note of a letter from the UNHCR Office in Vienna dated 3 February 2012, seemingly citing problems with the techniques of age assessment in Hungary, detention and the detention conditions for asylum-seekers, refoulement to Serbia and the fact that a Dublin-returner\u2019s asylum request was considered a subsequent asylum request if the proceedings had been discontinued in Hungary. However, the Asylum Court noted a lack of sources in the UNHCR\u2019s letter and referred to the recently updated country information obtained by the Austrian asylum authorities, which did not indicate systematic deficiencies in the Hungarian asylum proceedings and reception conditions that would have warranted an extensive use of the sovereignty clause of Article 3 \u00a7 2 of the Dublin II Regulation.",

If he was returned to Hungary, an asylum request would be considered a subsequent request which would not have automatic suspensive effect if there were no new circumstances supporting his application but there was a safe third country which he could be returned to. Regarding the issue of appointing a guardian for the minor applicant, the Hungarian authorities stated that unaccompanied minor asylum-seekers were usually immediately assigned a guardian, except when the applicant would reach the age of majority before the decision on the merits was taken. Unaccompanied minors were placed in a children\u2019s home in F\u00f3t, where care and education were provided to them according to their age. Having regard to the fact that the applicant would turn 18 on 1 January 2013, it was very unlikely that a guardian would be appointed for him upon his return.",

The issue of prolonging the detention of an asylum-seeker and the lack of proper judicial review were consistently raised during interviews it conducted. The right to a complaint which could be submitted against a detention order was not often explicitly communicated to those being detained. The Working Group therefore called to the Hungarian Government\u2019s attention the fact that the situation of asylum-seekers and migrants in irregular situations needed robust improvements and attention to ensure against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. It recommended that the measures introduced by the recent law, which were considered to be positive, should be implemented in a clear and defined manner. Detention should not be the common and first resort and should be for the shortest possible duration, especially when genuine asylum-seekers may be overlooked or detained unnecessarily without proper justification.",

Furthermore, the Court has reiterated that where States cooperate in an area where there might be implications for the protection of fundamental rights, it would be incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention if they were absolved of all responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the Convention in the area concerned (see, among other authorities, Waite and Kennedy v.

The country reports showed that there is still a practice of detaining asylum-seekers, and that so-called asylum detention is also applicable to Dublin returnees. The grounds for detention are vaguely formulated, and there is no legal remedy against asylum detention. However, the reports also showed that there is no systematic detention of asylum-seekers anymore, and that alternatives to detention are now provided for by law. The maximum period of detention has been limited to six months. Turning to the conditions of detention, it is noted that while there are still reports of shortcomings in the detention system, from an overall view there seem to have been improvements.",
