According to the report of the official who conducted the investigative measures, the second applicant was not consistent in his submissions: he had indicated different men in military uniform and different grey UAZ cars. He failed to identify a particular person because he was afraid to make a mistake due to his bad eyesight. In an \u201cexplanation\u201d dated 16 April 2003 the second applicant stated that although he had seen the men who had abducted his son, he could have made a mistake trying to identify them since he had bad eyesight and everyone in a military uniform seemed the same to him. The second applicant alleged that he had signed this \u201cexplanation\u201d because the investigator had told him to. However, the investigator did not read it out to him. Neither a copy of the report nor a copy of the \u201cexplanation\u201d have been submitted to the Court.",

According to the Government, the prosecuting authorities first received his application on 22 January 2003.

No other witnesses, including other applicants, witnesses indicated by the applicants, servicemen or other State officials were questioned with regard to the events of 4-5 January 2003 at all.

However, it appears that no identification parades were conducted with the participation of the FSB or ROVD officers deployed in Urus-Martan.

The officers questioned M, the transport police officer who had stopped the driver with Mr Ali Khadayev\u2019s driving licence, the two witnesses present when the report on administrative offence of drunken driving had been drawn up, and K. of the drug clinic where the driver had been transferred to for an examination. They also seized Mr Ali Khadayev\u2019s driving licence and enclosed it in the investigation file. At the same time it appears that graphological examination of signatures on administrative reports and of Mr Ali Khadayev\u2019s signature on his driving licence and his passport was not conducted. Furthermore, although \u2013 according to the Government \u2013 the owner of the car driven by the man with Mr\u00a0Ali Khadayev\u2019s driving licence was being \u201csearched for\u201d, it is not clear which particular measures were taken to establish the whereabouts of the owner as well as of the driver.

Although the enquiries were mostly made by the first and second applicants, the seventh applicant went to Pyatigorsk to search for his brother after it became known that a man with his driving licence had been found guilty of an administrative offence. For these reasons, in the present case the Court does not consider it necessary to distinguish any family members who could not have standing as victims for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention (see Luluyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-13).",

In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee.

According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the effect of Article 13 of the Convention is to require the provision of a remedy at national level allowing the competent domestic authority both to deal with the substance of a relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they comply with their obligations under this provision. However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p.\u00a01020, \u00a7 64).",
