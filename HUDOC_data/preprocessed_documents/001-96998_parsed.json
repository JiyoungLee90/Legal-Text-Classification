Moreover, the inclusion of lay assessors is a common feature in many countries. In particular cases, however, the assessors\u2019 independence and impartiality may be open to doubt (see AB\u00a0Kurt Kellermann v. Sweden, no. 41579/98, \u00a7 60, 26 October 2004).",

In that case the Court found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in that the assessors of the Regional Appeals Commission were nominated by and had close links with the bodies which had concluded the general agreement challenged by the applicant, namely the Association of Social Insurance Boards and the Tyrol Regional Medical Association. In addition, in one set of proceedings the two assessors were senior officials of the applicant\u2019s opponent in the proceedings, namely the Tyrol Health Insurance Board.",

More importantly, employees of the Regional Health Insurance Board and the Regional Medical Association, which are parties to the general agreement on which the individual contract in dispute is based, cannot be assessors in the respective Regional Appeals Commissions.",

Thus the assessors appointed upon the proposal of the Association of Social Insurance Boards were not members of the Lower Austrian Health Insurance Board, which was the applicant\u2019s opponent in the proceedings. The Court agrees with the Constitutional Court\u2019s view that the mere fact that other Regional Health Insurance Boards have provisions in their general agreements which are similar or identical to the provisions of the Remuneration Regulation, which was in dispute in the present case, does not suffice to cast doubt on the independence and impartiality of the assessors. A finding to the contrary would be tantamount to excluding lay assessors from a large number of cases, thus depriving the Regional Appeals Commissions of their specific expertise on the subject matter. In sum, the Court has not found any circumstances in the present case which would have upset the balance inherent in the participation of lay assessors in the Regional Appeals Board.",
