Therefore, the Government bore responsibility for the debtor\u2019s actions from the moment when the applicants\u2019 judgments became final and until it was excluded from the Register. They argued that those periods could not be considered excessive. As regards the period after 30 July 2010, the Government, referring to the Court\u2019s case law (see Dovgal v. Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a050726/06, 20 October 2009), maintained that the State was responsible for the non-enforcement in the applicant\u2019s favour only insofar as the State Bailiffs\u2019 Service was involved, while the applicants had not challenged before the domestic courts the Bailiffs\u2019 alleged inactivity in the enforcement of their judgments.
