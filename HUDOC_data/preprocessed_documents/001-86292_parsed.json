It is therefore incumbent on the State to organise a system for enforcement of judgments that is effective both in law and in practice and ensures their enforcement without any undue delay (Fuklev v. , no.\u00a071186/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 7\u00a0June\u00a02005). While the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining logistical arrangements for the administration of justice, these arrangements should foster accurate record-keeping practices and enable the parties to obtain prompt access to information concerning the developments in their proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Sukhorubchenko v. , no.\u00a069315/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a045 and 53, 10 February 2005).",

The Court observes, further, that the Government presented no evidence that the applicant had been duly notified about the availability of the payment, or even about the institution of the enforcement proceedings on his behalf, as required by domestic law (see paragraphs 20-21 above). On the contrary, taking into account that the applicant\u2019s name was misspelled in the Bailiffs\u2019 records and that the applicant has made several unsuccessful attempts to locate the enforcement writ, which generated contradictory responses by various authorities (see paragraphs\u00a07,\u00a011-19 above), the Court finds credible his submissions concerning lack of adequate record-keeping and access to information as regards the status of the enforcement.

Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a035, 27\u00a0May\u00a02004 and Iatridis\u00a0v.\u00a0Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a032, ECHR\u00a02000-XI). Therefore, the Court concludes that the State\u2019s outstanding obligation to enforce the judgment given in the applicant\u2019s favour is not in dispute. The Court further finds that the applicant must have suffered non-pecuniary damage on account of the prolonged inability to obtain compensation for the unlawful actions of the law-enforcement authorities.
