Article\u00a0292 of the Civil Code establishes, as a general rule, that the right of use accruing to family members of the owner of a flat does not survive a change in ownership \u201cunless statute stipulates otherwise\u201d (see paragraph 13 above). However, no such stipulation emerges from the existing body of law. Article 31 \u00a7 4 of the Housing Code and section 19 of the Housing Code Enactment Act deal with a different kind of situation, that is to say the breakdown of a family relationship between the current owner of a property and persons living under the same roof with him or her, rather than a change in ownership (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).",

The Court reiterates that the requirement of foreseeability which the term \u201claw\u201d implies cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development remains consistent with the essence of the provision and could reasonably be foreseen (see OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v.

Still, no provision has been made for any form of registration of the right of use accruing to persons who could not benefit from privatisation. As a result, a potential purchaser, such as the applicant, could not reasonably rely on the information contained in the State-operated property register to establish that the property was free from claims or encumbrances by third parties. In this connection, it is relevant that the Constitutional Court found that the existing framework governing rights of permanent use held by former family members lacked transparency and that the absence of registration of those rights tipped the balance against the new owner. It also directed the legislature to devise a mechanism for registering such interests in property (see paragraph 19 above).",

It was not until the applicant applied for eviction of the former owners\u2019 family that the matter of their right of use was raised for the first time. In those proceedings, the courts interpreted the presence of personal belongings of the adult children in the contested flat as an indication of their intention to continue living there. The applicant could not anticipate the decisive weight that would be attached to that personal chattel, the nature of which was not specified. Even if she could, she would not have been able to look through the owners\u2019 belongings before signing the contract, seeking to establish if they contained anyone else\u2019s items capable of justifying their right of use to the flat.
