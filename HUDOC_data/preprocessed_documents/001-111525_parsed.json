A number of allegations received included recent accounts of beatings on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet, the placing of a plastic bag over the detainee\u2019s head to cause temporary asphyxiation, or the infliction of electric shocks on different parts of the body.

Furthermore, the investigation must be prompt and independent. Lastly, the investigation must afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny to secure accountability. While the degree of public scrutiny required may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.

Switzerland, 12 July 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46, Series A no. 140; Teixeira de Castro v.

It is, therefore, not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law \u2013 may be admissible. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000-V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, \u00a7\u00a076, ECHR 2001-IX; and Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2002-IX).",

In so doing, it observed, inter alia, that there were six separate, unrelated, criminal cases pending concurrently against the applicant and considered this as an aggravating circumstance in his sentencing (see paragraph 42 above). The Court further notes that in his appeal against this judgment, and subsequently at third instance, the applicant complained about the said pronouncement, as well as the consequent \u201cbreach of his right to be presumed innocent\u201d (see paragraphs 44-47 above), albeit to no avail. In these circumstances, the Court considers that, having exhausted the available remedies in the criminal context, the applicant could not in addition have reasonably been expected to make use of a civil claim based on Articles 157, 172 \u00a7 1, 199 and/or 200 of the Obligations Act (see, mutatis mutandis, Matija\u0161evi\u0107 v. , no. 23037/04, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33, ECHR 2006X).",

Turkey, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 52-53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 94, Reports 1998-VIII), no direct evidence of injuries to the plaintiff can be found in the present case. In the absence of substantiated medical reports, visible physical injury, apparent mental suffering, or corroboration by an unbiased witness, sole reliance on the testimony of the plaintiff and his lawyer V.J.\u0110. constitutes insufficient evidence for a finding of guilt. The plaintiff himself admitted that he had failed to acquire a medical report, though he had a whole week to obtain one. Nor did he take a photograph that would have shown his injuries. The Court\u2019s judgment relies on unsubstantiated claims of abuse from other detainees concerning their treatment, as well as the circumstances surrounding the plaintiff\u2019s confession, as indirect evidence of wrongdoing. On the latter issue \u2013 the circumstances surrounding the confession \u2013 this in itself does not convincingly demonstrate the mental suffering or intimidation required for \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading treatment\u201d; the plaintiff\u2019s ultimate decision to confess falls within the scope of what one may reasonably expect during the course of police detention. Admittedly, the repeated detention of Mr Hajnal amounted to harassment and would appear prima facie to have been illegal but these characteristics alone do not constitute a violation of Article 3. As a result, no violation of the substantive aspect of Article 3 was made out and therefore the burden of proof was not reversed, although the objections raised by the applicant should have triggered an investigation into the alleged police brutality. I thus respectfully dissent with regard to the finding of a violation of the substantive aspect of Article 3.",
