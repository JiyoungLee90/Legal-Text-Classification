Equally, the court took into account the fact that the applicant had family in the country at the times he absconded and therefore, contrary to his assertions, their presence did not remove the risk of absconding. Likewise, the Secretary of State\u2019s detention reviews had characterised the risk of the applicant reoffending as \u201chigh\u201d. The court further noted that the applicant\u2019s offences became less serious and more intermittent as time went on. However, the fact remained that while he was free he was committing offences of such seriousness as to require him to be imprisoned, including robbery and public order offences. The court also considered whether alternatives to detention could be used such as electronic tagging, monitoring by telephone and regular reporting. However, given the applicant\u2019s history of absconding, it concluded that the alternatives would not have been sufficient and there was an absence of adequate assurances from the applicant.",

It took into consideration the fact that the Rule\u00a039 measure applied in the applicant\u2019s case did not involve any specific assessment of risk towards him by this Court, since at the material time this Court had adopted a fact-insensitive approach towards Rule 39 measures in respect of removals to Somalia, and noted the consequence that from October 2008 this Court had adjourned 116 applications concerning removal to Somalia. It also took account of correspondence between the Government and the registry of this Court from which it was clear that from April\u00a02009 the Court would be granting a fact-insensitive Rule 39 measure to any applicant with removal directions to Mogadishu as well as the separate correspondence between the Government and this Court concerning the progress of Sufi and Elmi, cited above and the linked domestic case law.",

It accepted that at the time of receipt of the Rule\u00a039 measure in the applicant\u2019s case, although it was not possible to say when the proceedings before the Court would be concluded, there was nonetheless a reasonable prospect of their being concluded and of removal being effected within a reasonable time.

Lord Justice Elias dissented on one point only: acknowledging that \u201cthere is no one right answer to the question what is a reasonable period\u201d, he believed that the period of two weeks which elapsed following the judgment in Sufi and Elmi before the applicant was released from detention was not reasonable in all the circumstances.",

However, the Court of Appeal found that although some of the passages in the review forms were not very happily expressed, they did not involve any legal error. Moreover, as the same conclusion was reached regardless of whether or not reference was made to the question of voluntary return, it appeared that the applicant\u2019s refusal of this offer played no material part in the assessment of whether detention should be maintained.",

This claim was also reinforced through the imposition of the Rule 39 measure. The third was because he was exercising a right of in-country appeal with suspensive effect against his deportation notice from 10 June 2010, and from at least 25\u00a0November 2010 there was a statutory bar on his removal until those proceedings completed on 12\u00a0July 2011.",

At the outset the Court notes that it is well documented that around that time it faced a significant increase in the number of cases coming before it. The Declaration made at the High Level conference on the Future of the European Court of Human Rights in April 2011 in Izmir also recorded the increase in the number of interim measures requested in accordance with Rule 39 and emphasised the importance of speedily examining the merits of the case concerned by the Rule 39 measure. Indeed, this general context is referred to by the Court of Appeal, who characterised the interaction between the Rule 39 measure; the lead case before this Court on deportations to Somalia; and related domestic litigation as complex, and the inevitable result of the volume of migration and proliferation of litigation.",

In this respect, the Court also notes that aside from the litigation there were no other barriers to the applicant\u2019s expulsion, as all other issues concerning his immigration status had been dealt with. The fact that the applicant was detained for two weeks following the decision in Sufi and Elmi, cited above does not affect this conclusion in light of the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case and the broader context (see paragraph 20, above). In this regard, the Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s representative accepted that one week would have been reasonable and all members of the Court of Appeal agreed that there was \u201cno one right answer to the question what is a reasonable period\u201d (see paragraph 20, above).

The Court further notes that, whilst taking into account the fact that the judgment in Sufi and Elmi was not yet final and a request for referral to the Grand Chamber had been made, the Tribunal in AMM & Others (Conflict; Humanitarian Crisis; Returnees; FGM) Somalia CG expressly and in some detail considered the consequences of that judgment on the ability of the Government to resume removals to Somalia (\u00a7\u00a7 55-133).",

The interim measure was therefore imposed awaiting clarification in the lead case of Sufi and Elmi, cited above, of the country conditions in Somalia. The Court was evidently satisfied that there was an imminent risk of irreparable damage to the applicant (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a0104, ECHR\u00a02005I) and indeed that risk was later confirmed.
