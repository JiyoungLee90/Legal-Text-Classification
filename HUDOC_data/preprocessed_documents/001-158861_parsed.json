It held that the public\u2019s right to information resulted from the claimant\u2019s position in society, and that the pressure that he might have experienced as a result of those disclosures, aimed at obliging him to recognise his child, did not prohibit publication but was merely an inevitable consequence of it, which he was required to tolerate. It noted that the published photographs had been taken with the claimant\u2019s agreement, in his private sphere, and had been made available to the press by a person who had just as much right to do so as the claimant. It held that the protection of the claimant\u2019s private sphere and his right to his own image had to yield to the freedom of the press, on account of the importance of communicating to the public information concerning the claimant\u2019s son born out of wedlock and about the child\u2019s mother.

In this connection, they submitted that, in practice, the criterion of \u201ccontribution to a debate of public interest\u201d, however pertinent, guaranteed the requisite balance between freedom of expression and the protection of private life only when it was correctly applied and not subverted. In the present case, the considerations relating to the paternity of a child who was clearly excluded from succession to the throne could not fall within the scope of a debate of public interest. According to the Monegasque Government, the main \u2013 if not the sole \u2013 purpose of the article had been to satisfy the curiosity of a certain readership with regard to the private life of public figures. Moreover, it was to be feared that the approach taken in the Chamber judgment would result in future in too broad an interpretation of the justification of a contribution to a debate of public interest, which would seriously undermine the protection of private life which public figures were legitimately entitled to expect, particularly those exercising political functions.",

Yet the Chamber judgment created a grave risk in this regard, namely that the protection afforded to political figures\u2019 private lives would henceforth be severely restricted, or indeed reduced to nought.

In particular, it stresses the importance of obtaining the consent of the persons concerned, and the more or less strong sense of intrusion caused by a photograph (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no.\u00a059320/00, ECHR 2004VI, \u00a7 59; Gurgenidze v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 71678/01, \u00a7\u00a7 55-60, 17 October 2006; and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v.

Another factor in the Court\u2019s assessment is the purpose for which a photograph was used and how it could be used subsequently (see Reklos and Davourlis v.

Thus, the task of imparting information necessarily includes \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d, as well as limits which the press must impose on itself spontaneously (see Mater v. Turkey, no. 54997/08, \u00a7 55, 16 July 2013). Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v.

This is nonetheless an area in which the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance, as the photographs may contain very personal or even intimate information about an individual or his or her family (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 103). Lastly, although the publication of news about the private life of public figures is generally for the purposes of entertainment rather than education, it contributes to the variety of information available to the public and undoubtedly benefits from the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. However, such protection may cede to the requirements of Article 8 where the information at stake is of a private and intimate nature and there is no public interest in its dissemination (see Mosley v. the United Kingdom, no. 48009/08, \u00a7 131, 10\u00a0May 2011).",

The margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in assessing whether such a \u201cneed\u201d exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107).",

Where it examines an application lodged under Article\u00a010, the Court will also examine the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity, and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the journalists or publishers (ibid.).

Likewise, the attitude of the Prince, who wished to keep his paternity a secret and refused to acknowledge it publicly (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), could, in a hereditary monarchy whose future is intrinsically linked to the existence of descendants, also be of concern to the public. This was equally true with regard to his behaviour in respect of the child\u2019s mother \u2013 who was unable to obtain either the notarial deed of recognition of her son, or its transcription into the register of births, marriages and deaths (see paragraph 17 above)\u00a0\u2013 and the child himself: this information could provide insights into the Prince\u2019s personality, particularly with regard to the way in which he approached and assumed his responsibilities.",

This was the Court\u2019s conclusion, in particular, with regard to the illness of Prince Rainier III (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 117). In the Court\u2019s opinion, this is also the case with regard to the birth of a child, even one born out of wedlock, especially since, at the date of the impugned events, the child in question appeared to be the Prince\u2019s only descendant.

In assessing the circumstances submitted for their appreciation, the domestic courts did not give due consideration to the principles and criteria as laid down by the Court\u2019s case-law for balancing the right to respect for private life and the right to freedom of expression (see paragraphs 142-43 above). They thus exceeded the margin of appreciation afforded to them and failed to strike a reasonable balance of proportionality between the measures restricting the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression, imposed by them, and the legitimate aim pursued.",
