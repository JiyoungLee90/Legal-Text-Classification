The case originated in an application (no. 61949/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr Sean McNamee (“the applicant”) on 5 May 2000.
The applicant was represented before the Court by McCann and McCann Solicitors, . The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, .
The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.
By a partial decision of 4 December 2001 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning widows’ benefits and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. It also decided to join this application to other applications (nos. 60525/00, 60933/00, 60937/00, 60944/00, 61038/00, 61388/00, 62776/00, 63388/00, 63464/00, 63469/00, 63470/00, 63473/00, 63474/00, 63584/00, 63645/00, 63701/00, 63702/00, 64735/01 and 65723/01). By a decision of 26 August 2003 the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.
The applicant lives in .
His wife died in May 2000. They had no children from the marriage. His claim for widows’ benefits was made in June 2000 and was rejected on 15 June 2000 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under  law.
