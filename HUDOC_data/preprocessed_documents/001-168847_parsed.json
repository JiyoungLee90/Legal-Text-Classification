This caused the applicant company to apply to the courts on a regular basis with identical claims.

As customs duties or charges for imported goods must be regarded as falling within the realm of taxation, and as tax matters still form part of the hard core of publicauthority prerogatives, with the public nature of the relationship between the taxpayer and the community remaining predominant, the Court considers that tax disputes, including disputes about the determination of import duties or charges, fall outside the scope of civil rights and obligations, despite the pecuniary effects which they necessarily produce for the taxpayer (see Emesa Sugar N.V., v. the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a062023/00, 13\u00a0January 2005; Ketko and Mroz v.
