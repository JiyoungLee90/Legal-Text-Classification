In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I). In the present case, there is no appearance that the courts lacked impartiality or that the proceedings were otherwise unfair or arbitrary.",
