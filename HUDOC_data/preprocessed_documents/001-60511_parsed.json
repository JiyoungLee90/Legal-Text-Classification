It emphasised that the proceedings took a very long time, considering that the case was not complicated. According to the applicant, the fact that Turkish law had to be applied did not affect the complexity of the case as the Court had heard a legal opinion of a Turkish expert appointed by the City Court. Even though several sets of observations were submitted to the Court of Appeal, the period of four years before that instance could not be regarded as reasonable. The applicant pointed out that the reporting officer was assigned only on 20 February 1992, i.e. fourteen months after the appeals had been received. It was further noted by the applicant that the case was finally brought before the Court of Appeal on 16 December 1993 and the decision was rendered on 30 December 1994, i.e. over one year later, after a request to expedite the proceedings. Finally, the applicant stressed that the increasing number of cases pending before the Court of Appeal could not be regarded as a valid reason.",

In respect of the Court of Appeal proceedings the Court notes that it took the Court of Appeal some fourteen months to assign a reporting officer to the case and over a year to render a decision after the case was finally submitted. However, it must be borne in mind that the applicant had also lodged further observations on 16\u00a0March\u00a01994, i.e. after the final submission of the case. Some further observations were submitted by other parties even later in April and May 1994.
