The first is lack of \u201csufficient means to pay for legal assistance\u201d, the second is that \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d must require that such assistance be given free (see, among many other authorities, Wersel v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7 43). In discharging that obligation, the State must, moreover, display diligence so as to secure to those persons the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article\u00a06 (see, among many other authorities, R.D. v. , nos. 29692/96 and 34612/97, \u00a7 44, 18 December 2001).",

The Court reiterates that the requirement that an appellant be represented by a qualified lawyer before a court of cassation cannot, in itself, be seen as contrary to Article 6. This requirement is clearly compatible with the characteristics of the Supreme Court as the highest court in Poland examining extraordinary remedies such as cassation appeals on points of law and it is a common feature of the legal systems in several member States of the Council of Europe (see Vacher v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2148-49, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 28; Staroszczyk v. Poland, no. 59519/00, \u00a7\u00a0128, 22 March 2007). On the other hand, there can be no doubt that a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that the lack of sufficient means will not be an obstacle for the parties to lodge available remedies to these courts.",
