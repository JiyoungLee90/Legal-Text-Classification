This amount was calculated on the basis of the total amount of the lost rent from the date of the Convention\u2019s entry into force in respect of , as indexed according to the National Bank\u2019s interest rates, amounting to approximately USD\u00a026,754. The Government noted, however, that the interior of the flat located in a recently constructed building required minimum fittings and decoration work, which usually fell to be done by the owner and without which the flat would not be suitable for use. Therefore, the Government claimed that the total amount of lost rent should be reduced by an estimated sum of USD\u00a07,359 for the expenses that the applicant would inevitably have incurred for the necessary work, and that a further sum of USD 3,746 (at the annual rate of 14%) should be deducted for the taxes that the applicant should have paid on rental revenue. In support of their calculations, the Government submitted an estimate provided by a commercial consulting company on rental rates for flats in a similar condition as well as an estimate of the expenses for the necessary work from the same company.",

The Court accepts this argument; however, it cannot accept the specific amount proposed by the Government as the estimate for such expenses in the present case, as this estimate was not supported by any explanations as to which specific work was required or the breakdown of costs. In any event, the Court also notes that, in addition to the initial work, there would have been other inevitable expenses relating to the flat\u2019s maintenance over the years. Moreover, it would not be unreasonable to suppose that the applicant could have experienced certain delays in finding suitable tenants, further reducing the actual amount of revenue he could expect to receive from renting out the flat during the relevant period (Radanovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 65). Having regard to the above considerations and to the information available in respect of similar matters in other cases, the Court, deciding on an equitable basis, considers that it is reasonable to reduce the total adjusted amount of lost rent (referred to in paragraph 26 above) by a lump sum of 30%, in order to account for losses incurred owing to the work, maintenance and possible delays in finding suitable tenants.",
