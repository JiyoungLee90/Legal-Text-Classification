Greece ([GC] (just satisfaction), no. 25701/94, \u00a7\u00a072, 28\u00a0November\u00a02002) that a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation to put an end to the breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach. The Court is of the opinion that this principle is also applicable in cases such as the present ones, where a Government seeks to obtain strike-out decisions by means of unilateral declarations (Decev v. Moldova (no. 2), no. 7365/05, \u00a7\u00a018, 24\u00a0February 2009).",

The Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress is to ensure that the applicant is put as far as possible in the position it would have been if the requirements of those provisions not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003). For that reason, the Court accepts the applicant company\u2019s claim and awards it the sum of EUR\u00a018,400 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount. In respect of the remainder of the debt, the Court notes that Article\u00a0449 (h) of the Moldovan Code of Civil Procedure provides for the possibility of reopening domestic proceedings where the Court has found a violation of an applicant\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms.",
