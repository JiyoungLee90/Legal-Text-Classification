As regards the charges for defamation and false accusation of a crime, the judge held that there were reasonable doubts as to whether the applicant had been aware of the messages in question before his police interview and that he should therefore be acquitted in that regard. It was also alleged that he had protected the individuals who had made the defamatory statements; however, the judge considered that he could not be found guilty of concealment as it had not been proved that he had been aware at the time of his police interview that it had been possible for him to have access to the Internet Protocol (IP) numbers of the participants on the forum.",

Those expressions imputed the commission of crimes to the complainants (sexual assault, sexual slavery of a person) and were detrimental to their fame and reputation to the extent that it is obvious that the imputations were serious in themselves and related to public understanding, which is an open-ended concept of which interpretation depends on the particular facts of the case. It is worth remembering that we are speaking here of a small town where everybody knows each other, where everybody runs into each other, where everybody attends the same places, where everyday life is routine and there is little room for novelties, where anything breaking the monotony is something which attracts public attention, where the genealogy of every inhabitant is known to the rest.
