They had no training in such a task, which was pre-eminently a judicial function. In the applicants' submission, the decision-making procedures in the lead-up to the administration of diamorphine to the first applicant and the insertion of a DNR notice in his case notes failed to ensure effective respect for the interests of both applicants, in contravention of the respondent State's positive obligations under Article 8. They further pleaded that the impugned interferences were not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d since the relevant domestic legal framework did not regulate what the medical authorities were required to do in circumstances where life-threatening treatment was proposed and a DNR notice included in the first applicant's medical notes without the second applicant's knowledge. Leaving the decision to involve the courts to the discretion of doctors was, in their view, a wholly inadequate basis on which to ensure effective respect for the rights of vulnerable patients such as the first applicant. They argued that the arbitrary nature of the current situation could be remedied by introducing greater clarity into, for example, the above-mentioned aide-m\u00e9moire on consent (see paragraph 53 above).",

Significantly, the second applicant chose to admit the first applicant to St Mary's Hospital on 20\u00a0October 1998, in full knowledge of the tenor of the discussions which she had had with the doctors there in the preceding months. Had there been an irreconcilable difference of opinion between the second applicant and the doctors during the period between 9 September and 20 October 1998, it would have been open to the second applicant to seek another hospital or to bring an application before the High Court. Moreover, it was not practical for the Trust to seek the intervention of the courts with respect to the second applicant's opposition to the administration of diamorphine to her son, given that the latter's condition was clearly perceived to be critical on 20\u00a0October 1998. The doctors' duty to act in the first applicant's best interests required them to react swiftly to his serious condition. For the Government, had an urgent application been made to the High Court on 20\u00a0October 1998, whether by the Trust or by the second applicant, that court could have offered no remedy that could have benefited her in the circumstances of the case. In particular, the High Court would not have ordered the doctors to provide treatment that they did not consider clinically appropriate and would not have regarded the second applicant's views as determinative if they conflicted seriously with the doctors' views of the first applicant's best interests.",

The Government pointed out that the applicants had hitherto consistently relied on the fact that, save in exceptional circumstances, domestic law required that doctors must have the consent of a person with parental responsibility before treating a child who lacks capacity and, in the event of a disagreement, recourse must be had to the courts.

The Government have observed that the second applicant had given doctors at St\u00a0Mary's Hospital on the previous occasions on which he had been admitted authorisation to pursue particular courses of treatment (see paragraphs 15, 17 and 66 above). However, it is clear that, when confronted with the reality of the administration of diamorphine to the first applicant, the second applicant expressed her firm opposition to this form of treatment. These objections were overridden, including in the face of her continuing opposition. The Court considers that the decision to impose treatment on the first applicant in defiance of the second applicant's objections gave rise to an interference with the first applicant's right to respect for his private life, and in particular his right to physical integrity (on the latter point, see, mutatis mutandis, X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, \u00a7 22; Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061 and 63, ECHR 2002-III; and Y.F. v.

However, that argument does not detract from the fact of interference. It is, rather, an argument which goes to the necessity of the interference and has to be addressed in that context.",

The doctors at the hospital were obviously concerned about the second applicant's reluctance to follow their advice, in particular their view that morphine might have to be administered to her son in order to relieve any distress which the first applicant might experience during a subsequent attack. It cannot be overlooked in this connection that Dr Walker recorded in his notes on 8 September 1998 that recourse to the courts might be needed in order to break the deadlock with the second applicant. Dr Hallet reached a similar conclusion following his meeting with the second applicant on 9 September (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above).",

In addition, it cannot speculate as to what would have been the outcome of an application by the Trust to the High Court for authorisation to pursue the proposed. treatment On the other hand, the second applicant can be considered to have suffered stress and anxiety in her dealings with the doctors and officials representing the Trust as well as feelings of powerlessness and frustration in trying to defend her own perception of what was in the best interests of her child. Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicants jointly 10,000 euros (EUR).",

Beyond any speculation as to what would have been the outcome of an application to the High Court for authorisation to pursue the treatment proposed by the doctors (see paragraph 87 of the judgment), the facts have shown \u2013 nearly six years later and to date \u2013 that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, maternal instinct has had more weight than medical opinion.",
