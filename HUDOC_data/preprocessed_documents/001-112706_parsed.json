In so doing, she concluded that they had been discriminated against on the basis of their registered residence, i.e. as non-residents of the seven privileged municipalities, and recommended to the Government to take all necessary measures in order to ensure that all reservists be afforded the payments recognised by their decision of 17 January 2008. The Government was also invited to provide the Commissioner with an appropriate \u201caction plan\u201d within a period of thirty days. In its reasoning, the Commissioner\u2019s decision noted, inter alia, that the payments in question were per diems, notwithstanding that the Government had chosen to consider them as social benefits awarded to persons in need (socijalna pomo\u0107), and that this was best exemplified by the fact that the reservists in question had had to renounce their legal claims concerning the per diems as well as the fact that the individual reservists resident in the seven municipalities at issue were never under an obligation to prove their indigence (imovinsko stanje i socijalnu ugro\u017eenost). This being so, there was clearly no objective and reasonable justification for the differential treatment of reservists merely on the basis of their residence.",

There is no indication that in the case at issue the debtor/respondent had actually done so.

The application of Article\u00a014 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive Convention rights. It is sufficient \u2013 and also necessary \u2013 for the facts of the case to fall \u201cwithin the ambit\u201d of one or more of the Convention Articles (see Burden v. the  [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7 58, ECHR\u00a02008). The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention article, for which the  has voluntarily decided to provide. This principle is well entrenched in the Court\u2019s case-law. It was expressed for the first time in the Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d v.

Denmark, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 56, Series A no. 23). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article\u00a014 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (D.H.\u00a0and Others v.\u00a0the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a057325/00, \u00a7 175, ECHR 2007; Burden\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, \u00a7 60). Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification, in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a060).",

In that case the Court stated that \u201ca constitutional appeal should, in principle, be considered an effective domestic remedy ... in respect of all applications\u201d (paragraph 51). The present judgment argues that it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one at the relevant time. This position disregards the fact that Vin\u010di\u0107 reversed that burden. Moreover, one cannot prove a negative.

It is not for an international court to offer its interpretation of this law in the absence of domestic interpretation, especially where the  is considering the matter.",

The Court notes, in paragraph 82 of the judgment, that \u201cthe applicants\u2019 per diems had been formally recognised as the respondent State\u2019s outstanding pecuniary obligation as of 1999 (see paragraph 6 above)\u201d, and states that the applicants\u2019 complaints concern rights which are of a \u201csufficiently pecuniary\u201d nature to fall within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2002IV). In Willis, however, the amount and the conditions of applicability of a statutorily defined benefit were not contested, only that the applicant was not entitled to it on discriminatory grounds. The present case is different. A \u201cclaim\u201d can constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 if it is sufficiently established to be enforceable (Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 301B). No court ever established an enforceable claim in respect of the applicants, whose entitlement remains unrecognised; nor do they have a recognised specific claim that is not enforceable only because of the statute of limitations. No court ever recognised a specific claim. The court of first instance recognised the claim only in the sense that it had the legal nature of a damage compensation claim, but it could not rule on the merits (that is, whether the applicants were or were not entitled to a given amount of compensation) because it was barred from doing so by its correct finding that the statute of limitations applied. Therefore the applicants\u2019 claim for damages remains speculative.",

There is a working group tasked with addressing the requests of all reservists, though it is not clear that the group is charged to act ex gratia or in recognition of specific claims. Given the prima facie more favourable handling of the claims of some other reservists, I fully respect and understand the position of my colleagues, but I find that in the circumstances of the case, even in view of the troubling delays, considerations of subsidiarity should have prevailed.",
