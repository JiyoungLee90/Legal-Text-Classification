Mr Artyomov, like the applicant in the present case, complained about the conditions of detention in the remand prison. His detention in that prison ended more than six months before the introduction of his application to the Court. After receiving from the Court a letter explaining the requirement for exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 of the Convention, Mr Artyomov, as well as the applicant in the present case, lodged a civil action seeking damages for the allegedly inadequate conditions of his detention. The civil actions brought by both applicants resulted in judgments of the  rejecting the tort claims as unsubstantiated.\u00a0The question was whether such judgments could be considered a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention.",

The reasons for that operation, as well as the exact instructions given to the officers of the unit, remain unclear. It is certain, however, that the operation did not target any particular convict but rather the entire colony population, or at least a large group of convicts known as habitual offenders against prison rules. It was therefore a sort of \u201cshow of force\u201d by the colony administration to the prison population. Furthermore, everything suggests that the operation must have been planned in advance: it \u201cwas not a random operation which might have given rise to unexpected developments to which the officers of the special-purpose unit might have been called upon to react without prior preparation\u201d (see Artyomov, \u00a7 170).

These are: (1) the reasons for the operation, its scale and the intimidating and \u201cheavy-handed\u201d character of the intervention of the special forces; (2) the fact that physical violence was used against some of the convicts indiscriminately; (3) the fact that the applicant was amongst those convicts who were targeted by the operation, so that there was a high likelihood that he did not escape the beatings, (4)\u00a0the consistency and detailed character of the applicant\u2019s description, (5)\u00a0the authorities\u2019 failure to submit the applicant to an independent medical examination following the events, (6) their failure to produce the materials of the domestic criminal investigation of the applicant\u2019s complaint or the complaints of other inmates, and (7) their failure to produce the applicant\u2019s medical history or other medical documents related to the period in the aftermath of the special operation of 21 January 2002.
