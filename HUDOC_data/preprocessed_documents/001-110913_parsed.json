Furthermore, the arrest was to take place in front of a kindergarten at a time when the applicant and other parents would ordinarily be taking their children home, thus potentially in front of the applicant\u2019s family and other people, including small children. In such circumstances, the Court is not persuaded by the findings of the domestic authorities to the effect that the applicant represented such a serious threat to the arresting officers as to justify such brutal methods on their part. Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s initial reaction to four individuals in plain clothes wanting to arrest him was some form of resistance, the Court remains persuaded that other less harmful methods and techniques were available to a group of four trained police officers.",

Judging by the materials in its possession, the Court is not persuaded that the present case presents such complexity as to have required such a long time to be resolved. The investigation\u2019s long duration was apparently due to the manner in which the criminal proceedings took place, which, in the Court\u2019s opinion, discloses a lack of means by which the courts might exercise effective control over investigating bodies. In the Court\u2019s view, the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Prosecutor\u2019s Office did not feel compelled to fully implement the instructions received from the district court and the court had no other option but to quash the prosecutor\u2019s decisions each and every time.
