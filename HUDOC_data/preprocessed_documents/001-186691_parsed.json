In his opinion, his fragile state of health and considerable business interests in Sint Maarten opposed (a continuation of) his detention. The Procurator General opposed suspension of the applicant\u2019s detention, arguing that there was a high risk of absconding, given that the applicant was a wealthy businessman in whose home two identity cards from Columbia and the Dominican Republic had been found during a search, and that he had use of a private jet in the United States of America.

He further argued that his serious health condition \u2013 considered in the light of the inadequate medical care and hygiene in the detention centres of Sint Maarten, as found by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) in various reports \u2013 and his considerable business interests necessitated suspension of his detention pending extradition.

He further recommended that the applicant be seen by a dentist every three to four months to avoid similar infections. On 3 April 2017 the dentist reported that the infection had subsided but the build-up of plaque was already visible again, and this was probably due to the lack of possibilities for adequate oral hygiene.",

Relying on a CPT report of 25 August 2015 (see paragraph 29 below) and the Court\u2019s considerations in the case of Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia ([GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7\u00a7 138-41, ECHR 2016), the applicant argued that there was at least a strong presumption that the conditions of his detention should be regarded as contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. On this point, he submitted that for three months he had been staying in a cell measuring 16 square metres which he often had to share with five or sometimes even six other persons. Furthermore, the cells were dark and unhygienic and there was a foul smell. He further submitted that the unhygienic circumstances had caused the infection diagnosed by the dentist on 13 March 2017.",

The applicant could be transferred to Cura\u00e7ao, where the conditions of detention were better, but the applicant had opposed such a transfer. If he consented to a transfer, he could find himself a spacious single-occupancy cell in Cura\u00e7ao within a matter of days. The Joint Court further noted that on two previous occasions it had considered and rejected requests filed by the applicant to suspend or terminate his detention, and it found no substantial change of (personal) circumstances warranting a different finding as regards the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty. In this respect the Joint Court took into account that during the hearing on 4 April 2017, on which his request was examined, it was confirmed that the applicant by that time was no longer detained in a multi-occupancy cell, but in a single-occupancy cell, that he daily received vitamins and that, if he wished so, he could see a doctor or dentist. It also took into account that, in reply to an explicit question it had put to him about a possible voluntary transfer to Cura\u00e7ao, the applicant had indicated that this was not an option for him.

The Joint Court noted, amongst other things, that the applicant was a very wealthy man who had travelled extensively in the past and who apparently had close ties with the Dominican Republic, from where extradition would not be possible. It further noted that the applicant had been detained at Philipsburg Police Station since his arrest because, being a wealthy man, he could not be held in the remand centre of Point Blanche Prison for safety reasons, which, in the circumstances, justified his detention at the Philipsburg Police Station. In respect of the duration of his detention at that facility, the Joint Court noted that, although on legal grounds it had prohibited the Sint Maarten Prosecution Department from transferring the applicant \u2013 who had fiercely opposed such a transfer \u2013 to a place of detention in another country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it remained open to the applicant to consent voluntarily to such a transfer.

Further, it appeared that the nurse visiting sentenced prisoners every day could also examine police detainees. However, there was no screening of detained persons and requests to see a doctor were not always followed up promptly.

In several cells, there was leakage from the sanitary annexes, which were not fully partitioned from the rest of the cell. In the larger cells (16 m\u00b2) there were two sets of bunk beds for four persons but it was quite usual for an additional two or three persons to be kept overnight in these cells, sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Many of the mattresses were dirty and worn, or consisted of broken pieces of foam held together by a sheet. Moreover, during the first 10 days of detention (the period considered as police custody) staff confirmed that detained persons were not provided with sheets, a pillow or a towel. A number of persons displayed rashes all over their bodies. There were also no call bells in the cells which meant that detained persons had to shout repeatedly to attract the attention of staff, often resulting in terse exchanges.",

It is for that reason that the Court has repeatedly stressed in its case-law that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15\u00a0November 1996, \u00a7 118, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V). However, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not demand that detention be reasonably considered necessary, for example, to prevent the individual from committing an offence or fleeing. It is therefore immaterial whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 112; Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7 146, ECHR 2003\u2011X; Sadaykov v. Bulgaria, no. 75157/01, \u00a7 21, 22 May 2008; and Raza v. Bulgaria, no. 31465/08, \u00a7 72, 11 February 2010). However, any deprivation of liberty under the second limb of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) will be justified only for as long as deportation or extradition proceedings are in progress. If such proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention will cease to be permissible under that provision. In other words, the length of the detention for this purpose should not exceed what is reasonably required (see, Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 113; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0164, 19 February 2009; Mikolenko v.
