The decision as to which of the two alternatives mentioned in the provision should be chosen, namely the applicant\u2019s right to defend himself in person or to be represented by a lawyer of his own choosing, or in certain circumstances one appointed by the court, depends upon the applicable legislation or rules of court. Notwithstanding, the importance of a relationship of confidence between lawyer and client, the right to choose one\u2019s own counsel cannot be considered to be absolute. It is necessarily subject to certain limitations where free legal aid is concerned and also where it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice require that the accused be defended by counsel appointed by them. When appointing defence counsel the national courts must certainly have regard to the defendant\u2019s wishes. However, they can override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, \u00a7 65-66, 20 January 2005).",
