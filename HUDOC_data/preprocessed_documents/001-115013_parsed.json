The Catholic Church, to which the majority of the Austrian population belongs and which, according to Article\u00a0II of the Concordat (BGBl. II No. 2/1934), has public-law status, has a level of importance in Austria going beyond that of a small association, as is clear from the overall content of the Concordat and the circumstances in which it was ratified. Accordingly, conduct on the part of Church dignitaries which is in flagrant contradiction with Catholic teachings may very well be of public interest, particularly where \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 homosexual contacts take place and are maintained, albeit on a consensual basis, between staff and students in an educational establishment and between students themselves. The Catholic Church strives for acceptance and credibility among the public at large, and the activities of a principal and a deputy principal, particularly those in charge of a training college for future priests, are directly related to public life. The Catholic Church is engaged in public relations work in many spheres and regularly makes its views on (sexual) morality known to the population as a whole, with the result that the general public is also entitled to be informed if individual officials are failing to practise what they preach, condemning homosexuality as a sin in public while practising it in private, even between staff and students. It should also be taken into consideration that the teachings of the Catholic Church on the subject of homosexuality are contrary to the fundamental right to sexual self-determination under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to the prohibition on discrimination; hence, on this basis also, there is a public interest in the publication of specific allegations that Church dignitaries are failing to observe their Church\u2019s teachings on sexual morals. This is even more so where the reports concern homosexual contacts between a teacher and his students. Such relationships of dependency call for particular vigilance in order to avoid potential breaches of a fundamental code of conduct designed to protect the physical and psychological integrity of the students. The media have a vital role in publicly exposing misconduct in a democratic society governed by the rule of law.",

The weighing of interests in the present case should undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that the public right to information prevails. The professional activity of an ordained priest who is active in public life both as a clergyman and as head of a seminary does not take place merely within the Church; the Catholic Church has an important and, in some respects even a State role, and the credibility of its officials, who demand moral standards from the population and compliance with the Church\u2019s rules of community life, occupies an important position in that regard. In particular, the fact that the events involved students who as future officials of the Catholic Church are supposed to be taught these moral precepts by example, lends those events a public-interest dimension extending beyond the Church itself and affects all sections of the population...\u201d",

                                                "content": "The accompanying text portrays the claimant in a negative light. He is neither a \u2018figure of contemporary society \u2018par excellence\u2019\u2019 (to use the terminology of the German case-law) nor a \u2018public figure\u2019 (the term used in Austrian legal practice) whose appearance was already known to the general public before the picture was published (4 Ob 15/93). It is clear that the publication of the picture intensifies the demeaning effect of the accompanying text, which is damaging to the honour of the person concerned (\u2018pillorying effect\u2019). In such cases, therefore, publication of the picture can be justified only if, after the required weighing of interests, the interest of the publisher in publishing is found to prevail (RIS-Justiz RS0077767). However, that is not the case here. The protection of the intimate sphere of the claimant\u2019s private life carries greater weight in this case than the public interest in being informed of the image, in contrast to the case already examined concerning the text of the article. Of course, there is some force to the Court of Appeal\u2019s argument that publication was designed to some extent to \u2018prove the claimant guilty\u2019 after he had denied the accusations as \u2018slander\u2019, and thus to allow the public to make up its own mind on the basis of the photograph. In the Supreme Court\u2019s view, however, this argument is not sufficiently decisive to justify intruding upon the intimate sphere of the claimant\u2019s private life and providing documentary \u2018evidence\u2019 of the allegations denied by the claimant. It must first be taken into consideration that the photograph was taken at a private party and thus indisputably fell within the private sphere protected by Article\u00a08 of the ECHR. If sexual freedom between consenting adults is recognised as an absolute personal right and the innermost private sphere is protected under the Constitution, then this must also apply in principle to members of religious organisations and Church officials, even if the practice of that sexual freedom is contrary to the Church\u2019s teachings. Forfeiture of the right to anonymity requires particularly weighty reasons which do not apply here to the required degree. There is no overriding interest for the public at large to be informed of the claimant\u2019s appearance and to identify him via publication of his photograph. Even when publication takes place in connection with a criminal offence, the principle of proportionality of the interference applies. Likewise, even a genuine need to inform must not go beyond what is strictly necessary, so that it cannot be accepted in all cases in which the public has reason to take an interest in a particular individual that there is a genuine need to be shown a picture of that person (RIS-Justiz RS0077883). The interest in dissemination of a picture can only take precedence if the picture has a particular news value \u2013 for instance, to warn the public about an escaped criminal (4\u00a0Ob 63/95 = SZ68125 4 Ob 1013/96). In any case, the proportionality principle prohibits publication merely in order to satisfy an appetite for scandal. The interest in being informed can be sufficiently met without publication of an image, simply by reporting the facts and referring to the existence of a photograph (several photographs) as evidence.\u201d",

It noted that damages under the Copyright Act were to be awarded only if the general requirements laid down in the Civil Code were met. In particular, it was necessary for the publisher to have acted culpably, with at least minor negligence. In the present case, the applicants had based their decision to publish the photograph on an arguable legal opinion. It was a borderline case in which a detailed weighing of the interests at stake had eventually led to the assessment that the publication of the photograph at issue had violated the claimant\u2019s legitimate interests. In the preliminary injunction proceedings the  and even the Court of Appeal had come to the opposite conclusion, holding the view that the publication of the picture had an information value of its own, while the Supreme Court had overturned their decisions. In these circumstances, the applicants were entitled to believe that the publication of the picture was admissible, and they had therefore not acted culpably.",

With regard to the applicants\u2019 appeal it noted that it had already given detailed reasons in its decision of 15\u00a0December 2005 explaining why, as far as the publication of the photograph was concerned, the claimant\u2019s interests in the protection of his private sphere under Article 8 of the Convention outweighed the freedom to impart information protected by Article 10 in the circumstances of the present case.

It held that a decision taken under sections 6 and 7 of the Media Act did not resolve a preliminary question (Vorfrage) in relation to the claim under section 78 of the Copyright Act. There was no logical contradiction in prohibiting a newspaper publisher from publishing a picture under section 78 of the Copyright Act, while on the same facts dismissing a compensation claim under sections 6 and 7 of the Media Act. The finding that the requirements for granting compensation were not met did not provide a basis for concluding that the publication of a picture did not violate legitimate interests within the meaning of section 78 of the Copyright Act.",

Accordingly, whilst a private individual unknown to the public may claim particular protection of his or her right to private life, the same is not true of public figures. A fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting facts capable of contributing to a debate in a democratic society, relating to politicians in the exercise of their official functions for example, and reporting details of the private life of an individual who does not exercise such functions (see Von\u00a0Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 110 with further references).",

Moreover, as regards the distinction between the report on the one hand and the picture on the other hand, the Court\u2019s own case-law acknowledges that the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance in the context of the publication of photographs which may contain very personal or even intimate information (see paragraph 66 above). There can therefore be no objection to distinguishing between the publication of a text and the publication of a photograph. In the case of MGN Limited (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0148-156), for instance, the Court found no violation of Article 10 in respect of decisions by the domestic courts which had found that the publication of a report dealing with the drug addiction of a famous model was justified, but had considered that the publication of additional information about the details of her treatment and the publication of her picture amounted to a breach of confidence.",

The Supreme Court also dealt with the applicants\u2019 argument that the publication of the photograph had been necessary in order to provide proof of the allegations raised, namely of homosexual relationships between seminarians and their superiors, which had been denied by Mr K\u00fcchl. While accepting that there was some force to this argument, the Supreme Court noted the intimate nature of the information conveyed by the photograph. It added that sexual relationships between adults fell within the sphere protected by Article\u00a08. This protection applied also to representatives of the Church, even if their conduct was in contradiction with the Church\u2019s position.
