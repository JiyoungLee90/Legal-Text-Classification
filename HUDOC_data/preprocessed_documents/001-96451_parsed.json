On that premise, the trial court considered it appropriate to hold the applicant responsible for all the activities carried out by TKEP/L.

The Court further notes that the statement taken from one of the arresting police officers also supports this version of the events.

Furthermore, unlike two of his co-accused, the applicant did not mention to the doctor that he had pain in his testicles (see paragraph 29 above).

As a rule these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him either when he is making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v.\u00a0Italy, 19\u00a0February 1991, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 194-A, and Luc\u00e0 v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a033354/96, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, ECHR 2001II). The corollary of that is that where a conviction is based solely, or to a decisive degree, on depositions that have been made by a person who the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see, among other authorities, Sadak and Others v.
