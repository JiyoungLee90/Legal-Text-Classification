The Court further observes that she attempted to lodge a criminal complaint against the policeman who, as she alleged, had kicked her on the ankle; however, apart from a copy of her complaint she provided the Court with no further material in support of her version of events, not even a witness statement by any persons who might have been with her at the time. It should be noted that the alleged assault on the ninth applicant was a separate event from the arrest of the other applicants and took place at a different location. Therefore it cannot be said that her allegations are corroborated by the account of events given by the other applicants. As the file stands, the Court cannot even establish that the police did in fact disperse the authorised meeting at the Griboyedov monument. Moreover, the applicant did not attempt to lodge a civil-law complaint specifically alleging a violation of her right to peaceful assembly on that occasion, thus failing to exhaust domestic remedies for the purposes of Article 11 of the Convention or to substantiate her allegations.",

The Court takes cognisance of the applicants\u2019 request to examine these as two separate issues because of the particular circumstances of the case. It observes that the administrative charges brought in this case referred, inter alia, to the applicants\u2019 having chanted anti-government slogans during an unauthorised demonstration. This complaint, falling in principle under Article 10, is similar in scope to those examined in Galstyan (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96 and \u00a7\u00a0100), where the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a political demonstration, and Sergey Kuznetsov v.

For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland, no.\u00a01543/06, \u00a7 66-68, 3\u00a0May 2007). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 5962, ECHR 2003III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. An interference will be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for a legitimate aim if it answers a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d (see, for example, Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. , \u00a7 104, 18 January 2001 and S. and Marper v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], nos.  and , \u00a7 101, ECHR 2008). It is, in any event, for the Court to give a final ruling on the restriction\u2019s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others, cited above).",

The three applicants claimed that they had been walking to the authorised public event at the Griboyedov monument, and there had therefore been no grounds for their arrest, whereas the Government claimed that they had had to be arrested because they had been conducting a demonstration in breach of the regulations and because they were threatening to break through the security perimeter of Red Square. The Court has already found that the domestic courts made no attempt to establish the precise circumstances of the applicants\u2019 arrest, such as the time and the place, in order to verify whether it had been necessary to stop them (see paragraphs 60-62 and 66 above). In the absence of sufficient factual material to resolve this controversy the Court is unable to accept either party\u2019s version of events as a basis for deciding whether the authorities acted lawfully. In any event, it considers that in this case the issue of compliance with the law is indissociable from the question whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. It will therefore examine this issue below (see Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 28793/02, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2006II).",

France, no. 51346/99, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2002III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., \u00a7\u00a042; see also Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. , \u00a7 34, ECHR 2007III; F\u00e1ber v.\u00a0Hungary, no. , \u00a7 49, 24 July 2012, and Berladir and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 34202/06, \u00a7 38, 10 July 2012).",

However, the police reports did not mention any such risk and, in any event, it did not form part of the reasoning given by the Justice of the Peace or the Tverskoy District Court. Moreover, the Court notes that the place of arrest set out in the judgments, , is about 1.4 km away from the nearest approach to Red Square. Given the modest size of the group (estimated by the police as fifty to sixty persons) and the undeniably peaceful character of the march, the Court is not persuaded that the threat of the marchers penetrating the security area was imminent.",

Clear instructions had been given to the police officers who took part in the riot control operation specifically planned for the event. Moreover, the documents submitted by the Government reveal that reinforcements from the riot police had been brought in for the day from twenty-nine regions of Russia precisely because of the expected demonstration (see paragraph 11 above).
