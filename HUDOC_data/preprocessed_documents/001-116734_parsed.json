The General Conditions for Real Estate Transactions by Trustees applied to that agreement. The bank had transferred the money to the applicant\u2019s account on 5 September 1995. Only two days later the applicant had transferred the entire amount to a savings account. In breach of the trusteeship agreement including the above-mentioned General Conditions, the applicant had transferred part of the sum to his client without obtaining a loan guarantee, and had invested the remainder abroad in the hope of achieving considerable profits. He had told the bank, which had set 31 December\u00a01995 as the deadline for submitting the guarantee, that he would be able to obtain it by 15 February 1996. Although the bank had repeatedly requested the fulfilment of the trusteeship agreement or the reimbursement of the loan, and the applicant knew by then that his investments had been unsuccessful and that he no longer disposed of the entire amount, he continued to use the remaining money, for instance to pay his own fees of ATS\u00a0840,000 (approximately EUR 61,000).",

Moreover, the Disciplinary Council referred to the Appeals Board\u2019s established case-law, in accordance with which the disciplinary authorities were bound by the establishment of facts contained in a judgment of a criminal court convicting a lawyer alleged to have committed a disciplinary offence. It noted that disposing of such a large amount of money in breach of the trusteeship agreement amounted to serious professional misconduct and a severe infringement of the profession\u2019s honour and reputation within the meaning of section 1 (1) of the Disciplinary Act. Given the circumstances of the case, which had also become publicly known and had caused serious damage to the legal profession, it was not sufficient to impose a ban on practising of up to one year but it was necessary to order that the applicant be struck off the register. It would be unacceptable that the applicant, who was at that time serving his prison sentence, could resume practising immediately after his release. Moreover, no client would entrust his affairs to a lawyer who had diverted such a large amount of money in breach of his duties as a trustee.",

The Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law relied on the explanatory report to Protocol No. 7, according to which Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 did not protect a person against conviction for the same act in criminal proceedings and in a different set of proceedings, such as disciplinary proceedings against a civil servant. It thus appeared that disciplinary proceedings did not qualify as criminal proceedings. Moreover, the Disciplinary Council had not merely relied on the matters which constituted the criminal offence, but had had particular regard to the ensuing damage to the profession\u2019s honour and reputation. The commission of a serious criminal offence which had a direct link with the exercise of a lawyer\u2019s professional activity served to undermine the trustworthiness of the profession as a whole.

Secondly, the Government noted that unlike criminal law, which applied generally, disciplinary law applied to members of specific professional groups, such as lawyers, notaries, doctors, judges or other civil servants, and was aimed at maintaining the confidence of the public in certain professions which were of importance for the functioning of public life. The Appeals Board\u2019s considerations when setting the sanction in the present case emphasised the specific character of disciplinary law, in that it focused on the damage which the applicant\u2019s conduct had caused to the general public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. Thirdly, turning to the nature and severity of the penalties at stake, the Government noted that although the sanction imposed had a decisive impact on the applicant it was not primarily deterrent in nature, but was aimed at restoring the confidence of the general public.

The Court\u2019s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the \u201cEngel criteria\u201d (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8\u00a0June 1976, \u00a7 82, Series\u00a0A no. 22), to be considered in determining whether or not there was a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, in particular, Jussila\u00a0v. Finland [GC], no.\u00a073053/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030-31, ECHR 2006XIII, and Ezeh\u00a0and Connors v. the  [GC], nos.\u00a039665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2003X).",

Although the facts which gave rise to the disciplinary proceedings also constituted a criminal offence, the offences brought against the applicant in the disciplinary proceedings related solely to professional misconduct. The fact that an act which can lead to a disciplinary sanction also constitutes a criminal offence is not sufficient to consider a person responsible under disciplinary law as being \u201ccharged\u201d with a crime (see Moullet v. France (dec.), no. 27521/04, 13\u00a0September 2007, concerning disciplinary proceedings against a civil servant; see also Vagenas\u00a0v. Greece (dec.), no. 53372/07, 23 August 2011).",

At the same time that provision aims at protecting the profession\u2019s honour and reputation and at maintaining the trust the public places in the legal profession. As the Government pointed out, this is underlined by the sanction rules contained in the Disciplinary Act. Section 16 (6) of the Disciplinary Act required the disciplinary authorities to have particular regard not only to the degree of culpability but to the damage resulting from the commission of the offence, in particular to members of the public. Having regard to all these elements the Court finds that the offence under section 1(1) of the Disciplinary Act is not criminal but disciplinary in nature (see, mutatis mutandis, Brown, cited above).",

With the exception of the fine, these sanctions are typical disciplinary sanctions (see, mutatis mutandis, Moullet, cited above). As regards the fine, the Court notes that in contrast to fines in criminal proceedings fines under the Disciplinary Act do not attract a prison term in the event of default, as the disciplinary authorities have no power to impose deprivation of liberty. Although the size of the potential fine is such that it must be regarded as having a punitive effect, the severity of this sanction in itself does not bring the charges into the criminal sphere (see Brown, cited above).",

The sanction eventually imposed on him was being struck off the register. Although this is a severe sanction it affects first and foremost a lawyer\u2019s civil right to continue exercising his or her profession (see paragraphs 39-40 above). As the Appeals Board pointed out, its aim is to restore the confidence of the public by showing that in cases of serious professional misconduct the Bar Association will prohibit the lawyer concerned from practising (see paragraph 29 above). Finally, the Court notes that being struck off the register does not necessarily have permanent effect. Pursuant to section 18 of the Disciplinary Act, a lawyer who has been struck off the register may apply to be re-registered after three years. In sum, the nature and severity of the sanctions the applicant risked incurring and the sanction actually imposed were not such as to render the charges \u201ccriminal\u201d in nature.
