Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8 February 2005), it is satisfied that the domestic courts verified the domestic law correctly when considering whether the charges against the applicant were such that remand in custody could be ordered.",

In the course of the subsequent investigation, other instances of the applicant\u2019s repeated attempts to pervert the course of the investigation by putting pressure on witnesses and other co-defendants and destroying or hiding the evidence were established. In such circumstances the Court accepts the argument that the authorities\u2019 fear that as the applicant was a high-ranking police officer at the time, he might have used his connections to evade criminal liability was justified and persisted throughout the course of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.
