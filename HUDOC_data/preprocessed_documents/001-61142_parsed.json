The Court of Appeal had regard to various passages of the expert opinion. Thus, it noted that the expert had considered gender reassignment surgery as one possible medical treatment; however, the question of necessity could not be clearly affirmed given the diverging scientific opinions and results. In his view, consensus existed on the improved psycho-social situation following the change of the sexual role, although the effect of the operation as such was often overrated. In the applicant\u2019s case, the advantages of an operation would, in the expert\u2019s view, prevail, while psychotherapy could not cure the transsexuality on account of the applicant\u2019s chronic narcissistic character structure; even extended psychotherapy was not likely to result in any changes. Turning to the expert\u2019s statement that gender reassignment was not the only possible curative treatment, but recommendable from a psychiatric-psychotherapheutic point of view in order to improve the applicant\u2019s social situation, the Court of Appeal found that, with this cautious formulation, the expert had not clearly affirmed the necessity of an operation. The applicant had therefore failed to prove that the conditions for reimbursement of medical treatment were met in her case. The Court of Appeal added that, while the expert had mentioned that the gender reassignment operation \u201cformed part of the curative treatment of a mental disease\u201d, taking his other statements into account, he had regarded success as rather uncertain. Such a vague hope could not justify the necessity of medical treatment, bearing the aim of health insurance in mind. Thus, the health insurance had to bear only costs of treatment suitable to cure a disease. In the applicant\u2019s case, the expert had explained that gender reassignment measures could not be expected to cure the applicant\u2019s transsexuality, but at best to improve her psycho-social situation. This result was insufficient, as such an improvement did not affect the applicant\u2019s transsexuality as such. With regard to these remaining doubts, the Court of Appeal concluded that the applicant had failed to prove the necessity of her treatment.",

The term \u2018transsexual\u2019 is usually applied to those who, whilst belonging physically to one sex, feel convinced that they belong to the other; they often seek to achieve a more integrated, unambiguous identity by undergoing medical treatment and surgical operations to adapt their physical characteristics to their psychological nature.

Bellinger was found to indicate a growing acceptance of findings of sexual differences in the brain that are determined pre-natally, although scientific proof for the theory was far from complete. The Court considers it more significant however that transsexualism has wide international recognition as a medical condition for which treatment is provided in order to afford relief (for example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) replaced the diagnosis of transsexualism with \u2018gender identity disorder\u2019; see also The International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10)). The United Kingdom National Health Service, in common with the vast majority of Contracting States, acknowledges the existence of the condition and provides or permits treatment, including irreversible surgery. The medical and surgical acts which in this case rendered the gender reassignment possible were indeed carried out under the supervision of the national health authorities. Nor, given the numerous and painful interventions involved in such surgery and the level of commitment and conviction required to achieve a change in social gender role, can it be suggested that there is anything arbitrary or capricious in the decision taken by a person to undergo gender reassignment. In those circumstances, the ongoing scientific and medical debate as to the exact causes of the condition is of diminished relevance.",

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, \u00a7 22). It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s physical and social identity (see Mikuli\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I). Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, for example, B. v. France, cited above, pp. 53-54, \u00a7 63; Burghartz v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 28, \u00a7\u00a024; Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series\u00a0A no. 45, pp. 18-19, \u00a7 41; Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 19 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 131, \u00a7\u00a036; and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999-VI). Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, \u00a7 47, and Friedl v. Austria, judgment of 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 20, \u00a7 45). Likewise, the Court has held that although no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in Article 8, the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002-III). Moreover, the very essence of the Convention being respect for human dignity and human freedom, protection is given to the right of transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security (see I. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 70, and Christine Goodwin, \u00a7 90, both cited above).",

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, p. 11, \u00a7 23; Botta v.

The same is true with the rights of the Convention. Under the Convention, Contracting States have to ensure (Article 1) that individuals can enjoy their private life and one of the requirements, as the Court stressed in Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 28957/95, ECHR 2002-VI), is respect for gender identity. The terms of the contract between the applicant and her private insurers must be interpreted in the light of these requirements of Article 8. The term \u201cnecessary\u201d in relation to gender reassignment surgery must therefore be interpreted with a view not only to respecting the difficult situation of potential transsexuals but also to taking into account the findings of science which were set out in the recent judgment in Christine Goodwin. According to those findings, the situation is one which is dominated by the brain and is characterised by both objective and subjective elements. In the light of these requirements, did the German courts approach the question with due regard to Article 8? Despite the fact that the doctor who had seen the applicant concluded, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages in the applicant\u2019s case, that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages and that an operation was therefore to be recommended, the German courts held that that was not a clear affirmation of the necessity of the operation. The Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning would be quite acceptable and, as is said in the dissenting opinion, reasonable if it did not fall to be judged from the standpoint of whether the requirements of Article 8 \u2013 respect for the specific private-life circumstances of the applicant\u00a0\u2013 had been observed.",

In cases where the question arises whether a gender reassignment operation is necessary and the doctor who examined the person concerned came to the conclusion, as in the instant case, that the applicant was a transsexual and that transsexuality constituted a disease and accordingly, after weighing up the drawbacks and advantages, recommended the operation, the decision of the applicant should always be the final and decisive factor to indicate that the operation was necessary. I think that this type of case, following the reasoning in Christine Goodwin, can be clearly distinguished from other medical cases. Where a transsexual, after lengthy treatment, has been told by his or her doctor that in that doctor\u2019s view, the advantages of an operation outweigh the disadvantages, it cannot be said that the transsexual caused the \u201cdisease\u201d deliberately. This does not mean that in the case of every transsexual surgery should be assumed to be necessary, but if a transsexual has, over quite a long period, undergone treatments of a different kind, such as psychotherapy (see paragraph 16 of the judgment), the individual has done everything necessary to come finally to the conclusion, which has to be respected, that only a gender reassignment operation would be helpful and thus necessary in his or her case. The applicant had already had recourse to less drastic means, such as hormonal treatments. To prolong her situation, which had already lasted quite a time (see paragraphs 11 and 26 of the judgment), would, in my view, have amounted to treatment not in keeping with \u201crespect\u201d for private life under Article 8. It is a most intimate and private aspect of a person\u2019s life whether to undergo a gender reassignment operation, and therefore the courts, in considering the necessity of an operation should take into account, as one of the decisive factors, the wishes of the transsexual. I cannot see any arbitrary element in the applicant\u2019s decision finally, after quite lengthy treatment, to undergo the reassignment operation, when even her doctor had recommended it.",

We cannot, however, agree as outlined in the second sentence of paragraph 56 of the judgment that this means that there is anything disproportionate about requiring a person such as the applicant to prove the medical necessity of treatment, including irreversible surgery. This case involves an action by the applicant to force her private insurers on foot of her contract with them to reimburse her 50% of the cost of such treatment. One of the terms of that contract as outlined above was that such treatment must be medically necessary. The insurance company took the view that it was not. Not unnaturally, the applicant took the view that it was. The issue therefore was the very question of necessity. Nothing in our view in Christine Goodwin prohibits or should prohibit a party to such a contract of insurance from litigating any term of that contract including the term requiring the medical necessity of the relevant treatment. To find otherwise, we fear, means that the medical necessity of surgery would have to be assumed in every case involving a transsexual. This in our view cannot be correct. Indeed, the likely consequence would be the exclusion of such cover from medical insurance policies to the great disadvantage of transsexuals in general.",
