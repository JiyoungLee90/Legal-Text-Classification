Latvia [GC], no. 44898/10, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2016). As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where no effective remedy is available to an applicant, the time-limit generally expires six months after the date of the acts or measures about which he or she complains (ibidem, \u00a7\u00a075). In cases of a continuing situation, the period starts to run afresh each day and it is in general only when that situation ends that the sixmonth period actually starts to run (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7 159, ECHR 2009; Sabri G\u00fcne\u015f v. Turkey [GC], no. 27396/06, \u00a7 54, 29 June 2012; and Mocanu and Others v.

The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until at least July 2010, the \u201cMRT\u201d was only able to continue to exist, and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region, because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-20; Catan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0121-22; and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110).

The events complained of in all the present applications (except for application no. 28972/13) started before July 2010 and ended at various times thereafter (see annexed table). The events concerned in application no. 28972/13 took place in 2013.

In the present case, the applicants submitted that the Republic of Moldova had not discharged its positive obligations since various State authorities replied that they could not take action on the territory under the de facto control of the \u201cMRT\u201d. Moreover, unlike in Mozer, they failed to address international organisations and embassies in order to ask for assistance regarding each individual applicant.

In this connection, it notes that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of movement on the territory of the Republic of Moldova had not been carried out in accordance with Moldovan law. Therefore, bearing in mind its case-law to the effect that no \u201cMRT\u201d authority could order anyone\u2019s lawful arrest (see Mozer, cuted above, \u00a7 150), it concludes that no \u201cMRT\u201d authority could lawfully order the restriction of the freedom of movement of individuals either.",
