Accordingly, the applicants are still entitled to recover the principal amounts of the judgment debts in the domestic proceedings. The Court recalls that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violations found (cf. Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 24\u00a0February 2005). It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the awards made by the domestic courts under the judgments of 28 March 2001 and 20 November 2002 in the applicants' favour.",
