A judge examining the lawfulness of prosecuting authorities\u2019 actions or decisions can quash them if he or she finds them to be unlawful (Article 451). The decision of a judge on the lawfulness of prosecuting authorities\u2019 actions or decisions can be disputed before an appellate court in accordance with the procedure established in Articles 452-453 of the CCrP. A chamber of an appellate court, composed of three judges, examines this kind of appeal within three days of it being received, in a hearing held in camera (Articles\u00a0453.1 and 453.2). A person who has lodged a complaint has a right to participate in the relevant hearing, but if parties who have been notified of the time and place of the hearing fail to attend it, then this does not prevent the court from examining the case (Article 453.3). The decision of the appellate court shall be sent to the parties within three days of being delivered, and cannot be appealed against (Articles 453.8 and 453.10).",

The analysis that the Court expects to find in domestic decisions must go beyond reference to the dispatch of judicial summonses, and must make the most of the available evidence in order to ascertain whether an absent litigant was in fact informed of an upcoming hearing sufficiently in advance (see A\u017edaji\u0107 v. Slovenia, no. 71872/12, \u00a7 70, 8 October 2015). The answer to this question shall enable the courts to determine whether a hearing must be adjourned pending due notification (see Zemlyachenko v. Russia, no. 23866/06, \u00a7 22, 22 January 2013, and Kokurkhayev v. Russia, no. 46356/09, \u00a7 31, 13 December 2011). The courts cannot conclude that an absent litigant waived the right to attend in person without ascertaining whether he or she was made aware of the very existence of that right, and therefore of the hearing in question (see Dilipak and Karakaya v. Turkey, nos. 7942/05 and 24838/05, \u00a7 87, 4 March 2014). Lastly, the Court reiterates that whenever the domestic courts examine the issue of an absent litigant being notified in a timely manner, they are expected to attach special importance and give full effect to his or her right to present his or her case effectively before the court without there being a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent (see Gankin and\u00a0Others v. Russia, nos. 2430/06 and 3 others, \u00a7 38, 31 May 2016).",
