His detention was based on the suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence \u2013 namely, aiding A.A., an alleged member of a criminal group \u2013 although no formal charges had been laid against him. During his detention he was questioned on the ROVD premises, presumably about his suspected association with A.A. It does not appear that formal records were drawn up in respect of his detention or questioning. Although some ROVD officers alleged that he had been released, either on the same day or after three days (see paragraphs 29 and 32 above), he has never been seen again and his family have had no news of him. The investigation did not establish the exact circumstances, or even the timing, of his alleged release. There is no plausible explanation as to what happened to him after his detention.",

While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings opened by the district investigative committee have been plagued by a combination of the serious defects it has already enumerated in many previous judgments concerning disappearances in the region (see, for example, Magomadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0105-09; Shakhgiriyeva and Others v. , no. 27251/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0168-173, 8\u00a0January 2009; and Sasita Israilova and Others v. , no. 35079/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0113-117, 28 October 2010). Most notably, the investigation was instituted with a delay of over four years; it has been repeatedly adjourned and reopened, thus protracting the taking of the most essential procedural steps and increasing the risk of irreversibly losing valuable evidence and witnesses\u2019 memories fading; by 2010 it had failed to establish the basic facts concerning the detention and disappearance or to collect evidence relevant to Yeraly Israilov\u2019s detention, for example, through obtaining the records of his questioning at the premises of the ROVD or identifying the persons who had questioned him. No one has been identified as a suspect or charged with his unlawful detention or disappearance.",

The authorities\u2019 behaviour in the face of the applicant\u2019s wellsubstantiated complaints gives rise to a strong presumption of at least acquiescence in the situation and raises strong doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation. The Court notes with particular dismay the decisions taken in 2005 by the law-enforcement authorities and courts in Dagestan, where the applicant had turned for assistance after her husband\u2019s disappearance, stating that she should pursue the matter on her own with the authorities in Gudermes, despite clear indications of the commission of a serious crime (see paragraphs 22-24 above).",

It is not in dispute between the parties that in the present case the applicant and her two sons had been summoned to the Gudermes Department of the Investigative Committee on a number of occasions between 2009 and 2010, where they were questioned and asked to participate in investigative measures such as site examinations and confrontations with other witnesses. As noted above, the questions posed to the applicant and her sons, as witnesses and victims of the crime under investigation, focused entirely on the events of October 2004.",

The Court does not discern anything in the present case which could attest to the authorities\u2019 bad faith in carrying out these steps, nor does it find that these measures were calculated to pressure the applicant to withdraw or modify her complaint or otherwise interfere with the effective exercise of her right of individual petition (see Konstantin Markin v.  [GC], no. 30078/06, \u00a7 163, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). It might be understandable that the applicant perceived direct contact with the law-enforcement bodies as threatening, in view of her experience and the overall security situation in the region, but such approach leaves the State authorities without appropriate recourse if they wish to investigate the complaints and to provide relief (see Bitiyeva and X v. Russia, nos.\u00a057953/00 and 37392/03, \u00a7 166, 21 June 2007).",
