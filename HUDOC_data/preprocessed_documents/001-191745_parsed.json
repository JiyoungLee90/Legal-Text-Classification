He did not complain that he had been detained in overcrowded conditions, but rather concentrated on the issue of sanitary conditions in the cells. As regards his detention in prison no. 61, while challenging the objectivity of the information provided by the prison governor, the applicant did not deny the fact that he had been detained in the cells referred to in the certificate provided by the Government. However, he submitted that the possibility had not been excluded that apart from those cells there had been other premises in the prison hospital measuring 3.75\u00a0sq.\u00a0m in which he could have been held with three other prisoners. He did not indicate the period during which such detention might have taken place.

The relevant legislation did not draw any further distinctions between the different categories of persons with whom detainees could correspond (such as, for example, lawenforcement and other domestic authorities, Convention and other international bodies, relatives, and legal counsel). It did not elaborate on the manner in which the screening measures would be exercised. In particular, it did not provide for any participation by or involvement of prisoners at any stage of the monitoring process. Nor did it specify whether a detainee was entitled to be informed of any alterations to the contents of his or her outgoing correspondence. Moreover, monitoring was automatic and without any time-limits and did not require any reasoned decision giving grounds for the screening measures and/or setting a timeframe for it. Lastly, there was no specific remedy enabling the detainee to contest the measure and obtain adequate redress. In the light of those characteristics of the applicable domestic legal regime the Court concluded that the applicable domestic law had not offered an appropriate degree of protection against arbitrary interference with a prisoner\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence and that interference with rights under Article 8 of the applicant in that case on account of that monitoring had not been \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 54).",
