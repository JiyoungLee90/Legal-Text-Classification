The regime under which the applicants had rented their property could not be considered proportionate as the applicants received an extremely low amount of rent, i.e. EUR\u00a0372.20 annually (which will not change until 2021) while according to the court appointed architect in 2006 the market value was around EUR\u00a04,692 annually, in 2011 it was EUR 4,947 annually and in 2015 EUR\u00a05,100 annually.

While it was true that there was a possibility of requisition, they had not shown that there was a probability of this occurring. It noted that the applicants were aware of the law at the time when they decided to rent the property and yet they had not demanded a higher rent or any other more favourable conditions which could have prevented a disproportionate result.

The violation only occurred on the termination of the concession at which point the rent received was no longer fair in view of the circumstances and social realities of 2006 and after, which could not have been envisaged by the applicants in 1985. They referred to the difference in the rent received and that payable on the market as established by the courtappointed expert (see paragraph 9 above) and noted that the blanket provision had not taken into account the interests of owners. Relying on domestic and ECtHR case-law they considered that there had been a violation of the invoked provision.",

The Constitutional Court did not find a violation of the applicants\u2019 property rights given that the applicants\u2019 ancestor was aware of the applicable regime when he rented the property in 1985. However, the Court notes that it has already held, in similar circumstances, that, at the time, the owners (ancestors of the applicants) could not reasonably have had a clear idea of the extent of inflation in property prices in the decades to come, and that the decisions of the domestic courts regarding their request challenging such laws constituted interference in the applicants\u2019 (heirs) respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Zammit and Attard\u00a0Cassar v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a01046/12, \u00a7\u00a7 50-51, 30 July 2015).

As to the amount of the rent, the Court notes that the court-appointed expert\u2019s valuation in the present case shows that after 2006 the applicants were receiving, in rent, less than 10% of the rental market value. That is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the rent received by the applicants was disproportionately low in the period between 2006 until June 2019 when the tenants vacated the property following negotiations with the applicants. The Court reiterates that State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of chargeable rent. Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit (ibid., \u00a7 62).",

However, the Government considered that such estimates had not taken account of various factors such as the probability of the property having been rented out throughout, the expenses incurred by the tenants, and that measures intended to achieve greater social justice did not require payment at market values. Thus, they considered that a joint award in pecuniary damage should not exceed EUR\u00a010,000 and EUR\u00a01,500 in non-pecuniary damage, particularly given that the tenants had now vacated the property.",
