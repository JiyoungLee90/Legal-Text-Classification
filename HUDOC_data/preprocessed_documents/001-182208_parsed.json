The Court notes that the domestic courts did not rely on any medical or other expert evidence showing that I.\u2019s health prevented him from attending a nursery school. It is therefore not persuaded that the domestic courts convincingly demonstrated that I.\u2019s attendance at a nursery school could have \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences for him.
