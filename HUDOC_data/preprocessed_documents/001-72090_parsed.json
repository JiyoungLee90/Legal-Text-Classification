The same considerations applied to the two other statements in the letter calling Mr\u00a0Paarhammer a \u201crebel\u201d and a \u201ccritic of the church who should be removed\u201d. It noted in particular that Mr\u00a0Paarhammer had criticised the Holy See for its refusal to receive the Cathedral Chapter in audience in the radio interview of 10\u00a0January 1989. Thus, this criticism related to concrete behaviour and was not questioning the authority of the highest church officials as such. As regards Mr Paarhammer\u2019s statements concerning the succession of the  archbishop, the court found that criticising the Pope for his decisions on personnel-policy matters was lawful also under the Canon Law, as the doctrine of papal infallibility only applied to matters of belief and morals. Furthermore, the applicant company could not rely on any of the exemptions from liability under Section\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02\u00a0lit.\u00a02\u00a0(a), (b) or lit.\u00a04 of the Media Act, as the allegations were neither true, nor was their publication in preponderant public interest eight years after the election of the  archbishop in 1989. The applicant company had also failed to comply with the ethics of journalism, as it had not given Mr Paarhammer an opportunity to comment. Finally, the letter at issue did not constitute a correct statement of a third person (Section 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02\u00a0lit. 4 of the Media Act), since the signed \u201cInitiative\u201d was non-existent as a legal person and not represented by any natural person.",

The court considered that the applicant company could not claim to have uttered permissible criticism under Article 10\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, since the imputation of dishonourable behaviour without reference to facts was not justified criticism. Therefore, it fell outside the scope of protection of Article 10 of the Convention. The court found that the applicant company had failed to produce factual evidence that would have supported the incriminated statements. In particular, Mr Paarhammer\u2019s critical remarks during the election process of 1988/89 could not be described as \u201cpublicly criticising or disparaging the Pope in an extremely offensive manner\u201d. Considering the high positions he held as Vicar General, entitling him to represent the archbishop, and also as Judicial Vicar (Judizialvikar), any such behaviour as alleged in the incriminated passages would not only be incompatible with the requirement of orthodoxy under the Codex Iuris Canonici 1983, but also with the profile of a high-ranking church official as expected by the clergy and the interested catholic public. Were any of these allegations true, Mr\u00a0Paarhammer would not only risk being recalled from his position as Vicar General but also losing his missio canonica at the university. The allegation of a \u201crebel within the Cathedral Chapter\u201d meant in its context that Mr\u00a0Paarhammer rebelled against the church order \u2013 which he ought to represent himself as well \u2013 and was therefore capable to lower him in public esteem. All the more so, as the recipients of \u201cDer 13.\u201d belonged traditionally to the conservative wing of the Catholic Church in . The court confirmed the lower court\u2019s finding as regards the applicant company\u2019s failure to comply with the ethics of journalism. Finally, as the applicant company had in no way distanced itself from, but rather identified itself with its contents by adding the title and by framing the text, it could be left open whether the publication had been in the preponderant public interest within the meaning of Section\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 lit.\u00a02\u00a0(b) and lit.\u00a04 of the Media Act.",

The Government, referring to the case of Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria (judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313), argued that the margin of appreciation accorded to Contracting States was a wide one and that church-related matters were not part of a general political debate.

It further notes that there existed a factual basis for these statements as the evidence obtained by the Austrian courts proved that Mr Paarhammer had previously publicly uttered criticism against the Holy See. Admittedly, the terms used in the letter to the editor at issue may appear somewhat far fetched. However, the Court recalls its constant case-law according to which freedom of the press covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26\u00a0April\u00a01995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, \u00a7 38). Thus, in the view of the facts of the case, the impugned comment has to be regarded as permissible value judgment.",
