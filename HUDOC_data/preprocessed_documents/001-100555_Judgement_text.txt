The case originated in six applications (nos. 29572/08, 55180/08, 55427/08, 56294/08, 60443/08 and 61438/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eleven Turkish nationals (“the applicants”), whose names appear in the appendix.

On 18 June, 15 and 22 October, 10 November, 1 and 3 December 2008 the applicants' representative requested that the respondent Government be notified of the introduction of the applications in accordance with Rule 40 of the Rules of Court and that the cases be given priority under Rule 41.
On 17 March 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give priority to the applications under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court and to give notice of the applications to the Government.

The impugned publications were mainly deemed to be propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL, and to constitute the approval of crimes committed by that organisation and its members.
Neither the applicants nor their representative participated in these ex parte procedures, and their written objections to the suspension orders were dismissed. Consequently, the orders were executed.
The applicant Ali Turgay, the owner of Yedinci Gün, was prosecuted under sections 6(2) and 7(2) of Law no. 3713, as well as Articles 215, 218, 220 §§ 6 and 7 and 318 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code, mainly for disseminating propaganda in favour of the aforementioned organisation and praising crimes committed by that organisation and its members, on account of various articles published in the said newspaper.
