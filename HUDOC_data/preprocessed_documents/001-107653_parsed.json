At the hearing the court heard submissions from the lawyer, M.D., and a public prosecutor. M.D. supported the applicant\u2019s appeal and alleged that the decision of the first-instance court had been unlawful. The prosecutor considered that the decision had been adopted lawfully and was justified by the applicant\u2019s persistent refusal to respond to any summonses sent to her or to sign the statement of charges brought against her. He furthermore informed the court that the applicant\u2019s assessment would be completed within one week of the date of the hearing in the appeal court. The appeal court considered that the first-instance court had adopted its decision in full conformity with the requirements of section\u00a0191 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see below, paragraph 26), under which the presence of the suspected or accused person at the court hearing concerning that person\u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital was not mandatory. The court considered that the actual implementation of the decision of the Saldus District Court had not been sufficiently considerate, since the applicant had been forced to leave her household and domestic animals without any supervision. Nevertheless, the court took into account that the Saldus District Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office had taken certain steps to ensure that the applicant\u2019s property would be looked after during her stay at the psychiatric hospital, and it therefore considered that it was not \u201cexpedient\u201d to terminate the assessment of the applicant\u2019s psychiatric health.",

No further appeal was possible in that regard. Unlike with regard to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, the domestic law did not provide any prima facie effective avenues for claiming compensation for damage done by the alleged impossibility of challenging in a court the lawfulness of a decision ordering placement in a psychiatric hospital. Therefore the Court agrees with the Government that the running of the six-month period for the applicant\u2019s complaint about the review of the lawfulness of the deprivation of her liberty started on 24 May 2002, which was more than six months before the date on which the application was submitted to the Court.

According to the Government, the considerations to be taken into account in that regard included the essence of the obligation prescribed by law which was to be fulfilled, the information about the person being detained, the particular circumstances necessitating their deprivation of liberty, and the length of the detention (Vasileva v.\u00a0Denmark, no. 52792/99, \u00a7 38, 25 September 2003). In the present case the psychiatric assessment had been carried out in the applicant\u2019s interest, to ensure the fairness of the criminal proceedings. The in-patient assessment had been carried out only after the out-patient assessment had proved inconclusive. The applicant had been held in the psychiatric hospital for only as long as was necessary to carry out the assessment and had been released on the day after the assessment had been completed. The foregoing considerations led the Government to conclude that the applicant\u2019s detention had been proportionate and that Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention had not been violated.",

Denmark, cited above, \u00a7 33). Furthermore, detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is justified only as a last resort where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2008..., and C.B. v. , no. 21207/03, \u00a7 48, 20 April 2010).",

Therefore that case is to be seen as pertaining more to non-compliance with a court order, considering that the Court has previously held that the phrase \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201d denotes an obligation of a specific and concrete nature already incumbent on the person concerned (Ciulla v.

Semantically the choice of that sort of language presumes that the person arrested or detained must have had an opportunity to comply with such an order and have failed to do so (see, with regard to securing \u201cthe fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law\u201d, McVeigh, O\u2019Neill and Evans, nos. 8022/77, 8025/77 and 8027/77, Report of the Commission of 18 March 1981, DR 25, \u00a7\u00a0175). That conclusion is borne out by the case-law of Convention organs, where a pre-condition for verifying the compliance of an internment for psychiatric observation with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) has been a prior implied or explicit refusal of the applicants to be subjected to a court-ordered internment for observation (in addition to the above-cited Berli\u0144ski decision see also X\u00a0v.\u00a0FRG, no.6659/74, Decisions and Reports (DR) no.3; Nowicka v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7 62; and Sobek v.

This objective, and the broader condition that detention be \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, require the existence in domestic law of adequate legal protection and fair and proper procedures (Winterwerp v.\u00a0the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 45). In other words, the Court has to examine the quality of the domestic law, verifying its compliance with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Amuur v.\u00a0, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III).",
