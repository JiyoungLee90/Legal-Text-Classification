The case originated in an application (no. 32540/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Montenegrin national, Mr Marko Vrbica (“the applicant”), on 26 August 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Rožman and Mrs M. Oredić of Law Firm Rožman & Oredić, advocates practising in Karlovac. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 17 November 2007 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaints concerning property, fairness and an effective remedy to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The Government of Montenegro, having been informed of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2(a) of the Rules of Court), did not avail themselves of this right.
The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Cetinje ().
On 15 October 1991 the Titograd Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud u Titogradu) gave judgment no. P-437/87 ordering the companies C.O. and P. – both incorporated under Croatian law and with their head offices in  – to pay the applicant jointly and severally damages in the total amount of 600,000 Yugoslav dinars for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident, together with accrued statutory default interest and the costs of proceedings. The judgment became final on 6 January 1992.
On 16 October 2001 the applicant instituted non-contentious proceedings before the Koprivnica Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Koprivnici) seeking that the above foreign judgment be recognised in .
On 20 November 2001 the Municipal Court accepted the applicant's request and issued a decision recognising the  court's judgment.
On 4 March 2002 the applicant applied for rectification of that decision because it incorrectly stated that the case number of the recognised judgment was P-437/97 instead of P-437/87.
On 13 March 2002 the Koprivnica Municipal Court issued a decision rectifying the error. It served it on the applicant's representatives two days later.
Meanwhile, on 3 December 2001 the applicant instituted enforcement proceedings before the Koprivnica Municipal Court against the companies C.O. and P. by submitting an application for enforcement of the recognised judgment.
On 6 February 2002 the court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o ovrsi) by garnishment of funds from the debtors' bank accounts.
The judgment debtors appealed, arguing that number P-437/97 figured in the decision on recognition as a number of the recognised judgment while the actual number of the judgment sought to be enforced was P-437/87. In his reply, the applicant submitted that the decision on recognition contained a clerical error, that he had applied for its rectification and that the proceedings instituted thereby were still pending.
On 16 April 2002 the  (Županijski sud u Koprivnici) quashed the writ of execution of 6 February 2002 and remitted the case. It held that the decision on recognition of the foreign judgment indeed contained the number P-437/97 as a number of the recognised judgment whereas the judgment sought to be enforced had the number P-437/87. The court observed that this discrepancy might have been caused by a clerical error but nevertheless quashed the writ of execution, giving precedence to the principle of strict formal legality in enforcement proceedings. The second-instance decision was served on the applicant's representatives on 10 May 2002.
In the resumed proceedings, on 13 June 2002 the Koprivnica Municipal Court issued an instruction, which the applicant's representatives received four days later, inviting him to submit within fifteen days the proper enforcement title (that is, the judgment with the same number as the one stated to be the number of the recognised judgment in the decision of 20 November 2001) or a rectified decision on recognition.
As the applicant failed to do so, on 6 August 2002 the court declared his application for enforcement inadmissible.
The applicant appealed and enclosed that court's decision on rectification of 13 March 2002 (see paragraph 10 above).
On 17 September 2002 the  dismissed the applicant's appeal. It held that the first-instance decision to declare the application for enforcement inadmissible was justified, given that the applicant had failed to satisfy the request of the first-instance court even though he could have done so as he had been in possession of the rectified decision at the relevant time. The second-instance decision was served on the applicant's representatives on 15 October 2002.
The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against that decision, which the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed on 17 September 2004.
Meanwhile, on 24 December 2002 the applicant instituted the second enforcement proceedings before the Koprivnica Municipal Court against the judgment debtors by resubmitting his application for enforcement together with the rectified decision on recognition.
On 7 March 2003 the court issued a writ of execution by garnishment of funds from the debtors' bank accounts.
The debtors appealed, arguing that the enforcement had become time-barred, given that the ten-year statutory limitation period running from the finality of the judgment sought to be enforced had elapsed on 6 January 2002. In reply, the court instructed them, pursuant to the Enforcement Act, to institute separate civil proceedings before it against the applicant with a view to declaring the enforcement inadmissible.
After these civil proceedings ended in the applicant's disfavour (see paragraphs 25-29 below), on 10 December 2004 the Koprivnica Municipal Court issued a decision discontinuing the enforcement proceedings.
The applicant appealed, but his appeal was dismissed by the Koprivnica County Court on 25 January 2005.
On 19 May 2003 the judgment debtors, companies C.O. and P., brought a civil action against the applicant in the Koprivnica Municipal Court, seeking to have the enforcement declared inadmissible.
On 8 June 2004 the Koprivnica Municipal Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, finding that the enforcement was time-barred and thus inadmissible.
On 28 September 2004 the  dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment.
The courts held that the applicant's request of 16 October 2001 for recognition of a foreign judgment instituting the relevant non-contentious proceedings had not interrupted the running of the statutory limitation period within which the enforcement of the recognised judgment could have been sought. The courts held so because they considered that a judgment debtor was not a party to such proceedings and was thus unaware that a judgment creditor had undertaken steps to enforce the judgment. The courts also noted that the applicant had not used the opportunity to institute enforcement proceedings directly – a step that would certainly have interrupted the running of the statutory limitation period – in which case the recognition of the enforcement title could have been decided incidentally as a preliminary issue in those proceedings. Lastly, the courts noted that the applicant had instituted the first enforcement proceedings within the ten-year statutory limitation period but that they had ended with a decision declaring his application for enforcement inadmissible, in which case, pursuant to section 389(2) of the Obligations Act, they did not interrupt the running of the limitation period.
The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against the second-instance judgment, alleging violations of his constitutional rights to a fair hearing, equality and property. On 20 April 2005 the  dismissed his constitutional complaint.
The relevant part of the Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 29/1978, 39/1985 and 57/1989, and Official Gazette of the Republic of  no. 53/1991 with subsequent amendments) provided as follows:
Section 379 (1)
Claims determined by a final court decision or a decision of another competent authority
“All claims determined by a final court decision or a decision of another competent authority ... lapse in ten years, even if for certain claims a statute provides for a shorter limitation period.”
Section 388
Bringing of an action
“[Running of the] limitation [period] is interrupted by bringing of a civil action in a court or by taking any other legal action before other competent authority by the creditor against the debtor with a view to determining, securing or enforcing his or her right.”
Section 389
Abandoning, dismissing or declaring an action inadmissible
“(1) An interruption of limitation period resulting from bringing of a civil action in a court or from taking of any other legal action before other competent authority by the creditor against the debtor with a view to determining, securing or enforcing his or her right, is considered never to have occurred if the creditor abandons the civil action or any other action undertaken.
(2) Likewise, it is considered that an interruption has never occurred if the creditor's civil action or application was dismissed or declared inadmissible, or if the measure obtained to secure or enforce the debt was set aside.”
Section 390 (1)
Declaring a civil action inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction
“If a civil action against the debtor is declared inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction or any other reason which does not concern the merits of the case, and the creditor brings another civil action within three months following finality of the decision declaring the [first] civil action inadmissible, it is considered that the limitation period was interrupted by the first civil action.”
The relevant part of the Enforcement Act (Ovršni zakon, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia, nos. 57/1996, 29/1999, 42/2000, 173/2003, 194/2003, 151/2004, 88/2005, 121/2005 and 6720/08), as in force at the material time, provided as follows:

“Unless otherwise provided by this Act or another statute, in enforcement ... proceedings the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act shall apply mutatis mutandis.”
Section 33 (1)
Certificate of enforceability
“If an application for enforcement is lodged with the court which did not decide on the claim at first instance, the application shall be accompanied with the original or a copy of the enforcement title having the certificate of enforceability ...”
In its decisions no. Gzz-22/00-2 of 5 July 2000 the Supreme Court interpreted section 33(1) of the Enforcement Act as follows:
“Section 33(1) of the Enforcement Act provides: 'If an application for enforcement is lodged with the court which did not decide on the claim at first instance, the application shall be accompanied with the original or a copy of the enforcement title having the certificate of enforceability ...' It follows by converse implication from that provision that an application for enforcement does not have to be accompanied by the enforcement title having the certificate of enforceability when the application for enforcement is [lodged with and] based on the decision of the court which decided on the claim [at first instance].”
The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia nos. 4/1977, 36/1977 (corrigendum), 36/1980, 69/1982, 58/1984, 74/1987, 57/1989, 20/1990, 27/1990 and 35/1991, and Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007, 84/2008 and 123/2008) as in force at the material time, provided as follows:

(2) When returning a submission to a party with a view to correcting or supplementing it, the court shall specify a time-limit for its re-submission.
(3) ...
(4) If a submission is not returned to the court within the specified time-limit, it shall be considered withdrawn. If it is returned without correction or supplement, it shall be declared inadmissible.”
Section 352 (1)
“In an appeal the parties may rely on new facts and adduce new evidence...”
Reopening of proceedings following a final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in  finding a violation of a fundamental human right or freedom
Section 428a
“(1) When the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of a human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or additional protocols thereto ratified by the Republic of Croatia, a party may, within thirty days of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights becoming final, file a petition with the court in the Republic of Croatia which adjudicated in the first instance in the proceedings in which the decision violating the human right or fundamental freedom was rendered, to set aside the decision by which the human right or fundamental freedom was violated.
(2) The proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 of this section shall be conducted by applying, mutatis mutandis, the provisions on the reopening of proceedings.

Section 101 (5)
If no separate decision on recognition of a foreign decision has been rendered, any court may in the proceedings [before it] decide on recognition of that decision as a preliminary issue, but only with effect for those proceedings.
In its decisions nos. Gž 6/1992-2 of 19 August 1992, Gž 2/1995-2 of 14 June 1995 and Gž-4/1995-2 of 15 June 1995 the Supreme Court held that the lower courts had breached the principle of adversarial hearing in the non-contentious proceedings for recognition of a foreign judgment because they had not served the application for recognition to the judgment debtor nor held any hearing before reaching their decisions.
