In the instant case, however, the Court considers that the delay of several years in the execution of a simple procedural act in accordance with the judgment appears at the outset manifestly unreasonable. Nor did the Government advance any sound justification for such a long delay. The Court is mindful that information is by definition a perishable commodity (see, mutatis mutandis, Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a038224/03, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2010-...), therefore, grounds for delay in providing the personal information to the individual concerned \u2013 when such disclosure is ordered by a domestic court \u2013 shall be particularly exceptional (see Kenedi v.
