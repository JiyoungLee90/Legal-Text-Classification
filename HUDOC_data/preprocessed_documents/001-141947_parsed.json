He oscillated between aggressive acts and menacing behaviour on the one side and pleadings on the other. In both cases, his behaviour followed the same pattern: it started with rather low-key aggression, which escalated during the course of the crisis which was marked by serious feelings of mortification....Now and then he threatened the women with violence and displayed suicidal tendencies...

The Court has, in particular, confirmed its previous stance that Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention does not only apply to pending proceedings on the determination of a criminal charge, but will remain applicable after the conclusion of criminal proceedings in order to ensure that, as regards any charge which was not proven, the innocence of the person in question is respected. Whenever the question of the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention arises in the context of subsequent proceedings, the applicant must demonstrate the existence of a link between the concluded criminal proceedings and the subsequent proceedings (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 104; also compare Sekanina v. Austria, 25\u00a0August\u00a01993, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 266A and Yassar Hussain v. the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no.\u00a08866/04, \u00a7 19, ECHR 2006III). The Court has considered that such a link was likely to be present where the subsequent proceedings required examination of the outcome of the prior criminal proceedings and, in particular, to assess the applicant\u2019s participation in some or all of the events leading to the criminal charge (see Allen, ibid.).",

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty unless he has been proved so according to law. It emerges from the case-law examined by the Court in the Allen case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 120-124) that there is no single approach to ascertaining the circumstances in which that Article will be violated in the context of proceedings which follow the conclusion of criminal proceedings. As illustrated by the Court\u2019s existing case-law, much will depend on the nature and context of the proceedings in which the impugned decision was adopted (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 125 and Yassar\u00a0Hussain, cited above, \u00a7 19). Furthermore, the language used by the decision-maker will be of critical importance in assessing the compatibility of the decision and its reasons with Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0126 and the further case-law cited therein). However, when regard is had to the nature and context of the particular proceedings, even the use of some unfortunate language may not be decisive. The Court\u2019s case-law provides some examples of instances where no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 has been found even though the language used by domestic authorities and courts was criticised (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7 126; A.L. v. Germany, no.\u00a072758/01, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39, 28 April 2005 and Reeves v. Norway (dec.), no.\u00a04248/02, 8 July 2004).",

Neither the Kassel Regional Court nor the Frankfurt Court of Appeal stated that the applicant had been guilty of a fresh criminal offence, but merely based their prognosis on the applicant\u2019s dangerousness on the assessment that the applicant\u2019s behaviour towards his female acquaintance Ms J. displayed similarities to his conduct before he murdered his wife.

While it is clear that in such subsequent civil proceedings the mere finding of liability for damages despite a previous acquittal cannot per se give rise to an issue under Article 6 \u00a7 2 as otherwise one would have to abolish such civil-liability actions \u2013 a point made recently in the case of Vella v. Malta (no. 69122/10, 11 February 2014, \u00a7\u00a060) \u2013 the fact remains that to speak of \u201cunfortunate language used\u201d and then to distinguish between unfortunate language that is in violation of the presumption of innocence and unfortunate language which is not merely shoves the problem into the realm of the aleatory.",

In that sense they could be said to be intimately connected with criminal proceedings. In reviewing the postconviction behaviour of the applicant one would have expected the Regional Court, sitting as an execution of sentence chamber, to be extremely cautious not to suggest, even tangentially, that the applicant had in fact committed the offence against Ms J. What in fact happened was that the court not once but twice suggested that the offence had in fact been committed by the applicant in respect of Ms J. \u2013 in its decision of 23\u00a0February\u00a01999 (Marburg Regional Court, see paragraph 9) and in its decision of 4 September 2007 (Kassel Regional Court, see paragraph 15). As regards the first decision (which, it must be emphasised, is mentioned in the judgment only by way of background to the case, the \u201coffending\u201d decisions, for the purpose of the instant judgment, being those of September and October 2007), the Marburg Regional Court, although stating that the applicant had attacked Ms J. in the evening of 10 January 1997 (and using the word \u201cperpetrator\u201d to boot), did at least attempt to \u201cdecriminalise\u201d, as it were, the facts by adding the perfunctory sentence \u201cirrespective of the qualification of the incident under criminal law\u201d (see paragraph 10). The Kassel Regional Court, on the other hand, in its decision of 4\u00a0September\u00a02007, reproduced without the slightest compunction, reservation or criticism the medical expert\u2019s view that \u201c... the criminal offence that the applicant had committed to the detriment of Ms J. showed that the applicant was willing to enter into relationships with women once more and that a separation would lead to violent acts for reasons of wounded pride ...\u201d (see paragraph 15). Neither the Kassel Regional Court nor the Frankfurt Court of Appeal (decision of 9 October 2007, see paragraphs 18 and 19) attempted to distance themselves from this clear attribution of criminal liability as regards the incident involving Ms J. It is true that neither court stated explicitly that the applicant had been guilty of a fresh criminal offence, but both clearly implied it by their lack of criticism of the expert\u2019s views in this respect.",

The cases of A.L. v. Germany and Reeves v. Norway, both cited at the end of paragraph 46 in support of the proposition that \u201cunfortunate language\u201d used may nonetheless not give rise to a breach of the presumption of innocence, are hardly the best examples that could have been adduced. In A.L. the \u201cunfortunate language\u201d used was not part of a public court judgment but was contained in a letter that the presiding judge had sent to the applicant\u2019s counsel, and, in any event, in that case the error of the presiding judge had been rectified by the Frankfurt Court of Appeal and by the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 38 of that judgment). As for Reeves, the less said the better \u2013 the third but last paragraph of that decision is, in my view, a strained exegetical exercise to defend the indefensible.",
