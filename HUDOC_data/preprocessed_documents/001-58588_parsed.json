Moreover, the Court considers that delays related to the backlog of cases resulting from such a strike come within the State\u2019s responsibility. In the light of the above, the Court considers that the period of inactivity until the first adjournment of the appeal hearing must be imputed to the Government. The Court also considers that the same holds true for the fourteen-month delay resulting from the adjournments of the appeal hearing on 9\u00a0January 1995 and 6\u00a0December 1995, which were due to industrial action by the clerks of the court and the failure of a prosecution witnesses to appear.",
