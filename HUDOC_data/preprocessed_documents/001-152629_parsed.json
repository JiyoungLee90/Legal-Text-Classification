This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses aimed at helping prisoners to address their offending behaviour and the risks they posed. While Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not impose any absolute requirement for prisoners to have immediate access to all courses they might require, any restrictions or delays encountered as a result of resource considerations had to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that whether a particular course was made available to a particular prisoner depended entirely on the actions of the authorities (see \u00a7 218 of the judgment).",

Thus, where, as in the present case, the applicant claims that delay in his access to prison courses constituted a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (a), the applicant\u2019s general progression through the prison system must be assessed in light of the particular circumstances of the case (see, inter\u00a0alia, Hall, cited above, \u00a7 32; and Black, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

However, following completion of the ETS course the applicant undertook a number of other courses which were relevant to his offence (see paragraph\u00a019 above). It is of significance that in July 2011 the authorities acceded to a request made by the applicant for a transfer to HMP Wymott on compassionate grounds. Following his transfer, the applicant applied to remain at HMP Wymott and was clearly warned that this would delay his access to the SOTP BNM course until August 2012. An offer was made to facilitate his transfer to another prison where the course might be available earlier but the offer was declined by the applicant (see paragraphs 22-25 above). Notwithstanding his own responsibility for the delay following his transfer to HMP Wymott and decision to remain there, he lodged in January 2012 an application at this Court in which he complained about the delay. In August 2012, as previously informed, he duly commenced the SOTP BNM course (see paragraph 28 above).",
