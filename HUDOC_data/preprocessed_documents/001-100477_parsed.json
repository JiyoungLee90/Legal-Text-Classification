The jury trial is not an essential aspect of a fair hearing in the determination of a criminal charge (see Callaghan and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 14739/89, Commission decision of 9 May 1989, DR 60, p.\u00a0296; Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004) and, furthermore, jury trials were introduced in the Vladimir Region only after the applicant's conviction. A similar complaint was examined and dismissed by the Court in the case of Klimentyev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a046503/99, 17 September 2002. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
