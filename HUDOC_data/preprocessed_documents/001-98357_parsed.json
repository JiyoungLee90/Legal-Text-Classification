That obligation would be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under Article\u00a02 of the Convention, an applicant's victim status were to be remedied by merely awarding damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u015fa v.\u00a0Turkey, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 74, Reports 1998VI; see also, more recently Nikolova and Velichkova, cited above, \u00a7 55 and the cases cited therein). Confining the authorities' reaction to incidents of deprivations of life to the mere payment of compensation would also make it possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibitions on killing, despite their fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Leonidis v. Greece, no. 43326/05, \u00a7 46, 8 January 2009). The Court therefore rejects the Government's objection in so far as it concerns the issue of compensation.",

What is not disputed, however, is the fact that the soldiers went to the applicants' village with a view to apprehending Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan, and that Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan was shot and killed during the soldiers' visit. Two aspects of the killing are particularly important for the Court's examination. Firstly, Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan was killed by a bullet fired by a member of the armed forces. Secondly, the killing took place during a planned military operation, at the beginning of which Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan's house was surrounded by armed soldiers who formed two circles around the house. It follows that the killing lies within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities and the respondent Government are thus under an obligation to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the killing occurred, failing which an issue under Article 2 of the Convention will arise (see Akkum and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 21894/93, \u00a7 211, ECHR 2005II (extracts); see also Yasin Ate\u015f v.

There has never been any suggestion that he would be armed or that he would pose a danger to the life or limb of anyone, including the soldiers who went to his village to arrest him. In fact, the decision to arrest him was taken and the operation was planned and conducted without Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan having had an opportunity to surrender to the authorities, because the local prosecutor had issued the arrest warrant without first inviting him to surrender (see paragraph 29 above). The Court thus has serious misgivings as to whether a military operation of that scale was really necessary to arrest Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan without waiting for him to surrender to the authorities and without trying other, non-life-threatening methods of arresting him for the minor offence in question.",

The same soldiers also secured the crucial evidence, such as the spent bullet cases found in the area (see paragraph 13 above). When the applicants informed the prosecutor that Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan had been killed in the garden and his body dragged down the hill, the same soldiers then searched the area in question and told the prosecutor that the applicants' allegations were baseless. The trial court, which considered that there were \u201cno legal reasons to disregard the investigation\u201d carried out by those soldiers, relied on that investigation in reaching its conclusion that Y\u0131lmaz \u00d6zcan had not been killed as alleged by the applicants.",

Although some of the applicants drew the investigating authorities' attention to the inappropriateness of the soldiers' involvement in the investigation, the authorities' response was to arrest those applicants and detain them in prison (see paragraph 32 above). The Court considers that allowing the same soldiers involved in the fatal arrest operation to take such an active part in the investigation is not only so serious as to taint the independence of the entirety of the criminal proceedings (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a052391/99, \u00a7\u00a7 339-341, ECHR 2007...), but also entailed the risk that crucial evidence implicating the soldiers in the killing would be destroyed or ignored.",

This was despite the fact that the same prosecutor had been informed about the allegations against the first lieutenant within hours of the killing (see paragraph\u00a013 above). For the Court, a delay of three days to question a main suspect in an investigation into a killing did not disclose the necessary diligence required by Article 2 of the Convention. As well as creating an appearance of collusion between the judicial authorities and the military, the failure to question first lieutenant Sevin\u00e7 promptly is also conducive to leading the relatives of the deceased \u2013 as well as the public in general \u2013 to form the opinion that members of the security forces operate in a vacuum in which they are not accountable to the judicial authorities for their actions. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the failure to question the officer in a timely fashion, coupled with the fact that he continued in the meantime to work as the commander of his military unit, created the risk of collusion between the first lieutenant and the soldiers under his command (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others, cited above, \u00a7 330).",

The same failure on the part of the national authorities also led the trial court to conclude that the statements given by the eyewitnesses to the events which supported the applicants' version of the killing could not be relied on in evidence (see paragraph 40 above).
