The Municipality was further liable to pay his legal costs. The District Court took note of the Municipality\u2019s argument that the tentative approval was conditional upon an amendment to the property plan, and that the applicant was aware of the need to modify the property plan and ought to have understood that the positive tentative approval did not mean that he would be able to build without an amendment to the property plan. In the view of the District Court the fact that a claimant was aware that an amendment to the property plan was needed in order to grant a building permit did not dispense the Building Committee from specifically reviewing and justifying its position as to whether the desired measure was authorised by existing plans. What the applicant may have known about existing plans was therefore of no significance in this context. Since the applicable plans did not allow the grant of a building permit and since an amendment to the plan could not be a condition attached to a tentative approval, such approval should not have been granted. Nor was such knowledge significant for the assessment of his application for a building permit, refused on 13 February 1997. On the whole, the refusal was erroneous. The District Court found that the Building Committee had disregarded a clear and unambiguous provision in the 1987 Act, i.e. Chapter 8 section 34, which stated that a tentative approval was binding if an application for a building permit was made within two years from the date on which the tentative approval was granted. Moreover, the District Court found it remarkable that the Building Committee had taken almost four and a half years to reject the request for a building permit since the average time to process such a request was six to eight weeks, according to testimony given by the city architect. Thus, the court considered that the Building Committee\u2019s handling of the case had involved such fault and neglect in its exercise of public authority that the Municipality was liable to pay compensation.",

The three rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, for example, Bruncrona v. Finland, no. 41673/98, \u00a7 65, 16 November 2004) and must comply with the principle of lawfulness and pursue a legitimate aim by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see, for example, Beyeler v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a033202/96, \u00a7\u00a7 108-14, ECHR 2000-I; J.A.

Secondly, the Building Committee had disregarded a clear and unambiguous provision in the 1987 Act stipulating that a tentative approval was binding if an application for a building permit was made within two years from the date on which the tentative approval was granted. Thirdly, the Building Committee had taken almost four and a half years to reject the application for a building permit, which normally was a matter that would be processed within six to eight weeks.

Indeed, in this case it turned out that two of the applicant\u2019s neighbours successfully opposed the repeal of the property plan, which measure - had it been allowed to stand - would have enabled the requisite division of the applicant\u2019s land. The Court is not persuaded by the applicant\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s decision of 14 November 1996 to quash the repeal was unlawful and that the  erroneously upheld the decision as being lawful. Moreover, after the Office of the Town Architects had informed the neighbours on 23 March 1999 about the tentative approval of 15 April 1992, they challenged that decision before the County Administrative Board, which on 31 March 2000 quashed the decision, as it was contrary to existing plans and had been taken without prior consultation of the neighbours. Despite the manifest lateness of this decision, the Court finds no reason to call into doubt the lawfulness under domestic law of the Board\u2019s decision, upheld by the administrative courts at three levels of jurisdiction. Nor does it find any reason to question the lawfulness of their connected decision to uphold the refusal of the building permit, decided by the Building Committee on 13 February 1997.

However, even if he had been granted a building permit in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, this would by no means have guaranteed him a protection against the measure being challenged by the neighbours and being ultimately altered or quashed with reference to the applicable plans. This was a reality that he had to face relatively soon after the grant of the tentative approval. Already in 1993 the owners of two neighbouring properties objected to the repeal of the property plan, a measure that had been aimed at facilitating the division of the applicant\u2019s property, and the neighbours succeeded in having the measure quashed by the Government on 14 November 1996, a decision upheld by the  on 4 September 1998. Moreover, an amended detailed development plan which effectively prohibited a division of the applicant\u2019s property and the construction of another house on it was adopted by the Municipal Council on 27 February 1997. While the competent authorities\u2019 handling of the matter indisputably left a lot to be desired, the Court does not find that the applicant\u2019s interest in obtaining a building permit for a second house on his property could outweigh the interests of the neighbours and the public interest in preserving the particular character of the area in question. In these circumstances and, having regard to the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by the Contracting States in such matters, the Court does not find that the refusal to grant the applicant a building permit can be regarded as a disproportionate interference with his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.",

Such proceedings were usually complicated and time-consuming. Swedish planning and building legislation was designed to take into account different interests in society and to enable those concerned to have a say in new plans and the amendment of existing plans. Moreover, it should be stressed that the applicant himself had to some extent contributed to the length of the proceedings. Thus, he had on numerous occasions asked for extensions of the time-limits set by the authorities and the courts for submitting observations, comments, etc. Such extensions had been requested and granted more than twenty times in the proceedings concerning the tentative approval and more than fifteen times in the proceedings concerning the building permit. In the latter proceedings, the applicant also requested the County Administrative Board to stay the proceedings for some time, pending the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the compensation proceedings.

The proceedings that ensued before the administrative authorities and the administrative courts all concerned the same dispute - between the applicant, on the one hand, and variously the neighbours and the authorities, on the other hand - and ended on 15 September 2004, thirteen years and one month later, when the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the annulment of the tentative approval and the refusal to grant a building permit.

However, the Government questioned that the market value was actually as high as the estimated SEK 1,200,000. According to the report, the estimation of the market value was relatively uncertain. The taxation value, which corresponded to approximately 75 % of the estimated market value, amounted to SEK 582,000 for the whole undivided plot of 810 m2. No vacant plots had been sold between 1990 and 1996 in the relevant area. In November 1996 a plot of about 1,000 m2 had been assessed at between SEK 1,300,000 and 1,400,000, but the size of that part of the property, which the applicant would have liked to parcel off in order to build another house, was only 336 m2.

According to the findings of the national courts, the applicant had failed to show that the refusal had caused him financial damage. In reaching this conclusion in its judgment of 25 October 2000, the Court of Appeal seems to have placed particular weight on the consideration that a tentative approval should not have been granted in the first place and on the negative outcome for the applicant after many years\u2019 proceedings regarding the tentative approval, the building permit and relevant planning measures. It did not seek to determine the hypothetical question of what his position would have been had the authorities complied with the statutory obligation to issue him a building permit. The Court cannot speculate either as to what the outcome would have been in the absence of the deficiencies that violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. However, it considers that the applicant must have suffered a loss of real opportunities (Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden (Article 50), judgment of 18 December 1984, Series A no. 88, p. 13, \u00a7 25) as a result of the Building Committee\u2019s omission to issue within a reasonable time a building permit to him in accordance with section 34 of the 1987 Act and the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s refusal to hear oral argument from him about the repeal of the property plan that would have enabled division of his property.
