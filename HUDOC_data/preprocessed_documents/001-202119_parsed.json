Administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public.

Indeed, crossexamination of a rape victim in court is highly sensitive as it necessarily reveals information about the most intimate aspects of the victim\u2019s life (see, as regards the instant case, paragraph 18 above). Secondly, the Court accepts the Government\u2019s contention that in the present case the State had been under an obligation to provide an even higher degree of protection to I.J., given that the police authorities had breached her privacy by unlawfully publishing her personal information at the very outset of the case (see paragraph 6 above).",

On the one hand, as the Court has consistently emphasised, it is a fundamental principle under Article 6 \u00a7 1 that court hearings should be held in public. This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice without public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby people\u2019s confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the principles of any democratic society (see, for instance, Welke and Bia\u0142ek v. Poland, no.\u00a015924/05, \u00a7 73, 1 March 2011). On the other hand, as acknowledged by the very wording of Article 6 \u00a7 1, there are circumstances where it may be necessary, and therefore justified, to exclude or limit public access to all or part of the trial, the protection of private life of the parties being one of the grounds on which such measures may be legitimate. These starting points are, of course, common ground.",

A general position in the Court\u2019s case-law is, however, that the conduct of trials \u201cin camera\u201d must be strictly required by the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the trial court must be required to make a specific finding in this regard, to provide sufficient reasoning to demonstrate such necessity, and to limit secrecy to the extent necessary to preserve the interest for the protection of which the measure is taken (see Belashev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 28617/03, \u00a7 83, 4\u00a0December 2008). More generally, the Court has required that the manner in which criminal proceedings are conducted in each case must afford the parties the necessary protection so as to strike an appropriate balance between the victim\u2019s rights and interests protected by Article 8 and the rights of defence protected by Article 6 of the Convention (see Y v. Slovenia, no.\u00a041107/10, 28 May 2015, \u00a7\u00a0115).",

Accordingly, the trial court was under an obligation to examine in detail whether and to what extent this was impermissible on account of the protection to be afforded to the alleged victim. The limitations on public access called for careful consideration and balancing by the trial court. The domestic court, however, decided to completely exclude public access to the trial without giving any specific reasons to justify its decision. It merely cited the relevant statutory norms. There is therefore no indication that the trial court actually performed the requisite balancing in the light of the specific circumstances of the case. (On the contrary, the trial court twice referred to the adverse consequences for the victim\u2019s private life,as well as the the accused\u2019s private and family life, even though the latter clearly were not a relevant justification for in camera proceedings in circumstances where the accused himself insisted on being tried in open court; see paragraphs 13 and 17 of the present judgment.)

Even if the coverage of the events in the media cannot be decisive for the assessment of whether and to what extent there are grounds for limiting public access to the trial, the conduct of the parties in relation to the media in the course of the pending proceedings is not wholly irrelevant for the balancing required under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01. Where a party to live proceedings grants interviews to the media on the subject matter of those proceedings while at the same time wishing to benefit from closed doors at the trial on the grounds of protection for his or her private life, such a situation calls for closer scrutiny from the angle of the balancing exercise required under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.",

What is stressed in this context is that in the interviews, she was able to control what she shared with the public, whereas this was not the case at the trial, where the alleged victim could and would be required to respond to questions that might be of a highly intimate nature (see paragraph 55).",

When, however, the alleged victim has already voluntarily exposed herself to publicity, during the ongoing criminal proceedings, by giving interviews and sharing her own view and perspective on their subject matter, such an approach will to some extent lighten the weight to be attributed to the risk of secondary victimisation through the publicity of the trial, in particular where \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 the entire trial is closed to the public and not only the testimony or cross-examination of the alleged victim.",

This error is invoked by the Government, and acknowledged by the majority, as a factor demanding heightened protection for the latter in the context of the trial (see paragraph\u00a055). It should be noted, however, that according to the applicant\u2019s submissions, although the press release issued by the police had not identified him by his full name but only by his initials and age, in reality his identity was known to both the community and the media, where the ensuing coverage referred to him, too, by his full name. Thus it appears that the identity of both the alleged perpetrator and the alleged victim were revealed to the public by the police. It cannot therefore be said that the adverse consequences only concerned the alleged victim. Rather, both parties seem to have been affected. Under such circumstances, it could not be argued that the initial error committed by the police, and subsequent media coverage and public attention relating to the case, were capable of dispensing the domestic court from its duty to carry out careful balancing of the competing interests arising in the specific context of the trial.",

It is of course important that the outcome of the case was made public, together with a statement of the main reasons on which it was based. Yet the public pronouncement of the court\u2019s conclusions cannot replace the public scrutiny of the actual trial, and is therefore not sufficient to compensate for the fact that the entire trial was closed to the public without adequate consideration and balancing of the competing rights and interests. The same is true for the retrospective finding by the Supreme Court acting on appeal that the defendant\u2019s procedural rights had (otherwise) not been breached (paragraph 54).",

I find such a conclusion disturbing in the light both of the Court\u2019s existing case-law and of the requirement of a specific and substantiated balancing of the competing rights and interests at stake. Although the protection of the victim\u2019s rights under Article 8 is an important and weighty consideration, I find it problematic to suggest that this protection can only be provided by closing the entire trial to all public scrutiny, without a specific account and balancing of the circumstances justifying such an outcome. Even where the aim is to protect the victim\u2019s rights, the need remains to conduct a balancing exercise based on the specific features of the case. In my view, it would be inappropriate to encourage a systematic and total closure of criminal trials from the public by invoking the rights of the victim in a general manner.

By contrast, nothing in those instruments can be taken as diluting the obligation to conduct a specific assessment and balancing of the competing rights and interests and to consider in detail which measures should be applied in each situation and at each stage of the proceedings.",

At the same time, I am very mindful of the fact that extent and manner in which the possibility of public scrutiny of criminal trials in cases of the present kind calls for a very careful approach, given the risk that some of the media, and some users of the social media, might tend to abuse the possibilities of access to such trials. It is therefore clear that a sufficient margin must be left to the domestic authorities to determine, and impose, limitations in this respect so as to ensure that appropriate professionally and ethically responsible public scrutiny remains possible, while enabling abusive practices to be avoided.",
