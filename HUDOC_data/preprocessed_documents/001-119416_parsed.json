While noting the extensive international criticism of the use of torture and the impunity of the State officials responsible in , the Deputy Director of the FMS found no well-founded reason for fearing that the applicant would be persecuted on religious grounds. Noting that the great majority of the population of  were Muslims, he found it unlikely that the applicant would be persecuted solely on the basis of his Islamic beliefs. As to the authorities\u2019 attempt to strengthen control over religious beliefs, this was considered to be pursuing the understandable aim of limiting the influence of radical Islam, including the IMU. He concluded that the applicant was not eligible for refugee status and that his application had been motivated by his intention to escape criminal liability in Tajikistan. He noted at the same time that the existence of a well-founded fear of becoming a victim of torture or ill-treatment might be a ground for granting the applicant temporary asylum in  under section 12 of the Refugees Act.",

It further reiterated its settled case-law to the effect that the scope of the constitutional right to liberty and personal inviolability was the same for foreign nationals and stateless persons as for Russian nationals. A foreign national or stateless person may not be detained in  for more than fortyeight hours without a judicial decision. That constitutional requirement served as a guarantee against excessively long detention beyond forty-eight hours, and also against arbitrary detention, in that it required a court to examine whether the arrest was lawful and justified. The Constitutional Court held that Article 466 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP, read in conjunction with the Minsk Convention, could not be construed as permitting the detention of an individual for more than forty-eight hours on the basis of a request for his or her extradition without a decision by a Russian court. A custodial measure could be applied only in accordance with the procedure and within the time-limits established in Chapter 13 of the CCrP.",

The Court may find it useful in this respect to examine the practice of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which have used interim measures to enjoin the authorities to place applicants under special police protection in order to shield them from criminal acts by certain non-state actors.\u201d",

The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case.

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article\u00a019 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof.

It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, with further references, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 147, ECHR 2005VII; Iskandarov v.

Although anyone may, in theory, decide to voluntarily surrender, the official version appears unsubstantiated and totally inconsistent with all the other material submitted to the Court. First of all, a \u201cconfession statement\u201d which the applicant allegedly made to the Tajik authorities has never been submitted to the Court. Furthermore, the official version of the applicant\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d and \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d is clearly contradicted by his own written testimony before the Court, his reported statement in a public hearing in  and the detailed and coherent account of the events reported by his representatives on the basis of the information collected from various sources. Moreover, the idea of \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d sits ill with the written testimony by the applicant\u2019s father, who was refused a meeting with the applicant on the ground that he had failed to cooperate with the Tajik authorities in their effort to bring the applicant back to the country (see paragraph 41). Moreover, while referring to the Tajik official version the respondent Government failed to support it with any tangible element, let alone explain in any way how and when the applicant managed to undertake such a long trip across various State borders in such a short time without either his passport or any official record of crossing the Russian border. Lastly, the Court finds it difficult to reconcile the Tajik official version of \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d with the applicant\u2019s insistent claims to the Russian authorities and the Court over the two preceding years with the sole motive of preventing his return to .",

Indeed, a forcible transfer would in any event have started by restricting the liberty of the person concerned. That the applicant was apprehended in Moscow and detained incommunicado shortly before his forcible transfer to  does not appear implausible. The Court draws strong inferences in support of the applicant\u2019s account from the Government\u2019s failure to present any alternative version of what happened to the applicant between 31 October and 2 November 2011 and, most importantly, from the authorities\u2019 deliberate and persistent refusal to conduct a meaningful investigation into those events (see paragraphs 193196 below). The Court is particularly struck by the explanation given for the investigators\u2019 refusal to open a criminal investigation into the incident: that the applicant had purportedly attempted to stage his abduction with a view to escaping criminal liability in  (see paragraphs 56 and 63 above). The Court finds that assumption to be devoid of any sense, as the investigators already knew, or ought to have known by that time (MarchJuly 2012), that the applicant\u2019s disappearance from Moscow had resulted in his arrest, detention, criminal trial and conviction in Tajikistan.",

Indeed, given the short time that elapsed between the applicant\u2019s abduction in Moscow and his sudden emergence in the hands of the police in Khujand, and in view of the long distance between the two cities (approximately 3,500 km by road), there is nothing to counter the applicant\u2019s assertion that he was transported there by air.

Where the sources available to the Court describe a general situation, an applicant\u2019s specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence, with reference to the individual circumstances substantiating his fears of ill-treatment (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7 73, and Dzhaksybergenov, cited above, ibid.). The Court would not require evidence of such individual circumstances only in the most extreme cases where the general situation of violence in the country of destination is of such intensity as to create a real risk that any removal to that country would necessarily violate Article 3 (see N.A.\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7\u00a7 115-16, 17 July 2008, and Sufi and Elmi v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, \u00a7 217, 28\u00a0June 2011). In a case where assurances have been provided by the receiving State, those assurances constitute a further relevant factor which the Court will consider. However, assurances are not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment. There is an obligation to examine whether assurances provide, in their practical application, a sufficient guarantee that the applicant will be protected against the risk of illtreatment. The weight to be given to assurances from the receiving State depends, in each case, on the circumstances prevailing at the material time (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 148, and Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, \u00a7 187, ECHR 2012 (extracts)).",

On the contrary, the recent reports dating from 2011 and 2012 tend to corroborate a continued practice of torture and other illtreatment by law-enforcement officers (see paragraphs 104-107 above). The risk of torture appears to be further increased by a common police practice of incommunicado detention before formally opening a criminal case, and confessions extracted under duress were still reported to be used as evidence in court (ibid.). The Court finds nothing in the respondent Government\u2019s submissions to refute those recent reports or otherwise attest to any perceptible improvement of the situation in Tajikistan. It notes at the same time that the decision taken by the Deputy Director of the FMS himself on 26\u00a0August 2010 acknowledged the existence of extensive international criticism of the use of torture and the impunity of the officials responsible in Tajikistan, without reporting any major improvement in that respect (see paragraph 27 above).",

First, the investigators strictly limited their action to \u201cpre-investigation inquiries\u201d under Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, while persistently refusing to open criminal proceedings, which would have constituted the best, if not the only, tool to meet the Convention requirements of effective investigation as set out in paragraphs 187-190 above. Given, notably, the limited procedural framework provided for by Article 144 and the failure to ensure the victim\u2019s or his representatives\u2019 effective participation in the investigation, the Court has serious doubts that a pre-investigation inquiry was capable of complying with the abovementioned requirements in a situation where an individual had lodged an arguable complaint of torture or ill-treatment, as in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Kleyn and Aleksandrovich v. Russia, no.\u00a040657/04, \u00a7\u00a7 5658, 3 May 2012).",

In fact, the decisions by which the investigators concluded their inquiries and refused to open a criminal investigation were immediately quashed by their superiors on at least four occasions, only to be repeated a few weeks later in either identical or very similar terms (see paragraphs 55-63 above). For example, the second decision by the senior investigator, P.K., of 20 April 2012 refusing to initiate a criminal investigation repeated word for word his first decision of 21 March 2012. Both decisions were quashed by two equally identical decisions taken by the head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division or his deputy on 23 April and 21\u00a0March 2012 respectively. They were followed by two further consecutive decisions of the investigators, also refusing to open a criminal investigation without adding any new relevant element of substance. The Court is bound to conclude that the process of repeated quashing and renewal of identical decisions by the investigation division resulted in the proceedings being stalled in a manner that was incompatible with the Convention requirement of effective investigation. Not only was valuable time lost, but also the vicious circle within the investigation division deprived the applicant of any reasonable opportunity to challenge the investigators\u2019 decisions in court under Article\u00a0125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In those circumstances, the Court sees no value for the applicant in obtaining such judicial review, as it would only have prompted the investigators to repeat yet another cycle of their futile inquiries.",

Their decisions represent a mere compilation of general statements of fact, meaningless procedural requests and references to unreliable assumptions. For example, as late as 9 June 2012 the deputy head of the Nikulinskiy Investigation Division requested a second verification of whether the applicant had crossed the Tajikistan border and been remanded in custody in that country (see paragraph 62 above). Yet, the authorities must have been aware of the official letter of 28\u00a0March 2012 from the Prosecutor General of Tajikistan informing his Russian counterpart that the applicant had been detained in  at the relevant time (see paragraph\u00a044 above). Notwithstanding that obvious fact, the decision taken by the investigator on 9 July 2012 incomprehensibly concluded that it had been impossible to confirm or refute the information about the crossing of the State border by the applicant (see paragraph 63 above). Likewise, from March to July 2012, the investigators persistently relied on the hypothesis that the applicant might have staged his abduction in order to escape criminal liability in Tajikistan. The Court has already found that that hypothesis was devoid of any sense, in view of the obvious causal link between the applicant\u2019s abduction in  and his arrest in his home country (see paragraph 136 above). At the same time, the investigators failed to take some elementary and straightforward investigative steps, such as finding out which airlines had operated flights from Moscow to Khujand between 1\u00a0and 3\u00a0November 2011 and questioning the security and administrative staff of Domodedovo airport, where the applicant had reportedly boarded an aircraft. Instead, the investigator referred only to \u201cverification\u201d by the FSB of the possible unlawful crossing of the Russian State border by the applicant and readily reproduced the general statement that Russian law did not provide for the \u201crecording of names of persons crossing the border\u201d.",

Turkey (dec.), nos. 46113/99 et al., \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR 2010). The Court\u2019s proceedings in respect of such controversial issues as those raised by the present case are all the more contingent on respondent States\u2019 cooperation, in line with their undertaking under Article 38 of the Convention, to furnish all necessary facilities for the establishment of the facts. The Convention organs have repeatedly emphasised that obligation as being of fundamental importance for the proper and effective functioning of the Convention system (see, among others, Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], cited above, \u00a7 70, and Committee of Ministers Resolutions ResDH(2001)66 and ResDH(2006)45). In the Court\u2019s view, the only genuine way for Russia to honour its undertaking in the present case was to ensure that an exhaustive investigation of the incident was carried out and to inform the Court of its results. However, the Russian authorities manifestly failed to do so (see paragraphs 193-196 above), thus prompting the Court to examine the highly controversial issues at stake in the place of the domestic authorities. Such a failure by the State Party to adduce crucial information and evidence compels the Court to draw strong inferences in favour of the applicant\u2019s position (Rule 44C \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). In this connection, the Court also attaches great weight to the way in which the official inquiries were conducted, as the authorities did not appear to want to uncover the truth regarding the circumstances of the case (see El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-93).",

More recently, the Court came to the same conclusion in yet another similar case (see Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012527, 2\u00a0October 2012).

In most of these, the applicants face a genuine threat to life and limb, with the ensuing real risk of grave, irreversible harm in breach of the core provisions of the Convention. This vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands the utmost importance to be attached to the question of the States Parties\u2019 compliance with the Court\u2019s indications in that respect (see, inter alia, the firm position on that point expressed by the States Parties in the Izmir Declaration cited in paragraph\u00a0119 above and by the Committee of Ministers in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)83 in the case of Ben Khemais cited in paragraph 117 above).

On 16 December 2010 the Government informed the Court that the authorities had taken relevant steps to guarantee that the applicant would not be extradited to  until further notice (see paragraphs 5 and 209 above). Notwithstanding the steps taken, in November 2011 the applicant was forcibly transferred by aircraft from Moscow to Khujand by means of a special operation in which State agents were found to be involved (see paragraphs 202-203 above).",

The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument. While the measures taken to stay extradition may be indicative of the Government\u2019s initial willingness to comply with the interim measures, they cannot, in the Court\u2019s view, relieve the State of its responsibility for subsequent events in the applicant\u2019s case. Nor could the Government legitimately claim, as their argument may suggest, that the applicant\u2019s forcible return to Tajikistan was not prevented by the interim measures which were formulated by the Court in the present case.",

Whilst the formulation of the interim measure is one of the elements to be taken into account in the Court\u2019s analysis of whether a State has complied with its obligations under Article\u00a034, the Court must have regard not only to the letter but also to the spirit of the interim measure indicated (see Paladi v. Moldova [GC], no.\u00a039806/05, \u00a7 91, 10 March 2009) and, indeed, to its very purpose. The sole purpose of the interim measure, as indicated by the Court in the present case \u2013 and the Government did not claim to be unaware of it \u2013 was to prevent the applicant\u2019s exposure to a real risk of ill-treatment at the hands of the Tajik authorities. There could have remained no doubt about either the purpose or the rationale of that interim measure after the case had been communicated to the Government and given priority by the Court, on 30 January 2011. The Government\u2019s understanding of the spirit and purpose of the interim measure is also demonstrated by the instructions that they sent to various domestic authorities to suspend \u201cany action to expel, extradite or otherwise forcibly remove the applicant to Tajikistan\u201d (see paragraph 209 above). The fact that the authorities strictly complied with the interim measure for almost eleven months until the unexpected events of 31 October 2011 also shows that its purpose and legal consequences did not raise any doubts.",

Yet, the latter is exactly what the Court has found the respondent State to be responsible for in the present case (see paragraphs 202-203 above). In so doing, the State frustrated the purpose of the interim measure, which sought to maintain the status quo pending the Court\u2019s examination of the application. As a result, the applicant was exposed to a real risk of illtreatment in  and the Court was prevented from securing to him the practical and effective benefit of his right under Article 3 of the Convention.",

Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 11, Series A no. 85, and Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece (Article 50), 31 October 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 330B). This obligation reflects the principles of international law whereby a State responsible for a wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, consisting in restoring the situation that existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided that restitution is not \u201cmaterially impossible\u201d and \u201cdoes not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation\u201d (Article 35 of the Articles of the International Law Commission on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts). In other words, while restitution is the rule, there may be circumstances in which the State responsible is exempted \u2013 fully or in part \u2013 from this obligation, provided that it can show that such circumstances obtain (see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v.\u00a0 (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2009).

The Court reiterates that since its judgment in the Iskandarov case (cited above), in which it found the Russian Federation responsible for a violation of Article 3 on account of the applicant\u2019s unexplained abduction and transfer to Tajikistan by unidentified persons, it has been confronted with repeated incidents of that kind. The Court has already found a violation of both Article 3 and Article 34 in the Abdulkhakov case, in which the applicant was abducted in Moscow and forced to board a plane for Tajikistan in identical circumstances (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 124-27). More recently, albeit in different circumstances, it found the same violations on account of another applicant\u2019s deportation from St Petersburg to Uzbekistan (see Zokhidov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 67286/10, \u00a7\u00a7 128-42 and 201-11, 5 February 2013, not yet final).

This development is in line with the Court\u2019s case-law and perfectly supports the idea of improving domestic remedies in extradition and expulsion cases, which has long been promoted by the Convention organs in respect of all Contracting States (see, among the most recent authorities, the Grand Chamber\u2019s stand in De Souza Ribeiro v. France, cited above, \u00a7 82; see also the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)6 on the improvement of domestic remedies and Recommendation R(98)13 on the right of rejected asylum seekers to an effective remedy). The Court trusts that the meticulous application of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling by all Russian courts would allow the judiciary to avoid such failings as those criticised in the present judgment (see paragraphs 161-165) and further develop emerging domestic case-law that directly applies the Convention requirements through judicial practice (see, among the most recent examples, the domestic courts\u2019 decisions examined in Kulevskiy v. Russia (dec), no. 20696/12, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 36, 20 November 2012). The Court notes that the steps being taken by the courts of general jurisdiction echo the important case-law developed by the  on extradition matters and the positive measures taken at other levels, as reflected in the Committee of Ministers\u2019 decisions (see paragraphs 123-124 above). Against this background, it is all the more disturbing for the Court to face situations in which domestic legal mechanisms are blatantly circumvented as a result of the unlawful transfer of applicants to States that seek to prosecute them. The recurrence of such lawlessness is capable of wiping out the effectiveness of domestic remedies on which the Convention system totally relies (compare Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi, cited above, \u00a7 166).

The need for such a mechanism is particularly pressing in respect of applicants wanted by those States to which unlawful forcible transfers or deportations have already taken place. In view of the exceptional purpose pursued by the interim measures and the likelihood of grave irreparable damage being caused by any breach thereof, any special mechanism thus introduced should be subject to close scrutiny by a competent law-enforcement officer at an appropriate level capable of intervening at short notice to prevent any sudden breach of interim measures that may occur on purpose or by accident.

However, a thorough assessment of all such matters goes beyond the Court\u2019s judicial function in view of the numerous legal, administrative, practical and security issues involved. The Court will therefore abstain at this stage from formulating specific orders, considering that the indications provided above will help to ensure the proper execution of the present judgment under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 137, and Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 194, 10 January 2012). It is for the Russian authorities to propose to the Committee of Ministers concrete steps to secure the Convention rights concerned, and for the latter to assess the effectiveness of the measures proposed and to follow up their subsequent implementation in line with the Convention requirements, as highlighted by the present judgment.",
