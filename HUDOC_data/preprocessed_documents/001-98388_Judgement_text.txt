The case originated in an application (no. 34830/07) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Zoran Kvartuč (“the applicant”), on 29 June 2007.
The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Š. Stažnik.
On 11 December 2008 the President of the First Section decided to give notice of the application. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).

On 15 March 1995 the applicant brought a civil action in the Zadar Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zadru) against the Croatian Privatisation Fund and other two companies, seeking annulment of the share purchase contract whereby the Fund sold the shares of one company, in which the applicant holds the shares, to the other one.
On 23 May 1995 the court issued a decision dismissing the second respondent's plea of lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae (stvarna nadležnost). Following an appeal by the second respondent, on 21 December 1995 the Zadar County Court (Županijski sud u Zadru) reversed the first-instance decision finding that the ordinary courts had no jurisdiction in the matter and transferred the case to the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske). On 11 September 1997 the  declined its jurisdiction in the matter and applied to the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) to resolve the conflict of jurisdiction created thereby. On 1 October 1998 the Supreme Court decided that the ordinary courts had competence in the matter. On 11 December 1998 the case was transferred back to the Zadar Municipal Court.
The Municipal Court held hearings on 3 May 2000 and 19 February 2002.
On 23 March 2004 the court stayed the proceedings on account of the insolvency proceedings that had been opened against the second respondent on 16 November 2000. Those insolvency proceedings ended on 4 October 2004 when the P.P. company was deleted from the business register.
Because of the insolvency proceedings, on 9 February 2005 the Zadar Municipal Court declined its jurisdiction in the matter and transferred the case to the  (Trgovački sud u Zadru).
On 24 May 2006 the applicant lodged a request for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (zahtjev za zaštitu prava na suđenje u razumnom roku) with the  which request was dismissed on 3 November 2006. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court.
On 18 October 2006 the  stayed the proceedings because the second respondent had ceased to exist as a legal entity.
On 10 November 2006 the applicant appealed against that decision to the  (Visoki trgovački sud Republike Hrvatske).
On 17 May 2007 the Supreme Court reversed the 's decision of 3 November 2006 (see paragraph 10 above) by finding a violation of the applicant's right to a hearing within a reasonable time. It awarded him 14,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) in compensation and ordered the  to give a decision in the applicant's case within six months of service of its decision.
The Supreme Court's decision was served on the  on 29 June 2007.
Since at that time the case was pending before the High Commercial Court, on 3 July 2007 the judge of the Zadar Commercial Court, assigned to hear the case, wrote a letter to the High Commercial Court urging it to decide on the appeal by the applicant of 10 November 2006 against the first-instance decision. He explained that otherwise he could not proceed in the case and comply with the Supreme Court's order of 17 May 2007 to give a decision in the applicant's case within six months.
On 31 December 2008 the  dismissed the applicant's appeal from 10 November 2006 in part and upheld the first-instance decision in respect of the first and the second respondent. It however quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case in respect of the third respondent. The case was returned to the  on 26 January 2009.
The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) against the second-instance judgment, which the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared inadmissible on 4 June 2009.
On 9 September 2009 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Supreme Court's decision. On 26 November 2009 the  declared applicant's complaint inadmissible.
Meanwhile, in the resumed proceedings following the 's decision on remittal of 31 December 2008, on 11 March 2009 the  delivered a judgment ruling against the applicant.
