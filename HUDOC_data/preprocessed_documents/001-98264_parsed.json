Thirdly,  ratified the Convention on 3 March 2004, meaning that the proceedings in question have been within the Court's competence ratione temporis for a period of almost five years. Fourthly, during this time, the domestic courts fined N.C. only once, without ever having collected this fine, misplaced the case file, and, most strikingly, took no substantive steps between 28 October 2004 and 2 October 2008. Fifthly, the bailiff in question was employed by the Municipal Court in Ni\u0161, which is why his inaction is attributable to the respondent State irrespective of whether his employment was subsequently terminated. Sixthly, it took the Serbian authorities more than two years to ascertain N.C.'s new address in , the applicant herself having apparently been afforded no contact with her child since September 2007. Lastly, it is noted that throughout the proceedings the applicant has done everything in her power to have the final access order enforced, whilst the domestic authorities have failed to make use of any coercive measures in spite of the clearly uncooperative attitude expressed by the other party, including N.C.'s apparent attempt to conceal his new place of residence between September 2007 and October 2009.\u00a0Notwithstanding the sensitivity of the impugned proceedings, as well as the fact that the applicant was able to see her child occasionally prior to September 2007, the Court concludes that the Serbian authorities did not act diligently or take sufficient steps to execute the final access order of 7\u00a0October 2002, as modified on 21 May 2003.\u00a0There has, consequently, been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

In this context, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who do not cohabit (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102).",

In particular, although the applicant had sporadic contact with her child until September 2007, and seemingly none thereafter, her access rights as specified in the final access order of 7 October 2002 and modified on 21\u00a0May 2003, were never properly enforced. The legitimate interest of the applicant to develop and sustain a bond with her child and his own long-term interest to the same effect were thus not duly considered (see, mutatis mutandis, G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v. Germany, no.\u00a074969/01, \u00a7\u00a046, 26\u00a0February 2004. Consequently, the Court concludes that the applicant has suffered a separate breach of the right to respect for her family life as guaranteed by Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, McMichael v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 24\u00a0February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, \u00a7\u00a091; see also Felbab v.
