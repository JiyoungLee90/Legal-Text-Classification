The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Istanbul. She was represented by Mr M. Erbil, a lawyer practising in Istanbul.
The Government were represented by their Agent.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 2 January 2008, in a press declaration, the applicant referred to the imprisoned leader of a terrorist organisation, namely the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan), as “Sayın”, meaning esteemed.
On 9 January 2008 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant before the Beyoğlu Magistrates’ Court in Criminal Matters for praising an offence or offender, proscribed by Article 215 of the Criminal Code.
On 15 July 2008 the Beyoğlu Magistrates’ Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced her to one month imprisonment. In accordance with Article 50 of the Criminal Code, the applicant’s prison sentence was converted into a fine. In the decision, it was stated that this decision was final.
Subsequently, the applicant’s lawyer filed for appeal.
On 12 September 2008 the Beyoğlu Magistrates’ Court dismissed the appeal request, holding that its decision of 15 July 2008 was final as the fine that had been imposed on the applicant did not reach the minimum value required for lodging an appeal with the Court of Cassation. The applicant did not file an objection against this decision.
Following a decision delivered by the Constitutional Court, which annulled Article 305 of the Criminal Procedure Code and made it possible to file an appeal for those who are in the same situation as the applicant, on 20 October 2009 the public prosecutor requested the Beyoğlu Magistrates’ Court to review the case and decide whether the suspension of the execution of the applicant’s sentence was required.
On 20 November 2009 the Beyoğlu Magistrates’ Court held that there was no need to suspend the execution of the applicant’s sentence. The public prosecutor filed an objection against this decision stating that the suspension of the execution of the applicant’s sentence would be the most favourable solution in the applicant’s case.
On 11 December 2009 the Beyoğlu Assize Court decided to suspend the execution of the applicant’s sentence.
