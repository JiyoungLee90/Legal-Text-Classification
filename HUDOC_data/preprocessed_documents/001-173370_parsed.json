Bulgaria, no. 46577/15, \u00a7\u00a075, 21\u00a0April 2016; see also, mutatis mutandis, Moskal, cited above, \u00a7\u00a073). It is true that where the correction of errors caused by State authorities results in an interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of the property, bona fide holders of such property enjoy particular protection (see Gladysheva v. Russia, no.\u00a07097/10, \u00a7 80, 6\u00a0December\u00a02011 and the caselaw cited therein). Nevertheless, if there is a mechanism which allows any claimant, whether bona fide or mala fide, to claim reimbursement of sums paid under the purchase contract, that mechanism should be effective (compare and contrast with Bucia\u015f v. Romania, no. 32185/04, \u00a7 43, 1\u00a0July 2014).",

On the basis of the terms of the purchase contracts (see paragraphs 21-22 above) and noting the general legal provisions of the Civil Law for claiming damages (see to that effect, for example, Zavoloka v. Latvia, no. 58447/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015-19, 7\u00a0July 2009), the Court considers that the applicants could have sought damages from the persons who had sold them the contested property.",

Moreover, this situation should be distinguished from those cases in which a requirement to bring separate compensation proceedings against former owners was considered too formalistic and excessive burden in circumstances where the buyers and the seller had acted in good faith (contrast, for example, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081) or where the compensation mechanism had been either exhausted or devoid of effectiveness (see, mutatis mutandis, B.K.M.
