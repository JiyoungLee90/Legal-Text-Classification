In its conclusions the court emphasised E.\u2019s behaviour, as it transpired from the video recordings, and the statements of Drs S. and H., who had examined her, and of another doctor who had treated her.

Having regard to the fact that also other evidence in addition to [E.\u2019s] account has been presented, the Court of Appeal finds that the above-mentioned procedural error cannot lead to the dismissal of the charge. Taking into account the legal protection of the child and her state of health as well as the fact that she had already been undergoing treatment for a long time, it would not have been reasonable to follow the adversarial procedure at a later stage. Naturally, the child\u2019s account and her behaviour, as they transpire from the video recordings, must be taken with circumspection when assessing the evidence.

The aim of those examinations, which had been recorded on videotape, had been to establish whether E. had been sexually abused or not. The doctors had concluded that such abuse had taken place. The guarantees of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms had not come into play until the commencement of the pre-trial investigation, which had aimed to establish the suspect. By the time the pre-trial investigation was initiated, E.\u2019s therapy had already begun. Thus, she had not been interviewed anew by the police. Accordingly, neither the police nor the prosecutor had had a better opportunity than the applicant to put questions to E. Moreover, E. had only been 3-4 years old at the time which had justified, in terms of receiving evidence, lending more weight to the medical examinations than to the investigative measures in criminal proceedings. The Government further pointed out that, prior to the pre-trial investigation, Dr S. had given the applicant an opportunity to request additional examinations.",

As the hospital staff had promised that a meeting between him and E. would be arranged, he had had no reason to request any further examination of the child at that point. Moreover, he would not have been able to present all the relevant questions due to the lack of access to E.\u2019s medical reports. Nor did he have any knowledge of the fact that E. had referred to several possible suspects until he had seen the video recordings of her medical examinations. When the applicant had finally been given access to E.\u2019s medical file, he had learned that there had been no physical evidence whatsoever in support of the alleged sexual abuse. The fact that neither the police nor the prosecutor had been able to question the child was not relevant, as E.\u2019s account, recorded on videotape, had been used as evidence against him in court.

As a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3\u00a0(d) of Article 6 cannot be interpreted as requiring in all cases that questions be put directly by the accused or his lawyer, whether by means of cross-examination or by any other means, but rather that the accused must be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see W.S. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055 with further references). The statement of a witness does not always have to be made in court and in public if it is to be admitted as evidence; in particular, this may prove impossible in certain cases (see Asch v. Austria, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 203).

However, the doctors\u2019 testimonies, as well as those given by the three other witnesses relied on by the court, were only indirect evidence, as none of the persons giving testimony had witnessed the alleged acts. Those witnesses were only able to give an account of what E. had told them and of their observations of her behaviour. The three medical experts were also able to testify on the credibility of E.\u2019s account. As to the recordings of E.\u2019s examinations, the court did not only have regard to E.\u2019s behaviour, but also to her account of the alleged events.

The applicant had not indicated, at that point, that he wished to have any further examinations conducted (see paragraph 23 above). In response to the Government\u2019s argument, the applicant pointed out that the hospital staff had earlier promised that he would be given an opportunity to meet E. in person and he had thus not had any reason to request further examination of E. at that point. Nor would he have been able to present all the relevant questions to E. at that stage, as he had not been given access to any of her medical reports containing information about the alleged events (see paragraph 37 above).",

Finland (no. 17122/02, \u00a7\u00a044-45, 24\u00a0April\u00a02007), where the defence had been afforded, but turned down, a possibility to have questions put to the child complainant. The Court would also stress the fact that the feedback discussion with Dr S. had taken place outside the sphere of the formal pre-trial investigation and thus without the legal guarantees of respect for the rights of the defence. Nor can the Court disregard the applicant\u2019s view in that he would not have been able to exercise his right to put questions to the child in full as he was not, at that point, made fully aware of the findings of the doctors who had examined her, as they transpired from the medical reports. Although the applicant was later given full access to E.\u2019s medical file, and he was able to make use of her medical reports in his defence before the trial courts, this was not done at a stage where it would have proved useful.",

The Court has accepted in similar cases against Finland that in view of the apparent absence of cases where counsel for the defence has successfully requested the cross-examination of young child complainants, the applicant could not have obtained the appearance of the children in person before the courts (see W. v. Finland, \u00a7\u00a046, and A.H. v. Finland, \u00a7 43, both cited above). In this case, the child complainant was even younger than in those cases, in fact, only 3-4 years old at the time of the court proceedings. It must also be taken into account that the pre-trial investigation had not even begun before E. started receiving therapy. It is undisputed that from that point on, questioning E. would not have been useful in terms of receiving evidence. This view was even expressed in the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning. Indeed, the defect in the proceedings as to the applicant\u2019s right to put questions to E. prior to the trial was specifically acknowledged by the courts (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above). It can thus be regarded as understandable that the applicant did not, in those circumstances, ask that E. be heard during the criminal proceedings, as it hardly would have benefited his defence.",

Yet, no measures to facilitate the applicant\u2019s attempts to build a proper defence were taken. In the circumstances of this case, the Court cannot subscribe to the Government\u2019s view that the guarantees of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms only came into play when the pre-trial investigation against the applicant began, especially having regard to the fact that the most important part of the evidence against the applicant was collected before that stage. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the police and the prosecutor were afforded no better opportunity than the applicant to put questions to E., the Court does not consider it sufficient for a finding that the applicant was not put in a disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis the other party (see W.S. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a063). Regard should also be had, in this connection, to the fact that E.\u2019s mother, as the child\u2019s representative, apparently had access to the totality of E.\u2019s medical file throughout the proceedings.",

The recording also enabled them to observe the manner in which the examinations were conducted and to assess for themselves, at least to a certain degree, the credibility of E.\u2019s account. It was open to the applicant to contest and comment on the evidence produced before the trial courts. While the Court acknowledges the significance of such a recording as evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Bocos-Cuesta v. the , no.\u00a054789/00, \u00a7\u00a071, 10 November 2005; W.S. v.

Finland, \u00a7\u00a041, cited above). Although the Court is satisfied that, in the present case, the Court of Appeal made a careful assessment of the evidence as a whole, the fact remains that the applicant was never afforded an effective opportunity to contest E.\u2019s account.",

In the circumstances of this case, however, the use of the child\u2019s videotaped account as essential evidence, without an adequate and timely opportunity to put questions to the child on the basis of sufficient background information, involved such limitations on the rights of the defence that the applicant cannot be said to have received a fair trial.
