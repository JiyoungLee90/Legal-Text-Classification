The case originated in an application (no. 29908/05) against the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, lodged with the Court, under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), by, at that time, a citizen of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr Živan Simić (“the applicant”), on 1 August 2005.
As of 3 June 2006, following the Montenegrin declaration of independence,  remained the sole respondent in the proceedings before the Court.
The applicant was represented by Mr R. Spasojević, a lawyer practising in Valjevo. The Government of the State Union of Serbia and  and, subsequently, the Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 15 March 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Valjevo.
On 24 July 1998 and 16 November 1998 the applicant filed two separate claims against his employer with the Municipal Court in Valjevo (“the Municipal Court”), seeking revocation of his suspension from work as well as reinstatement and salary arrears, respectively.
On 9 April 1999 the two sets of proceedings were joined.
Following a remittal, on 14 March 2006 the Municipal Court ruled against the applicant.
On 29 March 2007 and 3 April 2008 the District Court and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld the decision of 14 March 2006.
Article 122 § 3 provided that all employment-related disputes were to be resolved by the courts within a period of 6 months from the date of institution of the proceedings.
This Act entered into force on 23 March 2005 and thereby repealed the Labour Act 2001.
The text of Article 195 § 3 of the Labour Act 2005 corresponds to Article 122 § 3 of the Labour Act 2001.
