In their view, it should be acceptable in a democratic society to confer such privileges and immunities on the head of State. Nevertheless, they considered that the immunity enjoyed by a president should be narrower than that enjoyed by MPs. A president\u2019s functions were different from those of MPs. Unlike the latter, a president is not called upon to participate in adversarial debates in the exercise of his functions. Moreover, unlike the parliamentary opposition, he does not run the risk of undue interference with his freedom of expression. His tasks as enumerated in the Constitution differ from those of an MP, and in exercising them he is required to display balanced and respectful behaviour. Another reason for a president to have narrower immunity is, in the applicant\u2019s view, the fact that unlike MPs, he is not elected by the people, but is a figure of compromise elected by Parliament.",

In that connection the Court has already had occasion to develop criteria in its case-law providing an answer to this question, namely, the test of \u201cclarity\u201d of judgments, according to which a judicial act can be considered sufficiently reasoned if the parties can understand the reasons on which the judicial act is based, so as to be able to present their counter-arguments in the higher courts (see, for instance, Hadjianastassiou v.
