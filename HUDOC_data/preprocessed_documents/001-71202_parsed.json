The secondary role of the applicants in these proceedings is further demonstrated by the fact that they, unlike the prosecution, had no right of appeal against the court\u2019s decisions to remit the case for further investigation (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, on both occasions, once the Kyiv City Court quashed the decisions to reinstitute the investigation in the case, the case-file was remitted to the trial court with considerable delays.

This pattern was followed in subsequent cases, where the duration of an obligation not to leave one\u2019s place of residence varied from 13 years 6 months (see Goffi v.
