Turkey, no.\u00a015259/02, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, 12 April 2005, in respect of the second objection). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned applications. It therefore rejects the Government\u2019s objections under these heads. As to the third objection concerning Article 141 of the New Criminal Procedure Code, the Court observes that this provision provides for the possibility of compensation for those who were kept in pre-trial detention for a long time. As the present application concerns the length of the criminal proceedings, the Government\u2019s objection cannot be upheld.",

It thus lasted thirteen years and eight months at one level of jurisdiction. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case and the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v.

The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, the Court considers that the applicant must have suffered non-pecuniary damage, such as distress and frustration, on account of the duration of the proceedings, which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation alone. Taking into account the circumstances of the present case, and ruling on a equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 12,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",
