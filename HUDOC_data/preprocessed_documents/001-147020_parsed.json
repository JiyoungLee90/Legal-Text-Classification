The Court observes that at the time of the events in question, Russian legislation apparently did not provide for a medical examination of detained persons from the very outset of the prevention of liberty (see paragraph 50 above). In cases of this kind, however, the medical examination of an arrested person prior to being placed in police custody is important for several reasons as the CPT has stressed (see paragraph 48 above). It not only ensures that the person is fit to be questioned in police custody but also enables a respondent Government to discharge the burden of providing a plausible explanation for any injuries found (see Carabulea v. Romania, no.\u00a045661/99, \u00a7 112, 13\u00a0July 2010).",

The Court observes that the applicant was apprehended following a hot pursuit and that he was armed with a handgun, so stopping and disarming him might have required the use of at least some physical force. However, given the character of the injuries (multiple traumatic lesions, grazes and bruises, inter alia, in the form a strip of bruising, see paragraphs 13, 15 and 24), they are unlikely to have been inflicted in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s apprehension by private individuals, as presented by them (see paragraphs 11 and 33). The investigating authorities did nothing to verify the allegations of those individuals or to determine the cause of the applicant\u2019s injuries. In the absence of any explanations from the Government in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Sherstobitov v. Russia, no. 16266/03, \u00a7 78, 10 June 2010) and in view of the national authorities\u2019 failure to conduct a medical examination immediately after the applicant\u2019s arrest (see Mammadov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 34445/04, \u00a7 65, 11 January 2007; Korobov v.

He gave a detailed account of the treatment he had suffered, and medical evidence corroborates his account. The Court is mindful of the fact that on 21\u00a0March 2002 the doctor \u2013 apparently citing the applicant\u2019s or the police officers\u2019 explanations \u2013 indicated in his medical file that the applicant had been beaten up by unknown persons at about 11\u00a0a.m. on 20\u00a0March 2002, namely before his arrival at the Lefortovo police station at about 12 noon (see paragraphs 7 and 24 above). The Court notes that the evidentiary value of that entry in the applicant\u2019s medical file is rather low. It was not a conclusion made by the doctor on the basis of a medical expert examination, but information received from an unspecified source (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). The doctor was never interviewed by the authorities in the course of the inquiry into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment.

Thus, it appears that the officer in charge of the inquiry never questioned the applicant in respect of his ill-treatment complaint. The medical documents attesting to the applicant\u2019s injuries were not mentioned in the first decisions, so the investigator concluded that there was no case to answer (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). Even in the decision where those documents were mentioned, no explanation was provided as to the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries and the court limited its review to concluding that there had been no \u201cconvincing, objective or sufficient proof\u201d confirming the applicant\u2019s account (see the decision of 6 February 2006 by the Basmanny District Court, paragraph 27 above). No face-to-face confrontation between the applicant and the police officers allegedly involved in the ill-treatment took place. It appears that there was no attempt to identify and inspect the premises where the applicant had allegedly been ill-treated. Nor did the authorities try to find and question individuals who might have had useful information about the applicant\u2019s state of health upon his arrival at the Lefortovo police station on 20 March 2002 and thereafter, in particular, the police officers who had arrested him, the police officers who had escorted him to the station after his arrest, the attesting witnesses present at his personal search on admission to the police station (see paragraph 18 above), the doctor who had examined him at Moscow hospital no. 111 on 21\u00a0March 2002 (see paragraph 13 above) and individuals who had been detained with him in the police station between 20\u00a0and 22 March 2002.",

The police officers involved in questioning the applicant at the Lefortovo police station in March 2002 were not questioned by the investigating authorities until September 2004, after the remittal of the case for re-examination. By that time, Mr R., one of the officers allegedly involved in the ill-treatment, no longer worked in the police and his whereabouts were unknown. The expert report on the applicant\u2019s medical file was not drawn up until 16 February 2005, almost three years after the alleged ill-treatment. The expert was no longer able to determine the exact time when the injuries had been sustained (see paragraph 24 above).

Confirmation of the applicant\u2019s story about the beatings would have undermined the position of the prosecution in the court and reduced their chances of establishing the applicant\u2019s criminal liability. Furthermore, some of the tasks within the investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations were entrusted to the police officers of the same Lefortovo police station where the applicant had allegedly been beaten (see the decision of 7 October 2004 by the Lefortovo deputy prosecutor, paragraph 22 above).",
