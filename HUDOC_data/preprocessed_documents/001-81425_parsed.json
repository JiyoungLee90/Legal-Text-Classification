However, the Court is ill-equipped to engage in, or verify, the valuation of residential property across ; nor indeed would it be appropriate for the Court to do so, given that the applicant was free to choose his place of residence. The Court notes in addition that the judgment awarded a fixed amount which was not based on any price per square metre. Consequently, the Court cannot accept the applicant's claim in respect of pecuniary damage based on a price per square metre. Having regard to the refinancing rates determined by the Central Bank of Russia over the period of the non-enforcement, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,400 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount, and dismisses the remainder of his claims for pecuniary damage.",
