It recalls that the adequacy of the compensation would be diminished if it were to be paid without reference to various circumstances liable to reduce its value, such as an extended delay in enforcement (see Gizzatova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 5124/03, \u00a7\u00a028, 13 January 2005; Metaxas v. , no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 27 May 2004).
