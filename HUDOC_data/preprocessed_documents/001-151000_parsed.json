The tax authorities can decide not to impose a tax surcharge. If they have not reported the matter to the police, a tax surcharge can be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision. If the tax authorities have imposed tax surcharges, they can no longer report the same matter to the police unless, after imposing the tax surcharges, they have received evidence of new or recently revealed facts.

Finland (cited above). In that case the Court found that, regarding the first criterion, it was apparent that the tax surcharges were not classified as criminal but as part of the fiscal regime. This was, however, not decisive but the second criterion, the nature of the offence, was more important. The Court observed that the tax surcharges were imposed by general legal provisions applying to taxpayers generally. Further, under Finnish law, the tax surcharges were not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage but as a punishment to deter reoffending. The surcharges were thus imposed by a rule, the purpose of which was deterrent and punitive. The Court considered that this established the criminal nature of the offence. Regarding the third Engel criterion, the minor nature of the penalty did not remove the matter from the scope of Article 6. Hence, Article 6 applied under its criminal head, notwithstanding the minor nature of the tax surcharge (see Jussila v. Finland [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38). Consequently, proceedings involving tax surcharges are \u201ccriminal\u201d also for the purpose of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7.",

Russia [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-84, ECHR 2009) the existence of several approaches to the question of whether the offences for which an applicant was prosecuted were the same. The Court presented an overview of the existing three different approaches to this question. It found that the existence of a variety of approaches engendered legal uncertainty incompatible with the fundamental right not to be prosecuted twice for the same offence. It was against this background that the Court provided in that case a harmonised interpretation of the notion of the \u201csame offence\u201d for the purposes of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7. In the Zolotukhin case the Court thus found that an approach which emphasised the legal characterisation of the two offences was too restrictive on the rights of the individual. If the Court limited itself to finding that a person was prosecuted for offences having a different legal classification, it risked undermining the guarantee enshrined in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 rather than rendering it practical and effective as required by the Convention. Accordingly, the Court took the view that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 had to be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second \u201coffence\u201d in so far as it arose from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same. It was therefore important to focus on those facts which constituted a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked together in time and space, the existence of which had to be demonstrated in order to secure a conviction or institute criminal proceedings.",

Sweden (dec.), cited above; Carlberg v. Sweden, no. 9631/04, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 27 January 2009; and Dev v. Sweden (dec.), \u00a7 51, no. 7362/10, 21 October 2014) that the obligation of a businessperson to enter correct figures in the books is an obligation per se, which is not dependent on the use of book-keeping material for the determination of tax liability. In other words, an applicant, while not having fulfilled the legal book-keeping requirements, can later have complied with the duty to supply the tax authority with sufficient and accurate information by, for instance, correcting the information contained in the books or by submitting other material which can adequately form the basis of a tax assessment. An accounting offence is therefore sufficiently separate from the tax surcharge proceedings to conclude that these proceedings did not arise from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same. Similarly, as far as the charges against the applicant concerned his actions as a representative of the company, the impugned proceedings did not arise from identical facts or facts which were substantially the same because the legal entities involved were different (see Isaksen v. Norway (dec.), no. 13596/02, 2 October 2003; and Pirttim\u00e4ki v. Finland, no. 35232/11, \u00a7 51, 20 May 2014).",

As the tax surcharge proceedings did not concern at all the tax years 2000 and 2001, the impugned proceedings did not arise from identical facts as far as these tax years are concerned. Moreover, the Court notes that the Supreme Court dismissed the charge of aggravated tax fraud without examining the merits as far as the charge concerned the tax year 2002.

According to the Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 7, which itself refers back to the European Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments, a \u201cdecision is final \u2018if, according to the traditional expression, it has acquired the force of res judicata. This is the case when it is irrevocable, that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time-limit to expire without availing themselves of them\u2019\u201d. This approach is well entrenched in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Nikitin v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2004VIII; and Horciag v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a0, 15 March 2005).",

However, under the Finnish system the criminal and the administrative sanctions are imposed by different authorities without the proceedings being in any way connected: both sets of proceedings follow their own separate course and become final independently from each other. Moreover, neither of the outcomes of the proceedings is taken into consideration by the other court or authority in determining the severity of the sanction, nor is there any other interaction between the relevant authorities. More importantly, the tax surcharges are imposed under the Finnish system following an examination of an applicant\u2019s conduct and his or her liability under the relevant tax legislation which is independent from the assessments made in the criminal proceedings. This contrasts with the Court\u2019s earlier cases R.T. and Nilsson relating to driving licences, where the decision on withdrawal of the licence was directly based on an expected or final conviction for a traffic offence and thus did not contain a separate examination of the offence or conduct at issue. Therefore, it cannot be said that, under the Finnish system, there is a close connection, in substance and in time, between the criminal and the taxation proceedings.",

At that time the applicant\u2019s taxation case was no longer pending before any domestic authority or court, but simply awaited the time-limit for rectification and appeal to elapse in order to gain legal force. After 27 February 2012 the only way of preventing double jeopardy would therefore have been for the applicant to lodge first an application for rectification and then an appeal against the taxation decision concerning the tax year 2006 (see H\u00e4kk\u00e4 v. Finland, no. 758/11, \u00a7 52, 20 May 2014). As no such application or appeal was apparently lodged, the taxation decision concerning the tax year 2006 became final on 31 December 2012.
