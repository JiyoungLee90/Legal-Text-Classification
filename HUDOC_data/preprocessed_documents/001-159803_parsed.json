It examined the log book of the military unit for the period between 14 and 16 December 1999, but found no record of the seizure of the applicant\u2019s truck. The court heard evidence from two servicemen who had served in unit no. 3702 at the relevant time and who denied the presence of any alien truck in the base of the unit. On this basis, the court doubted the veracity of the information contained in the letter from Major-General V. (see paragraph 9 above) which stated that the truck was being kept at the base of military unit no.\u00a03702. It noted that the letter had not referred to the sources of such information and that, in any event, the ownership of the truck in question remained unclear at that time. The court declined to calculate the amount of damages on the basis of the evaluation report of 27 April 2000 because the commission consisting of the local council representatives had had no special knowledge or expertise enabling it accurately to assess the damage inflicted. The court examined the case with reference to Articles 1069 and 1070 of the Russian Civil Code (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below). Under those provisions, damage caused by an unlawful act or a failure to act on the part of the State or municipal bodies, or their officials, is to be compensated at the expense of the federal, regional or municipal treasury, as appropriate. The court thus concluded that military unit no.\u00a03702 was not the proper defendant in the case.",
