The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depends to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remains classified as secret and the decision to maintain the confidentiality is left within the powers of the current secret services, creates a situation in which the lustrated person\u2019s position is put at a clear disadvantage.",

In so far as the Government rely on the constitutional complaint, the Court points, firstly, to the fact that the Lustration Act had on several occasions been unsuccessfully challenged before the  (see Matyjek v.\u00a0 (dec.), cited above). Moreover, the Court has held that a constitutional complaint was an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention only in situations where the alleged violation of the Convention resulted from the direct application of a legal provision considered by the complainant to be unconstitutional (see, Szott-Medy\u0144ska v.

In this connection, the Court observes that the breach of the Convention complained of in the present case cannot be said to have originated from any single legal provision or even from a welldefined set of provisions. It rather resulted from the way in which the relevant laws were applied to the applicant\u2019s case and, in particular, Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, allowing the President of the Lustration Court to limit the applicant\u2019s access to the case file and his possibilities of taking notes and copying documents (see Bobek, cited above, \u00a7 73 and Luboch, cited above, \u00a7 71).
