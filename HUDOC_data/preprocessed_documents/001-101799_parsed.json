It is also mindful of the fact that the applicant filed three motions for remittal of the case to the prosecution, which further delayed the proceedings. However, it has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by the national law in the defence of his interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 66, Series A no.\u00a0319-A). Accordingly, a cumulative delay of ten months can be attributed to the applicant.",

On three occasions it took the trial court from three to six months to hold a first hearing; it also took seven months to examine the applicant\u2019s appeal of the conviction. The Court notes that the remittal of the case to the prosecutor to remedy the investigation defects further delayed the proceedings by four months. Finally, it is cognisant of the fact that it took seven months to conduct an accounting expert examination commissioned by the trial court. The Court concludes that an approximate delay of two years and four months is attributable to the authorities.",
