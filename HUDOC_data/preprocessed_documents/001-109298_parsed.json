They reached the addressees, because the defendant received the notification and was present at the hearing.

Nevertheless, the Court considers that in the interests of the administration of justice a litigant should be summoned to a court hearing in such a way as not only to have knowledge of the date and the place of the hearing, but also to have enough time to prepare his case and to attend the court hearing. A formal dispatch of a notification letter without any confidence that it will reach the applicant in good time cannot be considered by the Court as proper notification (see Gusak, \u00a7 27, cited above).",

Moreover, they did not submit any documents to demonstrate that the summons had, in fact, been sent to the applicants or their lawyer, such as copies of the summons, acknowledgments of receipt, envelopes bearing postmarks, a checklist of the case-file or any other record confirming the fact of actual dispatching of the notifications to the applicants or their representative (see, by contrast, Belan v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a056786/00, 2 September 2004, and Bogonos v. Russia, cited above). In these circumstances, the Court is unable to accept the Government\u2019s submission that the respondent party had been notified of the hearing as sufficient evidence of the applicants\u2019 notification of the examination of the case. Similarly, the fact that the decision of 6 October 2004 contained a new date of the hearing, taken alone, cannot be regarded as an appropriate notification. It is important to note in this respect that the applicants had not been present at the court on 6 October 2004 and that the case-file does not contain any information as to the date on which they had received a copy of the decision to adjourn the case taken on that date. Moreover, the Court observes that there is nothing in the text of the appeal judgment to suggest that the appeal court examined the question whether the applicants had been duly summoned, and, if they had not been, whether the examination of the appeal should have been adjourned. In fact, the court\u2019s reasoning in this respect was confined to a finding that the applicants had been apprised of the date of the examination of their case, without further details.",

In these circumstances the Court accepts the applicants\u2019 allegation that the domestic courts had failed in their duty to inform them of the appeal hearing. The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the other party took part in the appeal hearing and made oral submissions. The participation in the hearing enabled the other party to submit observations on the applicants\u2019 appeal submissions, which were not communicated to the applicants and to which they could not reply orally.",

Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s requests of 4 and 27\u00a0February 2009 to give her access to the file could not be granted. The Court accepts that the case file was necessary for the Government to prepare its observations on the admissibility and merits of the present application within the time-limit set out for this purpose. The Court notes, however, that the registry of the first instance court could have considered alternative means of transferring the information on the case which would have permitted to avoid any impediment to the applicant\u2019s representative\u2019s access to the documents, such as, for instance, sending photocopies of the case file by fax or mail. Nevertheless, the Court is satisfied that once the file was returned to the registry of the district court, the lawyer\u2019s new request for access to the file was granted without an undue delay. In fact, her new request to afford her an opportunity to study the case file lodged on 12 May 2009 was allowed two days later. She was able to study the case file, and the first applicant\u2019s representatives successfully submitted their observations on the admissibility and merits of the present application.",

However, having regard to the fact that the applicant\u2019s representative studied the case file on 18 May 2009 and was able to prepare and submit her observations within the time-limit set out for this purpose, the Court considers that there is an insufficient factual basis to consider that there has been any unjustified interference by State authorities with the first applicant\u2019s exercise of the right of petition in the proceedings before the Court in relation to the present application.",
