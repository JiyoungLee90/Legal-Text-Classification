Applying these principles to the remedy invoked by the Government, the Court points out at the outset that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of the individual case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], 16 September 1996, \u00a7 69, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV).",

In that case, the Court accepted that it would have been open to the applicants to challenge the participation of a specific judge, even though they did not know which judges of the Constitutional Court would deal with their case.

It is further noted that the constitutional appeal proceedings were held in camera and without the attendance of the parties. Indeed, the applicant company was informed in advance of the identity of the judge rapporteur in the case, but not of the other two judges who would sit (see paragraph 17 above). Accordingly, the Government did not claim that the applicant company had actual knowledge that judge M.K. would sit. Rather, they claimed that because the names of all judges of the Constitutional Court are publically available (see paragraph 23 above), as are the names of the judges who sit in the various panels, the applicant company should have found out that judge M.K. was entitled to sit, and should have made representations that she be excluded. In this connection, the Court points out that the publication of the composition of individual panels does not guarantee that a particular member will sit in each case decided by the panel in the period of several months for which the Constitutional Court\u2019s work schedule applies. Accordingly, each panel is assigned a substitute judge to act in place of an absent member of the panel. Thus, to accept the Government\u2019s argument would be to accept that the applicant company was required to challenge judge M.K. based on the likelihood, and not the certainty, that she would sit in its case. However, in the Court\u2019s opinion it would be excessive to require the applicant company to make such a challenge on essentially precautionary grounds in order to ensure its right to an impartial judge.",

Having regard to this and the judge\u2019s extensive experience, the applicant company was of the view that judge M.K.\u2019s failure to withdraw from the constitutional appeal proceedings had not been incidental, but the result of a conscious decision and showed that the judge was biased. Lastly, according to the applicant company, the question of whether judge M.K.\u2019s participation in the proceedings had affected the impartiality of the Constitutional Court panel in deciding its case and/or the lawfulness and regularity of the panel\u2019s decision was of little relevance, as it had in any event constituted a grave violation of the domestic procedural rules.",

Arguing that the present case was distinguishable from that of San Leonard Band Club v. Malta (no.\u00a077562/01, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2004IX), the Government pointed out that the employment dispute had twice been remitted for a new trial in which judge M.K. had not taken part. In deciding the constitutional appeal, the Constitutional Court had thus examined the decisions issued in an entirely new trial in which the courts had been free in their legal assessment. The prior involvement of judge M.K. at the appellate stage was therefore not sufficient reason to doubt the impartiality of the Constitutional Court that had later decided on the applicant company\u2019s constitutional appeal.",

On this basis, the applicant company stated that the judge\u2019s involvement in the constitutional appeal proceedings had been a conscious decision on her part, which showed her personal bias. However, the Court notes that almost eight years elapsed between judge M.K.\u2019s involvement in the proceedings in the capacity of a Higher Labour and Social Court judge and her later participation in the constitutional appeal proceedings. Having regard to the fact that the judge was not challenged by the applicant company and in the absence of any indication in the parties\u2019 observations that she remembered her prior involvement in the proceedings, the Court is unable to share the applicant company\u2019s position that she must have been aware of her earlier involvement in the proceedings. Moreover, it must be noted that the mere participation of judge M.K. in the administrative panel of the Constitutional Court deciding its case cannot be considered, in itself, to constitute sufficient proof of her personal bias (see, in this regard, Golubovi\u0107 v. , no. 43947/10, \u00a7 51, 27 November 2012, and the references cited therein).",

Judge M.K. had therefore already examined this question in her previous capacity of Higher Labour and Social Court judge and was accordingly well acquainted with the facts of the case; moreover, she had expressed her view on the matter. It should be further noted that it was precisely this view \u2013 namely, that disciplinary proceedings against N.N. were time-barred \u2013 that ultimately prevailed in the employment proceedings and was challenged before the Constitutional Court.",

Firstly, the applicant company complained that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see paragraph 18). This purely procedural issue obviously concerned only the last set of proceedings (which took place from 2006 to 2008), with which Judge M.K. had nothing to do. Her impartiality in respect of this issue is not in question.",

So, if the issue before Judge M.K. in 1999 was simply whether or not disciplinary proceedings against N.N. were time-barred based on the relevant legislation and the practice regarding its application, in 2008 she had to analyse a completely different legal issue, namely whether the labour courts\u2019 existing practice in respect of the limitation period for disciplinary proceedings was in conformity with the constitutional provision guaranteeing free economic initiative. Although it is true that judges must apply legislation in the light of constitutional principles, an issue of \u201cfree economic initiative\u201d was definitely not at stake before the labour court back in 1999.",

These conclusions do not correspond to the nature of the applicant company\u2019s constitutional complaint as described in paragraph 18. Moreover, they do not correspond to the very special place the Constitutional Court occupies in the legal system of the State concerned. Whilst the labour court judges could only resort to an interpretation of the legislation in question and remained bound to observe it, the Constitutional Court judges could declare it null and void.",
