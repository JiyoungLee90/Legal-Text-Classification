(no. 1), no. 34896/97, \u00a7 98, 5 December 2002, with further references). This is so with regard to the impartiality of the court under Article 6 \u00a7 1, as well as with regard to the presumption of innocence embodied in Article 6 \u00a7 2 (see Ninn-Hansen v. Denmark (dec.), no.\u00a028972/95, ECHR 1999V, and Anguelov v.  (dec.), no.\u00a045963/99, 14 December 2004). At the same time, the Court notes that press coverage of current events is an exercise of freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. If there is a virulent press campaign surrounding a trial, what is decisive is not the subjective apprehensions of the suspect concerning the impartiality required of the trial courts, however understandable, but whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, his fears can be held to be objectively justified (see Beggs v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15499/10, \u00a7 123, 16 October 2012).",

The applicant stood trial on charges of several counts of aggravated murder, robbery, theft, using forged documents and failure to report a crime, and therefore risked a term of imprisonment exceeding fifteen years. Article 51 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as interpreted by the , imposed the mandatory legal representation of defendants who faced criminal charges of that gravity. It was incumbent on the judicial authorities to appoint a lawyer for the applicant to ensure the effective enjoyment of his rights, irrespective of whether he had made a request to that effect (see paragraphs 21, 26 and 27 above). The Court notes that the applicant never unequivocally waived his defence rights. However, no attempt was made to appoint a lawyer or to adjourn the appeal hearing in order to ensure that a lawyer was present (see, for similar reasoning, Shulepov v. , no. 15435/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 38, 26 June 2008).",

Taking into account three factors \u2013 (a) the wide powers of the appellate courts in Russia, (b) the seriousness of the charges against the applicants and (c) the severity of the sentence which they had faced \u2013 the Court considered that the interests of justice demanded that, in order to receive a fair hearing, the applicants should have had legal representation at the appeal hearing. The Court therefore found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in these cases (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-39; and see also Potapov v.

The legal issues in the applicant\u2019s case were particularly complex, involving the determination of the constituent elements of a number of aggravated criminal offences, an assessment of the degree of liability of two co-defendants, including their level of personal culpability and the establishment of various mitigating and aggravating factors. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that the applicant was assisted by a lawyer when formulating the grounds for his appeal (see paragraph 14 above). It is therefore of the view that, without the services of a legal practitioner, he was not in a position to articulate the arguments raised in the appeal statement and could not competently address the court on the legal issues involved, and thus was unable to defend himself effectively. Moreover, the appellate court had wide powers in determining his appeal and its decision was final. Of even greater relevance is the fact that the applicant had been sentenced to twenty-three years\u2019 imprisonment. For the applicant therefore, the issue at stake was an extremely important one (see, for similar reasoning, Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 122, and Maxwell v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 38-41, Series A no. 300C).",
