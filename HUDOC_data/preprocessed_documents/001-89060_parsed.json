[GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 1999II). For the Court, it would be inconceivable that Article\u00a013 provided the right to have a remedy, and for it to be effective, without protecting the implementation of the remedies afforded. To hold the contrary would lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, by analogy, Hornsby v.

However, in the present case the Government\u2019s submissions in respect of the delays in complying with the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision cannot be accepted (see \u00a7 21 above) in view of the fact that the time-limit in question has so far been exceeded by more than three years. Therefore, the Government\u2019s justification cannot be considered decisive in the present case. In particular, as already found above (see paragraph 13 above), the compensation awarded to the applicants was too low and thus insufficient. While it is true that this factor alone does not normally render the remedy ineffective, the Court notes that in the present case it was reinforced by the failure of the competent court to execute the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision in a timely fashion; it being understood that the cessation of an ongoing violation is for the Court an important element of the right to an effective remedy (see, implicitly, Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074).",
