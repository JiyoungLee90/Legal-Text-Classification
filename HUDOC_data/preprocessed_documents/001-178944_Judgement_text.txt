The case originated in an application (no. 54135/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Ahmet Bilgiç (“the applicant”), on 30 November 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Aydın, a lawyer practising in Antalya. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the complaints concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on account of the applicant’s inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, and the alleged independence and impartiality of the tribunal because of the presence of two military officers sitting on the bench who did not enjoy the same judicial guarantees as the other military judges, were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1987 and lives in Bursa.
On 26 April 2006 the applicant was dismissed from the Air Force non-commissioned officer vocational high school due to non-compliance with admission pre-conditions. On 22 June 2006 the applicant brought an action before the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested the annulment of the dismissal decision.
On 23 May 2007 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request, taking into account the “secret documents” submitted by the Ministry of Defence. These documents were not disclosed to the applicant. This decision was served on the applicant on 5 June 2007.
