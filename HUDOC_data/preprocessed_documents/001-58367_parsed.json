In any event, in so far as the claim may concern damage of a pecuniary nature, the Court cannot speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings had a public hearing taken place before the Administrative Court; the claim must therefore be rejected. As to non-pecuniary damage, the Court recalls its conclusion in the Stallinger and Kuso case that the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction (op. cit. pp. 680-681, \u00a7 57). The Court is unable to find any features distinguishing the present case from that of Stallinger and Kuso which might justify a departure from the Court\u2019s approach in that judgment. Accordingly, it concludes that the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the applicants\u2019 alleged non-pecuniary damage.",
