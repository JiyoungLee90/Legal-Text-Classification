The aim was to elucidate the significance thereof and associated problems from a long-term perspective. Parents to a group of one hundred and fortyone preschool children volunteered to participate in the study, which was followed up every third year. Certain assurances were made to the children\u2019s parents and later to the young people themselves concerning confidentiality. The research papers, called the Gothenburg study, were voluminous and consisted of a large number of records, test results, interview replies, questionnaires and video and audio tapes. It contained a very large amount of privacy-sensitive data about the children and their relatives. Several doctoral theses have been based on the Gothenburg study. The material was stored by the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, of which the applicant was director. The project was originally set up and started by other researchers but the applicant had subsequently taken over the responsibility for completing the study.",

Concerning the issue of secrecy, the research applications can be summarised as follows: In the first application, it was stated that it would not be possible to identify individual children and that the research team did not intend to register any case records. In the first of the two applications submitted in 1984, it was stated that the project leader - being a medical doctor - was bound by professional secrecy and was to be responsible for the registers set up within the research project, that the registers were to be made non-personalised after the study had been carried out and that the results were to be presented in a way that would make it impossible to identify different individuals. Furthermore, if data registers were to be used, the Data Inspection Board\u2019s (Datainspektionen) instructions were to be followed. In an additional application from the same year, concerning inter alia the use of social registers, it was stated that it would not be possible to identify different individuals through the data processing that was to be carried out and that only the project leader was to have access to the identification code. The application from 1988 contains the same language as the application submitted in January 1984.",

The case was discussed within the University Board and subsequently by decision of 27 January 2004 the University of Gothenburg decided to refuse to grant access to K because in the light of a memorandum drawn up on 12 March 2003 by the Swedish Research Council there was no connection between K\u2019s research and the research project that she had specified before the Administrative Court of Appeal.

One of its main characteristics is the constitutional right for everyone to study and be informed of the contents of official documents held by the public authorities. This principle allows for the public and the media to exercise control of the State, the municipalities and other parts of the public sector which, in turn, contributes to the free exchange of opinions and ideas and to efficient and correct management of public administration and, thereby, to maintaining the legitimacy of the democratic system (see Govt. Bill 1975/76:160 p. 69 et seq.). The principle of public access to official documents is enshrined in Chapter 2, Sections 1 and 12, of the Freedom of the Press Act. Thus, every Swedish citizen shall be entitled to have free access to official documents, in order to encourage the free exchange of opinion and the availability of comprehensive information (Chapter 2, Section 1; foreign nationals enjoy the same rights in this respect as Swedish citizens, Chapter 14, Section 5).",

A document is \u201cdrawn up\u201d\u201d when it is dispatched by an authority. A document that is not dispatched is \u201cdrawn up\u201d when the matter to which it relates is finally settled by the authority in question. In case the document does not belong to any specific matter, it is \u201cdrawn up\u201d when it has been finally checked or otherwise received its final form. As research is considered to be an activity in its own right (faktiskt handlande) (see, for example, the Chancellor of Justice, 1986 p. 139), it cannot be said to belong to any specific matter. This means, in turn, that research material, as a rule, is \u201cdrawn up\u201d and thereby official, as soon as it has been finally checked or otherwise received its final form. It could be added that preliminary outlines, drafts, and similar documents enumerated in Chapter 2, Section 9, of the Freedom of the Press Act, are not deemed to be official unless they introduce new factual information or have been accepted for filing. Finally, there is no general requirement that a document be filed in order to be considered official, and registration does not affect the issue of whether a document is official or not (cf.

The provisions relate to prohibitions against disclosing information, irrespective of the manner of disclosure. The question of whether secrecy shall apply to information contained in an official document cannot be determined in advance, but shall be examined each time a request for access to a document is made. Decisive for this issue is whether making a document available could imply a certain risk of harm. The risk of harm is defined in different ways in the Secrecy Act having regard to the interests that the secrecy is intended to protect. Thus, the secrecy may be more or less strict depending on the interests involved. The secrecy legislation has been elaborated in this way in order to provide sufficient protection, for example, for the personal integrity of individuals, without the constitutional right of public access to official documents being circumscribed more than considered necessary. In the present case, the Administrative Court of Appeal, in its judgments of 6\u00a0February 2003, found that secrecy applied to the research material under Chapter 7, Sections 1, 4, 9 and 13, of the Secrecy Act (Chapter 7 deals with secrecy with regard to the protection of the personal circumstances of individuals).",

As an example of such a restriction, the preparatory notes mention a prohibition against disseminating the content of a document or against publishing secret information contained in a document (see Govt. Bill 1979/80:2, Part A, p. 349).

As mentioned above, there are specific requirements of speediness regarding the handling of such requests. A decision by an authority other than the Swedish Parliament or the Government to refuse access to a document is subject to appeal to the courts - as a general rule, an administrative court of appeal - and further to the Supreme Administrative Court (Chapter 2, Section 15, of the Freedom of the Press Act; Chapter 15, Section 7, of the Secrecy Act and Sections 33 and 35 of the 1971 Administrative Court Procedure Act (F\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen; SFS 1971:291), leave to appeal is required in the last mentioned court). Only the applicant has a right of appeal. Thus, if the Administrative Court of Appeal - contrary to the public authority holding the document in question - decides that a document shall be made available, its judgment may not be appealed against by the public authority in question, or private subjects who consider that harm would be inflicted on them as a consequence of the fact that access to the document is granted (see R\u00c5 2005 note 1 and R\u00c5 2005 ref. 88). The reason why the right of appeal has been narrowly limited is that once the competing interests have been considered by a court the legislator has given priority to the principle of public access to official documents over other private and public interests (see, for example, Govt. Bill 1975/76:160 p. 203 and R\u00c5 2003 ref. 18, which concerned the applicant\u2019s request for relief for substantive defects).",

It is their particular duty to ensure that courts and administrative authorities observe the provisions of the Constitution regarding objectivity and impartiality and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens are not encroached upon in the process of public administration. An Ombudsman exercises supervision either on complaint from individuals or of his or her own motion by carrying out inspections and other investigations which he or she deems necessary. The examination of a matter is concluded by a decision in which the Ombudsman states his or her opinion on whether the measure of the authority contravenes the law or is otherwise wrongful or inappropriate. The Ombudsmen may also make pronouncements aimed at promoting uniform and proper application of the law. An Ombudsman\u2019s decisions are considered to be expressions of his or her own personal opinion. They are not legally binding upon the authorities. However, they are of persuasive force, command respect and are usually followed in practice. An Ombudsman may, among many other things, institute criminal proceedings against an official who has committed an offence by departing from the obligations incumbent on him or her in his or her official duties (for example, as in the present case, misuse of office).

In these circumstances, in the Court\u2019s view, it has not been shown that, at the time of the applicant\u2019s lodging the present application, there existed a remedy which was able to afford redress in respect of the violations alleged by the applicant (see also Bladh v.

Leaving open the question of whether the applicant could have been obliged to institute domestic compensation proceedings after the date of introduction, the Court notes, again, that the underlying issues in the cases mentioned by the Government were different to the ones raised in the present case. While the Court welcomes the development in Swedish law concerning the possibility to claim compensation on the basis of alleged violations of the Convention, it must be kept in mind that this development is a rather recent one. Consequently, it cannot generally be required of an individual applicant to pursue a compensation claim in respect of Convention issues that have not been determined by the domestic courts or are not closely related to issues that have been so determined. The reason for this is that, in many of these cases, the existence of the remedy cannot yet be considered as sufficiently certain. This consideration is even more important in a situation where the decisions allegedly establishing the remedy were issued after the introduction of the application before the Court.",

The researchers had promised confidentiality of the information collected about the individuals concerned. There is no question that the promise of confidentiality is essential for the purposes of medical, social and behavioural studies. It is only with this guarantee that researchers can expect research subjects to submit the most accurate data. In other words, if science is to make progress in areas that are important for human beings, the confidentiality and protection of research data is of key importance. Admittedly, the protection of research data for the advancement of science is another legitimate aim to be protected. However, the two aims are closely linked: the first sets the limits on the second. It has been repeatedly emphasised within the framework of professional debate and the World Health Organization in particular that \u201cAdvancement of medical knowledge depends, to a large extent, on expansion of research involving experimentation on human subjects. [However] it is not acceptable that the respect of the individuals be compromised in the pursuit of benefits that may accrue to science and society. ...The principle of respect implies that participation in the research should be completely voluntary and based on informed consent. Where research involves collection of data on individuals, privacy should be protected by ensuring confidentiality\u201d (see http://whqlibdoc.who.int/emro/2004/9290213639_chap2.pdf visited on 18\u00a0October 2010).",

Therefore, the arguments advanced by the applicant in the criminal proceedings \u2013 namely, that his behaviour had been dictated by both medical and research ethics and the Convention \u2013 ought to have been examined in much more detail then the court actually did (paragraph 33). Likewise, the arguments advanced by the applicant to the effect that the promise of confidentiality given to the children and their families and the importance of upholding the value of confidentiality for the future of research in Sweden, which form the core of the professional debate on how to carry out medical research in compliance with human rights (see World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki\u00a0\u2013 Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, as last amended in October 2008), were dismissed in two short paragraphs by the Court of Appeal.",

Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.\u201d The approach in the field of medical research is not to maintain secrecy. On the contrary, it is recognised that public debate about research results is important for quality, transparency and various other reasons. There is a duty to make public the results of research irrespective of whether the outcome has been positive or negative. However, this has to be balanced against the principle of confidentiality as it applies to research subjects (see point 2 above). The question arises whether the system, as developed in  over a long period of implementing the principle of public access to official documents (see paragraphs 35-41) is adapted to the modern challenges of medical research and the right of privacy in its various forms in this context. The main aspects of this issue had to be debated within the framework of administrative proceedings which fall outside the Court\u2019s competence. It is, in our view, misleading, however, to think that these questions are irrelevant in criminal proceedings (see point 3 above).",

The national courts and the European Court of Human Rights should bear this in mind and accordingly be prepared to balance all the arguments. In our view, the Swedish courts, in adjudicating the criminal charges against the applicant, were too formalistic and, in a sense, self-righteous. Of course, the State has every right and obligation to see to it that order is maintained and that court judgments are complied with. We agree that the State had to make sure that the applicant complied with the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal, even if we have a number of questions regarding this judgment (see point 4 above). However, in the criminal proceedings the national courts should have had regard to the major chilling effect that an imposition of a criminal sentence on a researcher and the subsequent criminal record will have. A criminal sentence is clearly disproportionate in view of the important interests involved, even if balanced against the fundamental principle of access to information as regulated in . Surely, the State would want to promote medical science both in the interests of the population and also for reasons of competition and economic development. Surely,  would want to be among those States which promote medical research in compliance with the human rights of those individuals who agree to participate in such research and with respect for the researchers.
