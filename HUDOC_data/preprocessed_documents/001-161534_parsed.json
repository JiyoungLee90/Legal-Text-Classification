The existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. Indeed, the particular importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court\u2019s view, that the States Parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention (see Vladimir Romanov v.

The Court observes, however, that it has previously dismissed that legal avenue as ineffective for an application for early release, because the Government had been unable to provide examples of domestic case-law demonstrating the practical effectiveness of that remedy (see Semikhvostov v. Russia, no. 2689/12, \u00a7\u00a067, 6\u00a0February\u00a02014). In the present case, the Government have also failed to explain how the new cassation procedure would work in respect of an inmate\u2019s complaint, particularly when it concerns specific problems of conditions of detention. The Court\u2019s doubts in this respect are strengthened by the refusal of the Russian courts at two instances to authorise the applicant\u2019s early release, referring merely to the gravity of the charges against him and the fact that he had served only a small part of his sentence (see paragraph 18 above). The Russian courts did not make any attempt to examine the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention or to assess whether they were compatible with his disability. The Court has already examined a list of other domestic legal avenues available in Russian law and practice and found that none of them constituted an effective remedy that could have been used to prevent the alleged violations or their continuation and to provide the applicant with adequate and sufficient redress in connection with the complaints of unsatisfactory conditions of detention (see Gorbulya v.

Accordingly, the respondent State had an obligation to ensure that an effective remedy was available to deal with the substance of his complaint. Taking into account the circumstances of the present case and the aforementioned case-law, the Court sees no reason to depart from its previous findings on the issue.

The very principle of so many detainees being held in the same dormitory has previously given rise to serious concern on the part of the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (\u201cthe CPT\u201d). Reporting on the conditions of detention in correctional facilities in Eastern Europe, the CPT found, in particular, that high-capacity dormitories frequently accommodated prisoners in extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions and inevitably entailed a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives (see Fetisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 43710/07, 6023/08, 11248/08, 27668/08, 31242/08 and 52133/08, \u00a7 137, 17 January 2012, and also the relevant extracts from the CPT reports cited in paragraph 29 above). In cases where the applicants were housed, together with dozens of other inmates, in a dormitory in which they had at their disposal only minimal personal space, the Court has held that the level of privacy available to them was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention (see Butko v. Russia, no. 32036/10, \u00a7 59, 12 November 2015; Yepishin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 591/07, \u00a7 65, 27 June 2013; Kulikov v.

Greece, no. 11463/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-66, 28 February 2012). Although the applicant shared his dormitory with fewer inmates than did the applicants in the aforementioned cases, their number was sufficient to cause him additional significant distress.",
