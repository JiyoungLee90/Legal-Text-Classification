Turkey, no.\u00a025657/94, \u00a7\u00a0282, ECHR 2001). Such proof may, however, follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7\u00a0161 18\u00a0January 1978, Series A no. 25). Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

The minimum standards as to effectiveness defined by the Court's case-law include the requirements that the investigation be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny, and that the competent authorities act with exemplary diligence and promptness (see, for example, \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a044093/98, \u00a7 55, 26 October 2004). In addition, the Court reiterates that the rights enshrined in the Convention are practical and effective, and not theoretical or illusory. Therefore, in such cases, an effective investigation must be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Orhan Kur v.

Firstly, the Court reaffirms that evidence obtained during forensic examinations plays a crucial role during investigations into detainees' allegations of ill-treatment (see Salmano\u011flu and Polatta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 15828/03, \u00a7 79, 17\u00a0March 2009). In this connection, the Court cannot but note that the medical reports established at the end of the applicant's detention in police custody lack detail and fall significantly short of the standards recommended by both the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), which are regularly taken into account by the Court in its examination of cases concerning ill-treatment (see, inter alia, Akko\u00e7 v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2000-X), and the guidelines set out in the Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u201cthe Istanbul Protocol\u201d, submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (see Bat\u0131 and Others, \u00a7\u00a0100, cited above). Moreover, although the  sought to obtain additional medical evidence, the time which elapsed between the alleged illtreatment and the date of these examinations (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above) adversely affected, in the Court's view, the possibility of establishing the origins of the applicant's arm injury. In this connection, it regrets the fact that it took the authorities more than four years to organise an EGM test for the applicant in order to ascertain the origins of his injury (see paragraph 7 above).",

Thirdly, in the course of his investigation the prosecutor appears to have failed to hear any police officers or potential eyewitnesses, such as other persons held in the same detention unit as the applicant.",
