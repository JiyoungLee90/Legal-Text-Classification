The reports of 11 January and 2 February 1996 do not refer to any sign of ill-treatment on the applicant\u2019s body, whereas the report of 21\u00a0February 2002 issued subsequent to the applicant\u2019s medical examination at the beginning of his detention in police custody does mention the existence of injuries. The report drawn up on 25 February 2002 \u2013 the date on which the applicant\u2019s second period of custody ended \u2013 only refers to one injury on his ear, which had already existed when the applicant had been taken into police custody (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above). The Government argued that the applicant had sustained the injuries noted in the reports of 21 and 25 February 2002 as a result of the use of proportionate force to effect his arrest. The applicant, on the other hand, neither complained about the force used during his arrest in his application nor challenged the Government\u2019s version of the facts in respect of his arrest. Given that the applicant alleged that he had been ill-treated only when he had been detained in police custody for questioning, the Court considers it unnecessary to examine the circumstances in which the applicant\u2019s arrest was effected (see Tonka and Others v. Turkey, no. 11381/02, \u00a7 49, 22\u00a0July 2008), and confines itself to the examination of the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment in police custody.",
