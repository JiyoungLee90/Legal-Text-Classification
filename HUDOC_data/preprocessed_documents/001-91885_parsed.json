Such action is not governed by statute per se but has emerged from case-law. An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it. When both the plaintiff and the defendant have a title deed, the court must compare the two\u00a0deeds and decide which one is preferred. The main outcome of such an action, if successful, is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant\u2019s title to the property, with retrospective effect, thus obliging the defendant to return the property. If physical restitution is no longer possible, that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum (see Str\u0103in and Others v. Romania, no.\u00a057001/00, \u00a7\u00a026, ECHR 2005VII).",
