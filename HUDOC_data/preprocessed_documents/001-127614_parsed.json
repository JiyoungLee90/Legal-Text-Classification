On 17 April 2008 he decided not to bring criminal proceedings against the police officers who had arrested the applicant. In his decision he explained that he had examined the video-recording of the applicant\u2019s arrest and concluded that the police officers had not used excessive force. He further observed that the medical reports drawn up on 22 and 23 March 2008, the first and last days of his time in police custody, and the subsequent report dated 25\u00a0March 2008, issued the first day of his pre-trial detention, revealed no signs of illtreatment on his body. Furthermore, although the applicant alleged that his arm had been broken, the X-rays did not show any fracture. The Hakkari public prosecutor also took into consideration that the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer during his interrogation on 23 March 2008, had not mentioned that he had been ill-treated or that his arm had been injured. Furthermore, he had been released that day and until his subsequent pre-trial detention on 25 March 2008 his parents had not complained of any illtreatment or noticed that the arm of their son had been fractured. The public prosecutor also referred to photographs and news articles published by several media organisations regarding the applicant\u2019s allegations of illtreatment. He noted that upon the instructions of the terrorist organisation, some of the media organisations had started a campaign against the security forces, alleging that a young person\u2019s arm had been fractured by the police. In this connection, the names and even the addresses of the officers who had arrested the applicant had been published and the incident was being used to create an uprising against the security forces. Furthermore, it also transpired that a bank account had been opened in the name of the applicant\u2019s family to which charitable donations had been made. The prosecutor\u2019s decision indicated that investigations into these events were pending. Lastly, he concluded that the applicant\u2019s allegations had been made to debase the police officers, and that there was no evidence in support of his claims.",

A medical report issued on 8 May 2008 mainly focused on his allegations of illtreatment during police custody and indicated that he had an oedema in his left ear and nose as well as effusion (swelling) on the right elbow resulting from trauma. He was also found to be suffering from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

To assess this evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see\u00a0Talat Tepe v. Turkey, no. 31247/96, \u00a7 48, 21 December 2004). Such proof may, however, follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Labita, cited above, \u00a7 121). The Court further emphasises that, in respect of a person who is placed under the control of the authorities, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7\u00a038, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0336). Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (ibid., \u00a7\u00a034, and see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

Since his claims regarding ill-treatment during police custody and subsequent pre-trial detention were never raised during the domestic proceedings, the Court will limit its examination to determining whether the force used during his arrest was strictly necessary and proportionate. In this connection, the Court reiterates that Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force in certain welldefined circumstances. However, such force may be used only if absolutely necessary and must not be excessive (see Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a029462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 66-78, ECHR 2000\u2011XII).",

In this connection, the Court observes that the medical reports dated 22 and 23 March 2008, taken on the first and last days of his time in police custody, did not reveal any signs of illtreatment on his body. The Court further notes that the applicant was released on 23 March 2008, and until his subsequent detention on 25\u00a0March stayed with his parents. During this time he did not seek medical attention or obtain a medical report regarding the injury to his arm. Furthermore, he underwent another medical examination on 25 March when he was admitted to prison, which again revealed no signs of injury on his body. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s parents filed a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor on 28 March, six days after his arrest on 22\u00a0March, and alleged that the applicant\u2019s arm had been broken by the police officers who had arrested him. He was then transferred to a hospital on the order of the prosecutor and the X-rays revealed no fracture to his arm. The only injuries found on the applicant\u2019s body were an old scar, measuring 2 x 1 cm on his vertex as a result of an earlier fall, and a scabbed wound of 2 x 1 cm on the second phalanx of his right hand index finger.",

While in the video footage the applicant is seen crying in the street and a plain-clothes police officer is seen twisting his arm behind his back, the Court considers that based on the medical reports, which revealed no signs of injury on the applicant\u2019s body on the first and last days of his time in police custody, the force used against the applicant did not attain the minimum level of severity to fall within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",

In this connection the video footage submitted by the parties, which the Court had the benefit of watching, shows that the applicant was scared and crying in the street and that a police officer was holding him by the right arm. The officer then forcefully twisted his arm behind his back, which forced the applicant to bend forward. It is clear that this act caused a lot of pain to the minor, who was not showing any resistance to the police. Moreover, on 31 March 2008 the prison doctor reported a minimal oedema on the applicant\u2019s right elbow resulting from a soft tissue injury, and noted the presence of healing wounds on the distal phalanges of his right hand ring and little fingers. The findings of this medical report confirm the force used against the applicant during his arrest.",

All these texts call for a child-friendly and sensitive approach to offenders or suspects who are minors and, particularly, for careful treatment of the special needs and particular vulnerability of minors by judges, prosecutors, police and other law-enforcement agents. For example, paragraph 27 of the European Guidelines on child-friendly justice states: \u201cPolice should respect the personal rights and dignity of all children and have regard to their vulnerability, that is, take account of their age and maturity and any special needs of those who may be under a physical or mental disability or have communication difficulties.\u201d",
