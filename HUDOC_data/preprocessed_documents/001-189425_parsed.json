It agrees that the Regional Court generally took all necessary action quickly and cannot be held accountable for substantial periods of inactivity. It furthermore notes that much of the delay was caused by the fact that the first expert fell ill and the second expert was overloaded with work. The Court reiterates that in cases in which cooperation with an expert proves necessary, it is the responsibility of the domestic courts to ensure that the proceedings are not excessively prolonged (see Ewald v. Germany, no. 2693/07, \u00a7 24, 21\u00a0October 2010, and Bozlar v. Germany, no. 7634/05, \u00a7 23, 5\u00a0March 2009). In this respect, the domestic court\u2019s conduct after the first expert had fallen ill cannot be categorised as unreasonable. The court directed the proceedings towards the appointment of a new expert at all times. However, the domestic court\u2019s conduct after the appointment of the second expert lacked the necessary degree of resolve, as was established by the domestic courts in the compensation proceedings. The Regional Court failed (taking into account the time that had elapsed between the introduction of the case in June 2007 and the assignment of the second expert in September 2009) to point out to the second expert that given the advanced stage of the proceedings, the ordered opinion should be prepared within an accelerated working process. The domestic court\u2019s requests of 28\u00a0May 2010 and\u00a010\u00a0August 2010 for progress reports were rather reluctant in that respect. In contrast, the domestic court\u2019s conduct after the first expert had been reappointed does not lack the necessary degree of resolve.",

As established above (see paragraph 32 above), these specific proceedings themselves do not form part of the proceedings at issue. In any event, the scope of the independent evidentiary proceedings and the subsequent main proceedings were not identical. Rather, the applicant herself submitted that the former had concerned defects in the drainage system, whereas the latter had in addition encompassed further defects. Against this background, the Court cannot but conclude that the independent evidentiary proceedings were not able to substantially simplify the subsequent main proceedings.",

In this context, the Court would like to add that those proceedings concerned pecuniary damages stemming from the purchase of a residential unit \u2013 that is to say not from facts comparable to those which the Court has deemed to be of particular importance in the past (compare D.E. v. Germany, no. 1126/05, \u00a7\u00a070, 16 July 2009, and Bozlar, cited above, \u00a7 24). As far as the applicant alleged that the specific defects of the residential unit had been of such a nature as to potentially cause harm to her and her family\u2019s health, the Court finds that the applicant did not substantiate this allegation. Lastly, the amount of the pecuniary damages claimed appears to have been far less than the original investment in the property. Hence, it cannot be said that the applicant\u2019s economic existence was at stake (see Gr\u00e4sser v. Germany, no.\u00a066491/01, \u00a7 57, 5 October 2006).",

The Court of Appeal took the conduct of the Regional Court as a starting point, assessed it in the light of its obligation to expedite proceedings, and then viewed it within the context of the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the question of what was at stake for the applicant. It concluded that the delays (where they related to the conduct of the Regional Court towards the second expert) were to a minor extent attributable to the respondent State; however, those delays (which amounted to a total of about a month) did not constitute an excessive length overall. The Court does not find any reason to depart from this conclusion of the domestic courts in the compensation proceedings.",
