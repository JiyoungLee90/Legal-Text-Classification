The fact that the fine, which Mr\u00a0P.\u2019s heirs were supposed to pay for the fraudulent tax evasion of the deceased, was reduced to 1/4 demonstrates that the tax authorities sought to lessen the punitive component of the fine while at the same time maintaining part of its more general deterrent features.",

It cannot be said that \u201c[t]he fact that no entry was made in the criminal records of the heirs was irrelevant, since in some cases (for example, for petty offences) no such entry was made even concerning those responsible\u201d (see paragraph\u00a038 of the judgment). It is more justified, however, to point to the fact that while the incorrectly declared income was significant and the imposed fine \u201cnot inconsiderable\u201d (see paragraph\u00a040 of the judgment) no entry was made in the criminal records of Mr\u00a0P.\u2019s heirs, thus excluding the assumption that the fine was criminal in character.",
