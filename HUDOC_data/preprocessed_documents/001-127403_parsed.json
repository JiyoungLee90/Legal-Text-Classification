If the compensation claim was not specified (as in the applicant\u2019s case), the courts were not required to advise the victims to pursue their compensation claim by means of a separate civil action for damages, but that option had remained at their discretion. Domestic practice suggested however that the courts made such instructions in any case. They further provided statistical information, according to which the courts issued criminal sanctions in 193 of the 745 defamation criminal cases brought between 2009 and 2011, and awarded compensation in only three.

In the present case, the applicant pressed criminal charges against B.T. and R.P., accusing them of defamation. In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that the applicant acted as a private prosecutor is of no relevance for the applicability of Article 6 to the proceedings in question. This is because the capacity in which the victim participates in criminal proceedings (as a direct or subsidiary complainant or merely as an injured party) plays no part in the applicability of Article 6 to the civil-party claim.",

It also observes that under section 98(2) of the Criminal Proceedings Act, as in force at the material time, a civil-party claim could be brought before the proceedings were concluded at first instance. No argument has been submitted that that rule did not concern the requirement to have the civil-party claim specified by the end of the trial. It is to be noted that the trial in the present case did not result in a decision on the merits, but was concluded because of the absolute limitation period. Furthermore, it appears that the trial court did not take any action with respect to the applicant\u2019s indemnity claim, as specified under the applicable legislation (see paragraph 35 above).",

The Court considers that the statistical information provided in this regard is insufficient to support that argument. It is unclear in how many defamation cases brought before the courts within the reference period the claimants had sought compensation. The applicant\u2019s compensation claim was based on the applicable law, which, in the Court\u2019s view, clearly established that the criminal courts could award civil damages. Accordingly, it was not unreasonable for the applicant to expect that the criminal courts would consider his compensation claim. The recently enacted Criminal Proceedings Act 2010 also provides for the possibility of victims of crime to seek civil redress in the criminal courts (see paragraph 39 above).",

That the identity of R.P. remained unknown can only be attributed to the trial court. In this connection the Court observes that it was not until 6 May 2005, more than two years and two months after the trial had started, that the court requested that the newspaper reveal the identity of the author of the article.

In the criminal complaint, he accused B.T., editor-in-chief of the newspaper and a certain R.P., the presumed author, of having published the article allegedly containing false allegations that he had stolen a tractor. It was based on sections 172 and 184 of the Criminal Code, as valid at the material time (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above). It is true that the applicant did not identify the author of the article. However, the trial court was aware of the identity of the editor-in-chief of the newspaper and it could have examined accordingly the case under section 26 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 above). The applicant also made a claim for financial reparation of the loss sustained as a result of the alleged defamation. Thus, he put to the domestic courts, in accordance with domestic law, the substance of his subsequent complaint to the Court. The remedy pursued by the applicant could have given rise to a declaration that the article was defamatory. It could have also eventually led to an award of compensation. The relevant domestic practice confirmed the availability and, to some extent, the effectiveness of the criminal avenue of redress (see paragraph 54 above). In such circumstances, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant could not have legitimately expected that the criminal-law remedy would not be an effective one. The Court considers therefore that the applicant was not required to make before the civil courts a separate, additional request for compensation, which could also have given rise to a finding that the article was damaging to his rights under Article 8 (see Karak\u00f3 v. Hungary, no. 39311/05, \u00a7 14, 28 April 2009). The option to seek monetary or other compensation in the civil courts after the criminal proceedings had been stayed was at the applicant\u2019s discretion (see paragraph 54 above), and it cannot be interpreted as an exhaustion requirement.",

The Court takes note of the fact that the respondent State decriminalised the defamation (see paragraphs 29, 42 and 75 above).

In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private and family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see White v. Sweden, no. 42435/02, \u00a7 20, 19\u00a0September 2006). The Court considers that the present case engages the State\u2019s positive obligations arising under Article 8 to ensure effective respect for the applicant\u2019s private life, in particular his right to respect for his reputation (see Petrina v. Romania, no. 78060/01, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, 14\u00a0October 2008; Petrenco v. Moldova, no. 20928/05, \u00a7 52, 30 March 2010; and Aleksey Petrov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 27103/04, 2 November 2010). In this connection it adds that in order for Article 8 to come into play, the attack on the applicant\u2019s personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of gravity and in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for his private life (see, for example, A.\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, no. 28070/06, \u00a7 64, 9 April 2009, Mikolajov\u00e1 v.

This was not contested by the parties. In the criminal complaint, the applicant criticised the fact that the article had contained false allegations describing him as a thief, which had created a negative public perception about him and his family. However, the criminal proceedings were stayed because of the absolute limitation period. The domestic courts, owing to faults attributable only to the authorities (see paragraph 69 above), failed to verify the veracity of the statements contained in the article. The Government also admitted that the criminal proceedings had been ineffective in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraph 72 above). The applicant was therefore prevented from having his right to respect for his private life, which apparently was considerably affected (see paragraphs 13 and 71 above) effectively protected. Without making any conclusions as to what the outcome of the proceedings should have been (had the courts decided the merits of the applicant\u2019s claim), the Court considers that the manner in which the criminal-law mechanism was implemented in the instant case was defective to the point of constituting a breach of the respondent State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Sandra Jankovi\u0107 v.

In the present case, regard being had to the available material and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR 2,650 for legal fees and expenses relating to the defamation proceedings, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant. As to the proceedings before it, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s representative entered the proceedings after the applicant had submitted his comments in reply to the Government\u2019s observations (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). In such circumstances and in the absence of any supporting documents, it rejects the applicant\u2019s claim under this head.",
