In particular, they stated that in 2003 and then in 2014 the applicant had been convicted of crimes twice, which demonstrated his criminal propensities. Unlike in the case of Gablishvili v.\u00a0Russia, no. 39428/12, 26 June 2014, where the applicant did not commit crimes involving the use of violence, in the present case the applicant\u2019s second conviction had been for causing serious bodily harm to his victim. Furthermore, given that the exact date of the applicant\u2019s arrival in Russia was unknown and that for the fifteen years of his residence there he had left the country once every three months in order to comply with immigration regulations, the actual length of his stay in Russia was unknown. This, along with the fact that he had never applied for either a Russian residence permit or Russian nationality, showed that he preferred to maintain his foreign status. In addition, according to the information received from the penitentiary institution where the applicant had served his sentence, during his imprisonment he had been penalised on seventeen occasions, on ten of which he had been placed in a disciplinary cell. As for the applicant\u2019s family life, his daughter had been fourteen years old at the time of his deportation; his remarriage to his wife had been officially registered on 16 January 2014 \u2013 that is to say about two weeks after the commission of the crime on 30 December 2013. There was no information on whether the applicant and his wife had had any kind of family life between their divorce in 2009 and their remarriage in 2014. According to the Government, the applicant\u2019s remarriage had been registered only to enable him to legalise his stay in Russia between January and April 2014 for the period of the pre-trial investigation against him. The Government furthermore contended that the applicant had applied for a work permit in Russia for the first time only in November 2012 and that there was no information regarding his employment record. Therefore, his argument concerning his being the family\u2019s breadwinner was unsubstantiated, especially in view of his wife\u2019s position as the general manager and chief accountant of a delivery service company. As for the applicant\u2019s allegations that his daughter had suffered mentally on account of his deportation, it was impossible to distinguish whether this suffering was caused by his absence while serving his prison sentence or by his deportation. Given that the applicant had arrived in Russia at the age of thirty and that he had relatives in Armenia, along with the fact that he had neither employment nor property in Russia, he could not be considered as having close ties with Russia. All of the above-mentioned factors showed that the applicant would not face insurmountable difficulties in adjusting to life in Armenia. Lastly, the Government stated that prior to his exclusion, the applicant had been sanctioned for failing to comply with administrative immigration regulations on three occasions \u2013 in 2004, 2006 and 2010. In addition, he had been fined on three occasions \u2013 in 2010, 2011 and 2013 \u2013 for violations of traffic regulations.",

In January 2014 the applicant and Ms Ya. remarried and in December 2015 the applicant was deported from Russia. According to the Government, during the second marriage of the applicant and Ms Ya., there had been no family life. According to the applicant, during the second marriage to Ms\u00a0Ya. he had had a family life with her and their daughter. To this end, the Court notes that, firstly, the issue of the lack of family life between the applicant and Ms Ya. during their second marriage was not a subject of examination in the domestic proceedings concerning the exclusion. Secondly, there is nothing in the Government\u2019s submission to substantiate their allegation of a lack of family life between the applicant, Ms Ya. and their daughter from January 2014 until his deportation almost two years later. Therefore, the Court finds that the applicant and Ms Ya. and their daughter Z. had a family life prior to the applicant\u2019s deportation in December 2015. Given that as a result of the applicant\u2019s exclusion from the country for eight years the family was separated, the Court concludes that the measures taken by the authorities against the applicant amounted to interference with his right to a family life, as guaranteed by Article\u00a08 of the Convention.",

From the documents submitted it can be seen that the courts limited themselves to an assertion of the compatibility of the exclusion with paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraphs 20 and 23 ) and to mentioning that the applicant did have a wife and daughter. The courts did not refer to any of the arguments advanced by the Government in their observations on the merits of the case, such as the applicant\u2019s record of administrative violations or his lack of an official employment record or the first criminal conviction (see paragraph 40 above). The decisions of the domestic courts demonstrate that they neither analysed the proportionality of the measure to be applied against the applicant in view of his family life nor attempted to balance the interests involved. Thus, the courts ignored the criteria elaborated by the Court in \u00dcner and failed to apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 8 (compare to Gablishvili, cited\u00a0above, \u00a7\u00a051).",
