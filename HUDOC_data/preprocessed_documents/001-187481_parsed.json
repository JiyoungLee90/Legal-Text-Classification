The officers were also prohibited from holding positions in the police for five years and were sentenced to 240\u00a0hours\u2019 community service. In reply to the applicants\u2019 arguments in respect of the leniency of the lower court\u2019s judgment and about impunity, with reference to the Court\u2019s judgments in Valeriu and Nicolae Ro\u015fca v.\u00a0Moldova (no. 41704/02, 20 October 2009) and P\u0103dure\u0163 v. Moldova (no.\u00a033134/03, 5 January 2010), the court found that those cases were not applicable to the present case since in both of them serious physical ill-treatment had been caused, while the applicants in the present case had only been psychologically ill-treated. Moreover, one witness who had been subjected to the same treatment as the applicants during the relevant events had refused to completely undress and had not been ill-treated as a result.

They added that following the Moldovan judgments mentioned above the Criminal Code had been amended so as to exclude the possibility of suspending the serving of sentences imposed for torture.

The prosecutor summarised the applicants\u2019 statements and referred to the results of the identity parades during which each of the applicants had identified A.C. as the person who had taken them to the room in which they had been ordered to undress and do sit-ups. The first applicant stated that A.C. had ordered everyone to face the wall and not to look back. When one young woman (N.) had looked away, he had hit the back of her head, as a result of which her forehead had struck the wall. The first applicant added that when another officer had been describing the personal items in her purse, A.C. had threatened to throw it away. Subsequently she had been ordered to sign a document. When she had pointed out that the time of arrest had been noted incorrectly, A.C. had told her \u201cI\u2019ll give you one [that is to say \u2018hit you\u2019] so that you\u2019ll join your grandmother in the grave\u201d. The second applicant had given a similar description, noting that when she had entered the detention facility she had seen many persons against the wall, many of whom had been beaten by the police, while not offering any resistance. The prosecutor found that A.C. had clearly exceeded his powers as a police officer, but that the applicants had not sustained such serious damage as to qualify as torture. Accordingly, his actions were qualified as excess of powers under the Contravention Code (Codul contraven\u0163ional). Since the three-month prescription period for this administrative offence had already expired, the case against A.C. could not be pursued. He continued to work as a police officer throughout the proceedings.",

On 4 June 2010 the lawyer asked a more senior prosecutor to annul the decisions taken on 16 and 22 April 2010. She argued, inter alia, that A.C. should not have been relieved of criminal responsibility since he had acted at least as an accomplice of V.D. and M.T., in respect of whom the prosecution had continued to press criminal charges. In particular, A.C. had been fully aware of V.D.\u2019s presence in the room to which he had escorted the applicants and three other female detainees and had known that they would be subjected to a strip search. Moreover, he had acted brutally towards the applicants, humiliating them and hitting one of the female detainees (N.) and other persons in their presence. This treatment had had a considerable effect on the applicants, taking into consideration their gender and age (the second applicant was 21 at the relevant time) and the dominant position held by the police officer. Moreover, having witnessed A.C.\u2019s openly hitting N. in front of the applicants had caused them to fear being subjected to similar treatment. In addition, the applicants\u2019 will to resist police intimidation had been completely broken since the reason for their detention had not been explained to them, nor had they been informed of the rights which they had had, in the absence of a guarantee of being able to defend those rights. They had thus been forced to sign documents which had subsequently led to their detention. It had been also unclear why the prosecutor had not charged A.C. with the criminal offence of excess of powers (Article 328 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 37 below), but had preferred to examine the case under the Contravention Code, with the effect of letting A.C. go unpunished.",

In the Court\u2019s view, such leniency in treating police officers accused of a very serious crime is incompatible with the aim of preventing future occurrences of ill-treatment by the police.

As a result, the applicants remained in a state of uncertainty as to the outcome of the proceedings for almost four and a half years (see, for instance, S.Z. v. Bulgaria, no. 29263/12, \u00a7 39, 3 March 2015).
