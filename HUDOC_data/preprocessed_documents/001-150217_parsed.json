It held that the applicant\u2019s complaints concerned investigative acts carried out by G.B. During ongoing criminal proceedings, other legal remedies are available to the accused or the defendant(s) by virtue of the criminal procedure rules, and these could have been used here to express dissatisfaction in respect of the alleged breaches of the procedural rules and of their lawful rights. In this connection, the court identified several complaints the applicant could have lodged within the framework of the criminal proceedings instituted against him, namely a complaint against the prosecutor\u2019s orders for preventive measures and based on Article 51 et seq., Article 64 \u00a7 2, Article 67 et seq., and Articles 140 \u00a7 2, 172 \u00a7 6, 275-278, 320 and 332 of the Romanian Criminal Procedure Code. In addition to the aforementioned legal remedies, the defendants had other lawful means of lodging complaints against the person investigating or supervising the investigation of their case. However, a criminal complaint lodged against the prosecutor who had carried out the investigation in criminal proceedings that were still pending was not one of the legal means the applicant could have used, as it opened up the possibility of having aspects of legality regarding the pending criminal trial examined outside the framework expressly provided by the Criminal Procedure Code and of examining aspects of the criminal proceedings instituted against him. Moreover, the procedure allowing the prosecutor\u2019s orders to be challenged before domestic courts did not allow the court to substitute its judgment for that of the judicial organs charged with the examination of the pending criminal proceedings instituted against him. The applicant appealed on points of law (recurs) against the judgment.",

In this connection, the Court notes that, according to the medical report produced on the same date at the time of his imprisonment, the applicant\u2019s general condition was only relatively good. The same medical report also recorded the applicant\u2019s statement that at 9 p.m. his blood sugar level had been elevated.

The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 essentially refer back to national law and state the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. While it is normally, first and foremost, up to the national authorities, especially the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, the position is different in relation to cases where failure to comply with the law entails a breach of the Convention. This applies, in particular, to cases in which Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is at issue and the Court must then exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed (see Baranowski v.

In addition the Court recalls that it has already established that under Romanian law there are only two measures entailing a deprivation of liberty, in particular police custody and pre-trial detention (see Creang\u0103, cited above, \u00a7 107). However, neither of those measures was applied to the applicant prior to 9.15 p.m. on 9 March 2010. Consequently, the Court is not convinced that the domestic authorities perceived the restriction on the applicant\u2019s liberty prior to 9.15 p.m. on 9 March 2010 as a deprivation of liberty and were prepared to pursue the criminal complaints opened by the applicant in that regard. The Court\u2019s doubts are reinforced by the judgments of the domestic courts which considered that the applicant\u2019s criminal complaints amounted in reality to complaints against the investigating acts carried out by the prosecutor. Given the contradictions between the Government and the domestic courts as to what might have been the appropriate remedies for the applicant to exhaust in the circumstances of his case, the Court does not consider it unreasonable that the applicant raised his complaints before the Court only after he attempted to put his grievances to the domestic authorities.",
