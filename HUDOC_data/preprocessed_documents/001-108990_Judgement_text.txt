The case originated in an application (no. 10525/09) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by seven Greek nationals whose names appear in the annex (“the applicants”), on 5 February 2009.
The applicants were represented by Mr V. Chirdaris, a lawyer practising in Athens. The Greek Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent’s delegates, Mr I. Bakopoulos and Ms G. Kotta, Legal Assistants at the State Legal Council.
On 2 September 2010 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of an effective remedy in this respect to the Government. In accordance with Protocol No. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges.
The applicants were born on the dates listed in the Annex and live in Hydra.
The applicants are owners of different plots of land in Hydra, in the same area.
On 6 December 1980, 26 January 1981 and 27 January 1982 respectively, after applications were lodged by the applicants, the Forest Inspection of Poros decided that their plots of land were not forestal.
On 16 August 1985 the Forest Inspection of Poros designated an area of 235 000 square meters (235 stremmas), including the applicants’ property, as a forest land (decision no. 1265/1985).
The applicants lodged objections with the First Instance Committee for the Settlement of Forest Disputes (hereafter “the First Instance Committee”) challenging decision no. 1265/1985.
By decision no. 1/1986 the First Instance Committee decided that the area under consideration should be reduced to 203,5 stremmas and that, from this area, only a part of 138 stremmas should be characterised as forest land. Further, the applicants’ objections were accepted regarding 66,5 stremmas of the abovementioned area.
On an unspecified date an appeal was lodged by the applicants before the Appeal Committee for the Settlement of Forest Disputes (hereafter “the Appeal Committee”) challenging the part of decision no. 1/1986 designating the 138 stremmas as a forest land.
By decision no. 1/1987 the applicants’ allegations were accepted and the case was remitted to the Forest Inspection of Poros for a new consideration.
On 26 May 1988 the Forest Inspection of Poros designated again all the area (235 stremmas) as a forest land (decision no. 65/1988).
On 3 August 1988 the first five applicants lodged objections with the First Instance Committee challenging decision no. 65/1988. On 5 September 1989 their objections were rejected (decision no. 1/1989).
Subsequently, on 7 May 1990 they lodged an appeal with the Appeal Committee challenging decision no. 1/1989. The Appeal Committee found that the First Instance Committee did not have a lawful composition. Decision no. 1/1989 was annulled and the case was remitted to the First Instance Committee for a new consideration.
On 7 July 1993 the First Instance Committee decided that, as far as the 66,5 stremmas were concerned, the authorities had not challenged decision no. 1/1986 and thus, it had become final regarding this part of the area (decision no. 11/1993). Further, regarding the remaining part of the 138 stremmas, the Committee decided that this area was forest land and rejected the objections of the applicants.
In December 1993 appeals were lodged against the abovementioned decision. The first four applicants challenged the part of the decision concerning the 138 stremmas and the authorities the part of the decision concerning the 66,5 stremmas.
On 20 December 1994 the Appeal Committee found that the First Instance Committee had to decide again on the nature of the 66,5 stremmas.
On 19 February 1996 the First Instance Committee decided to declare the area of the 66,5 stremmas as a forest (decision no. 1/1996).
Subsequently, on 19 April 1996 - the first two applicants - and on 2 July 1996 - the other five applicants - lodged appeals with the Appeal Committee challenging decisions nos. 11/1993 and 1/1996, with the exception of the fifth applicant who challenged only decision no. 1/1996.
On 19 October 1999 the Appeal Committee upheld the designation of the area including the applicants’ property as a forest land (decision no. 12/1999).
On 2 June 2000 the applicants lodged recourses with the  asking for the annulment of decision no. 12/1999. By judgment dated 27 December 2006, the court accepted the recourse of the fifth applicant and annulled the part of decision no. 12/1999 concerning the property of the applicant that was included in the area of the 66,5 stremmas (judgment no. 3893/2006). Further, on the same date the court rejected the recourses of the other applicants (judgment nos. 3890-2/2006). The judgments were “finalised” (θεώρηση και καθαρογραφή) on 5 and 25 August 2008 respectively.
The following provisions of the Introductory Law (Εισαγωγικός Νόμος) to the Civil Code (Law no. 2783/41) are relevant:
Section 104
“The State shall be liable in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code concerning legal persons, for acts or omissions of its organs regarding private-law relations or State assets.”
Section 105
“The State shall be under a duty to make good any damage caused by the unlawful acts or omissions of its organs in the exercise of public authority, except where the unlawful act or omission is in breach of an existing provision but is intended to serve the public interest. The person responsible shall be jointly and severally liable, without prejudice to the special provisions on ministerial responsibility.”
These sections establish the concept of a special prejudicial act in public law, creating State liability in tort. This liability results from unlawful acts or omissions. The acts concerned may be not only legal acts but also physical acts by the administrative authorities, including acts which are not in principle enforceable through the courts. The admissibility of an action for damages is subject to one condition, namely the unlawfulness of the act or omission.
