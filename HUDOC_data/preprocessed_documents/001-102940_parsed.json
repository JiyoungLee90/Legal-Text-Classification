Article 3 does not in principle oblige the State to guarantee criminal impunity for assisting a person to commit suicide or to create a legal basis for another form of assistance with that act; the State must not sanction actions intended to terminate life (Pretty, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55 et seq.). With regard to Article\u00a08, the Court found that \u2013 without in any way negating the principle of sanctity of life \u2013 the quality of life and, in consequence, the question of the individual\u2019s autonomy play a role under this provision (judgment in Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court stated that it \u2018[was not prepared] to exclude\u2019 that the fact that the applicant was precluded from exercising her choice to avoid what she consider[ed would] be an undignified and distressing end to her life constituted an interference with her right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 67; see also the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Rodriguez v. British Columbia [Attorney General; [1993] 3 S.C.R. 513], and Judge Sopinka\u2019s opinion as the basis of the majority\u2019s findings); this had already been presaged in the 1983 Reed case, where the Commission had emphasised that the activity of a person aiding and abetting suicide did not, as such, fall within the sphere of Article 8, but that, on the contrary, the protection of the private life of the person seeking to die could be at stake (inadmissibility decision in Reed v. the United Kingdom, no. 7630/76, Commission decision of 4 July 1983, Decisions and Reports 33, p. 273, \u00a7 13).",

The matter in dispute is whether, on the basis of Article 8, the State must take steps to ensure that the applicant is able to end his life without pain and without risk of failure, and that, in consequence, he is able to obtain sodium pentobarbital without a medical prescription, in derogation from the legislation. This question must be answered in the negative: admittedly, the Convention guarantees not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (judgment in Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37); it does not appear, however, \u2013 given that other options exist \u2013 that the freedom to commit suicide and, accordingly, the freedom to choose one\u2019s own quality of life are restricted by the mere fact that the State does not authorise the unconditional issue of the substance in question, but makes it dependent on the presentation of a medical prescription, issued on the basis of the \u2018recognised rules of pharmaceutical and medical science\u2019 and knowledge of the health of the individual concerned (section 24(1)(a) taken in conjunction with section 26 of the LPTh [Federal Medicines and Medical Devices Act], and section 9(1), taken in conjunction with section 10, of the Lstup [Federal Drugs Act]). In order to guarantee effectively the freedom to choose to end one\u2019s own life, derived from Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it is not necessary to authorise unrestricted availability of sodium pentobarbital, even if this substance is supposedly highly suitable for the act of committing suicide. The mere fact that solutions other than sodium pentobarbital entail higher risks of failure and greater pain is not sufficient to justify the provision, without prescription, of this substance for the purpose of suicide. Such a positive obligation cannot be inferred either from Article\u00a010 \u00a7 2 of the Federal Constitution or from Article 8 of the Convention ...",

Generally speaking, this obligation is intended to protect the health and safety of the population and, in the context of assisted suicide, to prevent the commission of criminal offences and combat the risks of abuse (Pretty judgment, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 74 and 75 ...). A substance which, when ingested, leads to death, cannot simply be dispensed by a pharmacist without any knowledge of the circumstances of the case; in the patient\u2019s interests, provision of such a substance must be subject to the presentation of a medical prescription. A medical prescription presupposes a diagnosis drawn up on the basis of a doctor\u2019s professional code of ethics, a medical indication (Indikationsstellung) and an information-seeking interview. Only a doctor can assess a patient\u2019s capacity for discernment and his or her medical records, and determine whether all treatment options have been exhausted to no avail ... The obligation to obtain a prescription for sodium pentobarbital is a guarantee that doctors will not issue this substance without all the necessary conditions being fulfilled, since otherwise they would leave themselves open to criminal, civil or disciplinary sanctions ... It protects individuals from hasty and unconsidered decisions ... and guarantees the existence of a medical justification for the action. ... A potential interference with the right to self-determination protected by Article\u00a08 of the Convention has only a relative bearing in view of the consequences attached to issuing sodium pentobarbital for the purpose of suicide. ... In contrast, the protection of life, the prohibition of murder and the latter\u2019s delimitation with regard to assisted suicide, which is not a priori subject to penalties, represent a significant public interest. ... While assisted suicide by medical means is authorised, a matter that, given the importance of the ethical issue at stake, must in the first instance be assessed by the legislature (see the above-cited Pretty judgment, \u00a7 74 in fine), the State is entitled to put in place a procedure for review, thus guaranteeing that the decision of the individual concerned does indeed correspond to his or her free and considered will ...; to that end, the obligation to obtain a medical prescription is appropriate and necessary. In so far as the applicant alleges that this argument does not take into consideration the 1,300 cases of suicide and the 63,000 cases of attempted suicide per year, in which the State allegedly fails to comply with its duty of protection, it must be emphasised that those cases do not, as the instant case does, concern the question of dispensing, without prescription, a substance for the purpose of suicide and are thus not comparable to the present situation.",

In contrast, the legislature remains free, in weighing up the interests at stake \u2013 the right to self-determination of persons wishing to kill themselves on the one hand, and protection against impulsive suicides (Affektsuizid) on the other \u2013 to make the legality of assisted suicide and the provision of a dangerous product subject to compliance with professional rules and the state of medical science. The Guidelines on End of Life Care issued by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences on 25 November 2004 acknowledge that, in borderline cases, a doctor may be faced with an \u2018intractable conflict\u2019 (point 4.1 of the Guidelines). Clearly, assisted suicide cannot be considered as part of a doctor\u2019s activities, since it is self-evident that such an action goes against the aim of medicine; however, respect for the patient\u2019s wishes is also fundamental to the relationship between the doctor and patient, so that the doctor may be led to take a decision in all conscience, a decision that ought to be respected. If the doctor opts for assisted suicide, he is guarantor of the fact that: (1) the patient\u2019s illness makes it likely that death is close; (2) other options for support have been discussed and, where appropriate, put into place; and (3) the patient is capable of discernment, his or her wish appears to be carefully considered, is not the result of external pressure and is to be regarded as final, which must be verified by an independent third party who need not necessarily be a doctor; the final act which leads to death must always be carried out by the patient himself. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s assertions, a doctor is entitled, in the context of the recognised professional rules, to prescribe sodium pentobarbital for the purpose of suicide, provided that the conditions for doing so are fulfilled. As the Federal Court has already observed, a change in attitude is to be perceived in modern society, in the sense that assisted suicide is increasingly considered as a voluntary medical activity which cannot be imposed on any doctor, but which is not excluded by the rules of professional conduct and supervision, provided that the duty of medical care is respected in examining patients, diagnosing them and dispensing the product (judgment 2P.310/2004 of 18 May 2005, paragraph 4.3, with references), and provided that doctors do not allow themselves to be guided solely by their patient\u2019s wish to die and fail to examine the reasons for such a decision in accordance with the applicable scientific criteria ...",

The most recent ethical, legal and medical opinions indicate that in such cases also the prescription of sodium pentobarbital is not necessarily precluded or to be excluded on the ground that it would represent a breach of the doctor\u2019s duty of care ... However, the greatest restraint must be exercised: it is necessary to distinguish between a desire to die as the expression of a psychological disorder which can and must be treated, and a wish to die that is based on the considered and sustained decision of a person capable of discernment (\u2018pre-suicide assessment\u2019), which must be respected as applicable.

The activities of such organisations have been criticised on several occasions; a study carried out in Basle, analysing 43 cases of assisted suicide by the organisation Exit between 1992 and 1997, rightly criticised the failure to take into account psychiatric or social factors in the decision to end one\u2019s life ... Accordingly, one cannot argue that issuing sodium pentobarbital and delegating responsibility for its use to an organisation for assisted suicide is equally compatible with the purpose of the legislation as maintaining the obligation to obtain a medical prescription.",

The requirement of a medical prescription for sodium pentobarbital has a legal basis, is intended to protect public safety and health and to maintain order in the public interest, and is also a proportionate and necessary measure in a democratic society. In weighing up the interests at stake, namely the protection of life \u2013 which requires (as a minimum) verification, on a case-by-case basis, of whether individuals\u2019 decisions to end their lives genuinely correspond to their free and considered will where they opt for assisted suicide using a product subject to legislation on drugs or medicinal products \u2013, and the individual\u2019s right to self-determination, the State remains free \u2013 from the standpoint of constitutional law or of the Convention \u2013 to lay down certain conditions and, in this context, to maintain, inter alia, the obligation to obtain a prescription for sodium pentobarbital.

To their knowledge, the criminal convictions of doctors for prescribing sodium pentobarbital all concerned cases where the diagnosis had not been carefully established or was manifestly erroneous. Moreover, according to a study conducted between 2001 and 2004 on suicides assisted by the associations Exit and Dignitas, carried out by the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Z\u00fcrich, twelve persons suffering from a psychiatric illness had been assisted by those two associations during that period. None of the doctors involved in those cases was prosecuted, and nor were any other measures taken against them. Further, it was apparent from Exit\u2019s annual reports that this association had twice, in 2007 and 2008, accompanied the suicide of a person suffering from a psychiatric illness (the association\u2019s Management Committee Reports for 2007 and 2008, Annexes 3 and 4). In the Government\u2019s view, this showed that doctors were willing to carry out the necessary assessments and prescribe the required quantity of sodium pentobarbital. To the Government\u2019s knowledge, these cases had not had legal consequences. Accordingly, the Government submitted that, if he was prepared to accept the conditions laid down by the Federal Court and confirmed by the Swiss Society for Forensic Psychiatry, the applicant could find a doctor who, after accompanying him over a certain period, would be able to attest, if appropriate, whether he fulfilled the conditions for prescription of the substance in question.",

They concluded that the association must be aware of doctors who could assume responsibility for the applicant\u2019s request. Secondly, they noted that, since 2006, in line with the Federal Court\u2019s judgment, the Canton of Z\u00fcrich had changed its practice so that doctors who drew up a prescription for sodium pentobarbital no longer faced criminal prosecution. According to the Government, once the impugned obstacle in the domestic law had been lifted, rather than seeking to contact a doctor in the Canton of Z\u00fcrich, the applicant had sent a written request, certified by a notary, to 170 psychiatrists, all of whom practised in the Basle region, with the exception of one doctor who practised in Berne. Thirdly, the Government, not knowing the criteria used by the applicant in selecting the 170 addressees of his request, considered that the wording of the letter was not such as to encourage a doctor to respond positively, in that the applicant, by dismissing in advance any therapeutic treatment and requesting solely an expert assessment, ruled out any serious examination of an alternative to suicide, a step that was part of the assessment that must precede the prescription of sodium pentobarbital.",

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see X and Y v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 91). It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s physical and social identity (see Mikuli\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I). Elements such as, for example, name, gender identification, and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 of the Convention (see, for example, B. v. France, 25 March 1992, \u00a7 63, Series A no. 232-C; Burghartz v.

Article 8 also protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see, for example, Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, \u00a7 47, and Friedl v. Austria, 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B, opinion of the Commission, \u00a7 45).

The subject of dispute in this case is whether, under Article 8 of the Convention, the State must ensure that the applicant can obtain a lethal substance, sodium pentobarbital, without a medical prescription, by way of derogation from the legislation, in order to commit suicide painlessly and without risk of failure. In other words, unlike the Pretty case, the Court observes that the applicant alleges not only that his life is difficult and painful, but also that, if he does not obtain the substance in question, the act of suicide itself would be stripped of dignity. In addition, and again in contrast to the Pretty case, the applicant cannot in fact be considered infirm, in that he is not at the terminal stage of an incurable degenerative disease which would prevent him from taking his own life (see, conversely, Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 9).",

In , pursuant to Article 115 of the Criminal Code, inciting and assisting suicide are punishable only where the perpetrator of such acts is driven to commit them by \u201cselfish motives\u201d. By way of comparison, the Benelux countries in particular have decriminalised the act of assisting suicide, but only in very specific circumstances. Lastly, certain other countries accept only acts of \u201cpassive\u201d assistance.

However, it is of the opinion that the regulations put in place by the Swiss authorities, namely the requirement to obtain a medical prescription, pursue, inter alia, the legitimate aims of protecting everybody from hasty decisions and preventing abuse, and, in particular, ensuring that a patient lacking discernment does not obtain a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (see, mutatis mutandis, with regard to restrictions on abortion, Tysi\u0105c v.
