Poland, no. 34458/03, \u00a7 129, 21 March 2017, with further references). It further reiterates that a request for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention on remand under Article\u00a0552 of the CCP enables a detainee to seek, retrospectively, a ruling as to whether his detention in already terminated criminal proceedings was justified, and to obtain compensation when it was not. The proceedings relating to such a request are essentially designed to secure financial reparation for damage arising from the execution of unjustified detention on remand (ibid.).",
