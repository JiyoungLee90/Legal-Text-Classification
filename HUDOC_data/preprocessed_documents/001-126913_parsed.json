In case of a life-threatening injury or death, the above obligation calls for an effective independent judicial system to ensure enforcement of the aforementioned legislative framework by providing appropriate redress (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 72, 24 May 2011). This obligation also applies in the context of designing a framework for protection of life from road traffic accidents (see, for example, Al Fayed v. France (dec.), no. 38501/02, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, 27 September 2007; Rajkowska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 37393/02, 27 November 2007; Railean v.

France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-I).

Any deficiency in the investigation, undermining its ability to establish the cause of the death or those responsible for it, may lead to the finding that the Convention requirements have not been met (see Antonov v.

The repetition of such remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency in criminal investigation (see Oleynikova v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 38765/05, \u00a7\u00a081, 15 December 2011). It is relevant to note that in ordering additional investigations, the supervising authorities specified, inter alia, that additional measures were necessary in order to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the case, namely questioning of the witnesses, expert examinations, a reconstruction of events, and an examination of the arguments advanced by the victim\u2019s relatives. The facts of the case therefore suggest that the investigative authorities did not take all the necessary steps in order to carry out a thorough investigation which would be compatible with the Convention requirements.",

In this regard, the Court reiterates that the effectiveness of an investigation implies a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see \u0160ilih v.\u00a0Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7\u00a0195, 9 April 2009).
