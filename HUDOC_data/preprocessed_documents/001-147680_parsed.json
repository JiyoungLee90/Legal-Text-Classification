In this connection, the Court notes that according to the available evidence, the Government failed to provide any information about the average temperature the heating system operated at or the cells. In addition, they did not clarify whether the applicant had been given adequate cutlery or whether he had enjoyed sufficient outdoor exercise (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). Consequently, the Court can only conclude that during the applicant\u2019s detention his cells were not properly heated, and that he did not receive adequate cutlery or sufficient outdoor exercise.",
