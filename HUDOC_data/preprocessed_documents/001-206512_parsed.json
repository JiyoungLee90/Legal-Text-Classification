The Court has already pointed out that the role played by the Chairman of the Bar constitutes a guarantee when it comes to protecting legal professional privilege. In Andr\u00e9 and Another\u00a0v.\u00a0France (no.\u00a018603/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042 and 43, 24 July 2008), it specified that the Convention did not prevent domestic law from allowing for the possibility of searching a lawyer\u2019s offices as long as proper safeguards and a strict framework were provided; more broadly, it emphasised that, subject to strict supervision, it was possible to impose certain obligations on lawyers concerning their relations with their clients, in the event, for example, that there was credible evidence of the lawyer\u2019s involvement in an offence and in the context of the fight against money-laundering. It then took into account the fact that in the case at hand, the search had been carried out in the presence of the Chairman of the Bar, which it saw as a \u201cspecial procedural guarantee\u201d. Similarly, in Roemen and Schmit v. Luxembourg (no. 51772/99, \u00a7\u00a069, ECHR\u00a02003IV) it noted that the search of the lawyer\u2019s premises had been accompanied by \u201cspecial procedural safeguards\u201d, including the presence of the Chairman of the Bar. Lastly, in Xavier Da Silveira\u00a0v.\u00a0France (no.\u00a043757/05, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and\u00a043, 21\u00a0January 2010), it found a violation of Article\u00a08, in part because there had been no such safeguard in place when a lawyer\u2019s premises had been searched (see Michaud v. France, no.\u00a012323/11, \u00a7\u00a0130, ECHR 2012).",

The search warrant was issued with a view to finding and seizing a computer which could have been used to access the account. There was no other possibility of obtaining evidence in relation to that account, as it had been deleted. Thus, the Court agrees with the Government that the search warrant was reasonably limited in scope. The search was carried out within the defined limits as only the objects specified in the search warrant were seized, namely the applicant\u2019s tablet computer and his daughter\u2019s portable computer. As soon as it was established that the computer belonging to the applicant\u2019s daughter did not contain any relevant data, it was returned.
