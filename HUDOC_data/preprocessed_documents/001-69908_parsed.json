On the other hand, the applicant could also have received the information regarding Mobutu\u2019s administration from other sources. As his identity and background had not been convincingly established it could not be assessed whether the reason for his departure from the DRC had been persecution within the meaning of section 30 (1) of the Aliens Act. He could therefore not be granted asylum. Despite the lack of clarity of his account it could not be excluded however that he had been one of Mobutu\u2019s personal guards. This lack of clarity should be interpreted to the applicant\u2019s benefit.

Some were taken to Kitona military base, ostensibly for ideological and military training. Many of them were caught up in that base at the time of the resumption of the war in August 1998. Many are feared to have lost their lives there or have been accused of being in alliance with  or with the armed opposition, and indeed many of them have been targeted. There are some who have joined the new army, so it cannot be said that all of them are targeted by the government, but indeed some have been. Another element that creates a potential problem for members of MPR and former Mobutu soldiers is the aforementioned perception that some former members of the Mobutu government are plotting to launch an attack on  from . Some of the FAZ soldiers, particularly the members of the Division sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9sidentielle (DSP), which was the bodyguard corps of President Mobutu, also fought in the wars in  and joined the Congo-Brazzaville army. Many of them still remain there. Since about 1999 there have been reports and fears on the part of the DRC government that some of these people are organising and regrouping with an intention of returning by force to  and recapturing state power. So these people will still remain at risk, whether or not they may be directly or not at all involved in plots against the DRC government. Indeed some of them are currently in custody. There have been attempts by the two governments to create an understanding by actual agreements not to attack each other, but there still seems to remain a kind of mistrust between them. As a result, at least the  regime fears that there could be an attack from . Another significant factor is that many of these ex-FAZ joined the MLC armed political group and as a result were also evidently fighting against the  government. Now that some form of power-sharing agreement has been signed, if it is implemented, one would assume that these former soldiers will end up in the national army. This may happen, but again this agreement has yet to be actually implemented. By and large the risk of persecution will depend on the specific circumstances of the particular individual. As regards the question of how important the military rank of a former Mobutu soldier is in this context, it has to be borne in mind that in some of these armies a rank may not always mean what it does in better established armies. Particularly in the DRC, a low-ranking soldier may politically have more power than a top general. There have been cases where a sergeant would beat up a major. Yet, the major, coming from an ethnic group that is not closely allied to the president, would not hit back or get the sergeant, corporal or even private who attacked him punished. He would not dare to touch him, although he is e.g. only a private, because he comes from . Without connections to influential persons at the top, being a general does not really mean much under such circumstances. In the case e.g. of Rwanda a Tutsi private may be able to challenge the power of a Hutu senior officer, not because he has been ordered to do so by the president or by someone else, but because he feels that he can do anything with impunity, that nobody will touch him because he happens to come from the ethnic group that is supposedly or really in power.",

Sometimes people are abused without any justification at all. On the other hand, even a civilian, linked to someone who was in a powerful position, may have been responsible for abuses for which he may be held liable or be subjected to reprisals. To cite an example, when a general\u2019s or minister\u2019s son drives an expensive foreign car or a military Land Cruiser, misuses power - or others only think he misuses power - or makes a lot of money, people would assume that he would not have that power and/or money if he was not related to the minister. Hence, when that minister leaves power, that individual, too, could be at risk. While this does not happen on a regular basis, it is however a real possibility. ...\u201d",

In determining whether substantial grounds have been shown for believing that a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 exists, the Court will assess the issue in the light of all the material placed before it and, if necessary, material obtained of its own motion (ibid., p. 1859, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97).

It is also of some importance, though not decisive, that according to his own account the applicant had never been in direct contact with President Mobutu and had not attained any senior military rank when forced to leave the country. The Court notes however that UNHCR and other reports indicate, in respect of former FAZ members, that factors other than rank \u2013 such as the soldier\u2019s ethnicity or connections to influential persons \u2013 may also be of importance when considering the risk he or she might be facing if returned to the DRC (see \u00a7\u00a7 120 and 122 above).

On account of those activities the Court finds that he would still run a substantial risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, if now expelled to the DRC. In this respect the applicant\u2019s case differs from Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, where the Court found that the evidence before it concerning the background of the applicants, as well as the general situation, did not establish that their personal position was any worse than the generality of other members of the Tamil community or other young male Tamils who were returning to their country. While in the still unsettled situation there existed the possibility that the applicants might be detained and ill-treated as appeared to have occurred previously in the cases of some of them, a mere possibility of ill-treatment, in such circumstances, was not in itself sufficient to give rise to a breach of Article 3 (judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 37, \u00a7\u00a0111).",

The Court recalls that in H.L.R. v. France it did not rule out the possibility that Article 3 may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. It is true that the Court went on to hold that even in such a scenario it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (in that applicant\u2019s case against reprisals by drug traffickers). The general situation of violence existing in the country of destination () would not in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of the applicant\u2019s deportation.

I would also note the reports to the effect that a number of Mobutu supporters have been returning voluntarily to the DRC in the recent years (see \u00a7 122 of the judgment).
