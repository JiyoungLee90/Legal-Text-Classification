The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) on 30 October 1997, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 19639/92) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a Turkish national, Mr Mevlüt Aka, on 15 August 1991.
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (a) of the Convention and Rule 32 of Rules of Court A. The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

2.  In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d), Mr K. Berzeg, a member of the Ankara Bar and the applicant’s counsel, informed the registry on 28 November 1997 that Mr Mevlüt Aka had died and that his widow, Mrs Şefika Aka, and children wished to pursue the proceedings in his name and to be represented by Mr Berzeg (Rule 30). 
On 20 January 1998 Mr Berzeg was given leave by the President to use the Turkish language in the written proceedings before the Court and the applicant was granted legal aid (Rule 27 § 3 and Rule 4 of the Addendum to Rules of Court A).
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr F. Gölcüklü, the elected judge of Turkish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the then Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 31 January 1998, in the presence of the Registrar, Mr Bernhardt drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mr N. Valticos, Mr A.N. Loizou, Sir John Freeland, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr K. Jungwiert and Mr V. Toumanov (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Turkish Government (“the Government”), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission, Mr A.Ş. Gözübüyük, on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial and supplements thereto on 3, 6 and 28 April 1998 and the Government’s memorial on 17 April 1998. On 15 May the applicant lodged a memorial in reply to the Government’s memorial.
Subsequently, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, who had been elected Vice-President of the Court, replaced Mr Bernhardt, who had been elected President of the Court, as President of the Chamber (Rules 21 § 6 and 24 § 1).
On 1 July 1998 the Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, having satisfied itself that the conditions for this derogation from its usual procedure had been met (Rules 26 and 38).
The applicant was a Turkish citizen and was born in 1930. At the material time he lived in the village of Gökdoğan (district of Durağan – Sinop province).
At the beginning of September 1987 the National Water Board (“the DSİ” – Devlet Su İşleri), a State body responsible, inter alia, for dam construction, expropriated two plots of land belonging to the applicant in the village of Gökdoğan (Sinop).
Following the construction of the Altınkaya hydroelectric dam in the Kızılırmak valley, the land, which had been used for growing crops, was flooded, as was that of more than 3,000 families also affected by the scheme.
After title to the land had been transferred to the authorities on 4 September 1987, the DSİ paid the applicant a total of 4,370,962 Turkish liras (TRL) for the two plots of land (being TRL 1,380,000 and TRL 2,990,962 respectively).
On 2 October 1987 the applicant brought, in respect of the expropriation of each plot of land, an action in the Durağan Court of First Instance for increased compensation. The actions were registered under nos. 87/2837 and 87/2828.
During the proceedings the court ordered two on-site valuations by experts in order to assess whether the amounts fixed by the expropriating authorities were correct. The two panels of experts relied on the same criteria in preparing their valuations, namely the criteria set out in Law no. 2942 on expropriation rules. As, however, they did not use the same methods of calculation, their valuations differed, but both were higher than the amount that had been paid by the DSİ on expropriation.
An application by the parties for a third valuation was dismissed because the court considered that the two valuations had been based on criteria complying with the statutory requirements and contained sufficient relevant material to enable it to decide the case.
Subsequently, the applicant stated in writing that he accepted the lower of the expert valuations. The Court of First Instance noted his agreement and made an order in those amounts.
In action no. 87/2837, on 22 June 1989 the court ordered the DSİ to pay TRL 3,089,130 in additional compensation for expropriation. In action no. 87/2828 it awarded the applicant an additional TRL 3,895,692 on 10 May 1990. Those amounts bore simple interest for delay at the statutory rate of 30% a year running from 4 September 1987 (see paragraph 10 above).
The Court of Cassation upheld those decisions on 17 September 1990 and 6 September 1991 respectively.
The additional compensation awarded in action no. 87/2837 was paid to the applicant on 30 January 1992. It came to TRL 7,097,276, of which TRL 4,008,146 was interest for delay due up to December 1991.

In action no. 87/2828 the applicant received the sum of TRL 10,116,692 on 7 January 1993, TRL 6,221,000 of which was interest for delay calculated up to December 1992.
The relevant part of Article 46 of the Constitution, relating to expropriations, provides:
“... Compensation for expropriation shall be paid immediately and in cash... If deferred payment is permitted by statute ... interest for delay at the maximum rate laid down for State debts shall be payable on the part that is not paid immediately...”
At the material time the rate of interest for delay payable on debts owed to the State was 7% per month (84% per annum) (section 51 of Law no. 6183 on the collection of debts due to the State and Cabinet Ordinance no. 89/14915).
By Law no. 3095 the rate of interest on overdue State debts is 30% per annum.
Article 105 of the Code of Obligations (“CO”) provides:
“Where the loss sustained by the creditor exceeds the interest due for delay and the debtor is unable to show that the creditor has been at fault, it is for the debtor to make good the loss.
If the additional loss can be assessed immediately the court may determine the amount when giving its decision on the merits.”
In practice, the loss for which compensation may be claimed under this provision is the loss caused by the lapse of time between the date the debt is due and the date it is paid.
On 3 June 1991 the Court of Cassation (Fifth Civil Division), which has jurisdiction in cases concerning compensation for expropriation, ruled as follows:
“The way in which creditors are compensated for the late payment of debt is through statutory interest. Since creditors are able, when resorting to enforcement measures, to claim the amount due to them plus interest, they are not entitled to claim any other form of compensation; accordingly, the decision to grant the creditor’s claim, on the basis that the rate of inflation was high, was ill-founded...”
The Government referred to another judgment delivered by the same division (judgment no. 96/13828 of 22 October 1996), in which the Court of Cassation had allowed an application for compensation under Article 105 CO. The decision concerned alleged additional loss resulting from the authorities’ delay in repaying a sum to which they had not been entitled. However, the claims in that case were based on the fact that in order to pay the amount supposedly due the plaintiff had had to close a deposit account before term, thereby losing interest.
Nonetheless, the practice of the Court of Cassation and in particular of its Thirteenth Division (see judgments nos. 95/267 and 96/9985) in cases not concerning expropriation appears to be to allow compensation for losses of that type under Article 105 CO in disputes between private individuals. On this point, it should be observed that the presidential committees of the Court of Cassation, responsible for ensuring that the case-law is consistent, tend to dismiss grounds of appeal based on differences in the practice of the various divisions, as they consider that decisions are made on a case by case basis in the light of the particular facts concerned and consequently do not need to be harmonised. 
In a leading judgment of 23 February 1994 the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, ruled for the first time on the adverse effects of inflation, holding:
“Law no. 3095 was approved and came into force when inflation in the country was high with rates well over 30%. Notwithstanding that fact, the legislature fixed the rate of interest for delay at 30%. In the present case it would therefore be unlawful to award compound interest at a rate exceeding 30% on the erroneous basis that the rate of interest payable on bank deposits was applicable.”
On 19 June 1996 the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, delivered another leading judgment in which it decided the issue of the applicability of Article 105 CO (see paragraph 19 above) to claims for loss sustained as a result of inflation. It held as follows:
“... the rate of interest provided for by Law no. 3095 ... constitutes lump-sum compensation for damage without the need for proof of loss... Since the rate of default interest (interest for delay in payment) is fixed by statute in the light of the economic problems (inflation, monetary erosion ...) the country is experiencing, it is impossible to adduce the same factors (inflation, monetary erosion ...) as clear evidence of the additional loss referred to in Article 105 of the Code of Obligations, or to affirm that 
the resulting disadvantages constitute the actual damage suffered. Otherwise, the legislature’s decision that the compensation for those disadvantages would be 30% would no longer make any sense. If the legislature, having had regard to all the economic problems, has, by virtue of the legislative power conferred on it by the Constitution, fixed the rate of compensation for loss resulting from those problems, it cannot be accepted that the damage for which compensation is due amounts to 60% or 70% rather than 30%, on the implied ground that the [legislature’s] assessment was unfounded... It is obvious that inflation, which has a considerable impact in the current economic climate of the country, exceeds [the rate of] 30% laid down by ... Law no. 3095 and that [in consequence] the creditor’s loss through late payment is not covered. However, in so far as it exceeds the 30% rate fixed by the legislature, that loss does not come within Article 105 of the Code of Obligations... As the legislature, pursuant to its legislative power, considered that the loss amounted to 30%, a judicial decision applying a higher rate of loss on the ground that inflation exceeds 30% would constitute an encroachment on the legislature’s jurisdiction...”
In practice, leading judgments must be followed by the courts below when those courts decide issues similar to those previously considered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court.
In January 1992 and 1993 the average exchange rate of the US dollar was, according to the exchange rate applied by the Central Bank of Turkey, TRL 5,332.59 and TRL 8,711.80 respectively.
The effects of inflation in Turkey are indicated in the lists of the retail price index published by the State Institute of Statistics. According to the relevant list, if the base index for the months of September and October 1987 (when title to the expropriated property was transferred to the authorities and the proceedings were issued in the Durağan Court of First Instance – see paragraphs 10–11 above) is taken as 100, the inflation index had by January 1992 (when the additional compensation in case no. 87/2837 was paid – see paragraph 16 above) reached 1006.06 and 1783.48 by January 1993 (when the additional compensation in case no. 87/2828 was paid – see paragraph 16 above).
Mr Aka applied to the Commission on 15 August 1991. He relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, complaining that his right to respect for his property had been infringed in that the award of additional compensation by the Durağan Court of First Instance and the interest thereon for delay had been insufficient. He also complained that the proceedings before that court had taken longer than was permitted by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

27.  On 16 January 1996 the Commission declared inadmissible the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings (Article 6 § 1) and the insufficiency of the compensation awarded (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).
However, it declared the application (no. 19639/92) admissible on 14 October 1996 in so far as it concerned the insufficiency of the rate of interest for delay in payment of the additional compensation. In its report of 9 September 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the concurring opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The applicant invited the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention.
In their memorial the Government requested the Court, as their principal submission, to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and, in the alternative, to find that there had on the facts of the case been no violation of the rights guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
