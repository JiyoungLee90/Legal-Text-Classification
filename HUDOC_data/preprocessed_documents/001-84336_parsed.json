Only 210 cases had been submitted by the Greek-Cypriot side and only 318 by the Turkish-Cypriot side. He again urged both sides to submit all cases without further delay and the committee to reach a consensus on the criteria for concluding its investigations (Doc.\u00a0S/26777, of 22 November 1993, paras. 88 - 90).",

By December 1995, the Greek Cypriot side submitted all their case files (1493). However, the committee\u2019s third member withdrew in March 1996 and the UN Secretary-General made it a condition for appointing a new one that certain outstanding questions, including classification of cases, sequence of investigations, priorities and expeditious collection of information on cases without known witnesses, be settled beforehand (Doc. S/1996/411, of 7\u00a0June 1996, para. 31). After being repeatedly urged to resolve these issues (Doc. S/1997/437, of 5 June 1997, paras. 24 -25), both parties eventually came to an agreement on 31 July 1997 on the exchange of information on the location of graves of missing persons and return of their remains. They also requested the appointment of a new third member of the CMP (Doc. S/1997/962, of 4 December 1997, paras. 21 and 29-31). However, by June 1998, no progress had been made towards the implementation of this agreement. The UN Secretary-General noted in this context that the Turkish-Cypriot side had claimed that victims of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Archbishop Makarios in 1974 were among the persons listed as missing and that this position deviated from the agreement (Doc. S/1998/488, of 10 June 1998, paras. 23).",

They submitted that the complaints in these applications were in essence related to spontaneous acts which had occurred more than 15 years before their acceptance of jurisdiction, in particular the deaths of eight of the nine alleged missing persons in military action in July-August 1974.

Referring in particular to Ble\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia ([GC] no. 59532/00, ECHR 2006-...), they argued that temporal competence could not be derived from the consequences flowing from facts which occurred beforehand, nor from any unsuccessful procedures seeking redress for those facts. Where death occurred prior to the acceptance of the right of individual petition, no procedural obligation could arise subsequently (Moldovan and Others v. Romania, nos.\u00a041138/98 and 64320/01, (dec.) 13 March 2001). They argued that the same held true in this case, in particular as there was no reason why the first applicants in this case were not presumed to be dead as in other disappearance cases (e.g. Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a023954/94, 31 May 2001). Further, they pointed out, citing Markovic and Others v. Italy ([GC], no.\u00a01398/03, \u00a7\u00a0111, ECHR 2006...) that the procedural obligation was first applied in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 27 September 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0324) and argued that it should not be retroactively applied to the events in this case.",

This was based on the effective control exercised over the victims by the respondent Government and the need to ensure effective accountability for the exercise of such control and to avoid impunity. The same rationale applied to the obligation to provide an effective investigation under Article 2 as the applicants were clearly in a life-threatening situation. They referred to evidence that the Turkish security forces on occasion killed civilians and detained fighters and that Turkish Cypriot militia tended to kill those prisoners handed over to them (ibid, paragraph 155) or leave the injured to die. The State\u2019s obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 was engaged in these circumstances, and this was also a continuing obligation.

In the latter cases, the fate of the victim is known; the former are characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and, not infrequently, callous inaction, obfuscation and concealment (see, amongst many examples, Kurt v. Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III, \u00a7\u00a7 127-128, Timurta\u015f v.

The Court is therefore not persuaded that the principles set out in Ble\u010di\u0107 and Moldovan exclude its temporal jurisdiction in the present cases or were intended as amending the approach taken in the inter-State case to disappearances. Nor does it find that the respondent Government is assisted by reliance on a passage in the Markovic case (cited above) which concerned the existence of a right in domestic or international law for the purposes of the application of Article 6 of the Convention. Further, while it may be true that the procedural obligation under Article 2 was first elucidated in the McCann case in 1995 (cited above), it was nonetheless applied in that case to events in 1988. However, even assuming therefore that an interpretation of a Convention provision cannot be retrospective in its application, this argument does not prevent an obligation of a continuing nature from being recognised as existing after that date.",

In the latter, it cannot be the case that the relatives of a person that has gone missing at a specific point in time can wait indefinitely before bringing the matter either to the attention of the domestic authorities or this Court. As has often been said, the object of the six month time limit under Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 is to promote legal certainty, by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time (e.g. Worm v. Austria, judgment of 29\u00a0August 1997, Reports 1997\u2013V, at p. 1547, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33). It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the Court and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible (Walker v. the United Kingdom, (dec.), no.\u00a034979/97, ECHR 2000I). It is not in the interests of the practical and effective functioning of the Convention system, which is of crucial importance to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms, that the Court be called upon to deal with stale complaints. The greater the lapse of time the more problematic any attempted examination of the facts and issues becomes. The effect on the evidence and the availability of witnesses inevitably risks rendering a belated assessment unsatisfactory or inconclusive, by failing to establish important facts or put to rest doubts and suspicions (see, mutatis mutandis, Finucane v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a029178/95, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2003VIII).",

In the Karabardak and other cases, the delay of over thirty years was not accounted for. In contrast, as concerns the present cases, the Court recalls that they were introduced on 25 January 1990, some three years after the right of individual petition became applicable to  on 28 January 1987. It is evident that, meanwhile, the disappearances had been made known to the relevant authorities from 1974 onwards in the series of inter-State cases brought by  concerning the missing persons as a whole. The reports of the Commission in these cases, although subject to discussion before the Committee of Ministers, were not made public throughout this period and the relatives of missing persons were unaware of the findings which were being made. The Court notes that it was not until 22 January 1990 that  recognised the jurisdiction of the old Court to examine applications, with the possibility that entailed of a public hearing and a binding judgment in which an award of just satisfaction might be made. The present applications were introduced three days after this. Accordingly, there is, in the Court\u2019s opinion, no element of unreasonable delay in bringing these individual applications to  in the circumstances. Whether applications introduced at a later date, in particular, long after the Court\u2019s inter-State judgment had made public findings on the disappearances as whole, would comply with the requirement for due expedition remains to be decided in such cases as may arise.",

Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998III, \u00a7\u00a099, Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no.\u00a023954/94, \u00a7\u00a084, 31 May 2001, Sarli v.

A zone of international conflict where two armies are engaged in acts of war per se places those present in a situation of danger and threat to life. Circumstances will frequently be such that the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the military forces in the field, and it would not be realistic to expect applicants to provide more than minimal information placing their relative in the area at risk. International treaties, which have attained the status of customary law, impose obligations on combatant States as regards care of wounded, prisoners of war and civilians; Article 2 of the Convention certainly extends so far as to require Contracting States to take such steps as may be reasonably available to them to protect the lives of those not, or no longer, engaged in hostilities (see, mutatis mutandis, Ertan \u00d6zkan\u00a0v. Turkey, no.\u00a047311/99, \u00a7\u00a7 301, 307-308, 9 October 2003). Disappearances in such circumstances thus attract the protection of that provision.",

Although the trigger for the Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 34 of the Convention is that an individual or private body can claim to be a victim of a breach of their rights, the Court serves a purpose beyond the individual interest in the setting and applying of minimum human rights standards for the legal space of the Contracting States. The individual interest is subordinate to the latter, as shown by the Court\u2019s competence to continue the examination of an application, even if the applicant no longer wishes to pursue his case, where respect for human rights so requires (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine).",

I voted against the finding of the majority in the Chamber rejecting the respondent Government\u2019s preliminary objection that the Court did not have jurisdiction ratione temporis to entertain the case.

Croatia ([GC], no.\u00a059532/00, ECHR 2006...), a judgment of the Grand Chamber. Having read the reasoning behind the preference not to apply that precedent to the case before us, I unfortunately found myself unable to agree that it did not apply or could not be followed in the present case, even in spite of the findings in the fourth inter-State case on the issue. As the justifications used by the majority of my colleagues to support their conclusions of continued violations of Articles 2, 3, and 5 can only be valid if the case falls within the temporal jurisdiction of this Court, I do not propose to commit myself to giving an opinion on the merits of the case, since I do not consider that the case falls within the Court\u2019s competence. I prefer to follow the recent case-law on the matter before us, and moreover, in the light of recent judgments, I do not agree that the allegations of violations were of a \u201ccontinuing nature\u201d. Additionally under this head, considering the lapse of time from 1974 to the date of the application, the more logical presumption of death, not the illogical \u201cpresumption of being alive\u201d, should have been adopted in the present case and, that being so, the disappearance could not be considered to be of a continuing nature, creating a continuing obligation under Article 2 to conduct effective investigations.

The events which the majority of the Court held to have given rise to an obligation to conduct effective investigations occurred in July and August 1974.

Neither the Commission nor the Court found sufficient evidence to hold that the missing persons were still in the custody of the Turkish authorities at the relevant time. In my opinion, it cannot be right to treat the Convention obligation which arises in certain circumstances to conduct a prompt and effective investigation as having persisted for fifteen years after the events which required investigation so that, when Turkey did become bound by the Convention, her alleged failure to date to conduct appropriate investigations can be regarded as a violation of the Convention. In my view, the concept of continuing violations cannot be prayed in aid to reach such a result. It seems to me that such an approach would be to apply an obligation imposed by the Convention retrospectively and to divest the time limitation in the declaration of its effect.\u201d",
