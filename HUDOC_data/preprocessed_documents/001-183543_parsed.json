In July 2014 the Russian authorities revoked the applicant\u2019s residence permit. As a consequence, the applicant has not been able to continue living with her husband and child in Russia, which has disrupted her family life there.

The first of these requirements does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question involving, amongst other things, a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference or abuse by public authorities. The issue of such protection, including the procedural safeguards against such abuse, overlaps with similar issues analysed in the examination of the decision-making process by means of the proportionality test under Article 8 \u00a7 2 (see Gablishvili, cited above, \u00a7 48, and Liu (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 86).
