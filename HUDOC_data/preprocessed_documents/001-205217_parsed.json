It pointed out that the right to manifest one\u2019s religion comprised the possibility to use one\u2019s own premises for religious meetings. The authorities had to refrain from imposing overly strict or prohibitive conditions for practising a religion, which included using an excessively restrictive interpretation of otherwise flexible rules as grounds for suspending the construction of a place of worship for a minority religious group. The mayoral order for suspension of the construction had been clearly discriminatory, and had been issued as a result of public pressure and an open demonstration of intolerance towards their religion. The applicant submitted that it therefore had been a victim of discrimination on the basis of its religion, in breach of Articles 9 and 14 of the Convention.",

It held in particular that the tacit refusal of the mayor to authorise the construction following the applicant\u2019s request of 15\u00a0May 2009 (see paragraph 38 above) had become final in the absence of a timely appeal by the applicant. The applicant could therefore not bring further proceedings concerning the same subject matter. Upon an appeal by the applicant, in which it stated that the municipality was deliberately finding different ways to prevent its construction, the SAC quashed the lower court\u2019s decision on 7 July 2010. The SAC observed that the lower court had found that there had been no new tacit refusal by the mayor on the merits of the applicant\u2019s request, but that the mayor\u2019s silence concerned a question on the admissibility of such a request. Thus, the SAC found, the lower court had without justification ruled on a different issue to that at the core of the applicant\u2019s challenge and had, as a result, delivered an unlawful decision. The mayor\u2019s silence following the applicant\u2019s request of 7\u00a0October 2009 (see paragraph 42 above) had undoubtedly represented a tacit refusal and, not only were the courts not prevented from pronouncing on the challenge to it, but were indeed called upon to exercise judicial control over its lawfulness. The SAC accordingly returned the case to the VAC for examination.",

The court observed in the first place that the applicant had specifically complained that the mayor had acted with ulterior motives and that his inaction had breached the applicant\u2019s human rights. The court went on to establish that, as stated in an expert report commissioned in the course of the judicial proceedings and confirmed by the legal representative of the respondent, the applicant had rectified all the irregularities which had led to the construction\u2019s suspension in the first place. Consequently, under section\u00a0224(5) of the 2001 Act, the mayor had been required to issue an order allowing the requested continuation of the construction. The mayor\u2019s failure to reply at all had represented an abuse of authority. In the same judgment, the court returned the case to the mayor, instructing him to issue a decision on the applicant\u2019s request in line with the court\u2019s reasoning. The court did not deal with the applicant\u2019s explicit arguments about the religious prejudice demonstrated by the mayor and about it having breached the applicant\u2019s right to manifest its religion.",

The court observed more specifically that the mayor had established that the applicant had indeed rectified all the irregularities which had originated the 9 July 2007 suspension order (see paragraph 23 above). In the meantime, however, as stated in the expert report as accepted in the court proceedings, the earlier mayoral order of 2001 designating the plot of land as an area where building was permitted had been quashed as unlawful (see paragraphs 35-36 above).

Administrative acts are to be issued within a fourteen-day period from the request being made (Article 57 \u00a7 1 of the Code). As a general rule, an administrative body has to issue the requested act, or refuse to do so, in an explicit motivated decision, which has to contain a number of mandatory elements, such as factual and legal grounds, as well as an operative part (Article 59 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Code). The failure of an administrative body to pronounce on a request, when required by law to decide on it, represents a tacit refusal (Article 58 \u00a7 1 of the Code). A tacit refusal can be challenged in court within one month counted from the end of the period within which the administrative body had been obliged to reply (Article 149 \u00a7 2 of the Code). The domestic courts have consistently applied these provisions by quashing tacit refusals of administrative bodies when the latter were required in law to explicitly issue a motivated decision on a request addressed to them, but had failed to do so (\u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 41 \u043e\u0442 8.04.2008 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0441\u044a\u0434 - \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0447 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 396/2007 \u0433.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1 \u043e\u0442 18.05.2007 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0441\u044a\u0434 - \u0412\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 20/2007 \u0433.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 17 \u043e\u0442 1.08.2008 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0441\u044a\u0434 - \u0412\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 193/2008 \u0433.; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 44 \u043e\u0442 24.06.2009 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0441\u044a\u0434 - \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 737/2009 \u0433. ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116\u00a07492 \u043e\u0442 8.06.2009 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 2835/2009 \u0433; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 13576 \u043e\u0442 12.11.2009 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 5748/2009 \u0433).",

However, that quashing had been lawful and been effected in the public interest and within the broad margin of appreciation enjoyed by States in the area of territorial planning.

Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made before the appropriate national courts. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Micallef v.

In the present case, it was on the basis of the authorities\u2019 own acts, namely initial amendment of the urban development plan and issuing of a building permit, that the applicant pursued its investment in the building project. Those acts were subsequently invalidated and that ultimately caused it to incur losses from its inability to build. The Court accordingly finds that the actions for damages under the SMRDA relating to the quashing of the 2001 mayoral order could have resulted in payment of compensation for any pecuniary loss incurred in connection with the investment in the construction work which was unable to continue as a result of an act by the authorities declared unlawful by the domestic courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Kateliev v.\u00a0Bulgaria (dec.), no.\u00a018594/06, \u00a7 54, 25 June 2013).

In view of the specific reasoning advanced by that court (see paragraph 26 above), namely that such suspension orders were given in all cases and to all persons in respect of whom the relevant authorities had established similar breaches, and that they had no relation to religious convictions, the Court finds that the authorities did not aim their decision to reject the applicant\u2019s judicial challenge at the applicant as a religious community.

On the basis of the other elements of relevance, namely that on 20 July 2009 the applicant had demonstrated compliance with the requirements to continue with its construction (see paragraph 39 above) and that on 12 July 2010 the mayoral order designating the plot in question as \u201cconstructible\u201d was quashed as unlawful (see paragraph 36 above), the Court considers that this was the case for about a year. The Court notes in this connection that the building works started immediately after permission had been given in 2007 (see paragraph\u00a020 above), that they had advanced in the two months before being suspended (see paragraph 49 above), as well as that the applicant made numerous subsequent attempts to have that suspension lifted and the resumption of the construction authorised (see paragraphs 38, 42, 46 and 48 above).

Despite the public opposition and the applicant\u2019s explicit related arguments in the domestic judicial proceedings, namely that the measures preventing it from constructing its house of worship were improperly motivated by an opposition to its religious activities, the administrative courts did not engage with the matter (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). They failed to address the evidence and arguments submitted by the applicant in this respect, and to rule on the applicant\u2019s complaint about a breach of its rights under Articles\u00a09 and 11 of the Convention, limiting instead their analysis to exclusive examination of the formal legal reasons for unlawfulness of the mayor\u2019s silence (contrast, albeit in the context of Article\u00a08 and mutatis mutandis, with Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez v.

The Court found above, under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, that the applicant had failed to seek damages domestically in connection with the investment it had made in the construction works before they were suspended (see paragraphs 74-75 above). Consequently, no award is due to the applicant in that respect. As regards the claim related to the rent which the applicant had paid to hold its meetings, the Court observes that the construction was lawfully suspended in 2007. It was in July 2009 when the applicant presented proof to the administration of having redressed the deficiencies at the origin of the suspension and, thereafter, on 7 October 2009 that it asked the mayor to order the resumption of the construction. The Court finds that it is not possible to establish with certainty when the construction would have been concluded, had it proceeded in 2009 after the applicant had redressed all irregularities in it. In any event, it finds that at least part of the rent which the applicant paid between June 2009 and April 2011 would not have been paid, had the violation it has found above under Article 9 in relation with Article 11 not occurred. Therefore, ruling in equity, the Court awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of pecuniary damage as a result of the rent the applicant paid in order to conduct its religious meetings.",
