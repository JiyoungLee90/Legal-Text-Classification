It held that the Kalush Court, having properly established the relevant facts, had interpreted the law incorrectly. Notably, according to Articles\u00a055 and 99 of the Housing Code, the applicant (together with her son) \u2013 having settled in flat A as a member of the original tenants\u2019 family \u2013 was bound by the duty of the original tenants to vacate the flat. There was therefore no legal basis for the applicant\u2019s and her son\u2019s continued residency in flat A, and this fact constituted a sufficient basis for their eviction without the provision of any other housing. Furthermore, the Kalush Court had erred in respect of the K.T. company\u2019s legal standing. Under Article\u00a055 of the Housing Code, notwithstanding the transfer of the property to the municipality, the K.T. company had retained the right to allocate the flat to one of its employees. It had therefore had legitimate standing to seek the vacation of the flat by its previous tenants.",
