Moreover, since the plain clothes police officers present at the courthouse were off duty and were acting in their private capacity when they allegedly beat up the applicant, the Court also considers that no direct responsibility can be attached to  under the Convention for their acts as private individuals. In addition, the Court finds no indication that the State authorities had failed to take effective steps to protect the applicant from ill-treatment. In reaching this conclusion the Court has had regard to the fact that various measures had been undertaken by the authorities prior to the incident (see paragraph 7 above), that the applicant was injured in the course of a verbal and physical confrontation which took place between opposing parties when a number of people sustained injury, including police officers (see paragraph 5 above), that the applicant's injuries appear to have been superficial with no lasting consequences and to the fact that the police appear to have intervened promptly after the fight began.",

In particular, it requires the authorities to investigate allegations of ill-treatment when they are \u201carguable\u201d and \u201craise a reasonable suspicion\u201d, even if such treatment is administered by private persons (see, in particular, Ay v.

Moreover, when the official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the gravity requirements of such matters. While there is no absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction or in a particular sentence, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow possibly serious attacks on physical and moral integrity to go unpunished (see Okkal\u0131 v.

This investigation led the prosecutor to indict thirteen people, including seven off-duty police officers for, inter alia, causing bodily harm pursuant to Article 456 of the Criminal Code. However, the ensuing criminal proceedings to which the applicant became a party and submitted observations ended without any tangible result due to the suspension of the proceedings against the accused in application of Law\u00a0no. 4616. In this connection, the Court reiterates its earlier finding in a number of applications that the Turkish criminal law system as applied in these cases has proved to be far from rigorous and would have had no dissuasive effect capable of ensuring the effective prevention of unlawful acts perpetrated by State agents or private individuals when the criminal proceedings brought against them are suspended due to the application of Law no. 4616 (see \u00c7elik v.

The Court finds no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case irrespective of the status of the alleged perpetrators since, as a result of the application of Law no. 4616, the facts were never established by a competent court of law. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the main purpose of imposing criminal sanctions is to restrain and deter the offender from causing further harm. However, these aims can hardly be obtained without having the facts of the case established by a competent criminal court.",

We have never had any difficulty in finding a violation of the procedural limb of Article 3 in such situations. In certain situations an impression of total impunity may contribute to a dehumanising form of dependence. However, the mere possibility of impunity does not turn private assault into a situation where the protagonists in a fist fight act with a sense of impunity. The impunity offered by Law no. 4616 does not result in commanding supremacy as far as the alleged aggressor is concerned.
