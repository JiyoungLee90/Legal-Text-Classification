The court held that on 15 October 1990 the applicant had left the country although he had known that he was sought by the police. He had not returned and had not informed the competent authorities about his stay abroad. He had illegally obtained a passport with the likely intention of travelling to the United States. The court further noted that the applicant was being prosecuted for a robbery committed while on conditional release in connection with a sentence for a similar offence. This reasonably gave rise to the risk that he would re-offend. The court also found that the applicant could influence witnesses: during his stay in Italy, he had intervened in the investigation procedure and had advised potential witnesses. Moreover, the investigator did not hear the applicant, and it could not be excluded that he would influence his co-accused who were not detained on remand.",

The court recalled that the case had been remitted to the Municipal Prosecutor who would necessarily hear further witnesses whom the applicant could influence, thereby frustrating the investigation of the facts which were of importance for the conduct of the proceedings. The applicant appealed against this decision. He submitted that the Municipal Court had previously stated that there no longer existed specific grounds to believe that he would influence the witnesses or that he would re-offend. He also maintained that the necessity to hear further witnesses could not in itself justify the court\u2019s anxiety that he would influence them and frustrate the criminal proceedings.",
