Notwithstanding the particular role played by the applicant in his capacity as union representative, as well as that his statements, which related to official conduct of a public employee, were as such a matter of public concern, the Court finds that he had a duty to react within limits fixed, inter alia, in the interest of \u201cprotecting the reputation or rights of others\u201d, including the presumption of innocence (see Constantinescu v. Romania, no.\u00a028871/95, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2000VIII).

It further considers that the circumstances of the instant case \u2013 a classic case of defamation of an individual in the context of a debate on a matter of public interest \u2013 presented no justification for the imposition of a prison sentence. Such a sanction, by its very nature, will inevitably have a chilling effect on public discussion, and the notion that the applicant\u2019s sentence was in fact suspended does not alter that conclusion particularly as the conviction itself was not expunged (see, mutatis mutandis, Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116 and Salov v.
