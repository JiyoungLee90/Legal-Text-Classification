To control the crowd, a police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers, and there were numerous clashes between the police and protesters. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered the organisers to finish the meeting early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the protestors from the square.",

Even assuming that the conditions in room no. 334 were similar to those in room no. 338 of the courthouse, the Court notes that there were only four defendants held in a glass cabin measuring about 5.4 square metres, a setting which allowed them at least 1.3 square metres of personal space. Furthermore, the applicant was held in those conditions only for several hours on 27 November 2014, unlike Mr Belousov, who had to endure overcrowding for several hours three days a week for a period of about two months, being permanently exposed to the public in that cramped setting.",

The Court notes that the domestic courts did not specify which of the applicants\u2019 acts were attributable to participation in mass disorder under Article 212 of the Criminal Code, as opposed to use of violence against a public official under Article 318 of the Code. In describing the applicants\u2019 participation in the mass disorder, the courts merely referred to their use of violence against police officers, also classified as a separate criminal offence (see, by contrast, Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 178, where the chanting of anti-government slogans by the applicant constituted participation in acts of mass disorder).",

Just as in Yaroslav Belousov (cited\u00a0above, \u00a7 179), there is nothing in the case files to suggest that the applicants were among those responsible for the initial acts of aggression which contributed to the deterioration of the assembly\u2019s initial peaceful character and the onset of clashes between the protesters and the police. As far as can be discerned from the indictments, the applicants used violence against the police officers at the height of the clashes when the police were already arresting protesters, an act which, according to them, was in response to the indiscriminate and unnecessary use of force by the police. The domestic courts did not establish the particular circumstances in which that behaviour had occurred and dismissed the applicants\u2019 allegations about excessive use of force by the police as unfounded, while leaving their allegations unrebutted. The Court concludes that the applicants were not regarded as among those responsible for the disruption of the assembly or prompting the use of force by the police. The applicants\u2019 conduct therefore, although involving violence, was sporadic in nature and appeared to be a spontaneous reaction to the force used by the police against the protestors, the majority of whom were peaceful. It therefore did not attain the degree of aggression which the Court has found in other cases to amount to violence calling for lengthy prison terms (see, by contrast, Primov and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a017391/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015663, 12 June 2014, and Osmani and Others v.\u00a0the\u00a0Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no.\u00a050841/99, 11\u00a0October 2001).",

While the Court does not endorse the applicants\u2019 violent behaviour and reiterates that the State authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation in sanctioning such actions (see G\u00fclc\u00fc, cited above, \u00a7 116, and Taranenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 19554/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a081-97, 15 May 2014), it considers that the reasons advanced by the Government could not justify two-year and threeyear prison sentences for participation in mass disorder under Article 212 of the Criminal Code.

Nonetheless, as explained above (see notably paragraphs 111 and 117-120), Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 does not exclude the conduct of dual proceedings, even to their term, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In particular, for the Court to be satisfied that there is no duplication of trial or punishment (bis) as proscribed by Article 4 of Protocol No. 7, the respondent State must demonstrate convincingly that the dual proceedings in question have been \u2018sufficiently closely connected in substance and in time\u2019. In other words, it must be shown that they have been combined in an integrated manner so as to form a coherent whole. This implies not only that the purposes pursued and the means used to achieve them should in essence be complementary and linked in time, but also that the possible consequences of organising the legal treatment of the conduct concerned in such a manner should be proportionate and foreseeable for the persons affected.\u201d",

Given that neither the domestic courts nor the Government elaborated on the distinction, this reference alone is insufficient to demonstrate that the different proceedings pursued complementary purposes and thus addressed, not only in abstracto but also in concreto, different aspects of the social misconduct involved (ibid., \u00a7 132). The two sets of proceedings, including the collection and assessment of evidence, were independent of each other. Overall, the conditions for dual criminal and administrative proceedings to be regarded as sufficiently connected in substance and in time were not met in the present case.",
