In Tanr\u0131kulu and Others (cited above), it found that readers of a newspaper whose distribution had been prohibited did not have victim status. Similarly, in Akdeniz (cited above, \u00a7 24), it held that the mere fact that Mr Akdeniz \u2013 like the other users of two music-streaming websites in Turkey \u2013 was indirectly affected by a blocking order could not suffice for him to be acknowledged as a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. In view of those considerations, the answer to the question whether an applicant can claim to be the victim of a measure blocking access to a website will therefore depend on an assessment of the circumstances of each case, in particular the way in which the person concerned uses the website and the potential impact of the measure on him. It is also relevant that the Internet has now become one of the principal means by which individuals exercise their right to freedom to receive and impart information and ideas, providing as it does essential tools for participation in activities and discussions concerning political issues and issues of general interest (see Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, cited above, \u00a7 54).",

They stated, in particular, that through their YouTube accounts they used the platform not only to access videos relating to their professional sphere, but also in an active manner, for the purpose of uploading and sharing files of that nature. The second and third applicants also pointed out that they had published videos on their academic activities. In that respect, the case more closely resembles that of Mr Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, who stated that he published his academic work and his views on various topics on his own website (ibid., \u00a7 51), than that of Mr Akdeniz (see decision cited above), who was acting as a simple website user.",

YouTube, however, not only hosts artistic and musical works, but is also a very popular platform for political speeches and political and social activities. The files shared by YouTube contain information that could be of particular interest to anyone (see, mutatis mutandis, Khurshid Mustafa and Tarzibachi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044). Accordingly, the measure in issue blocked access to a website containing specific information of interest to the applicants that is not easily accessible by other means.

User-generated expressive activity on the Internet provides an unprecedented platform for the exercise of freedom of expression (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR 2015). In this connection, the Court observes that YouTube is a video-hosting website on which users can upload, view and share videos and is undoubtedly an important means of exercising the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas. In particular, as the applicants rightly noted, political content ignored by the traditional media is often shared via YouTube, thus fostering the emergence of citizen journalism. From that perspective, the Court accepts that YouTube is a unique platform on account of its characteristics, its accessibility and above all its potential impact, and that no alternatives were available to the applicants.",

In reaching that conclusion, it mainly had regard to the fact that the individuals concerned, who all had a YouTube account, made active use of the site. In the case of the two applicants in question, it also took into consideration the fact that they taught at universities, carried out research in the field of human rights, used the website to access a range of visual material and shared their research via their YouTube accounts (see paragraphs 25-26 above).",

In this connection, the Court points out that it is not its task to rule in abstracto on the compatibility with the Convention of the legal provisions in force in Turkey at the material or the present time for blocking access to websites. On the contrary, it must assess in concreto what effect the application of the relevant provisions in the present case had on the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.
