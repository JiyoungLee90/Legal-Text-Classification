As a child, he worked illegally in a restaurant and later as a fisherman and a tailor. He claims that he suffered abuse in Pakistan, including by the police, and tried to flee to Iran but was repeatedly abused there and returned to Pakistan. In 2009 or 2010 the first applicant went to Bangladesh and stayed there for a year or slightly longer, living homeless and often abused by the police because he had no documents. During this period he distributed pamphlets for the BNP, a political party, and started to receive threats from supporters of another political party. In 2010 or 2011, he was expelled by the police to India, stayed there two weeks and then crossed into Pakistan. After four months in Pakistan he went to Iran, where he lived and worked for 18\u00a0months. From there he went to Turkey, worked there for another 18\u00a0months and then paid smugglers to bring him to Greece, where he spent two and a half months. In 2015 he crossed on foot into the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then on to Serbia by train.

The psychiatrist intervened at the request of the applicants\u2019 lawyers and was commissioned by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee. In her opinion the psychiatrist stated that the first applicant had left Bangladesh in 2010 partly because of a flood and partly because two political parties had been trying to recruit him. He had been attacked and suffered injuries because of his refusal to do so. The psychiatrist observed that the first applicant was well-oriented, able to focus and recall memories, but showed signs of anxiety, fear and despair. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d).\u00a0With regard to the second applicant, the psychiatrist noted that he had fled his country five years earlier and had worked abroad, during which time his whole family had died in a flood. He had then migrated through several countries in order to restart his life. He was found to be well oriented with no memory loss but with signs of depression, anxiety and despair. He was diagnosed with PTSD and as having an episode of depression. The psychiatrist did not mention any need for medical or psychological treatment.

It had considered the report of the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights published in 2015, the reports of August 2012 and June 2015 issued by the UNHCR concerning Serbia, and also other documents submitted by the applicants. It had established on the basis of those documents that Serbia satisfied the requirements of section 2 (i) of the Asylum Act. The court was satisfied that the asylum authority had established the facts properly and observed the procedural rules, and that the reasons for its decision were clearly stated and were reasonable. The court further emphasised that the statements given by the applicants at the hearings had been contradictory and incoherent. The first applicant had given various reasons for leaving his country and made confusing statements on whether he had received any documents from the Serbian authorities. The document he had finally produced was not in his name, and therefore could not be admitted as evidence. At no point during the administrative procedure had he referred to the conduct of the human traffickers before his hearing by the court. The second applicant\u2019s statements were incoherent on the issue of the duration of his stay in Serbia and the submission of a request for asylum.

The applicants expressed their wish to appeal and remain in Hungary and signed an appeal. The UNHCR staff left. In the early afternoon the police and the asylum authorities told the applicants, with the help of an Afghan man who could speak some Urdu, that the court had decided that they should go back to Serbia. The applicants replied that they did not want to go to Serbia and that the UN staff had told them that they might be able to stay for two months in Hungary. They handed a copy of the appeal they had signed but the authorities refused to take it. The police insisted and said that the applicants could choose between voluntary departure or detention and forceful handing over to the Serbian police. The applicants felt threatened and thought that they risked violence. They decided to leave. The police told them to cross into Serbia via the forest and not through the official checkpoint. As they were being led out of the transit zone the UNHCR staff arrived and conversed with the police who told them that the applicants had decided to leave Hungary voluntarily and also that they would not be escorted all the way and across to the Serbian side of the border. Serbian border police had informed the UNHCR staff and the Hungarian police officer that the applicants would not be allowed to enter Serbia through the official checkpoint without documents and that the only possibility would be to try to enter through the \u201cgreen border\u201d. The UNHCR representative made telephone calls to arrange for the applicants to be met at the other side of the border. The applicants were escorted only to the exit of the transit zone and given directions by the Hungarian police to go alone to the right, along the fence. No force was used. The UNHCR staff insisted and were eventually allowed to tell the two applicants that they would be met at the Serbian side of the border for which they had to go in another direction \u2013 to the left towards the highway and the Horgos border crossing on the Serbian side. This was communicated to the applicants. The applicants crossed the border as directed by the UNHCR and not through the forest. Serbian police officers were present when they crossed and only told them to wait for the UNHCR staff coming to meet them. The applicants were met by UNHCR staff who helped them.",

The section for single men comprised one row of containers placed adjacent to each other, sharing an approximately 2-metre-wide corridor. Persons who stayed in one section could go to other parts of the zone only to visit the doctor or to attend interviews with the asylum authorities, and were always escorted by guards, even inside the transit zone. Also, at the time of the visit in June 2017 the Hungarian authorities had informed the Special Representative that the average duration of a stay in the zone had been 33\u00a0days, but he had spoken with individuals who had mentioned periods of confinement of two and more months.

Given the location of the transit zones at the Hungarian-Serbian border over 99% of asylum applications, without an in-merit consideration of the protection claims, have been rejected on this basis by the Office of Immigration and Nationality (OIN). Moreover, the clear EU procedural violations that this process gives rise to have been documented by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee as well as ECRE. From the latest statistics this process is still in full swing with the Commissioner for Human Rights submitting that between mid-September and the end of November 2015, 311 out of the 372 inadmissible decisions taken at both the border and in accelerated procedures were found as such on the safe third country concept ground. With a clear lack of an effective remedy against such a decision available and an immediate accompanying entry ban for 1 or 2 years, various actors as well as the judiciary have argued that Hungary is in breach of its non-refoulement obligations.\u201d",

UNHCR participated in the drafting process, in an effort to ensure that the legislation is in line with international standards. The law currently incorporates many key provisions of the 1951 Convention. Furthermore, the provisions on subsidiary protection in the law are in conformity with relevant EU standards. The law also provides for certain rights up to the standard of nationals for those who benefit from international protection, as well as free legal aid during all stages of the asylum procedure. Nevertheless, some key provisions are still not in line with international standards. In response to a sharp increase in irregular migration, the Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection was recently further amended to change the previously restrictive regulations for applying for asylum in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which exposed asylumseekers to a risk of arbitrary detention and push-backs at the border. The new amendments, which were adopted on 18 June 2015, introduce a procedure for registration of the intention to submit an asylum application at the border, protect asylum-seekers from the risk of refoulement and allow them to enter and be in the country legally for a short timeframe of 72 hours, before formally registering their asylum application.",

Other practices in Serbia noted by the UN bodies and NGOs included penalising readmitted third-country nationals for illegal border crossing despite their asylum-seeker status, and a risk of harassment and abuse.

However, in an era of globalisation the perception that everyone had a right to move to the EU to enjoy the benefits of a welfare State spread quickly, and it was becoming impossible to stop fake refugees from entering the EU while observing the standards advocated by the UNHCR. The practical impossibility of removing undocumented migrants who were not entitled to international protection had rendered immigration uncontrollable. This was causing social tension, a feeling of powerlessness and a sense of loss of sovereignty in affected States. Asylum-shopping diverted resources from the search for collective solutions by the international community to the resettlement of refugees or improving their situation in the first safe country. In this respect, asylum-shopping was contrary to Article 17 of the Convention.",

The Government warned against elevating the requirements of that provision in the reception context beyond the requisite catering for the most basic human needs, given, in particular, that transit zones provide only temporary accommodation. As regards the applicants\u2019 allegations concerning their suffering in a number of Asian countries, the Government observed that they were articulated for the first time before the Grand Chamber and were unverifiable.",

In this regard the Court finds unconvincing the Government\u2019s argument, based on section 66(6) of the same law, that the applicants were free to spend time in Serbia and then have the asylum proceedings in Hungary resumed if they came back to the transit zone within nine months. No such example has been cited by the respondent Government and there is nothing to indicate that the applicants were informed of such a possibility when they were at the R\u00f6szke transit zone. To the contrary, as confirmed by the respondent Government in their written observations to the Grand Chamber, the applicants had to remain at the disposal of the Hungarian asylum authorities and, therefore, in the transit zone, pending examination of the admissibility of their asylum requests, which, moreover, depended on an assessment of whether they could safely be returned to Serbia.",

In the circumstances of the present case and in contrast to the situation that obtained in some of the cases concerning airport transit zones, and notably in Amuur (cited above), the risk of the applicants\u2019 forfeiting the examination of their asylum claims in Hungary and their fears about insufficient access to asylum procedures in Serbia, while relevant with regard to Article 3, did not render the applicants\u2019 possibility of leaving the transit zone in the direction of Serbia merely theoretical.

The cases cited in paragraph 221 of the judgment did not relate to asylum-seekers, never mind any choice on the part of such persons to agree to detention. It should also be emphasised that the word \u201cchoice\u201d means something completely different in connection with asylum-seekers from when it is used in the cases cited by the majority in paragraph 221. An asylum-seeker wants protection, and his asylum request concerns the protection of a right secured under the Convention, namely the right not to suffer treatment contrary to Article 3, or else Article 2. This process concerns a necessity, not a choice. We can see from European history that such \u201cchoices\u201d have cost hundreds of people their lives. I therefore find it difficult to conceive of the fact of asylum-seekers crossing a border as a \u201cchoice\u201d. The majority seem here to be adopting a position rejected by the Court in its Amuur judgment. For those reasons I consider that the Chamber, in the judgment which it delivered on 14 March 2017 in the present case, was right to reach the following conclusion as set out in paragraph 56 of its judgment:",

Furthermore, the Grand Chamber unanimously found a violation, albeit only a procedural one, of Article 3, on the grounds that the Hungarian authorities had decided to return the applicants to Serbia without conducting a prior detailed individual assessment. It chose not to pronounce on the merits of the question whether the applicants would have suffered treatment contrary to Article 3 had they been returned to Serbia. I therefore consider that to conclude that the applicants would have faced no risks is mere speculation. In my view, this no-risk finding as set out in paragraph 223 is conjectural, or indeed contradictory, if we consider paragraph 165 of the judgment. In my view the majority is circumventing the subsidiarity principle in order to reach a conclusion, which should have been a matter for the Hungarian national authorities, on the risks likely to be faced by the applicants in Serbia.",

This paragraph does not concern the means of transport used, contrary to what paragraphs 240 and 241 of the judgment might suggest, but rather relates to a fundamental aspect of Article 3 in this sphere, namely the absence of any risk in the event of return. The Grand Chamber concludes that the applicants could not have lawfully entered Serbia and that the Hungarian authorities failed duly to assess the real risks which the applicants would have faced had they been returned to Serbia. Yet it accepts that the applicants had a practical possibility of returning to Serbia, to a situation of illegality in which they could have been exposed to risks under Article 3. This reasoning leads me to conclude that the applicability of Article 5 also depends on the means of transport chosen by the asylumseeker to reach the border!",
