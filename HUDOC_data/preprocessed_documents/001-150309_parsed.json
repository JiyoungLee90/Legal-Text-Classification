If, after a fair main hearing in which the accused had been able to exercise his defence rights, the suspicions against the accused had not been dispelled, but could also not be proven in accordance with the law, he had a right to an acquittal in the operative provisions of the judgment. In contrast, the accused did not have any further rights in respect of the reasons given by the domestic court for its judgment. An acquittal for lack of evidence, such as in the present case, could be pronounced despite the fact that substantial suspicions remained against the accused. Such an acquittal was therefore of a procedural nature, in the sense that the procedural requirements for a finding of guilt had not been met. Contrary to an acquittal after proof that the accused was not guilty, it did not morally rehabilitate the accused, who did not have a right to be cleared of all suspicions under Article 6 \u00a7 2.",

It emerges from the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 36 above) that, at that stage of the proceedings, the trial court is not precluded by the presumption of innocence to voice remaining suspicions against the accused when acquitting him of the charges on account of insufficiency of proof. This can be deducted from the prohibition on voicing any suspicions of guilt, including those expressed in the reasons for the acquittal (emphasis added), once an acquittal has become final (ibid.). However, under the Court\u2019s case-law, the protection afforded by the presumption of innocence ceases only once an accused has properly been proved guilty of the offence charged with (see paragraph 37 above), which is never the case if he is acquitted. Consequently, the presumption of innocence applies to the reasons given in a judgment acquitting the accused in its operative provisions, from which the reasoning cannot be dissociated (see, in particular, T.H. v. Sweden, cited above; and compare Adolf, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a038-39, both referred to in paragraph 34 above).

The Regional Court stated that it was not convinced by A.\u2019s testimony in the hearing that the charges were completely correct, in particular, in terms of a clear definition of the criminal acts and their time. Owing to the inconsistencies in A.\u2019s statements, it had been impossible to establish precise facts, in particular in respect of the intensity of the applicant\u2019s acts, as necessary for their classification as an offence, but also in respect of the number of acts and the place and the time frame in which they were carried out. The Regional Court therefore did not consider the applicant proven guilty, in accordance with the law, of the criminal offences as defined in the Criminal Code he had been charged with. On the other hand, and despite these findings, the Regional Court, considering that A. had not been influenced by third persons, made its impugned statement that the core events described by the victim had a factual basis and that the accused actually carried out sexual assaults on his daughter in his car.",

It refers in this context to its above case-law that the voicing of any suspicions of guilt, including those expressed in the reasons for the acquittal, is incompatible with the presumption of innocence after the applicant\u2019s final acquittal. Every authority which refers, directly or indirectly, to his criminal responsibility in respect of the offences he was charged with must respect the operative provisions of the Regional Court\u2019s judgment acquitting him (compare paragraph 36 above).",

However, in view of the potential relevance of the reasoning of a criminal court\u2019s judgment for subsequent legal proceedings, it is of critical importance to avoid in that judgment any reasoning suggesting that the court considers the accused as guilty even in the absence of any formal finding of guilt. Only in that manner the protection guaranteed by the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 is rendered practical and effective (compare for the relevant case-law, inter alia, Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a025424/09, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2013 with further references).",
