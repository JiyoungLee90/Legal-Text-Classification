The case originated in eleven applications (nos. 22486/05, 40959/05, 18279/07, 61921/08, 3960/09, 7716/09, 5608/09, 10192/09, 13746/09, 28951/09 and 52614/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eleven Russian nationals. The application numbers, the dates of lodging the applications and the dates of their communication, the applicants’ names, their personal details and the names of their legal representatives, as well as the information concerning the relevant domestic judgments, are set out in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants each alleged that they had been convicted of drug offences following entrapment by the police in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. Mr Dimitriyev and Mr Dymov (applications nos. 7716/09 and 28951/09) also complained under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that they had not been able to examine witnesses against them.
On the dates indicated in the Appendix the applications were communicated to the Government and were assigned to a Committee of three judges.
On 2 November 2008 Mr Ulyanov (application no. 22486/05) died. In a letter of 3 September 2009 the applicant’s mother, Ms Ulyanova, expressed her wish to pursue the application on her late son’s behalf.
On 21 May 2011 Mr Kodola (application no. 3960/09) died. In a letter of 14 July 2012 the applicant’s mother, Ms Kodola, expressed her wish to pursue the application on her late son’s behalf.
In letters of 5 November 2009 and 14 August 2012 respectively the Government disagreed, stating that the proceedings before the Court in respect of Mr Ulyanov and Mr Kodola should be discontinued because of their death, and that their relatives did not have a sufficient legitimate interest to justify further examination of the cases.
The applicants were each targeted in undercover operations conducted by the police in the form of a test purchase of drugs under sections 7 and 8 of the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995 (no. 144-FZ). Those operations led to their criminal convictions for drug dealing.
The applicants disagreed with their convictions and argued that the police had incited them to commit drug-related offences.
The relevant domestic law governing the use of undercover operations at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Lagutin and Others v. Russia (nos. 6228/09, 19123/09, 19678/07, 52340/08 and 7451/09, 24 April 2014); Veselov and Others v. Russia (nos. 23200/10, 24009/07 and 556/10, 2 October 2012); Bannikova v. Russia (no. 18757/06, 14 October 2010); Vanyan v. Russia (no. 53203/99, 15 December 2005); and Khudobin v. Russia (no. 59696/00, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)).
