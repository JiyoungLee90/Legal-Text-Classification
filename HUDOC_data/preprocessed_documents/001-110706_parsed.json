In particular, it is not the Court\u2019s function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see,\u00a0among many others, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a7 2829, ECHR\u00a01999I). Further, the Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, while Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires courts to give reasons for their decisions, this is not to be understood as requiring a detailed reply to every argument (see Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 288). The extent of this obligation may vary depending on the nature of the decision and must be analysed in the light of the circumstances of each case (Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I).",

Moreover, having regard to the judgments of the domestic courts, which deal clearly and unambiguously with the various points that were submitted by the applicant, it does not appear that the domestic courts failed in their obligation to give reasons. Thus, there is no indication that the applicant\u2019s arguments were not heard by the domestic courts.",
