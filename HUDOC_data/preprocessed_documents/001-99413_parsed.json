In its section 2 the Act of 20 February 2009 contained a transitional provision according to which a complaint against excessive length of investigation was available to those complainants who, as with the applicant in the present case, had lodged an application with the Strasbourg Court alleging a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of unreasonable length of the proceedings, provided that their application to the Court had been lodged in the course of the investigation and that the Court had not yet adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. The complaint under the transitional provisions had to be lodged within six months of the entry into force of the amended provisions, even if the proceedings in question had meanwhile been terminated.",
