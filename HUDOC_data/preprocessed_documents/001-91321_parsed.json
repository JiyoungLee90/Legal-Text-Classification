The Court further observes that the applicant\u2019s subsequent attempts to challenge the quashing in a new round of the supervisory review proceedings proved unsuccessful, and, in any event, were provoked by the overturning of the final judgment in his favour. Finally, as regards the alleged impact of the recalculation of the pension in March 2007 on the applicant\u2019s victim status, the Court notes that the adjustment only concerned the pension the applicant had received as from 1 January 2005, while the quashed judgment awarded him such pension with the effect as from 1 January 2001, and the amount he had to repay represented arrears in respect of 2001-2003. The alleged violation was not recognised and no redress was afforded. Thus, the pension increase as from 2005 did not have any impact on his victim status.
