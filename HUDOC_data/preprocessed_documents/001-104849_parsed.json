However, despite the defects in the investigation enumerated above, the domestic courts dismissed their complaints. In any event, as has already been pointed out, the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities\u2019 failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures. The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the kidnapping. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
