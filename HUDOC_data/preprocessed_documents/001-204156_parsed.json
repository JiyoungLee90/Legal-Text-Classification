It is also evident that, having regard to the powers vested in the MNS and the prosecuting authorities, the applicant and T.Z.\u2019s wife clearly brought their complaints to the attention of the relevant domestic authorities and provided them with the opportunity to investigate, establish the facts and, in case of criminal behaviour on the part of State agents, punish them in accordance with the law.",

Assessment of this minimum level depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0162, Series A no. 25; Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 91, ECHR\u00a02000-XI; and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2001-III). The Court has considered treatment to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 92). In determining whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be classified as torture, consideration must be given to the distinction, embodied in Article 3, between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of such a distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering. In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element to torture, as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture, which in Article 1 defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2010).",

Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured afterwards, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni, cited above, \u00a7 87, and Mustafa Hajili v.

As a result, the applicant or other family members were refused information about the circumstances and causes of the death of their close relative and, moreover, prevented from disputing the findings of the forensic expert. Such a refusal can constitute a flagrant disregard by the authorities of their procedural obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, which require accessibility and public scrutiny of an investigation as an element of its effectiveness (see, as regards the procedural complaint, paragraphs 82 and 86 below). For purposes of the substantive limb of Article 3, the Court finds particularly striking that instead of providing full information to T.Z.\u2019s family regarding the circumstances of his death, the authorities repeatedly accused them of defamation, which could be understood as entailing a threat to open proceedings against them, in response to their attempts to exercise their procedural rights (see paragraphs 14 and 19 above).

If the authorities then fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn.

Those omissions in the forensic examination are particularly relevant in the context of Article 2 of the Convention, since as the forensic expert failed to record the injuries on T.Z.\u2019s body, he did not analyse the question whether there may have been a causal link between those injuries and T.Z.\u2019s death.",

The Court reiterates that, while it generally requires proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, in situations where knowledge of the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, with the authorities, as in the case of persons in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention.
