Turkey, no.\u00a035962/97, \u00a7\u00a077, 21\u00a0December 2006). Nevertheless, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the detainee\u2019s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Sheydayev v. Russia, no.\u00a065859/01, \u00a7\u00a059, 7\u00a0December 2006, and Ribitsch v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0336, \u00a7 38). The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no.\u00a025, pp. 64-65, \u00a7 161). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

The Court notes, and it is uncontested by the parties, that the officers had recourse to an immobilisation technique in respect of the applicant. At the same time, it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been beaten up or that rubber truncheons or other special means or weapons had been used against him (see, by contrast, Dedovskiy and Others v. Russia, no. 7178/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-79, 15\u00a0May 2008). Neither is there any medical evidence for the applicant\u2019s argument that he sustained injuries or that the use of force against him exceeded the minimum level of severity required in order to raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention and that it was disproportionate. The report on the use of force referred only to verbal insults and threats. Two out of three officers made statements justifying their use of force only with reference to those circumstances. One officer also mentioned that the applicant accompanied his utterances by swinging his hands and calling for a riot. It also appears that the squad\u2019s presence on the premises of the colony had been duly authorised and that the officers had been advised of the applicable rules on the use of force. During the search the applicant was warned that his unruly behaviour and resistance would give rise to the use of force against him. However, he failed to obey the lawful orders. In his decision of 21\u00a0January 2002 refusing institution of criminal proceedings against the officers the assistance prosecutor confirmed the above facts and also indicated that the applicant had assaulted the officers both verbally and physically (see paragraph 16 above).",

Until 1 January 2003 the procedure for supervisory review was prescribed by the 1960 Code of Criminal Procedure. According to Article 377 thereof, a supervisory-instance court had to decide whether the convict\u2019s and/or his counsel\u2019s presence was necessary at the hearing. If that presence was necessary, the attending persons had to be served with a copy of the supervisory review request. The \u2019s ruling of 14\u00a0February 2000 on Article 377 of the Code only concerned supervisory review requests which would be prejudicial to a convict\u2019s position (see paragraph 22 above).

On 2\u00a0December 2002 the Presidium of the  held that the 1992 conviction had indeed been cancelled in 1997 and should not have been taken into consideration when the trial court decided whether there had been recidivism. It concluded that the applicant\u2019s acts under review had constituted dangerous rather than \u201cparticularly\u201d dangerous recidivism, and changed the type of the correctional facility in which the applicant was to serve his sentence. The prison term, however, remained unchanged. Although the scope of the above proceedings was limited to the questions of the applicant\u2019s sentence and the prison regime rather than amendment of the conviction due to a different legal categorisation of his actions, the Court considers that those proceedings nevertheless concerned a determination of the \u201ccriminal charge\u201d against the applicant (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I, p.\u00a0279, \u00a7\u00a069; see, by contrast, Gutfreund v. , no.\u00a045681/99, \u00a7\u00a032, ECHR 2003VII, and Aydin v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a041954/98, 14 September 2000). Indeed, there was no disagreement between the parties on that point. Under the applicable legislation, a supervisory-instance court was not bound by the scope of a request for supervisory review and was under an obligation to exercise a full review of the case (see paragraph 23 above). It could dismiss the application for supervisory review, quash the conviction and/or the appeal judgment, discontinue the criminal proceedings, or amend any of the earlier decisions. As can be seen from the text of the supervisory review ruling in the applicant\u2019s case, the supervisory-instance court not only amended the trial and appeal judgments but also upheld them \u201cin the remaining part\u201d. Thus, the Court has no doubts that the proceedings in question fell within the ambit of Article 6.",

France, judgment of 17\u00a0December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2147, \u00a7\u00a022). According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the principle of equality of arms requires that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-a\u0300-vis his opponent (see, among other authorities, De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 238, \u00a7 53). The Court also reiterates that the principle of equality of arms does not depend on further, quantifiable unfairness flowing from a procedural inequality (see Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, \u00a7\u00a049, and Asnar v.  (no.\u00a02), no.\u00a012316/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a024-28, 18\u00a0October 2007). It is a matter for the defence to assess whether a submission deserves a reaction. It is therefore unfair for the prosecution to make submissions to a court without the knowledge of the defence (see APEH \u00dcld\u00f6z\u00f6tteinek Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge and Others v. Hungary, no. 32367/96, \u00a7\u00a042, ECHR 2000-X). This position is not altered when the observations are neutral on the issue to be decided by the court (see G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036590/97, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2002-V). The Court considers that this principle does not lose its importance when the submissions in question appear to be favourable to the defence.",
