The case originated in an application (no. 72704/01) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Aleksandr Olegovich Dolgov (“the applicant”), on 30 December 2000.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms Valeria Lutkovska, succeeded by Ms Zoryana Bortnovska.
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
The applicant’s complaints under Articles 6 § 1 of the Convention were communicated to the respondent Government on 11 February 2003. On the same date the Court decided that Article 29 § 3 of the Convention should be applied and the admissibility and merits of the case be considered together.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on admissibility and merits (Rule 54A).
The applicant, Mr Aleksandr Olegovich Dolgov, is a Ukrainian national, who was born on 2 March 1958 in Illovaisk and currently resides there.
In September 1999 the applicant lodged two complaints with the Labour Disputes Commission (the “Commission”) of the State Joint Stock Company Illovayskaya Mine (his former employer – hereafter the “Mine”) seeking reimbursement of salary arrears in the amount of UAH 1,535.02 for work he had performed in 1997 and 1999.
On 19 October 1999 the Commission held that the first part of the complaint should be allowed and the Mine should pay the applicant UAH 687.61 in arrears for September, October, November and December 1997.
On 11 November 1999 the Commission ordered the Mine to pay the wages due to the applicant. On 6 December 1999 the Khartsyzsk City Baillifs initiated execution proceedings on the basis of this order. However, it was not executed due to the Mine’s lack of funds.
In February 2000 the applicant lodged an application with the Mine, seeking termination of his employment contract.
On 7 March 2000 the applicant again lodged complaints with the Commission, seeking to recover the wages owed to him on termination of his employment and the enforcement of the decision of 11 November 1999.
On 16 May 2000 the Commission examined the second complaint of the applicant and ordered that the debts amounting to UAH 847.42 be paid to the applicant (for the period of March, May, June, September, October and November 1999).
On 14 June 2000 the Commission issued certificates Nos. 42 (for UAH 687.61) and 43 (for UAH 847.42) acknowledging the Mine’s debts to the applicant.
On 10 August 2000 the Khartsyzsk State Baillifs initiated execution proceedings (виконавче провадження) on the basis of these certificates. The Baillifs set a time-limit for their enforcement, but the Commission’s decisions were not executed due to the Mine’s lack of funds.
On 12 June 2002 the  instituted bankruptcy proceedings against the Mine and held that a moratorium should be imposed on the forced sale of the Mine’s property.
On 5 August 2003 the Government informed the Court that the bankruptcy proceedings were still pending.
On 24 November 2003 the Khartsyzsk City Court rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaints regarding the Baillifs’ failure to enforce the decisions and his claim for compensation for moral damage. This judgment was not appealed and thus became final.
On 22 January 2004 the Mine paid UAH 1,535.00 to the applicant, being the full amount of the salary arrears owed to him, in compliance with the Commission’s decisions.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).
