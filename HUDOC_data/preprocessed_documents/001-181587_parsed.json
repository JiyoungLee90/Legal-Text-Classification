As regards the domestic remedy introduced by the Compensation Act, the Court notes that the applicant made an attempt to lodge such a claim, and the domestic courts returned the application to him without examining its merits, for the applicant\u2019s failure to comply with formal requirements. Without assessing the relevant proceedings, the Court reiterates its settled approach that in any event it would be unfair to request the applicants whose cases have already been pending for many years in the domestic system and who have come to seek relief at the Court to bring again their claims before domestic tribunals (see, for similar reasoning, Fateyenkov and Others v. Russia, nos. 44099/04 and 9 others, 18 February 2016, with further references).

In the decision Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev the Court noted that it could exceptionally decide, for the sake of fairness and effectiveness, to conclude its proceedings by a judgment in certain cases of this kind which had remained on its list for a long time or had already reached an advanced stage of proceedings (ibid., \u00a7\u00a041).",

Furthermore, for an unexplained reason he chose to bring the domestic Compensation Act proceedings in respect of his length complaint (see paragraph\u00a032 above), but not in relation to his nonenforcement grievance. Even after the Government in their observations dated 30\u00a0October 2012 had pointed out that such possibility still existed for the applicant at the material time (see paragraphs 32 and 52 above), the applicant did not lodge the relevant application. The Court has no reason to doubt that the applicant was entitled to use the Compensation Act during the statutory period indicated by the Government for lodging such applications.",
