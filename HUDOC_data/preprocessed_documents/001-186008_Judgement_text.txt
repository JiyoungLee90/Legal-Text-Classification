The case originated in two applications (nos. 29899/07 and 33333/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Fermani Çetin, and Mr Soncan Gedik (“the applicants”), on 13 June 2007 and 10 June 2008 respectively.
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 August 2007 and 10 October 2008 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The applicants are Turkish nationals and at the time of lodging their applications they were serving their prison sentences in various establishments.
The names and dates of birth of the applicants, as well as the names of their representatives appear in the appendix.
The applicants were found guilty of breaching prison order by decisions of the respective disciplinary boards of prisons in which they were held. Pursuant to the Regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, the applicants were sentenced respectively between 11 to 12 days’ solitary confinement on the orders of the respective Prison Disciplinary Boards (referred hereafter as “the board”).
Their objections were subsequently rejected by the Enforcement Judges and the Assize Courts, on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicants or their lawyers, pursuant to Law no. 4675 on Enforcement Judges, dated 16 May 2001.
