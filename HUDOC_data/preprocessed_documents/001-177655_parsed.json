Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27 May 2004). Where a judgment is against the State, the defendant State authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed thereof and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for compliance (see Akashev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30616/05, \u00a7 21, 12\u00a0June 2008). The complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure or of the State budgetary system cannot relieve the State of its obligation under the Convention to guarantee to everyone the right to have a binding and enforceable judicial decision enforced within a reasonable time (Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

He submitted a calculation of his claims. It was based on the amount of the main debt, calculated by the applicant as 280,788 Russian roubles, multiplied by the consumer price index in the Stavropol Region for the period from May 2001 until November 2015. The applicant submitted a letter from the Stavropol Regional Department of the State Statistics of 26\u00a0November 2015 showing the consumer price index for each month during the reference period. At the same time, the applicant did not explain the method of his calculation of the amount of the main debt in accordance with the judgment of 3 May 2001. The applicant also claimed that the judgment 3 May 2001 in his favour should be enforced, and EUR 50,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

They pointed out that the applicant\u2019s calculation of the debt payable under the initial judgment had been wrong, and, therefore, the inflation losses claimed by him were excessive. At the same time, the Government did not contest in principle the method of the applicant\u2019s calculation of the pecuniary damage in this part and the index applied to the amount of the main debt. They submitted no alternative calculation of pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the depreciation of that amount.

The Court reiterates that the best redress in respect of the violation found would be to put the applicant as far as possible in the position he would have been if the Convention requirements had not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government shall secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 3 May 2001 in the parts, in which it remained unenforced.",
