The case originated in an application (no. 17039/13) against the Republic of Finland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Pavel Vladimirovic Rinas (“the applicant”), on 5 March 2013.
The applicant was represented by Mr Seppo Jääskeläinen, a lawyer practising in Espoo. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the ne bis in idem principle had been violated in his case.
On 3 December 2013 the complaint concerning the ne bis in idem principle was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Vantaa.
.  In 1998 the applicant’s Finnish company was subjected to a tax inspection but the tax authorities found no irregularities.
.  In 2004 and 2005 the applicant was again subjected to a tax inspection of his foreign companies. The preliminary tax inspection report was issued on 5 December 2005. The tax inspection was concluded with a final report on 27 February 2006.
.  On 22 December 2005 the tax authorities imposed on the applicant additional taxes as well as tax surcharges (veronkorotus, skatteförhöjning) for the tax year 1999 for having received disguised dividends from the foreign companies. The tax surcharges amounted to 6,727 euros (EUR).
.  By letter dated 19 February 2006 the applicant sought rectification from the local Tax Rectification Committee (verotuksen oikaisulautakunta, prövningsnämnden i beskattningsärenden), requesting it to quash the decision of 22 December 2005 concerning the tax year 1999.
.  On 26 June 2006 the tax authorities imposed on the applicant additional taxes and tax surcharges for the tax years 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004 for having received disguised dividends from the foreign companies. The amount of tax surcharges varied between EUR 824 and EUR 5,000.
.  By letter dated 25 August 2006 the applicant sought rectification from the local Tax Rectification Committee, requesting it to quash the decisions of 26 June 2006 concerning the tax years 2000 and 2002 to 2004.
.  On 4 October 2006 the Tax Rectification Committee rejected the applicant’s applications concerning the tax imposed for the tax years 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004.
.  By letter dated 31 December 2009 the applicant appealed against the rectification decisions of 4 October 2006 to the Helsinki Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen), requesting that the taxation decisions be quashed and the tax surcharges withdrawn. He also requested that an oral hearing be held.
.  On 8 April 2011 the Helsinki Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeals as well as the request for an oral hearing. The court found that it was not necessary to hold an oral hearing as the same witnesses had already been heard by the District Court and the Appeal Court in the same matter. The court examined the appeal concerning the tax years 1999, 2000 and 2002 as a material appeal (perustevalitus, grundbesvär) and the rest as ordinary appeals.
.  By letter dated 7 June 2011 the applicant appealed against the Administrative Court decision to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Administrative Court. Moreover, he pointed out that the charges had already been dismissed by the Appeal Court for the tax years 1999 to 2000 without examining the merits and that this fact should prevent the further examination of these matters by the administrative courts.
.  On 13 September 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.
.  By letter dated 15 April 2005 the tax authorities asked the police to investigate whether the applicant had committed aggravated tax fraud between 1999 and 2005 concerning the tax years 1998 to 2004.
.  On 17 November 2008 the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant, inter alia, for aggravated tax fraud (törkeä veropetos, grovt skattebedrägeri) concerning the tax years 1999 to 2000 and 2002 to 2004. According to the charges, the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as he had failed to declare in his personal taxation income received from the foreign companies and, consequently, the tax imposed on him had been too low. The tax authorities joined the charges and presented a compensation claim totalling EUR 48,870 which was the amount of avoided taxes still unpaid.
.  On 12 June 2009 the Vantaa District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) convicted the applicant of aggravated tax fraud, and imposed a suspended prison sentence of 1 year and 6 months. He was ordered to pay the tax authorities the EUR 48,870 claimed, plus interest, in compensation.
.  By letter dated 14 August 2009 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Appeal Court (hovioikeus, hovrätten), requesting that the District Court judgment be quashed and the charges dismissed. He also requested that an oral hearing be held.
On 21 December 2010 the Helsinki Appeal Court, after having held an oral hearing, dismissed the charges concerning the tax years 1999 to 2000 without examining the merits but otherwise upheld the District Court’s judgment. The sentence imposed was reduced to a 10-month suspended sentence. The compensation to be paid to the tax authorities was reduced to EUR 10,718 plus interest. The court raised ex officio the question of ne bis in idem. It found that the charge of aggravated tax fraud and the tax surcharges imposed clearly concerned the same failure to declare income. As the time-limit for applying for rectification within the taxation proceedings in respect of the tax years 1999 and 2000 had already run out before the charges were brought, the taxation had become final and these years could no longer be the subject of criminal proceedings. Therefore the charges had to be dismissed without examining the merits. However, as the charges had been brought before the time-limit ran out in respect of the tax years 2002 to 2004, there was no impediment to examining the charges in respect of these tax years.
.  By letter dated 20 February 2011 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Appeal Court. Moreover, he noted that the Appeal Court’s interpretation of the finality of the taxation decisions could not be tied to the time-limit for lodging an application for rectification because in the present case the Tax Rectification Committee had already rejected such applications in 2006.
.  On 12 September 2011 the Supreme Court granted the applicant leave to appeal as far as the charges concerned the tax years 2002 to 2004.
.  On 31 May 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the Appeal Court judgment. It found that the tax rectification decisions could not have become final before the time-limit for lodging an application for rectification had run out because the same time-limit also applied for lodging a further appeal to the administrative courts. As, at the time of bringing charges, the applicant still had a right to appeal to the administrative courts, which he had in fact exercised after the charges had been brought, the taxation decisions for the tax years 2002 to 2004 had not yet become final.
.  Section 57, subsection 1, of the Tax Assessment Procedure Act (laki verotusmenettelystä, lagen om beskattningsförfarande, Act no. 1558/1995, as amended by Act no. 1079/2005) provides that if a person has failed to make the required tax returns or has given incomplete, misleading or false information to the tax authorities and tax has therefore been incompletely or partially levied, the taxpayer shall be ordered to pay unpaid taxes together with additional tax and a tax surcharge.
.  According to Chapter 29, sections 1 and 2, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen, as amended by Acts no. 1228/1997 and no. 769/1990), a person who (1) gives a tax authority false information on a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (2) files a tax return concealing a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (3) for the purpose of avoiding tax, fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation, influencing the assessment of tax, or (4) acts otherwise fraudulently and thereby causes or attempts to cause a tax not to be assessed, or too low a tax to be assessed or a tax to be unduly refunded, shall be sentenced for tax fraud to a fine or to imprisonment for a period of up to two years. If by the tax fraud (1) considerable financial benefit is sought or (2) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period between four months and four years.
.  The Supreme Court has taken a stand on the ne bis in idem principle in its precedent case KKO 2010:46 which concerned tax surcharges and aggravated tax fraud. In that case it found, inter alia, that even though a final judgment in a taxation case, in which tax surcharges had been imposed, prevented criminal charges being brought about the same matter, such preventive effect could not be applied to pending cases (lis pendens) crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa. However, in July 2013 the Supreme Court reversed its line of interpretation, finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter (KKO 2013:59).
.  The Act on Tax Surcharges and Customs Duty Surcharges Imposed by a Separate Decision (laki erillisellä päätöksellä määrättävästä veron- tai tullinkorotuksesta, lagen om skatteförhöjning och tullhöjning som påförs genom ett särskilt beslut, Act no. 781/2013) entered into force on 1 December 2013. According to the Act, the tax authorities can, when making a tax decision, assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police. The tax authorities can decide not to impose a tax surcharge. If they have not reported the matter to the police, a tax surcharge can be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision. If the tax authorities have imposed tax surcharges, they can no longer report the same matter to the police unless, after imposing the tax surcharges, they have received evidence of new or recently revealed facts. If the tax authorities have reported the matter to the police, tax surcharges can, as a rule, no longer be imposed. The purpose of the Act is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in only one set of proceedings. The Act does not, however, contain any transitional provisions extending its scope retroactively.
