I was arrested, detained in a psychiatric cell, my flat was provocatively searched for \u2018drugs\u2019, my telephone calls were tapped, a car damaged. After such compromising events, a politician of such a calibre in the West would have had to leave. But here he still felt good \u2013 and the Sejm decided not to dismiss him! I can imagine what sort of arrangements must have existed in the Sejm to make such a decision! I was so shocked by this that I was ready to go abroad as nothing could be changed. A turning point came when the President dissolved the Parliament. People started to telephone and write letters asking me to stand in the elections. They were saying that the events which had taken place a year ago showed that I could fight. I am convinced that I am not the only one touched by the breaches of the law committed by the representatives of \u2018the new democracy\u2019. However, the law is the same for everybody, regardless of whether somebody is in power or is \u2018an ordinary man\u2019. This fundamental rule of democracy must be respected!\u201d",

The Court reiterates that the right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article\u00a03 of Protocol No. 1, is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime (see, Melnychenko v. , no. 17707/02, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2004...). It enshrines a fundamental principle for effective political democracy, is accordingly of prime importance in the Convention system and is crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 113, p. 22, \u00a7\u00a047; Hirst v.\u00a0the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a074025/01, \u00a7\u00a058, ECHR 2005...).",

Accordingly, the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration the crucial importance of free political debate in a democratic society particularly in the context of free elections. Thus, the national authorities cannot be considered as having applied the standards embodied in Article\u00a010 of the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law.",

In this connection the Court notes that the applicant was sentenced to a prison term of one year suspended for three years, ordered to pay for the publication of the judgment in one national daily and for the announcement containing her apologies to Mr Kern in the weekly \u201cAngora\u201d. The Government argued that the applicant did not suffer any prejudice since the prison sentence had not been enforced. However, the Court considers that what matters here is not that her sentence was not enforced but that she was convicted at all (see, mutatis mutandis, Lopes Gomes da Silvia v.\u00a0Portugal, judgment of 28 September 2000, \u00a7\u00a036). Furthermore, a decision not to enforce the prison sentence does not expunge her conviction and does not quash the applicant\u2019s criminal record. The Court considers that the circumstances of the instant case - concerning defamation of a politician in the context of a heated political debate - present no justification for the imposition of a prison sentence (see, Cump\u0103n\u0103 and Maz\u0103re v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 115 and 116). The conviction of the applicant for making during her parliamentary campaign press and radio statements alleging abuse of power by one of the most powerful politicians in the country must have had \u201ca chilling effect\u201d on the freedom of expression in public debate in general.",
