Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively. As such, this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public thoroughfares, as well as static meetings and public processions; in addition, it can be exercised by individuals and those organising the assembly (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a056, ECHR 2003III). Turning to the question of whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court refers to its case-law to the effect that the authorities have a duty to take appropriate measures with regard to lawful demonstrations in order to ensure that they are conducted peacefully (see Oya Ataman, cited above). The Court also observes that paragraph 2 of Article 11 entitles States to impose \u201clawful restrictions\u201d on the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly. The Court notes that restrictions on freedom of assembly in public places may serve to protect the rights of others with a view to preventing disorder (see \u00c9va Moln\u00e1r v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 10346/05, \u00a7 34, 7\u00a0October 2008).",
