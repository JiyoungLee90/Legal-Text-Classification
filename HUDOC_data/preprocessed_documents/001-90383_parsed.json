These circumstances did not take sufficient account of his personal situation. More specifically, the applicant complained that the domestic decisions had made no reference at all to his advanced age. He pointed out that when he had been brought before the investigating judge on 17 November 2002 he had been sixtyseven years old and that the Spanish Criminal Code exempted persons over the age of seventy from serving a prison sentence. Given that the complexity of the case was bound to contribute to prolonging the investigation, the competent judge should have taken into consideration that the prospect of the applicant's actually serving any prison sentence that might be imposed would be diminished as a result, and should have reduced bail accordingly. The applicant added that at the time he submitted his observations to the Court, the proceedings were still at the investigation stage before the Spanish courts.",

It is clear from the domestic decisions that in the instant case the courts based their findings on the seriousness of the offence and the public outcry caused and on the applicant's personal circumstances, namely the fact that he was a Greek national who lived in Greece and that he had no ties in .
