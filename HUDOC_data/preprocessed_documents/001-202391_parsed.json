It is a sociological fact that the term has lost its meaning as referring exclusively to \u2018extremists\u2019. The same adjective could describe both truly radical, aggressive standpoints and also more moderate ideologies. It is a matter for political and sociological debate which category is to be referred to, but it is a fact that in current national and European public life [the term] is used to cover both. As a consequence, if a party whose founding document acknowledges its radical right-wing ideology is referred to in a news programme as \u2018far-right\u2019 \u2013 an adjective widely accepted in public and scientific life \u2013 this does not mean that an opinion is being expressed about the party, and especially not that it is associated with extreme chauvinistic ideas. It simply means that the political entity in question is being described, factually, using one of the various meanings of the adjective \u2013 not based on the plaintiff\u2019s subjective assessment \u2013 corresponding to its nature as accepted by current social and political public understanding. The fact that the term \u2018far-right\u2019 is used in conjunction with the adjective \u2018parliamentary\u2019 further diminishes the impression that it refers to extreme ideology.\u201d",

As the Venice Commission held in its opinion on laws \u2018Gasparri\u2019and \u2018Frattini\u2019 of Italy, \u201cmedia pluralism is achieved when there is a multiplicity of autonomous and independent media at the national, regional and local levels, ensuring a variety of media content reflecting different political and cultural views\u2019; further down it continued: \u2018while external pluralism relates particularly to the private sector, internal pluralism has increasingly become associated with the public sector\u2019. In the Hungarian context, measures aimed at limiting over-concentration of the media and provisions fixing minimal quotas for national and European independent content providers are supposed to ensure diversity of opinions on the media market as a whole (see, in particular, Part Two of the Media Act, Chapters I, IV, V and VI).",

It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. One of the requirements flowing from the expression \u201cprescribed by law\u201d is foreseeability. Thus, a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; he or she must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. The level of precision required of domestic legislation \u2013 which cannot provide for every eventuality \u2013 depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. The Court has found that persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation, can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see Kar\u00e1csony and Others v.

The margin is also narrowed by the strong interest of a democratic society in the press exercising its vital role as a public watchdog: freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on subjects of public interest and the public also has a right to receive them (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).

In the Court\u2019s view, in the absence of a definition in the legislation, the judicial review of any measure taken under section 12 had the role of developing a sufficiently specific interpretation of the provision to precisely address the risk of distortion which the State sought to avoid. It was thus for the domestic courts to interpret the term \u201copinion\u201d in a manner that took into account the aim of the restriction and guaranteed the audience\u2019s right to a balanced and impartial coverage of matters of public interest, as well as the media\u2019s right to impart information and ideas. In other words, in view of the lack of precision in the legislation, the domestic courts were required to ensure that the contested provision concerned only expressions which were likely to upset balanced reporting on matters of public interest and which could arguably be restricted, and that it did not turn into a tool for the suppression of free speech, encompassing activities and ideas which are protected by Article 10.",

The Budapest Administrative and Labour Court qualified the newsreader\u2019s statement as one of fact, emphasising that the term \u201cfar-right\u201d could describe a variety of political ideologies, but that the appropriate terminology was a matter of social and political debate. It also referred to the funding declaration of Jobbik, in which it identified itself as a radical right-wing party (see paragraph 10 above). On the contrary, the K\u00faria, acting as a second-instance court, found it relevant when establishing that the impugned statement had constituted an opinion, that Jobbik did not identify itself as a party with a far-right political stance (see paragraph 12 above). Lastly, to explain the difference between statements of fact and opinions, the Constitutional Court held that an adjective could be classified as a statement of fact if it was accepted beyond doubt in society. The term \u201cfar-right\u201d was a disputed term which did not have a precise definition either in political sciences or in colloquial language; it therefore constituted a subjective opinion. According to the Constitutional Court, in the present case it represented the personal belief of the organisers of the demonstration against Jobbik, from which the newsreader had failed to distinguish himself (see paragraph 14 above).",

The medium used is also highly relevant to the Court\u2019s assessment. The Court has considered audiovisual media, which includes television, to be one of the most influential media, with the \u201cpower to convey messages\u201d and an \u201cimmediate and powerful effect\u201d. Precisely because of the influential nature of broadcast media, the Court held in Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and Di Stefano v. Italy that, in addition to the negative obligation to not interfere with the proposal and debate of \u201cdiverse political programmes\u201d, the State had a positive obligation to adopt an \u201cappropriate legislative and administrative framework to guarantee effective pluralism\u201d. For instance, in the context of political advertising, this could manifest as the State\u2019s \u201cdesire to protect the democratic debate and process from distortion by powerful financial groups with advantageous access to influential media\u201d. As the Court has recognised in Manole and Others v.

Furthermore, the Court has put specific emphasis on the editorial autonomy of journalists when imparting information and ideas on subjects of public interest.

The fact that the applicant company could not foresee that the term \u201cfar-right\u201d would be construed as an opinion stems precisely from the lack of clarity in the law, which failed to provide any guidance to the applicant company on differentiating between a fact and an opinion. Similarly, throughout their reasoning, the majority refer to the lack of foreseeability of the law to support their analysis, finally concluding that the applicant company \u201ccould not have foreseen that the term \u2018far-right\u2019 would qualify as an opinion\u201d.",

Clearly, the danger stemming from section 12 of the Media Act is not \u201ctheoretical\u201d, and is further exacerbated by the virtually unlimited authority conferred upon the Media Council to impose sanctions. In the present case, the applicant company only had to pay the costs of the domestic proceedings, but it could have faced any of the severe and wide-ranging sanctions set out in section 187 of the Media Act. Accordingly, the law cannot be deemed to provide adequate safeguards as the applicant company could not \u201cforesee to the appropriate degree the consequences\u201d which the expression of a possible \u201copinion\u201d or \u201cevaluative explanation\u201d might entail.

This selective enforcement of the law has also been pointed out by the Venice Commission, which noted that the impartiality requirements were not as \u201cstrictly enforced\u201d against public-service media in comparison to private media. Such a law entails the risk of the State acting as a \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d, dictating how the media should present news, which does not conform to the media\u2019s fundamental right to editorial autonomy. As pointed out by the Venice Commission, the vagueness of the terms in the law may turn the provision into \u201ca tool of suppression of ... free speech\u201d. This danger is also reflected in the stance of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on the proposal to set up a \u201cEuropean Media Ombudsman\u201d that would verify the accuracy of information, noting that \u201c... [t]his would lead to the creation of a sort of European information authority, with the task of policing the accuracy and impartiality of information\u201d which \u201cwould run directly counter to the Council of Europe\u2019s role as a guardian of press freedoms\u201d. Accordingly, a law with such possible ramifications, which to a certain extent has materialised in the present case, clearly runs counter to the essence of media freedom.",

In the words of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, \u201crestrictive laws and other measures to control media tend to have a chilling effect on the media community but also a negative impact on society as a whole, including for the whole spectrum of human rights\u201d. This has also been pointed out by the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression in relation to his criticism of the Hungarian media legislation; the Special Rapporteur has expressed doubts as to how dictating the media\u2019s news delivery through legal requirements would promote the freedom of expression.

The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has also pointed out the significance of media self-regulation for the prevention of media abuse. According to the Commissioner, the objective of media self-regulation is to demonstrate to the State that intervention is not necessary since the media can structure themselves so that they are shielded from abuse by individuals or group interests, which also depends on the State\u2019s non-intervention.",

According to these joint declarations, self- and co-regulation can be instrumental in attaining content diversity and addressing problematic issues such as hate speech, and can even help to deal with emerging issues posed by new forms of media. The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media has also noted the benefits of media self-regulation, which are as follows: preservation of editorial autonomy, minimisation of interference by the State, promotion of media quality and media accountability, and increased accessibility for the audience. Notably, as part of the Council of Europe\u2019s advocacy of self- and co-regulatory mechanisms for the adoption of journalistic principles, the Parliamentary Assembly has promoted media self-regulation as a trait of democratic governments, and has called on legislators to actively encourage media self-regulation. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has also called on governments to promote \u201ca system of effective self-regulation based on an agreed code of ethics\u201d.",

The above-mentioned soft-law instruments, as well as the experience from the present case, clearly demonstrate that heavy-handed State regulation is not suitable for regulating the media, especially content. Among other resources, resolutions of the PACE provide valuable guidance to States in adopting self- or co-regulatory models. In both cases, diverse bodies \u201ccomprising publishers, journalists, media users\u2019 associations, experts from the academic world and judges\u201d would be an ideal composition that would represent a variety of stakeholders in society. With regard to ensuring impartiality in the media, the relevant issue in the present case, the PACE has recommended that self-(or co-)regulatory bodies publish periodical reports on \u201ctruthfulness of the information broadcast by the media, comparing the news with the actual facts\u201d. Instead of the State being the arbiter of truth, these reports would give the public an opportunity to compare viewpoints and decide for themselves whether a media outlet is credible.",

It is vital that self-regulation is not so \u201coverregulated\u201d as to prevent the media from creating and directing the system by themselves. As the ACHPR put it in a famous case, self-regulation provides the best mechanism for the maintenance of ethical standards of journalists and for confrontation with manipulated and \u201cfake news\u201d in a democratic society, which demands the greatest possible amount of information and the least possible degree of State control and intrusion.",
