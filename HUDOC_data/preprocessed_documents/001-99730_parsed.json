Conflicting decisions in similar cases stemming from the same court which, in addition, is the court of last resort in the matter, may, in the absence of a mechanism which ensures consistency, breach that principle and thereby undermine public confidence in the judiciary (see, for example, Beian, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a036-39; Tudor Tudor v. Romania, no. 21911/03, \u00a7 29, 24 March 2009; and Iordan Iordanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 23530/02, \u00a7\u00a7 47-53, 2\u00a0July 2009), such confidence being one of the essential components of a State based on the rule of law. The Contracting States have the obligation to organise their legal system so as to avoid the adoption of discordant judgments (see Vrioni and Others v. Albania, no. 2141/03, \u00a7 58, 24\u00a0March 2009). The Court considers that this reasoning applies a fortiori in the present instance where the same court reached conflicting decisions in the same case. It also notes that it has previously found a violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention in similar circumstances (see Kostadin\u00a0Mihaylov v. Bulgaria, no. 17868/07, 27 March 2008).",

The role of a higher court in a Contracting Party is precisely to resolve conflicts of jurisprudence, avoid divergences and ensure uniform application of law. Therefore, by adopting a new decision on the same issue in the same proceedings and thereby effectively overruling its previous decision, without any reference to it or reasoning to the contrary, the Supreme Court in the instant case itself became the source of uncertainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Beian v.\u00a0Romania\u00a0(no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39). In this way it infringed the principle of legal certainty, inherent in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
