In particular, in C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 1365/07, \u00a7\u00a7 42-47, 24\u00a0April 2008) the Court found that, first, the domestic courts had allowed the executive to stretch the notion of national security beyond its natural meaning, and, secondly, those courts had not examined whether the executive was able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for its assessment that the applicant presented a national security risk. In the recent judgment of M. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 102, the Court found that the domestic court applied a formalistic approach and left a governmental agency full and uncontrolled discretion to certify blankly, with reference to little more than its own general statements, that an alien was a threat to national security and must be deported. As such \u201ccertifications\u201d were based on undisclosed internal information and were considered to be beyond any meaningful judicial scrutiny, there was no safeguard against arbitrariness.",

This document, which has not been submitted to the Court, apparently did not mention the factual grounds and the evidence on which the declaration was based. As in other similar cases against , it has not been alleged that the first applicant has ever been charged with related offences. Thus, the deportation order was issued on the basis of a purely internal assessment of undisclosed information.

However, expulsion by a  may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2008-...). Having said that, the Court notes that it is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see, for example, Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 129; Auad v. , no. 46390/10, \u00a7 99, 11 October 2011; and Mollazeinal v.
