The court further found that on 29 October 2004 the applicant had been taken to the police station in connection with the suspicion that he had committed a crime of violence and had duly been questioned first as a witness and then as a suspect. It also noted that the applicant, informed of his rights as a suspect, had voluntarily waived his right to legal representation. As at the material time the applicant had been suspected of simple murder, which could not lead to a life sentence, such a waiver had been compatible with applicable law.

France, no.\u00a029731/96, \u00a7\u00a089, ECHR 2001II). As a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first time a suspect is questioned by the police, unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were compelling reasons to restrict this right (see Salduz\u00a0v.\u00a0Turkey\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7\u00a055, 27 November 2008). The right to mount a defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (ibid.). While a defendant in criminal proceedings may, under various circumstances, waive his right to legal representation, such a waiver may not run counter to any important public interest, must be established in an unequivocal manner, and must be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to the waiver\u2019s importance (see e.g. Sejdovic v.\u00a0Italy\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a086, ECHR 2006II).",

Based on this information, on 29\u00a0October\u00a02004 the police officers inspected the applicant\u2019s home, seized his clothes, and brought him to the police station, where he was questioned and confessed to the murder on the following day (30 October 2004). It is apparent from these police actions that they already suspected the applicant of having been involved in V.\u2019s murder on 28 October 2004. In its judgment of 18 November 2005 the ARC Court likewise noted that on 29\u00a0October\u00a02004 the applicant had been brought to the police in connection with the suspicion that he had murdered V. In the meantime, as can be seen from the case file, on 30 October 2004 the applicant was questioned not as a suspect, but as a witness and was not provided with the option of appointing a lawyer to assist him during questioning. It also appears that at the material time the applicant remained in police custody without a record of that custody having been drawn up (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above). It follows that the applicant\u2019s confessional statement of 30 October 2004 was obtained in a setting where he was deprived of basic procedural guarantees of the fundamental rights not to incriminate himself and to obtain legal assistance. The guarantees of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3 (c) of the Convention were therefore not observed in respect of the applicant\u2019s questioning on 30 October 2004 and the taking of his confessional statement.",

However, in assessing whether these waivers were genuine and unequivocal, the Court notes that the applicant signed them while remaining in police custody. The first waiver of 31 October 2004 dates to the period, when, according to the applicant, he remained in off-the-record detention. There is nothing in the case file to rebut his submissions in this respect. The fact that the applicant signed this waiver while arbitrarily held in police custody and having no ability to consult a lawyer gives rise to a strong suspicion that it was obtained in defiance of the applicant\u2019s will. This waiver cannot therefore be regarded as compliant with the Convention requirements.",

In particular, at the material time the applicant was held under administrative arrest. The Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s allegations that this arrest was effected with an ulterior motive, namely, to ensure his availability for questioning as a criminal suspect and to exert unlawful pressure on him. Similar allegations were examined in a number of other cases against Ukraine, where the Court condemned the practice of placing a person under administrative arrest to ensure his availability for questioning as a criminal suspect (see, for example, Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v. Ukraine, no.\u00a042310/04, \u00a7\u00a0264, 21 April 2011; and Grigoryev v. Ukraine, no. 51671/07, \u00a7\u00a087, 15 May 2012). In the case of Balitskiy v. Ukraine the Court also found that such a practice resulting in questioning the criminal suspects in defiance of applicable procedural guarantees constituted a structural problem in Ukraine (no.\u00a012793/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050-51 and 54, 3 November 2011). Regard being had to the above findings and the fact that the applicant was arrested under the pretext that he had committed an administrative offence almost immediately upon his release from the initial off-the-record custody, as well as his intense questioning as a criminal suspect throughout the period of his administrative detention, the Court finds his allegations credible. It considers that the present case discloses another example of the aforementioned structural problem. It therefore finds that the waivers of the right to legal assistance obtained from the applicant on 4, 9 and 10\u00a0November 2005 were signed by him in a state of particular vulnerability and in the absence of proper procedural guarantees. They can therefore not be regarded as compliant with the Convention requirements.",

Nevertheless, the applicant was initially charged with simple murder and only several months later, after most questioning sessions and other investigative activities had been carried out in absence of a lawyer representing the applicant\u2019s interests, was the offence reclassified as murder for profit, which required mandatory legal representation under domestic law.",

It also notes that in February 2005, after having obtained an opportunity to consult a lawyer, the applicant retracted his confessions and consistently pleaded innocent throughout the further proceedings. Nevertheless, the domestic courts relied on the applicant\u2019s confessions as a basis for his conviction and failed to act upon his complaints of a breach of his right to mount a defence. Although the confessional statements at issue were not the sole basis for the conviction, in the above circumstances, the Court finds this fact of little relevance. Regard being had to the use of these statements in the body of evidence held against the applicant in convicting him and the failure of the domestic courts to take action to condemn the breach of the applicant\u2019s defence rights in the beginning of the investigation, the Court considers that this breach was not remedied by the subsequent legal assistance provided to the applicant or by the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings (see Leonid Lazarenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057).",
