Furthermore, none of the gendarmes present at the scene of Ahmet Demiray's death appears to have been questioned. Lastly, the autopsy was performed by a general practitioner and contains little forensic evidence. The authority's conclusion that a classic autopsy by a forensic medical examiner was not necessary is, in the Court's view, inadequate given that a death occurred in the circumstances described in the present case.",

The Court has held (see paragraph 47 above) that the authorities were responsible under Article 2 of the Convention for Ahmet Demiray's death. In the circumstances there is a direct causal link between the violation of Article 2 and the loss of potential financial support which the victim had been providing for his widow and children. The Court notes, nonetheless, in that connection that, according to the applicant herself, her husband was unemployed at the time of his death. In the absence of other evidence as to his income at the time of his death, the amounts claimed under that head by Mrs Demiray are therefore speculative.

The majority's reasoning is therefore based principally on the lack of measures taken to limit the risks to which Ahmet Demiray was exposed: he apparently agreed to show the Lice gendarmes the site of an arms cache belonging to the PKK, of which he was a member; he was allegedly killed while walking towards the cache when a grenade booby-trapped by that organisation exploded; lastly, the fact that the three gendarmes accompanying him were placed at a distance of 30 to 50 m from the cache, whereas he himself was hit by the grenade at 1 m from it, shows that the authorities' responsibility for the death of the victim was engaged.",
