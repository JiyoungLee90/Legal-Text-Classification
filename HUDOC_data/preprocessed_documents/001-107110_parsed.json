Even if one were to admit that there were certain irregularities in the membership declarations or the lists, this was not reason enough to hold that the number of founders had not in fact been attained. The sixtysix declarations presented by the prosecutor had to be discounted, inter alia because their sincerity was highly doubtful as they appeared to have been made under pressure from the police. That could be seen from the content of some of the declarations. Most of the irregularities noted in the police report were trivial or irrelevant and, in view of the limited number of individuals concerned \u2013 fiftyeight \u2013 did not cast doubt on the fact that the party had more than five thousand members, as required by law. Lastly, there was no indication that the party\u2019s formation had been in breach of Article 11 of the Convention or Articles 11 and 44 of the Constitution (see paragraph 41 below); on the contrary, it was consonant with the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above).",

Following the discovery of the larnax (box), the Star of Vergina was widely adopted by Greeks as a symbol of continuity between ancient Macedonian culture and modern .

Thus, the blue flag with the Star of Vergina appeared in the 1980s. The symbol was also adopted by the large Macedonian diaspora, and later, after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the independent  displayed the Star of Vergina on its new flag. The Star of Vergina became a source of controversies both within the Republic of Macedonia and in its relations with neighbouring . The flag \u2013 a red rectangle with the star in the middle \u2013 became a major issue and the subject of extensive political discussions between the two sides. Greek objections led to the flag being banned from use in a variety of international organisations, including the United Nations, the Olympic Games and the representations of the Republic of Macedonia in the United States of America and . In February 1993 the Greek Parliament adopted a declaration designating the Star of Vergina as an official Greek national symbol. In July 1995  lodged a request with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for exclusive intellectual property rights to the Star of Vergina.",

[This court] considers ... that the Sofia City Court erred by admitting in evidence the expert report contested by the applicants. This report is in fact a private expert report and not an official document, as wrongly held by the [Sofia City Court]. This entailed a breach of the rules of evidence. ... However, that breach was not material, as it was not the only ground which led to the [Sofia City Court\u2019s] refusal to register [the party]. That court found that the produced founding declaration \u2013 the first element of the complex of events leading to a political party\u2019s formation ... \u2013 was vitiated. The founding declaration cannot be individualised, as it does not emanate from at least fifty enfranchised Bulgarian citizens, as required by the law (section 10 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act]), but from a \u2018group of citizens\u2019, and that \u2018group of citizens\u2019 cannot be individualised, nor their number ascertained. There is no information in declarations under section\u00a011(3) of [the same Act] about the size and the membership of the initiative committee, because such declarations are lacking. Therefore, [the Sofia City Court\u2019s] decisive conclusion that the [applicant party] was not validly formed was based on lapses in the founding declaration presented, which fails to meet the imperative requirements of the law \u2013 sections 10(1) and 11(1)(3) [of the 2005 Political Parties Act]. The incompleteness of the lists, noted by the [Sofia City Court], was an additional and not a decisive ground for the refusal, and for this reason its being based on a breach of the rules of procedure is not material and does not vitiate the impugned judgment. By the same token, [this court] finds unavailing the arguments in the appeal about the rigid application of the rule in section 11 [of the Act] in relation to the handwritten declarations, which allegedly led to a restriction of the exercise of basic political rights. Section 11\u2019s requirement for a personally filled in and signed declaration does not restrict or discriminate against illiterate or blind individuals, as the law deals with such eventualities in Article 151 [of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure], which is also applicable in the instant proceedings... If the law requires personally filled in and signed declarations under section 11 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act], the court is bound to apply it correctly and uniformly \u2013 Article 4 \u00a7 2 [of the above Code]. [The Sofia City Court] did precisely that; therefore, the complaints that it erred in the application of section 11 [of the Act] are unfounded.",

In the course of the proceedings the court noted that the applicants have not complied with the requirements of [the 2005 Political Parties Act, whose] section 10 provides that [a political party] can be founded on the initiative of at least fifty enfranchised Bulgarian citizens, who have to form an initiative committee. This [committee] has to adopt a written founding declaration. The founding declaration of 1 July 2007 presented was signed by seventysix people, who did not however personally fill in and sign declarations under section 11 [of the above Act]. Moreover, according to section 11(1) [of this Act], the declaration has to be drawn up by the initiative committee. Since evidence to that effect has not been produced, the court cannot be certain that this initiative committee has indeed held meetings and that such resolutions have in fact been adopted. The minutes of the founding meeting of 15 July 2007 say that [it] was attended by 685 adult Bulgarian citizens who had personally filled in and signed declarations under section 11(1) [of the above Act]. The court fails to see how it was possible to obtain 685 declarations by adult enfranchised Bulgarian citizens in less than fifteen days (that is, from the committee\u2019s declaration of 1 July 2007 to 15 July 2007), so as to allow the holding of the founding meeting on 15 July 2007. It is true that section 12(1) of [the Act] provides that a political party is formed at a founding meeting held in the  not later than three months after the date on which the founding declaration has been adopted. However, in the instant case the court cannot accept that 685 people who had personally filled in their declarations under section 11(1) [of the Act] were able to get together to hold a [founding meeting] in such a short time. Moreover, the minutes are signed by the president of the meeting and the minutetaker, whereas they should have been personally signed by all founders. As noted above, there is no evidence, under section\u00a011(1) [of the Act], that [the initiative committee] has adopted a model declaration whereby each enfranchised Bulgarian citizen may, by personally filling it in and signing it, join the party. This declaration has to be ready before the holding of the founding meeting. It should contain the information required under section 11(2) [of the Act]. The presented lists of three names, [citizen identification numbers] and addresses do not demonstrate to the court that the persons who feature thereon are members of the party, as the lists are not accompanied by personally filled in and signed declarations (see the presented list of party founders). This court does not know whether these persons are aware that they are members of this party, or whether this is simply a list intending to prove before the court that the requirements of section\u00a015(3)(7) [of the Act] have been complied with. It must here be noted that [the court] received from [the Ministry of Justice] a letter informing it that [the Ministry] had received a letter from the head of the department for the execution of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, [Ms M.], in which she asked whether it was possible for the court to accept, when examining the application for the [applicant party\u2019s] registration, the list of 5,000 members presented in [the previous registration proceedings] in which the court, whose judgment was upheld by [the Supreme Court of Cassation], refused to register the party. This letter leads the court to conclude that the list produced in the instant proceedings is the same as the one presented [in the previous registration proceedings]. The use of the same list is in breach of Articles 11 \u00a7 3 and 44 of the [Constitution, which provide that] parties facilitate the formation and expression of the political will of citizens, who may freely associate. Each application for inclusion in the register of political parties means, first, sharing the ideas of a group of enfranchised citizens who use democratic ways and means for attaining their political goals, set out in [the political party\u2019s] platform, and, second, that the [party\u2019s] formation, resolutions [and] activity should be in conformity with the law. The use of the same evidence in separate cases cannot therefore be accepted by the court. The evidence presented in [the previous registration proceedings] cannot be used in the instant proceedings.",

The ones mentioned in clauses 4 and 5 of the constitution do not characterise the organisation as a political party within the meaning of [the 2005 Political Parties Act] and the [Constitution]. Political parties are citizens\u2019 organisations through which they take part in the political life of the . The thing which sets them apart from other citizens\u2019 associations is, according to Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the [Constitution], that only they may pursue political goals or carry out political activities. These activities are defined by Article 11 \u00a7 3 of the [Constitution] and section 1 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act] as ones facilitating the formation of the citizens\u2019 political will, which is the citizens\u2019 will to participate in government. The carrying out of political activities is the main criterion for distinguishing [political parties] from other citizens\u2019 associations. In this connection, it should be observed that in their constitutions political parties must clearly declare their goals and tasks and the ways of attaining them. The goals and tasks outlined in the [applicant party\u2019s] constitution are limited, have an optional character and do not comply with the abovementioned requirements. For the court, the goals set out in clause 4 of the constitution are rather those of a nonprofit association ..., not of a political party... It should [also] be noted that a political party bearing the same name and having the same goals was registered by the Sofia City Court in a judgment of 12 February 1999... After that [, in 2000, the ] declared that party unconstitutional and it was struck out of the register. The [Constitutional Court\u2019s] judgment shows that not only the name and the political goals of this party are identical to those stated by the applicants in the instant proceedings, but that the [party\u2019s] leadership consists of the same individuals. The court cannot therefore be sure that, having the same political goals and leaders, the party will not meet the same fate, that is, be faced with an application [for its banning] to [the Constitutional Court]. The court observes that the constitutionality of a political party must be judged on the basis of its activities. The political goals set out in clause 4 of the constitution show that this is a party which is active in a specific part of the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, which runs counter to both the [2005 Political Parties Act] and the [Constitution] (see clause 4, points 7 and 8 of the [party\u2019s] constitution). Moreover, clause 4, point 6 of the political goals of the party mentions good neighbourly relations in the Balkans, in Europe and in all countries inhabited by ethnic Macedonians. There is no distinct Macedonian ethnos in the . The same goes for the party\u2019s name.",

The underlying idea of the abovecited provision is doubtlessly to ensure that the required number of members who have declared their wish to join the effort to attain the goals set out in the party\u2019s constitution, adopted at the same founding meeting, has really been attained. From this vantage point, the list of members compiled during a previous founding of the party does not serve the law\u2019s purpose. The membership of an organisation, including a political one, is a dynamic value, which may increase but also decrease, due to changes in political views \u2013 something characteristic of every individual. This dynamic, which doubtlessly also reflects natural biological processes, requires [the founders] to establish before the registering court the requisite number of members at the time of the party\u2019s founding, or at the time when the application for its registration is lodged. It is obvious that in the instant case those requirements of section 15(3)(7) have not been complied with owing to the lack of information about the number of persons who have expressed their wish to become members of [the applicant party and work] for the attainment of its goals, as agreed at the founding meeting held on 15 July 2007 and laid down in the constitution adopted by the founders.",

Concrete rights and duties in that respect can arise and evolve only in the manner envisaged by the special statutes governing such matters. In the case at hand, the [2005] Political Parties Act lays down certain requirements which need to be met before an application to register a political party can succeed. One of those requirements is the obligation under section 15 [of the Act] for the applicants to enclose certain documents with their application. Those documents must be produced in order to allow the registering court to ascertain whether the application is admissible and wellfounded. It is the applicants\u2019 duty to produce them, and they directly relate to the ascertaining of a series of legal acts leading to the formation of a political party. Therefore, the making of an irregular application \u2013 such irregularity stemming from a failure to produce the enclosures required by law \u2013 is tantamount to a failure to comply with the duty to make a proper application. Moreover, some of the irregularities cannot be rectified in the manner and timelimits envisaged by Article\u00a0129 [of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure], because they are indicative of such failures of the [party\u2019s] founders as make the application for its registration illfounded. Although noncontentious proceedings follow the general rules of civil procedure, their specificity requires the court to assess whether the irregularities [in the application] can be rectified, and thus make the application successful, because the law requires all prerequisites for the registration of a political party to be in place. The lack of even one such prerequisite makes the application illfounded. In the case at hand, the [lower] court found that the imperative requirements of the law had not been complied with (there is no founding declaration; that declaration has not been published in a daily newspaper[, as required by] section 10 the [2005] Political Parties Act; the mandatory requirements of sections 11 and 12 [of that Act] have not been complied with). Although in their appeal the applicants said that they were ready to adduce fresh evidence, the above defects cannot be rectified in the manner and within the timelimit envisaged by Article 129 [of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure], because they presuppose the occurring of concrete facts at the time when the party was being founded. They thus relate to the application\u2019s wellfoundedness, not to its admissibility. Besides, [Mr] Tikov\u2019s assertion at the hearing on 9 December 2008 that the applicants do not have any documents other than those already produced leads directly to the conclusion that the appeal is illfounded, because it conflicts with the applicants\u2019 position before the [lower] court, where they had to make the requisite procedural steps. Therefore, the [lower] court has not breached the rules of procedure and has correctly assessed the application\u2019s wellfoundedness based on the enclosures submitted by the applicants.",

That has no bearing on the case at hand, because the refusal to register [the party] was based on its failure to comply with the formal requirements of the [2005] Political Parties Act. Those requirements apply to all, not only to the appellant. Therefore, the [lower] court was right to conclude that the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 judgment is irrelevant to the registration request in the case at hand. One of the main principles of the law of registration, flowing directly from Article 4 of the Constitution, is the principle of lawfulness. It requires the authorities examining registration requests to comply strictly with their duties, and requires those who lodge registration requests to comply strictly with theirs. The application of that principle is guaranteed by the strict rules governing the facts which need to be registered, the manner of their registration, the possibility of appealing against the rulings of the registering authorities and the sanctions for failures to comply with registration obligations. Therefore, the ones responsible for complying with registration obligations are the applicants, regardless of their identity, and not other persons, and their failure to do so leads to a refusal to register the requested fact.\u201d",

Currently the ultimate measure available to the Committee of Ministers is recourse to Article 8 of the Council of Europe\u2019s Statute (suspension of voting rights in the Committee of Ministers, or even expulsion from the Organisation). This is an extreme measure, which would prove counterproductive in most cases; indeed the High Contracting Party which finds itself in the situation foreseen in paragraph 4 of Article\u00a046 continues to need, far more than others, the discipline of the Council of Europe. The new Article 46 therefore adds further possibilities of bringing pressure to bear to the existing ones.

Under Article 32 of the Convention, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction extended to all matters concerning its interpretation and application, including the execution of judgments. In recent times, the Court had on a number of occasions analysed the application of Article 46 \u00a7 1 and the contents of the States\u2019 obligations under that provision, going as far as specifying the individual and/or general measures necessary for the execution of its judgments. In the present case, there existed good reasons why the Court should examine whether Article\u00a046 \u00a7 1 had been breached. It had in several judgments found various breaches of the Article 11 rights of persons asserting a Macedonian ethnic consciousness, and was currently faced with five similar applications. That was indicative of a systemic violation which could justify the indication of specific measures to the respondent State. The persistent nature of the breaches had been noted by the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers, whose Secretariat had sought to remedy the situation by giving indications to the Bulgarian authorities in connection with UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN\u2019s efforts to obtain reregistration. However, those indications had remained unheeded, and the Bulgarian courts had again refused to register the party. That was indicative of complete disregard for the Committee of Ministers\u2019 decisions and of a deliberate policy of denying the applicants\u2019 rights to freedom of assembly and association and refusing to comply with the Court\u2019s judgment in United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above), and amounted to a breach of Article 46 \u00a7 1. In those circumstances, it would be appropriate for the Court to indicate the individual measures that would remove the consequences of the repeated violations mentioned above. In the instant case, there was no real choice as to the measures required to remedy the breach. In October 2007 the Supreme Court of Cassation refused to register UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN solely because it did not accept the validity of the list of 5,778 party members. Since that issue had been examined in the course of the proceedings before the Committee of Ministers, and since there existed no further obstacles to the party\u2019s registration, it was necessary to reopen those proceedings and register the party on the basis of the documents already submitted, including that list.",

Turkey (dec.), no. 5980/07, 6 July 2010), the present case does not concern reopening of domestic proceedings, but two fresh sets of proceedings in which the applicant party sought to be registered anew. Both ended in refusals. In a number of cases the Court has treated such refusals in themselves as interferences with the right to freedom of association (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, \u00a7 31, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; APEH \u00dcld\u00f6z\u00f6tteinek Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge and Others v.

In one of those cases the Court specifically noted that although it could have regard to earlier or later registration proceedings, in so far as they could be relevant to the complaints before it, such proceedings fell outside the scope of the case (see United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 and 31). Thus, although the applicant party\u2019s attempts to obtain reregistration were undoubtedly connected with the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment in United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above), in the light of the cases just cited they can be regarded as a distinct situation containing relevant new information relating to issues undecided by that judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6467, as well as Mehemi v.

As noted in paragraph 64 above, the Court has in a number of cases treated such refusals as separate interferences, and has even observed that earlier or later registration proceedings fall outside the scope of the case (see United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 31). Such other registration proceedings are therefore of no relevance for the exhaustion of domestic remedies in the case at hand. Indeed, to hold otherwise might erect a permanent barrier to bringing such matters before the Court, because, as correctly pointed out by the Government, in Bulgaria a refusal to register a political party does not preclude the possibility of making further applications for registration an indefinite number of times (see, mutatis mutandis, Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 80, Series A no. 39; Nenov v. Bulgaria, no. 33738/02, \u00a7 38, 16 July 2009; and Naydenov v. Bulgaria, no. 17353/03, \u00a7 58, 26 November 2009).

Those interferences had been neither lawful nor necessary in a democratic society. During UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN\u2019s first reregistration attempt the Sofia City Court had failed to give them instructions concerning the purported irregularities in the party\u2019s registration documents and had refused to allow them to adduce additional evidence. In view of the trivial nature of the irregularities on which the court had based its decision and of its earlier refusal to allow the applicants to rectify those irregularities, its refusal to register the party had been excessive. Moreover, the proceedings had been accompanied by a hostile campaign by the authorities against the party\u2019s registration. The applicants and about five thousand other members of the party had been targeted in an unprecedented campaign of harassment by the police; some of them had been intimidated into signing declarations renouncing their membership. As a result, the authorities had obtained and had submitted to the Sofia City Court sixtysix such declarations. During the second reregistration attempt the national courts had not taken into account the binding effect of this Court\u2019s judgment in United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above). The Sofia City Court had in part relied on reasons that had been found problematic in that judgment. The Supreme Court of Cassation had based the refusal to register the party on the lack of an uptodate list of members, contrary to the express indications given by the Committee of Minister\u2019s Secretariat, and had not clearly disavowed the problematic reasoning given by the Sofia City Court.",

This point appears to be of importance for the assessment of both the lawfulness and the necessity of the interferences, because while the Sofia City Court gave a number of reasons why reregistration of the applicant party should be refused, the Supreme Court of Cassation discounted most of those and upheld the refusals on much narrower grounds. For instance, in the first reregistration proceedings the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the Sofia City Court had wrongly admitted in evidence an expert report based on information obtained by the authorities in the Pirin region through highly questionable means (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above); the Court will revert to that point later (see paragraph 88 below). Moreover, the Supreme Court of Cassation did not take up the Sofia City Court\u2019s lines of reasoning concerning the applicant party\u2019s symbols, the feasibility of its goals, or the prospect of it being banned again on account of having the same goals and the same leadership as the one that had been dissolved in 2000; it even openly expressed disagreement with some of those points (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above, and contrast Sidiropoulos and Others, \u00a7 13, and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, \u00a7 21, both cited above). It is a matter of regret that the Sofia City Court engaged in a protracted historical analysis of the applicant party\u2019s symbols and the feasibility of its goals, saying that it \u201crequire[d] precise and clear political goals\u201d in order to register a political party. Such reasoning bears a close resemblance to that given earlier for the refusal to register an association closely connected with the applicant party, a refusal which was later found to be in breach of Article 11 (see United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 19 and 7079). It is also to be regretted that in the second reregistration proceedings the Sofia City Court expressed the view that, if registered, the applicant party would be banned on account of having the same goals and the same leadership as the one whose dissolution in 2000 was found by this Court to be in breach of Article 11 of the Convention (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 30 above). That said, it cannot be overlooked that to uphold the two refusals to register the applicant party, the Supreme Court of Cassation had regard solely to its failure to observe certain contentneutral legal requirements concerning its formation process. In the first proceedings, it took issue with shortcomings in the party\u2019s founding declaration, specifying that the other problems noted by the Sofia City Court did not amount to independent grounds to refuse registration (see paragraph 22 above). In the second proceedings, it found a problem in the absence of an uptodate list of the party\u2019s founding members (see paragraph 32 above).",

Turkey, no. 52067/99, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2006XII (extracts)). The Court therefore finds that in assessing the lawfulness and the necessity of interferences it should take into account solely the reasons upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassation (see, mutatis mutandis, Adolf v.\u00a0, 26 March 1982, \u00a7\u00a7 3841, Series A no. 49). Naturally, since it must look at the interference in the light of the case as a whole (see, among other authorities, Gorzelik and Others, cited above, \u00a7 96), it will also have regard to the manner in which the two sets of reregistration proceedings unfolded, and the broader context. The Court will also have regard to the fact that the reregistration proceedings were, as evident from the proceedings before the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 3740 above), connected with the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment in United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above).",

Since the reregistration proceedings were, as evident from the proceedings before the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 3740 above), connected with the individual measures required to implement the Court\u2019s judgment in United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above), regard must also be had to the principles concerning the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments, as recently set out in Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2) (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8390). It should in particular be emphasised that, as held in that judgment, domestic procedures whose purpose is to allow the execution of a Court\u2019s judgment should afford the authorities of the respondent State the opportunity to abide by that judgment\u2019s conclusions and spirit (ibid., \u00a7 90). It must in addition be noted that States are entitled \u2013 subject to the condition of proportionality \u2013 to require organisations seeking official registration to comply with reasonable legal formalities (see Movement for Democratic Kingdom v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 27608/95, Commission decision of 29 November 1995, unreported; Baisan for \u201cLiga Apararii Drepturilor Omului din Roma\u0302nia\u201d v.\u00a0Romania, no. 28973/95, Commission decision of 30 October 1997, DR\u00a091A, p. 29; Ertan and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57898/00, 21 March 2006; Tebieti M\u00fchafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov v. , no. 37083/03, \u00a7 72, 8 October 2009; Hayvan Yeti\u015ftiricileri Sendikas\u0131 v.

However, such requirements should not be used to hinder the freedom of association of groups disliked by the authorities or advocating ideas that the authorities would like to suppress. Therefore, in cases where the circumstances are such as to raise doubts in that regard, the Court must verify whether an apparently neutral measure interfering with a political party\u2019s activities in effect seeks to penalise it on account of the views or the policies that it promotes (see Basque Nationalist Party \u2013 Iparralde Regional Organisation v. France, no. 71251/01, \u00a7\u00a033\u00a0in\u00a0fine, ECHR 2007VII, as well as, mutatis mutandis, T\u0103nase v.\u00a0Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, \u00a7\u00a7 16869 and 17779, 27 April 2010). This is because the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are not theoretical or illusory, but practical and effective (see, among many other authroities, Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37, and United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. , 30 January 1998, \u00a7 33, Reports 1998I). Indeed, Article 18 of the Convention provides that any restrictions permitted to the rights enshrined in it must not be applied for a purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.",

Naturally, a political party\u2019s formation should be based on the free and unfettered wishes of its founders, and that in a democratic society no person should be coerced or tricked into becoming a member of a party (see, concerning the negative impact of compulsory membership on personal views and opinions, Young, James and Webster v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 44; Sigur\u00f0ur A. Sigurj\u00f3nsson v. Iceland, 30 June 1993, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 264; Chassagnou and Others v.

In a recent case against the  concerning the registration of a religious denomination, the Court accepted as legitimate an inquiry on the part of the registration authority as to the genuineness of the consent of a number of adherents (see Lajda and Others, cited above). However, there are important differences with the present case. In Lajda and Others, the inquiry was carried out by means of letters sent by the registration authority to the purported adherents, whereas here it appears that the police in the Pirin region systematically summoned purported members of the applicant party, questioned them about the genuineness of their wish to join it, and in some cases elicited from them declarations to the effect that their wish was not genuine (see paragraphs 13, 15 and 16 above). In a democratic society, the use by the authorities of such tactics is rather disquieting and worryingly reminiscent of past infamous persecutions. However, it cannot be overlooked that the Supreme Court of Cassation expressly held that the Sofia City Court had erred in admitting in evidence the expert report produced on the basis of the information gathered as a result of that operation, and that the operation thus had no bearing on the ultimate decision to refuse reregistration (see paragraph 32 above).",

There is no indication that the judges in that court were influenced by any of them in reaching their decisions to uphold the two refusals to reregister the applicant party. As evident from the reasons for its two judgments (see paragraphs 22 and 32 above), that court had regard to deficiencies in the party\u2019s formation process. The legal requirements that, in that court\u2019s view, the party\u2019s founders had failed to comply with were purely contentneutral, and were not specifically aimed at the party. The Court is therefore not persuaded that the two refusals sought to penalise the party on account of the views or the policies that it promotes. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the two attempts to reregister the party were connected with the execution of the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above). When closing the examination of that case in December 2009 the Committee of Ministers expressed the view that refusals that are exclusively based on failures to comply with the formal requirements of the law do not raise issues in that regard (see paragraph 39 above); the Court sees no reason to depart from that view. This conclusion is not altered by the failure of the applicant party\u2019s third reregistration attempt either: that attempt was based on the obviously erroneous premise that the party had never lost its legal personality (see paragraph 33 above) and was thus bound to fail (see paragraph 36 above).",

Such formalities may vary in line with the historical and political factors peculiar to each country, and States have a certain margin of appreciation in laying them down. Indeed, there is a considerable variety of regulatory regimes in that domain in the various Member States of the Council of Europe (see the Venice Commission materials quoted in paragraphs 54 and 55 above). In view of the specificity of the subject matter, it is also within a State\u2019s margin of appreciation to refuse to allow serious defects in those steps, which by their nature have to be carried out in a particular order, to be cured subsequently (see, mutatis mutandis, Edificaciones March Gallego S.A. v. , 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03536, Reports 1998I). In the instant case, the Supreme Court of Cassation specifically found that the founding declaration, which was the first step in the applicant party\u2019s formation process and had an impact on all subsequent steps, was defective. It spelled out clearly why it considered that the declaration fell short of the requirements of the 2005 Political Parties Act, and explained why it regarded those defects as significant and incapable of being remedied in the course of the registration proceedings (see paragraph 22 above, and contrast United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 6768, and Tsonev, \u00a7 55, both cited above).",

The Supreme Court of Cassation explained that the underlying rationale of that requirement was to ensure that the requisite number of founding members had really been attained at the time when the party was being founded (see paragraph 32 above). It is true that, in the particular circumstances of the applicant party, that requirement could have been more difficult to comply with. However, it cannot be said that the Supreme Court of Cassation\u2019s refusal to carve out an exception reflecting the difficulties that might be encountered by a particular party fell foul of Article 11, even if account is taken of the fact that the registration proceedings were connected with the execution of this Court\u2019s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above). Indeed, that was the position ultimately adopted by the Committee of Ministers, which was fully apprised of all domestic developments (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above, and contrast Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 90).",

However, it went on to find that the sanction that the Azerbaijani authorities had imposed on an association for its failure to observe such formalities \u2013 forced dissolution \u2013 had been too severe, and that less draconian measures could have been envisaged (see Tebieti M\u00fchafize Cemiyyeti and Israfilov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 7083). However, the same logic cannot automatically be transposed to the initial registration of associations or political parties. While both the refusal to register an association or a political party and its dissolution are radical in their effects (see Gorzelik and Others, \u00a7 105; Tsonev, \u00a7 63; and Zhechev, \u00a7 58, all cited above), the latter is a particularly farreaching measure that could be justified only in strictly limited circumstances. The former has more limited consequences and can more easily be remedied through a fresh application for registration (see, mutatis mutandis, Movement for Democratic Kingdom, and Lajda and Others, both cited above). In that connection, the Court cannot overlook that, as pointed out by the Government, it is open to the applicant party to re-apply for registration, provided that it complies with all formal requirements of the law. In as much as the main hurdle to its successful registration appears to be the high number of founding members \u2013 five thousand \u2013 required under section 15(1) of the 2005 Political Parties Act, the Court observes that with the amendment of that provision in January 2009 that number was halved and currently stands at two and a half thousand (see paragraph 47 above and, mutatis mutandis, Lajda and Others, cited above, where the Court was faced with a similar reduction of the number of adherents required for the registration of a religious association). That was noted by the Committee of Ministers in its final resolution in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others (cited above) (see paragraph 39 above).",
