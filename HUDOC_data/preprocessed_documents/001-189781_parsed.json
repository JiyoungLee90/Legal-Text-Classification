UNFICYP\u2019s efforts to assist the sides to bring the suspects to justice proved unsuccessful, and all suspects were released in the north. This case is an illustration of the growing number of crimes across the cease-fire line, such as smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and human trafficking.

It is also common for national laws to lay down conditions under which extradition must or may be refused. In a number of States these conditions include situations where the crime in question is also subject to the jurisdiction of the requested State or the latter has already instituted proceedings in respect of the same acts. This is the position, for example, in Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Poland, Slovenia and Switzerland. The laws of some States make it expressly clear that, even when all the legal conditions for the extradition are satisfied, the final decision by the executive power includes the consideration of the State\u2019s interests, and is thus of a political and discretionary nature. This is the case in particular in Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Romania and Slovakia. In contrast to the discretionary approach adopted by the overwhelming majority of States, it appears that under Irish and United Kingdom law extradition must be ordered if the relevant statutory conditions are met, although this requirement applies to countries specified in the law or with which there are extradition agreements.",

Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and\u00a043579/98, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2005VII). Since the domestic criminal law provisions to be put in place by States were to protect the right of life of persons \u201cwithin their jurisdiction\u201d only, Article 2 did not require States to put in place criminal-law provisions dealing with offences committed outside their jurisdiction, or to assume universal jurisdiction (referring to Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, no.\u00a025965/04, \u00a7 244, ECHR 2010 (extracts), and Emin and Others v. Cyprus, Greece and the United Kingdom (dec.), nos.\u00a059623/08 and 6 others, 3 June 2010). In the absence of \u201cspecial features\u201d in a given case (within the meaning of Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7 \u00a0243; for instance, treaty commitments to investigate or to institute criminal proceedings in respect of a death occurring in another State Party as in the case of Aliyeva and Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 35587/08, \u00a7 57, 31 \u00a0July 2014), a State was obliged to investigate a death under Article 2 only if there was such a \u201cjurisdictional link\u201d between the victim and the State. In the present case, there was no \u201cjurisdictional link\u201d between the victims and Turkey either on the basis of territoriality, State agent authority and control, or effective control over an area. The presence of the suspects in the \u201cTRNC\u201d or Turkey and the fact that the Turkish and \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities had been informed of the crime (\u00a7\u00a0187 of the Chamber judgment) could not qualify as \u201cspecial features\u201d justifying a departure from the general principle that the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention fell on the State under whose jurisdiction the victim was to be found at the time of death. In the Turkish Government\u2019s opinion, nor could it be said that by instituting its criminal investigation of its own motion Turkey had assumed the procedural obligations under Article 2 arising out of the jurisdictional link between the victims and Cyprus.",

The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control, whether it be exercised directly, through the Contracting State\u2019s own armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 62, Series A no. 310; Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2001-IV; Ila\u015fcu and Others v.

The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77, and Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, \u00a7 138).",

The Court confined itself to noting that the applicant\u2019s Article 2 complaint against Russia concerned Russia\u2019s failure to take investigative measures, including securing evidence from witnesses resident in Russia. Although the extent of any procedural obligation incumbent on Russia under Article 2 was left for the examination of the merits, the Court accepted the compatibility ratione loci of the complaint (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0208 and 212). When examining the merits of the complaint under Article 2, the Court noted that the death had taken place in Cyprus and that, as a rule, the obligation to ensure an effective investigation applied to Cyprus alone (ibid., \u00a7 243, referring mutatis mutandis to Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2001XI, in relation to Article 3).

The Court reiterated that generally the procedural obligation under Article 2 fell on the respondent State under whose jurisdiction the person was to be found at the time of death. It did not, in the particular case, find any special elements that would have supported the imposition of a duty on the United Kingdom to conduct its own investigation into disappearances which had taken place within the territory and under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Cyprus.

The Court has already found that northern Cyprus is under the effective control of Turkey for the purposes of the Convention (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 77).

Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07778). In the context of its general approach to the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in unrecognised entities, the Court has had regard to the special character of the Convention as an instrument of European public order (ordre public) for the protection of individual human beings and has thus pursued the aim of ensuring that Convention rights are protected throughout the territory of all Contracting Parties (see Cyprus v.\u00a0Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a078, and Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 136).",

In its view, it was clear from the facts of the case that the authorities of the respondent States had taken a significant number of investigative steps promptly. A considerable amount of evidence had been collected and eight suspects had quickly been identified, traced and arrested (see paragraphs 266, 269, 276, 277 of the Chamber judgment). As to the applicants\u2019 grievances against Cyprus concerning the extradition requests, the Chamber noted that there was no indication that the requests had not been made correctly or through the right channels and that the fact that they had been made more than three and a half years after the issuance of the Red Notices did not constitute any significant obstacle (see paragraph 272 of the Chamber judgment). The Chamber also stated that it was not persuaded that the applicants had been excluded from the investigation carried out by the Cypriot authorities (see paragraph 274 of the Chamber judgment). As regards the investigation carried out by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, the Chamber noted that the investigation did not result in any prosecutions because of a lack of evidence (see paragraph 280 of the Chamber judgment). Therefore, the Chamber perceived no shortcomings that might call into question the overall adequacy of the respective investigations in themselves. It considered, however, that there was no need to make a finding under Article\u00a02 on this matter, in view of its conclusion as to the failure to cooperate between the respondent States (see paragraph 281 of the Chamber judgment).",

Where \u2013 as in the applicants\u2019 case \u2013 the investigation into the unlawful killing unavoidably implicated more than one State, the respondent States concerned were obliged to cooperate and take all reasonable steps necessary to facilitate and carry out an effective investigation into the case as a whole (see paragraph\u00a0285 of the Chamber judgment). Although, in the Chamber\u2019s view, the respondent States had had the opportunity to find a solution and come to an agreement under the brokerage of UNFICYP, they had not used that opportunity to the full. Any suggestions made in an effort to find a compromise solution or so that the authorities concerned could meet each other half way (such as meetings on neutral territory between both sides, the questioning of the suspects in the UN buffer zone, an ad hoc trial at a neutral venue, etc.) had been met with downright refusal on the part of those authorities. This position arose from political considerations which reflected the long-standing and intense political dispute between Cyprus and Turkey. On the Cypriot Government\u2019s side it was evident that what had driven the unwillingness to cooperate was the refusal to lend any legitimacy to the \u201cTRNC\u201d \u2013 an argument that the Chamber rejected. The Chamber ruled in this respect that it did not accept that steps taken to cooperate in order to further the investigation in this case would amount to recognition, implied or otherwise of the \u201cTRNC\u201d (see paragraph 291 of the Chamber judgment). On the other hand, the Chamber found it striking that the extradition requests made by the Cypriot Government, the sole legitimate government of Cyprus, had been completely ignored by the Turkish Government (see paragraph 292 of the Chamber judgment).",

Turkey therefore had an obligation to cooperate with the legitimate Government of Cyprus to secure human rights in cross-border cases, in order to prevent the murder suspects, who had fled from the territory under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus, from going unpunished. By refusing to engage at all with the extradition requests from Cyprus, Turkey had failed to engage in minimum cooperation. Furthermore, the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities had refused to compromise, given their insistence that the trial should take place in the \u201cTRNC\u201d.

First, a requirement under Article 2 for Cyprus to hand over all its evidence to the \u201cTRNC\u201d would breach the customary international law obligation of non-recognition, as codified in the Articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001 (Article\u00a041.2) and upheld by the International Court of Justice (they referred to the Advisory Opinion concerning Namibia). Since the situation in northern Cyprus was a situation of unlawful purported acquisition of territory, renouncing criminal jurisdiction in favour of the \u201cTRNC\u201d for a crime committed outside the occupied territory would have served to consolidate the \u201cTRNC\u201d\u2018s claim to and control over the territory. It was also different from \u201crecognition\u201d of the administrative acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, to the extent necessary for Turkey to be held accountable for violations of the Convention in the occupied territory or for Turkey to be allowed to correct wrongs imputable to it (referring to Foka v. Turkey, no.\u00a028940/95, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, 24 June 2008, and Demopoulos and Others, cited above). The mere fact that the United Kingdom had cooperated with the \u201cTRNC\u201d did not of itself make that cooperation lawful; what could reasonably be expected of an occupied State would inevitably be different from what could reasonably be expected of a third party State. Secondly, Article 2 could not require Cyprus, which had the strongest claim to jurisdiction (murder on the territory under Cyprus\u2019s control and against Cypriot nationals), to hand over evidence to the \u201cTRNC\u201d, which, not being a State party to the Convention, was not capable of discharging Article 2 obligations. Furthermore, the provision of that evidence to the \u201cTRNC\u201d would have resulted in the trial of the suspects by unlawful \u201ccourts\u201d which would then have resulted in their unlawful detention (relying on Mitrovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 52142/12, 21 March 2017). There could not be a duty under Article\u00a02 to provide evidence in circumstances where it was reasonably foreseeable that the provision of that evidence would result in breaches of the Convention.",

In other words they should cooperate where it was necessary to safeguard those rights. Whilst it was correct to say that the Court was not competent to rule on a State\u2019s compliance with other international instruments (see paragraph 288 of the Chamber judgment), the AIRE Centre invited the Grand Chamber to recall Article 53 of the Convention, which required that \u201cnothing in this Convention shall be construed as limiting or derogating from any of the rights ensured... under any other agreement to which it is a party\u201d. Thus where other international agreements imposed collective/joint cooperative obligations to assist in securing the proper implementation of Convention rights, Article 53 might require that the manner of adherence to those obligations was relevant to the determination of compliance with the Convention itself (M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, \u00a7\u00a7 249-50, ECHR 2011).

It found that the Cypriot authorities should have sought legal assistance from Russia in investigating the circumstances of the victim\u2019s death in Cyprus, by making a request to obtain the testimony of two witnesses who were present in Russia. It took account of the fact that both Cyprus and Russia were parties to the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and had, in addition, concluded a bilateral legal assistance treaty. Having regard, inter alia, to its failure to seek cooperation from Russia, the Court found that there had been a procedural violation of Article 2 by Cyprus (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 241-42). It went on to say that the corollary of the obligation on an investigating State to secure evidence located in other jurisdictions was a duty on the State where evidence was located to render any assistance within its competence and means sought under a legal assistance request. However, the Court considered that in the absence of any request from Cyprus, Russia had no obligation to interview the two witnesses present on its territory, as requested by the applicants. It further observed that the Russian authorities had made extensive use of the opportunities presented by mutual legal assistance agreements to press for action by the Cypriot authorities, including by making a specific request to institute criminal proceedings. The Court therefore found that there had been no procedural violation of Article 2 by Russia (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 245-47).",

The Court noted in Pali\u0107 that the domestic authorities had issued international arrest warrants, but that the investigation had been at a standstill ever since, as the suspects had moved to Serbia and as Serbian citizens could not be extradited. In Nje\u017ei\u0107 and \u0160timac, although there had been no international arrest warrants issued, the extradition of the majority of the suspects would not have been possible because those that had become Serbian citizens could not be extradited from Serbia. The Court held that the respondent States (Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, respectively) could not be held liable for that situation. It further considered that it was not necessary to establish whether those States had been obliged to request Serbia to take proceedings, since the applicants themselves could have reported their case to the Serbian authorities, who had jurisdiction over serious violations of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in the former Yugoslavia. Moreover, it was open to the applicants to lodge an application against Serbia if they considered that they were the victims of a breach by Serbia of their Convention rights (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 68, respectively).",

The Court reiterated that in some situations, where the suspects were on the territory of another State which refused to extradite them, there might be particular obstacles which could hinder the progress of a criminal investigation; Azerbaijan could not be held liable for another State\u2019s decision not to extradite its nationals (ibid., \u00a7 110). It found, however, that that refusal had not prevented the Azerbaijani authorities from examining the feasibility of transferring the criminal case to the Georgian authorities. The Court noted in that connection that various international legal instruments, such as the European Convention on Extradition, the 1993 Minsk Convention and a bilateral treaty, to which both States were parties, clearly provided for such a possibility. Moreover, the Georgian authorities expressly referred to that possibility in their reply to the extradition request from the Azerbaijani authorities. However, there was no evidence that the Azerbaijani authorities had examined the possibility of prosecuting the alleged perpetrators of the murder in Georgia by transferring the criminal case there (ibid., \u00a7 111). The Court also distinguished this case from Pali\u0107 as well as from Nje\u017ei\u0107 and \u0160timac (cited above), indicating that in those cases the applicants could have reported their case themselves to the Serbian authorities, which had jurisdiction over serious violations of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in the former Yugoslavia. In the Huseynova case the applicant did not have the possibility of applying directly to the Georgian authorities and the alleged perpetrators of the murder could have been prosecuted in Georgia only at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities following a transfer of the criminal case (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0112). The Court took account of this failure of the Azerbaijani authorities to consider the transfer of the case as one of the grounds for concluding that there had been a violation of Article\u00a02 under its procedural limb.",

This collective character may, in some specific circumstances, imply a duty for Contracting States to act jointly and to cooperate in order to protect the rights and freedoms they have undertaken to secure within their jurisdiction (see for instance, in the area of cross-border human trafficking under Article\u00a04 of the Convention, Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7 289). In cases where an effective investigation into an unlawful killing which occurred within the jurisdiction of one Contracting State requires the involvement of more than one Contracting State, the Court finds that the Convention\u2019s special character as a collective enforcement treaty entails in principle an obligation on the part of the States concerned to cooperate effectively with each other in order to elucidate the circumstances of the killing and to bring the perpetrators to justice.",

Such a result could frustrate the purpose of the protection under Article 2 and render illusory the guarantees in respect of an individual\u2019s right to life. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings require that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see Al-Skeini and Others, cited above, \u00a7 \u00a0162, and Margu\u0161 v.

This means that the States concerned must take whatever reasonable steps they can to cooperate with each other, exhausting in good faith the possibilities available to them under the applicable international instruments on mutual legal assistance and cooperation in criminal matters. In this connection, the Court is aware that Contracting States cannot cooperate with each other in a legal vacuum; specific formalised modalities of cooperation between States have developed in international criminal law. This approach is consistent with the previous transnational cases under the procedural limb of Articles\u00a02, 3 and 4, in which the Court has generally referred to existing extradition and other mutual assistance instruments binding on the States concerned (see Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 241, 246 and 307; Agache and Others, cited above, \u00a7 83; Nasr and Ghali, cited above, \u00a7 272; and Huseynova, cited above, \u00a7 111). Although the Court is not competent to supervise respect for international treaties or obligations other than the Convention (see Aliyeva and Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 74), it normally verifies in this context whether the respondent State has used the possibilities available under these instruments. The Court reiterates in this respect that it must take into account any relevant rules and principles of international law applicable in relations between the Contracting Parties and that the Convention should so far as possible be interpreted in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part (see Al-Adsani, cited above, \u00a7 55; Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2008; and Article 31 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention of 23 May 1969 on the Law of Treaties).",

Therefore, the procedural obligation to cooperate under Article 2 should be interpreted in the light of international treaties or agreements applicable between the Contracting States concerned, following as far as possible a combined and harmonious application of the Convention and those instruments, which should not result in conflict or opposition between them (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Latvia [GC], no.\u00a027853/09, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2013, concerning the interpretation of Article 8 of the Convention and of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction). In this context, the procedural obligation to cooperate will only be breached in respect of a State required to seek cooperation if it has failed to trigger the proper mechanisms for cooperation under the relevant international treaties; and in respect of the requested State, if it has failed to respond properly or has not been able to invoke a legitimate ground for refusing the cooperation requested under those instruments.",

Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 77). As the two respondent States have no formal diplomatic relations, the international treaties to which both States were parties (Council of Europe treaties, see relevant international law) cannot be the sole framework of reference in determining whether both States used all the possibilities available to them to cooperate with each other. In the absence of formal diplomatic relations, formalised means of cooperation are more likely to fail and States may be required to use other more informal or indirect channels of cooperation, for instance through third States or international organisations.",

Although their applicability to the specific circumstances of the case has been partially contested by Turkey, in particular with regard to their territorial applicability, these two conventions were in force in respect of both States and Turkey had not yet made the declarations attached to some of their Additional Protocols excluding their applicability with regard to the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraphs 144 and 149 above). The Court does not, however, consider that it is competent to determine whether these conventions were applicable according to their provisions or to review whether the respondent States complied with their obligations in the specific circumstances of the case. As noted in paragraph 238 above, these treaties can also provide the Court with guidance for the purposes of interpreting the obligation to cooperate under the procedural limb of Article 2 (for examples where the Court has taken into account international instruments as an expression of evolving norms in international law, irrespective of whether they had been ratified by the States concerned or were binding at the material time, see Demir and Baykara, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-86; Rantsev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 278, 282, 285-86 and 289; and Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7 145, 8 November 2016). This applies a fortiori in the present case, where the conventions at issue have been ratified by all member States of the Council of Europe, thus indicating that there is a clear measure of common ground amongst them in the area of extradition and cooperation in criminal matters (see paragraphs 146 and 151 above).",

These Red Notices were published by Interpol in respect of the eight suspects. The Cypriot bureau of Interpol also sent emails to the Turkish Ministry of Internal Affairs stating that it was searching for the suspects, and requesting that they be arrested if they entered Turkey (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above). It appears from the documents relating to meetings with UNFICYP that the Cypriot authorities knew that some of the suspects were already detained in the \u201cTRNC\u201d at that time (see paragraphs\u00a0108, 114 and 115 above). On the basis of all this, Cyprus tried to negotiate the surrender of the suspects by the \u201cTRNC\u201d through UNFICYP from the early stages of the investigation (see paragraphs 113, 118 and 121). It was, however, very clear early on that neither the Turkish nor the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities were intending to surrender the suspects (see paragraphs 93, 110, and 114). In these circumstances and in particular in the light of the objections put forward by Turkey and the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, which were conveyed to Cyprus through UNFICYP, Cyprus cannot be criticised for first trying to obtain the surrender through UNFICYP, and only when those efforts eventually proved unsuccessful, submitting the extradition requests to Turkey (in respect of six suspects, all except the fourth suspect who had died and the eighth suspect who had already been detained in Cyprus in 2006 and released) more than three and half years after the Red Notices were published. There is moreover no indication that this lapse of time in any way affected the outcome of the extradition requests.",

The Court does not consider it desirable or necessary in the present case to elaborate a general theory concerning the lawfulness of cooperation in criminal matters with unrecognised or de facto entities under international law. Nevertheless, the Court agrees with the Cypriot Government that the present case should be distinguished from previous cases in which the Court has accepted the validity for the purposes of the Convention of legal remedies established or measures adopted by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities with regard to \u201cTRNC\u201d inhabitants or persons affected by their actions (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 238; Demopoulos and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96; and Foka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84). In all those cases the Court recognised the validity of those remedies and acts to the extent necessary for Turkey to be able to secure all the Convention rights in northern Cyprus and to correct any wrongs imputable to it. The key consideration for the Court was to avoid a vacuum which would operate to the detriment of those who live under the occupation, or those who, living outside, may claim to have been victims of infringements of their rights (see Demopoulos and Others, cited above, \u00a7 96). In the present case, the question that arises is whether the Republic of Cyprus as the legitimate government of Cyprus, with no control over the northern part of the island, which is under the effective control of Turkey, can cooperate with the de facto authorities set up within that territory (the \u201cTRNC\u201d) without implicitly lending legitimacy or legality to them or to the occupation. In the Court\u2019s view, this situation is also different from that in which a Contracting State other than Cyprus cooperates with those authorities (see, for instance, the cooperation between the United Kingdom police and the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities referred to in paragraph 214 above).",

This statement was made in the context of the Court\u2019s assessment of whether the Republic of Moldova had discharged its positive obligations in respect of the applicants in that case, who were detained within the area controlled by the Transdniestrian de facto regime. These included the obligation on the part of Moldova to re-establish control over Transdniestria and to refrain from supporting the separatist regime. However, the Court would point out that those unofficial relations mostly concerned communications between Moldovan prosecutors or officers and their counterparts in Transdniestria, particularly to obtain information and summon witnesses.",

The Court notes that Cyprus sent some of the evidence to the \u201cTRNC\u201d through UNFICYP, namely the DNA results (see paragraphs 121 and 123 above), and was also ready to hand over all the evidence to UNFICYP so that the latter could see whether there was a prima facie case against the suspects, subject to an undertaking by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities that they would surrender the suspects to Cyprus in that event (see paragraph 130 above). Since there was no such undertaking by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, Cyprus refused to hand over any more evidence. Furthermore, the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities\u2019 insistence on obtaining all the evidence from Cyprus (police investigation records and security camera recordings) appears to be linked to their intention to prosecute and try the suspects before their courts, as shown also by their stance that the suspects should be tried by Turkish Cypriot courts (see paragraphs 110, 112, 114, 116 and 120 above). This became even more evident after notice of the present case was given to the respondent Governments in 2009 and the Cypriot investigation file was provided to Turkey through the Court. Indeed, the Turkish Government insisted before the Chamber that cooperation from Cyprus had been needed to ensure that witnesses, as well as those who had prepared the various reports, appeared before the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts to give evidence. They also confirmed that the \u201cTRNC\u201d was obliged to reject a request for the extradition of its nationals under the law of the \u201cTRNC\u201d (see paragraph 247 of the Chamber judgment). Turkey has further contended before the Grand Chamber that Cyprus should have requested the transfer of the criminal proceedings with regard at least to the fifth suspect, who was a Turkish citizen present in Turkey, a possibility provided for by both the Extradition Convention (Article 6(2)) and the Transfer of Proceedings Convention (Articles 6 and 8(1)(g)).",

It would amount in substance to a transfer of the criminal case by Cyprus to the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts, and Cyprus would thereby be waiving its criminal jurisdiction over a murder committed in its controlled area in favour of the courts of an unrecognised entity set up within its territory. Indeed, the exercise of criminal jurisdiction is one of the main features of the sovereignty of a State. The Court therefore agrees with the Cypriot Government that in such a specific situation it was not unreasonable to refuse to waive its criminal jurisdiction in favour of the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts.",

This ground for refusal can also be found in the legislation of some member States (see paragraph 167 above). Likewise, the Transfer of Proceedings Convention does not impose an obligation on a State to waive jurisdiction and transfer the proceedings to another State. Nor does it establish a system of priorities of jurisdiction in the event of positive conflicts of jurisdiction between two States that would impose, for instance, a duty to transfer the case to the State where the suspects are located (see paragraphs 154-56 above; and Explanatory Report on the Convention, p.\u00a031).",

However, the Court does not see how these other forms of cooperation could, in themselves, have facilitated the prosecution and trial of the suspects. It has not been established before the Court that these alternatives, in particular the possibility of arranging an ad hoc trial at a neutral venue, would have had a sufficiently solid basis in domestic or international law.

They relied in particular on the 1960 Constitution of Cyprus, which required that Turkish-Cypriot accused be judged by Turkish Cypriot judges (see paragraphs 112, 114, 120 and 142 above).

Furthermore, costs and expenses are only recoverable to the extent that they relate to the violation found (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, \u00a7 146, 25 September 2018). In the present case, the Court has found that Cyprus was not responsible for any violation of the Convention. Accordingly, no award of compensation for costs and expenses is to be made with regard to this respondent State (see Mozer, cited above, \u00a7 239). Having regard to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants EUR 10,000 in respect of costs and expenses incurred before it, to be paid by Turkey and to be converted into GBP at the rate applicable on the date of settlement.",

If a State is required to refrain from acts calculated to frustrate or obstruct the object of a treaty it has signed but not yet ratified, the same standard or an even higher one should apply when the State does ratify the treaty. Article 18 indicates that for a State to be a party to a treaty, it must genuinely be prepared and ready to abide by it.

Furthermore, the Convention, in Articles 17 and 18 respectively, prohibits the abuse of rights and the misuse of restrictions, those prohibitions also being elements of the principle of good faith. Moreover, Article 3 of the Statute of the Council of Europe (London, 5.V.1949) provides that \u201c[e]very member of the Council of Europe must \u2026 collaborate sincerely and effectively in the realisation of the aim of the Council\u201d stated in Article 1 therein.

The reasons put forward by Cyprus to justify its refusal to supply all the evidence to Turkey or to the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was either that provision of evidence to the \u201cTRNC\u201d would have resulted in the suspects\u2019 unlawful detention and trial by unlawful courts within the meaning of the Convention (see paragraph 247) or that such cooperation would have breached the customary international law principle of nonrecognition (see paragraph 250).

The United Kingdom, for example, has cooperated in criminal cases with the \u201cTRNC\u201d (see Attorney General v. Ozgay Yorgun TRNC Nicosia Assize Court, case no. 5719/99, Supreme Court appeal no. 67/99, in which the United Kingdom authorities had provided witnesses and evidence for the prosecution of the suspects, as referred to in the Chamber judgment, \u00a7 244) without affording it any recognition. In that sense the High Court of England and Wales had rejected the argument that police-to-police cooperation with \u201cNorthern Cypriot\u201d authorities amounted to implied recognition (see R. (in the application of Akarcay) v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, [2017] EWHC 159). The majority\u2019s approach is simply to tell Cyprus that it is not bound by the procedural obligation to cooperate under Article 2 when it comes to cooperation with the \u201cTRNC\u201d.",

Only the suggestion of an ad hoc trial at a neutral venue is dismissed by the majority as having an insufficient basis in domestic or international law.
