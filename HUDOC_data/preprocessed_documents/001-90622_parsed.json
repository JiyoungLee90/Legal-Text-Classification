No exceptions to that rule were permitted or provided for.

The application of that rule must, however, make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to establish. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. The rule is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each case. This means, amongst other things, that the Court must take realistic account of the general legal and political context in which the remedies operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see Estrikh v. , no.\u00a073819/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092 and 94, 18\u00a0January 2007, with further references).",

Although mere doubts as to the prospects of success of national remedies do not absolve an applicant from the obligation to exhaust those remedies, in a situation where he had repeatedly and unsuccessfully used a remedy, his failure to have further recourse to it on assumption that it would offer little if any prospects of success cannot be said to have been unreasonable.

The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s case concerned four defendants and was of a certain complexity. It reiterates in this respect that in cases involving numerous defendants, collecting evidence is often a difficult task, as it is necessary to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources and to determine the facts and degree of alleged responsibility of each of the co-suspects (see, mutadis mutandis, \u0141aszkiewicz v. , no. 28481/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059 and 61, 15\u00a0January 2008). In the present case the investigation was completed within eight months. There is no evidence of any significant periods of inactivity on the part of the prosecution authorities. Although the applicant argued that no investigative actions were taken for several months, his argument was rejected by the domestic courts (see paragraph 19 above). The judicial decisions and other documents in the case file show that within eight months the prosecution had searched the applicant\u2019s flat, obtained several expert opinions, questioned the applicant and his co-defendants, confronted them with witnesses and drawn up the bill of indictment. It took the defendants about two months to study the case file which delayed the committal of the case for trial through no fault of the authorities. The trial was conducted with due expedition and was completed within two months. The Court considers that the domestic authorities handled the applicant\u2019s case with the requisite diligence.",

Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see Reinprecht v. Austria, no. 67175/01, \u00a7\u00a031, ECHR 2005-...., with further references). The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure equality of arms between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c), a hearing is required (see Trzaska v.\u00a0Poland, no. 25792/94, \u00a7\u00a074, 11 July 2000). The possibility for a detainee to be heard either in person or through some form of representation features among the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty (see Kampanis v. Greece, 13 July 1995, \u00a7\u00a047, Series A no. 318-B).",

The violation of the applicant\u2019s rights at the hearing of 16 May 2003 made necessary an application for supervisory review and a new appeal hearing, causing an inordinate seventy-one-day delay in the final determination of the applicant\u2019s appeal.
