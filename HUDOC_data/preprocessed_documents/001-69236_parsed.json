An additional aspect of the crammed and insalubrious conditions was the lack of any partition separating the lavatory pan from the living area and, in particular, from the dining table fixed to the floor barely one metre away. The ventilation did not function most of the time and steel plates fitted to cell windows blocked access of fresh air (cf., 11th General Report, \u00a7 30). The lack of adequate ventilation was further aggravated by a general tolerance to smoking in the cell. For the applicant, who was a non-smoker, that was another severe, inescapable effect of the overcrowding. Other factors indicating the degrading character of the conditions of detention were the appalling quality of nutrition, the absence of bedding, swarming of insects, and the inadequate supplies of detergents. In the detention the applicant contracted scabies; he was given some treatment but was not isolated from other inmates.

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (Vala\u0161inas v. , no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101, ECHR 2001VIII).",

The applicant's situation was also comparable with that in the Kalashnikov case, where the applicant had been confined to a space measuring less than 2 m2. In that case the Court held that such a degree of overcrowding raised in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (Kalashnikov v. , no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7\u00a7 96-97, ECHR 2002VI). By contrast, in some other cases no violation of Article 3 was found, as the restricted space in the sleeping facilities was compensated by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (Vala\u0161inas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107; Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004).",

The fact that the applicant was obliged to live, sleep and use the toilet in the same cell with so many other inmates was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and arouse in him the feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him (Peers and Kalashnikov, cited above, loc. cit.; see also the CPT's 11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001) 16], \u00a7 29).",

These aspects, while not in themselves capable of justifying the notion of \u201cdegrading\u201d treatment, are relevant in addition to the focal factor of the severe overcrowding, to show that the applicant's detention conditions went beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 of the Convention.",

Greece, cited above, loc. cit.; Kalashnikov v. Russia, cited above, \u00a7 101). Even if there had been no fault on the part of the facility officials, it should be emphasised that the Governments are answerable under the Convention for the acts of any State agency since what is in issue in all cases before the Court is the international responsibility of the State (Lukanov v. Bulgaria, judgment of 20 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II, \u00a7 40).",
