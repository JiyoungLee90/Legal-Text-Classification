The Court has already found that although a court itself has no competence to institute criminal proceedings, its power to annul a refusal to institute criminal proceedings and indicate the defects to be addressed appears to be a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power by the investigating authority (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). At the same time the Court has pointed out that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69, and Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

During this period the criminal proceedings were discontinued and reopened thirteen times (see paragraphs\u00a046-55). In fact, except for two long interruptions of five and ten months, the proceedings were discontinued and reopened every one or two months on the supervising prosecutors\u2019 requests. The prosecutors had mostly referred to the same reasons for reopening the investigation (see paragraphs 47, 49, 51-53). In the Court\u2019s view, this demonstrates that the investigators were not diligent in eliminating the drawbacks in the investigation indicated by the supervising prosecutors. In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that an appeal to a court, which could only have had the same effect, would have offered the applicant any redress. It considers, therefore, that such an appeal in the particular circumstances of the present case would be devoid of any purpose (see, for example, Khatsiyeva and Others v. , no. 5108/02, \u00a7 151, 17 January 2008). The Court finds that the applicant was not obliged to pursue that remedy and that the Government\u2019s objection should therefore be dismissed.",

It was important to conduct this process as fast as possible whilst the memories of what had happened were still fresh, but also in order to avoid the loss of contact with witnesses. The Court is also mindful of the important role which investigative interviews play in obtaining accurate and reliable information from suspects, witnesses and victims and, ultimately, the discovery of the truth about the matter under investigation. Observing the suspects\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and victims\u2019 demeanour during questioning and assessing the probative value of their testimony forms a substantial part of the investigative process. The recollection of the events in question by the witnesses naturally fades away over the years, and the substantial delays in carrying out these assignments in the present case added up to the initial lapse of time (paragraph 79) and contributed greatly towards rendering the investigation ineffective.",

At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect for the right of an accused not to incriminate himself (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2006-IX, and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005).",

The Court has already discussed the circumstances in which the confession was obtained and considers that they were such as to cast doubts on its reliability. It also transpires that although the trial and appeal courts dealt with the applicant\u2019s submissions concerning duress, the relevant court decisions contain no meaningful ruling on the issue of legal assistance, despite the fact that the applicant consistently raised this matter at both levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above).

In the circumstances, the Court considers that there was no material difference between a recorded deposition by a witness or the result of an identity parade on the one hand and the result of a face-to-face confrontation on the other, since all are capable of furnishing evidence against a defendant in a criminal trial (see also Mirilashvili v.

The Court\u2019s task is thus to determine whether the applicant\u2019s conviction in respect of the first charge concerning which witnesses Sh. and Zh. gave their evidence was based solely, or in a decisive manner, on the evidence given by these witnesses in such a way that his right to a fair trial was violated (see, for example, Vladimir Romanov v. , no. 41461/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0100-03, 24 July 2008).",

Given these circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s conviction in respect of the first charge was based to a decisive extent on the pre-trial statements of witnesses Sh. and Zh. whom the applicant had no possibility to question.

During that confrontation the applicant admitted his involvement in the incident, later partly confirming this position at the trial (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 30). The Court notes, however, its earlier findings under Articles 3 and 6 \u00a7 1 (c) about the circumstances in which the applicant\u2019s consent to take part in interviews and confrontations of 4 October 2002 was obtained, the absence of the applicant\u2019s counsel on that day and, more generally, its doubts concerning the voluntary character of the applicant\u2019s participation.
