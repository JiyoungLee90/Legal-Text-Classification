In respect of each of the cases, investigations were formally pending at the time at which the applications were lodged with the Court. The criminal proceedings in respect of all the cases were suspended and resumed on several occasions throughout the periods concerned. The applicants maintained reasonable contact with the authorities, cooperated with each investigation, and, where appropriate, took steps to inform themselves of the progress of the proceedings and to speed them up, in the hope of securing a more effective outcome (see paragraphs 20, 43, 92-93, 158, 177-178 above). Given the time that passed between each of the abductions and the initiation of the relevant criminal proceedings \u2013 as well as the active stance taken by the applicants in respect of the proceedings \u2013 the Court is satisfied that the applicants lodged their applications within a reasonable amount of time (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, \u00a7\u00a0166, ECHR 2009).",

It has previously found that the law-enforcement bodies were not functioning properly in Chechnya at the time in question (see Isayeva v. Russia, no.\u00a057950/00, \u00a7 158, 24 February 2005); this state of affairs precluded the applicants from complaining promptly about the abduction of their respective relatives. Furthermore, there were two significant lulls in the criminal proceedings, each comprising four years; however, the applicants were not duly informed of the 2001 decision to suspend the investigation that signalled the first lull in the investigation (see paragraph 129 above); the proceedings were then resumed twice after the first applicant lodged complaints with the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Grozny (see paragraph 137 above). The Court notes that such long periods of inactivity on the part of the authorities could have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the pending investigation. However, taking into account the authorities\u2019 failure to provide the applicants with information concerning the investigation (notably the first decision to suspend it) and the fact that the investigations were complex and concerned very serious allegations, the Court concludes that it was reasonable for the applicants to wait for developments that could have resolved crucial factual or legal issues (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7\u00a0142, ECHR 2012). The delay in the opening of the criminal case, or the lulls in the proceedings, cannot therefore be interpreted as constituting a failure on the part of the applicants to comply with the sixmonth requirement (see Sagayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 22698/09 and 31189/11, \u00a7\u00a7 58-61, 8 December 2015, and Abdulkhadzhiyeva and Abdulkhadzhiyev v. Russia, no. 40001/08, \u00a7 67, 4 October 2016).",
