The father could only be granted a right of access by court order if this was in the interest of the child.  According to the court\u2019s findings, these conditions were not met in the applicant\u2019s case. The court considered that, as the parents separated when J. was only one and a half years old and as he did not exercise his right of access for several years, he was a stranger in respect of the child.

In the court\u2019s view, it was not in J.\u2019s interest to act contrary to her wish. After several changes, her mother\u2019s new husband had become a person exercising parental functions (m\u00e4nnliche Bezugsperson). J.\u2019s stable position and emotions would be shaken if contacts with a stranger were forced. In this context, the court considered that J. was very sensitive and vulnerable and therefore needed stable living conditions and a family life free of conflict. Her physical and emotional well-being could be easily affected and she had difficulties in concentrating and learning. Her wish not to have any contacts with her father had, therefore, to be accepted. ",

His argument that it had not been his fault that he had not been able to exercise his right of access since 1987 was irrelevant, as the child\u2019s interests were decisive. His criticism of section 1711 was irrelevant as this provision was the applicable legislation according to which granting access contrary to the mother\u2019s will was only possible in the interest of the child. However, in the applicant\u2019s case the District Court, on the basis of an expert opinion, had correctly found that J.\u2019s wish not to have contacts with the applicant had to be accepted. Moreover, even assuming that J. was influenced by her mother, such influence could not justify to force her to have contacts with the applicant.

Even if the criteria established in the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 1991 on the necessity to abolish discrimination against children born out of wedlock were applied to procedural rules, the general standards as to the period left to the legislator for the purpose of amending the relevant legislation did not yet permit the conclusion that the existing legislation was unconstitutional.",

Under such rules and circumstances, there was evidently a heavy burden of proof on the side of a father of a child born out of wedlock. The crucial point is that the courts did not to regard contacts between child and natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father. Even if the impugned decisions contain formulations referring to J.\u2019s sensitive and vulnerable personality and the risk that her stability and emotions would be shaken if contacts with the applicant were to be enforced, the mother\u2019s initial prohibition of further contacts and her influence on the child remained decisive.

According to paragraph 53 of the present judgment the \u201ccrucial point is that the courts did not regard contact between child and natural father prima facie as in the child\u2019s interest, a court decision granting access being the exception to the general statutory rule that the mother determined the child\u2019s relations with the father.\u201d I fail to see that the approach of the domestic courts on this point was in any relevant manner different in Elsholz, in which the District Court stated  that the provisions \u201cconcerning the father\u2019s right to personal contact with his child born out of wedlock ... was conceived of as an exemption clause which had to be construed strictly\u201d (paragraph 13 of the Elsholz judgment).

Therefore it could  not \u201cbe said  ... that a divorced father would have been treated more favourably\u201d (paragraph 61). The child\u2019s interests, however, seem to have been an equally paramount consideration in the present case. Thus both the District Court and the Regional Court very much emphasized the particular vulnerability and sensitivity of the child and the  dangers inherent in any forced contact between her and the applicant. Contrary to what the majority appears to suggest, I do not consider \u201cthe Regional Court\u2019s argument that, even assuming that J. had been influenced by her mother, such influence could not justify to force her to have contacts with the applicant\u201d (paragraph 53) as any particular proof of discrimination. To me this seems to be just another example of the paramount importance given to the child\u2019s interests, there being nothing indicating that in a comparable situation concerning a divorced father a different approach would have been taken.",
