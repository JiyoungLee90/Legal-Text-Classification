The case originated in an application (no. 34188/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Macedonian nationals, Mr Slobodan Ivanovski (“the first applicant”) and Mr Cvetan Velkoski (“the second applicant”) on 21 October 2003. The first applicant, who has а Croatian citizenship, also submitted the application on behalf of Mr Mile Stojčevski.
Mr Mile Stojčevski and the second applicant died on 27 February 2002 and 30 December 2005, respectively. Their widows, Mrs Vasilka Stojčevska and Mrs Stojanka Velkoska, both citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and resident in , applied to continue the application in their name. They further authorised the first applicant to represent them in this case.
The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska.
On 6 September 2007 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
On 17 August 2009 the Croatian Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings in respect of the first applicant (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court), indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right.
In 1995 the applicants concluded a sales contract with three individuals buying shares from the A. company (“the company”).
On 13 September 1996 the first applicant brought a civil action requesting the Skopje Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”) to order the company to register the sales contracts in its book of shareholders and to provide them with a certificate of title. On 22 November 1996 the second applicant and Mr Mile Stojčevski joined the first applicant's claim. During the proceedings, the applicants specified their claim on three occasions.
Between 25 June 1997 and 27 November 1998, the first-instance court ordered four adjournments, none of which was requested by the applicants.
On 11 January 1999 the first-instance court dismissed the applicants' claim finding that they had failed to comply with the applicable legislation and that the company had not had a capacity to stand in the proceedings. It also dismissed their request of 27 May 1998 for an interim measure prohibiting the vendors to dispose of the shares.
On 12 April 2000 the Skopje Court of Appeal partly upheld the applicants' appeal of 3 November 1999 and remitted the case for a renewed examination.
On 18 December 2001 the first-instance court dismissed the applicants' claim. The decision was served on them on 22 August 2002.
On 19 March 2003 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants' appeal. They were served with the decision on 7 May 2003.
