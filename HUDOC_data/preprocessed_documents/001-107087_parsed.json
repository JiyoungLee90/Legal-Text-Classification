He reasoned that it amounted to an administrative decision, creating legal rights for UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN, and that it was unlawful. Firstly, the organisation was not registered; on the contrary, in February 2007 the Supreme Court of Cassation had upheld the Sofia City Court\u2019s judgment turning down its request to be registered as a political party (see UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 41561/07, \u00a7\u00a7 819, 18 October 2011). Since it was accordingly unlawful under Bulgarian law, it had no standing to give notice of its intention to hold a rally. Secondly, the proposed rally would put public order at risk. Both the Rozhen Monastery and Melnik were places visited by many tourists, especially on Sundays. It was therefore inappropriate to allow the staging of rallies there. Moreover, rallies and meetings were being organised at those locations at the same time by the local authorities and non-governmental organisations. As clashes between supporters of UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and others had taken place in the past, it was necessary to ban its rally. Finally, the activities of the organisation were contrary to Bulgarian law, as they consisted in propaganda against the country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and aroused national and ethnic hatred. The Governor specified that his decision was to be served on the Mayor of Sandanski for execution. It was not served on UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN or on any of the applicants.",

After that both UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and UMO Ilinden were able to go ahead with the events planned by them, respectively in Melnik and near the Rozhen Monastery. As required by law, the police dispatched forces to ensure public order during the events. At about 10.30 a.m. a group of about fifty supporters of UMO Ilinden laid a wreath and flowers at Yane Sandanski\u2019s grave. UMO Ilinden\u2019s chairman made a short speech, and then the rally continued with a musical programme. No breaches of public order were noted. UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN was not allowed to hold a rally in front of the Rozhen Monastery. A compromise solution was reached with the organisation to hold the rally in Melnik. At about 12 noon approximately two hundred members and supporters of UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN gathered in front of Yane Sandanski\u2019s monument in Melnik. They laid a wreath and flowers. Then the organisation\u2019s leaders made short speeches about his life and work; in the Government\u2019s view, most of those speeches contained insults against the Bulgarian people and State. There were also a number of negative remarks against the police, threats of violence against the Regional Governor and insults against the chairperson of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister and other highranking politicians. The musical programme continued after the allotted time slot. The police did not allow drunk individuals to breach public order. Journalists from \u201cthe \u201d interviewed the leaders of UMO Ilinden and UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and a number of supporters.",

There was no indication that the Bulgarian courts would adopt an extensive interpretation of that provision and accept for examination an order issued by a regional governor, who clearly had no powers in connection with the holding of meetings or rallies. The decision and the judgment referred to by the Government were plainly inapposite, as they concerned mayoral decisions. The standard judicial review available in respect of regional governors\u2019 orders was not an effective remedy because, unlike the speedy procedure under the Meetings and Marches Act, which was designed to allow the examination of the case before the date of the planned event, it took on average six months. It would thus not allow consideration of the lawfulness of an order banning a rally in time for the event to proceed. The judicial review of police orders under the Code of Administrative Procedure suffered from the same drawback. The possibility to seek damages under the 1988 Act was not an effective remedy either, for two reasons. First, it would clearly not have allowed the applicants to hold their rally as planned.

In the instant case, the applicants amply complied with the above condition: they gave notice of the rally that they intended to organise a month and a half in advance (see paragraph 9 above).

It thus seems that the strict timelimit for determining applications for judicial review of mayoral bans of such rallies under section 12(6) of that Act did not apply to the Regional Governor\u2019s decision. The Government, who bear the burden of proof on that point, have not cited any examples in support of their assertion that the Governor\u2019s decision was reviewable under the Act. On the contrary, it appears that his decision was amenable to judicial review under the general provisions of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). However, unlike section 12(6) of the Act, those provisions do not require the courts to determine the case by means of a final decision within a brief period, and the procedure involves two levels of jurisdiction (see paragraph 26 above). Given that the Regional Governor\u2019s decision was made just four days before the planned rally (on a Wednesday, when the rally was to take place the following Sunday) and was not served on the applicants (see paragraph 11 above), it is unrealistic to assume that it would have been reviewed in time for the rally \u2013 whose timing was crucial for the organisers\u00a0\u2013 to proceed (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, Commission decision of 29 June 1998, unreported). It does not therefore seem that in the circumstances that remedy would have provided adequate redress to the applicants (see B\u0105czkowski and Others, \u00a7 83, and Alekseyev, \u00a7 99, both cited above).",

There is nothing to indicate that any legal challenges to them \u2013 which could involve two levels of jurisdiction \u2013 would have been determined in time for the rally to proceed.

First, the Government have not shown \u2013 by, for instance, citing relevant caselaw \u2013 that such a claim would have had a reasonable prospect of success (see Zeleni Balkani, cited above, \u00a7 46, and Hyde Park and Others v.  (nos. 5 and 6), nos.\u00a06991/08 and 15084/08, \u00a7 34 in fine, 14 September 2010). Secondly and more importantly, such a claim cannot be considered as providing sufficient redress in itself, because it can result solely in an award of compensation. In cases where \u2013 as here \u2013 the authorities, through deliberate actions, prevent a group of individuals or an organisation from holding a rally in the manner chosen by them, the alleged breach of Article 11 cannot be made good exclusively through such an award. If States were able to confine their response to such incidents to the mere payment of compensation, without putting in place effective procedures ensuring the possibility of staging such rallies, it would be possible in some cases for the authorities arbitrarily to deprive groups of individuals and organisations of their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Were that to be the case, that right, which, along with the rights to freedom of expression and association, and the right to take part in free and fair elections, is one of the essential features of a vigorous and healthy democracy, would be ineffective in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Petkov and Others v.

It also notes that as a result the police ordered the members of UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN\u2019s managing board and the first and second applicants to refrain from organising or taking part in the two rallies (see paragraph 12 above). Those measures clearly indicate an intention to prevent the rally. They had a chilling effect on the individuals concerned and on the other participants in the rallies, and thus amounted in themselves to interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of assembly (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, \u00a7 79; United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, \u00a7 101; and B\u0105czkowski and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06668, all cited above).",

Bearing in mind that the time and the place of the event were crucial to the participants, the Court finds that those actions also amounted to interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of assembly (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, \u00a7 109 in fine, and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, \u00a7\u00a0103, both cited above).",

The term \u201crestrictions\u201d in Article 11 \u00a7 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly, and those, such as punitive measures, taken after that (see Ezelin v. , 26 April 1991, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 202). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6668). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v. , no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 5962, ECHR 2003III). So do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as a dispersal of the rally or arrests of participants (see Oya Ataman v. , no. 74552/01, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 30, ECHR 2006XIII, and Hyde Park and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09, 13, 16, 41, 44 and 48), and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7 41; Osmani and Others v. \u201cthe \u201d (dec.), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001X; Mkrtchyan v.

First, the 1990 Meetings and Marches Act envisages no role for regional governors in the policing of rallies (see paragraph 22 above). Secondly, in banning the rally the Regional Governor relied on some clearly irrelevant grounds, such as UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN\u2019s lack of registration (see paragraph 11 above, as well as Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, \u00a7 81, and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, \u00a7 108, both cited above). Thirdly, section 55(1) of the 2006 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act, which served as a basis for the orders issued by the police, is formulated in very general terms and gives no indication of the circumstances in which the police may use the power conferred on them (see paragraphs 12 and 27 above and, mutatis mutandis, United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 109). Fourthly, no legal basis has been cited for the police block of the road to the Rozhen Monastery (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Djavit An, cited above, \u00a7 66). However, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d or pursued a legitimate aim, as it finds, for the reasons set out in the following paragraph, that, even if it did, it cannot be regarded as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Alekseyev, cited above, \u00a7 69).",
