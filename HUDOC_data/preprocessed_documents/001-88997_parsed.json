The Attorney-General (1969) 1 C.L.R. 355). It is a right to be evaluated in the context of Article 146 and the system of review of administrative action created thereby. It is ancillary to judicial review, as a measure necessary for its effectiveness. Primarily it entitles the injured party to recover damage not remediable by proper administrative action. If the proper administrative action is not taken, the remedy is to go to the administrative court again. If notwithstanding this step the injured party is left to shoulder damages, then he has a right to recover them from the Republic. The right to damages under Article 146 is distinctly independent from any other cause of action, as the Supreme Court held in Attorney-General v. Andreas Marcoulides and another (1966) 1 C.L.R. 242. Not only its juridical basis but also the manner of quantifying damages is different from a common law action. The Supreme Court emphasised the equitable character of the relief as well as the damages recoverable, stressing that they are not strictly compensatory. Consequently, it is legitimate for the Court to have regard, not only to the extent of the material damage suffered, but also to the conduct of the parties and the degree to which the successful party contributed to the production of the wrongful administrative act. In the case of Marcoulides, supra, the Supreme Court derived guidance, inter alia, from French case law, establishing that the conduct of the parties and their blameworthiness, if any, is of crucial importance to the determination of the quantum of the damages.\u201d",

The Supreme Court did not explicitly depart from or overrule the finding made by the District Court as to the damage that had been sustained by the applicants. Having examined its previous case-law on the question which, in its view, had left this issue open, it observed that the moral damage sustained by the applicants did not emanate from the annulled decision and that, as such, the claimed award was not covered by the domestic law provision under which the applicants' claim had been introduced.

The effective protection of such interests requires an established framework in the domestic legal system that enables a proportionality assessment of instances in which an individual's corresponding rights are restricted. While the Court's role is not to interpret the Constitutional provision under which the applicants sought compensation for the injury to their integrity and reputation, the Court finds that the Supreme Court failed to provide an adequate explanation for the reversal of the award of moral damages. The Court considers that the absence of a comprehensive assessment as regards a matter affecting the applicants' rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention was not consonant with an acceptable margin of appreciation.",
