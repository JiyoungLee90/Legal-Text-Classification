By virtue of Article 242 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure it examined ex officio whether the proceedings were not vitiated by the procedural flaws set out in Article\u00a0237 of that Code. It found no such flaws and observed that the appeal was neither admissible on any of the admissibility grounds pursuant to Article 238 of the Code. The Supreme Court thus did not examine the merits of the case. The decision was served on the defendant on 9\u00a0February and on the applicant\u2019s lawyer on 10\u00a0February 1999.",

Finally, under paragraph\u00a03\u00a0(b), an appeal on points of law is also admissible against a second judgment of an appellate court in which it upholds a second judgment of a first instance court if, in the second round, the first instance court decided differently than in its first judgment (which had been quashed by the first decision of the court of appeal) because it was bound by the legal view expressed by the court of appeal in its first judgment.

The Court observes that the Code of the Civil Procedure, in its Part Four, Head Three, provides for such a remedy. The applicant filed it in context of an undoubtedly serious and genuine dispute over her dismissal from work. On this appeal, the Supreme Court examined, by virtue of Article\u00a0242 (1) of the Code of the Civil Procedure and ex officio whether the proceedings were not vitiated by the procedural flaws set out in Article\u00a0237 of that Code. Having also examined the arguments put forward by the applicant, it concluded that the appeal was not admissible on any of the remaining admissibility grounds. However, had the Supreme Court found the appeal admissible, it would have examined the case on its merits. The outcome of such an examination might unquestionably have had a direct effect on the right claimed by the applicant. The fact that the Supreme Court ultimately found that the statutory requirements for its dealing with the merits of the case were not met does not prevent the Court from examining also the length of the proceedings before the court of cassation.
