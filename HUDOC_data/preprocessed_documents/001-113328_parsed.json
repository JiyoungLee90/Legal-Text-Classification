Further, I would like to clarify that under Article 500 of the CCP, the Minister of Justice could not suspend the execution of the extradition decision of Almir Rrapo as a result of the  order, because that provision does not contain such a clause, and, therefore, it does not provide the regulation of relevant consequences.",

Consequently, as long as there is no legal provision which expressly stipulates the possibility of keeping in force this measure in such a case, the legal interpretation would have favoured the position of ... Almir Rrapo. Thus, the latter should [have] be[en] released in this case. The scope of the Albanian party was to avoid the release of ... Almir Rrapo due to his high social risk, [the] serious charges brought against him and the evident opportunity to get away to an unknown direction. In this context, we add that on 27 October 2010 the American party had requested the Albanian party to undertake every legal measure to ensure that the citizen Almir Rrapo would not get away. In case of his leaving, the provisions of the Extradition Treaty would be violated. Hence, the Albanian state would not comply with the bilateral international obligations due to failure of good administration of justice.\u201d",

Consequently, in so far as the law did not stipulate the continuation of a defendant\u2019s arrest, the legal interpretation was to be in favour of the defendant, which would result in his subsequent release.

In this respect the Court refers to its case-law as summarised in the Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi judgment to the effect that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are \u201cpractical and effective\u201d and that a respondent State is considered to retain Convention liability in respect of treaty commitment prior to or subsequent to the entry into force of the Convention (see, for example, paragraph 69 above). Moreover, in the Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi judgment the Court further held that \u201cit is not open to a  to enter into an agreement with another State which conflicts with its obligations under the Convention. This principle carries all the more force ... given the absolute and fundamental nature of the right not to be subjected to the death penalty and the grave and irreversible harm\u201d risked by the applicant (see\u00a0paragraph 138 of the said judgment).

In the first place, there was no legal basis for the applicant\u2019s extradition after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 26 November 2010. Furthermore, the Court notes that although the time-limit for the applicant\u2019s extradition was extended to 1\u00a0December 2010 (see paragraph 23 above), he was physically removed on 24\u00a0November 2010, that is just two days prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Secondly, neither the existing state of national law expounded by the Government, notably the alleged legal vacuum concerning the continuation of detention beyond the time-limit provided for in Article 499 of the CCP, nor deficiencies in the national judicial system and the difficulties encountered by the authorities in seeking to achieve their legislative and regulatory objectives, can be relied upon to the applicant\u2019s detriment, in the absence of a final domestic court judgment authorising his extradition, or avoid or negate the respondent State\u2019s obligations under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no.\u00a030696/09, \u00a7 321, ECHR 2011; Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey, no.\u00a030471/08, \u00a7\u00a7 113-117, 22 September 2009; \u010conka v.

Thirdly, there is no indication that the authorities considered the possibility of taking any steps to remove the risk of the applicant\u2019s flight in the event of his release, by, for example, the imposition of other coercive forms of security measures provided for under the CCP (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above).

It is only in very exceptional cases that an applicant will be able to demonstrate that the sentence he or she would face in a non-Contracting State would be grossly disproportionate and thus contrary to Article 3 at the moment of its imposition (see Harkins and Edwards v. the United Kingdom, nos. 9146/07 and 32650/07, \u00a7 134, 17\u00a0January 2012). In the absence of any such gross disproportionality, an Article 3 issue will arise for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the same way as for a discretionary life sentence, when it can be shown: (i) that the applicant\u2019s continued imprisonment can no longer be justified on any legitimate penological grounds; and (ii) that the sentence is irreducible de facto and de iure (see Harkins and Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 138; and, Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 98, ECHR 2008).",

At the time of the submission of this complaint, the applicant had not yet been convicted, still less begun to serve his sentence. Had the applicant been sentenced, the Court does not find that the likely sentence to be imposed would have been grossly disproportionate, having regard to the counts with which he was charged and the plea bargain he has voluntarily and knowingly made. Moreover, the applicant did not show that, upon extradition, his incarceration in the United States would not serve any legitimate penological purpose. Indeed, if he had been given a mandatory life sentence, it may well have been that the point at which his continued incarceration would no longer serve any purpose would never have arisen. Lastly, the Court notes that the applicant was, in fact, sentenced by the United States court to 80 months\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 44 above) The Court therefore considers that this complaint is manifestly illfounded and should be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that the Extradition Treaty allows for a two-month custodial detention pending receipt of the official request for extradition from the requesting State. The period that elapsed between the date of the applicant\u2019s arrest and the date of the United States request for extradition (2 July and 30 August 2010), amounts to less than two months. The Court has no grounds upon which to conclude that the applicant\u2019s detention, prior to receipt of the United States official request for his extradition, was \u201cunlawful\u201d merely because of the lack of an official request for extradition (see Khodzhayev v. , no. 52466/08, \u00a7 137, 12 May 2010).",

The extension of his detention was based on judicial decisions. Furthermore, the length of the overall detention, that is four months and twenty-two days, was not excessively long and was justified by the conduct of the extradition proceedings. Moreover, the Court does not consider that the domestic courts lacked any due diligence in examining the applicant\u2019s case (see Quinn v. , 22 March 1995, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 311).",
