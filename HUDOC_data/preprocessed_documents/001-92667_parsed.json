Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that since a prosecutor or comparable officer, in undertaking the status of a procedural plaintiff, becomes in effect the ally or opponent of one of the parties, his participation was capable of creating a feeling of inequality in respect of one of the parties (see Kress, cited above, \u00a7 81, and F.W. v. France, no.\u00a061517/00, \u00a7\u00a027, 31 March 2005). In this context, the Court reiterates that while the independence and impartiality of the prosecutor or similar officer were not open to criticism, the public's increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice justified the growing importance attached to appearances (see Borgers v. Belgium, 30\u00a0October 1991, \u00a7\u00a024, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0214B).",

Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision (see, among other authorities, S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a075529/01, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2006...). In order to determine whether the acts of the prosecutor's office in the present case were compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court has had regard to relevant Council of Europe documents (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above).",

The Court does not exclude that support by the prosecutor's office of one of the parties may be justified in certain circumstances, for instance for the protection of vulnerable persons who are assumed to be unable to protect their interests themselves, or where numerous citizens are affected by the wrongdoing concerned, or where identifiable State assets or interests need to be protected. The Court notes in that connection that the applicant's opponent in the proceedings in question was a State-owned organisation (compare Yavorivskaya v. Russia, no. 34687/02, \u00a7 25, 21 July 2005). There was also a private person who had a vested interest in the outcome of the proceedings. Although both the Oceanology Institute and Mr\u00a0M were represented in the proceedings, the Court considers that the public prosecutor acted in the public interest when he brought proceedings against the applicant and her husband (compare Menchinskaya v. Russia, no.\u00a042454/02, \u00a7\u00a7 37-40, 15\u00a0January 2009). The applicant and her husband were also represented by counsel and made both written and oral submissions to the first-instance court. It was not shown that the prosecutor's decision to initiate civil proceedings had no legal basis under Russian law, or that this decision fell outside the scope of his discretion to bring proceedings on account of the particular circumstances of the case (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). In the circumstances of the case there is no reason to believe that the institution of the civil proceedings by the public prosecutor was meant or had the effect of unduly influencing the civil court or preventing the applicant from bringing an effective defence (see, mutatis mutandis, Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005II). Thus, in the Court's opinion, the principle of the equality of arms, requiring a fair balance between the parties, was respected in the present case.",

None of those exceptional circumstances is present here. I cannot agree with the majority that the participation of the prosecutor was necessary to protect State property. The flat in question, although it belonged to the State, was under the management of the Oceanology Institute. It was the Institute's responsibility to protect that property against trespass and to participate in any related litigation. Indeed, the Institute participated in the proceedings through its representative. Nothing in the case file shows that it encountered any difficulties in bringing or pursuing proceedings and therefore there was no risk that the state interests would be left unprotected. I am unable to distinguish any well-founded, recognisable aim or public interest for the prosecutor's interference in this otherwise ordinary civil dispute.
