The SAC found that, to be fair and justified, the minimum lawyer\u2019s fees had to be based on two objective criteria: (i) the volume and the complexity of the work performed by the lawyer, and (ii) the value of the protected interest involved in the case (\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441). An increase in the minimum lawyer\u2019s fees as a result of an increase in the minimum wage in the country failed to consider the first criterion and therefore contravened section 36 of the Bar Act. In the SAC\u2019s view, the right of the self-governing Bar Association to itself determine the minimum fees for lawyers\u2019 work had to be balanced against the public interest. Hence, on the one hand, the highly responsible work of lawyers was not to be underestimated and made dependent on market mechanisms; on the other hand, its value must not be set at an unjustifiably high level such as to impede citizens\u2019 and legal entities\u2019 access to qualified legal assistance or to be an instrument enabling one party or the other to exert economic pressure in the proceedings. According to the SAC, that would negatively affect the rule of law (\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 9273 \u043e\u0442 27.07.2016 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434.\u00a0\u2116 3002/2015 \u0433.).",

Accordingly, such fees could not be regarded as fair and justified as required by section 36(2) of the Bar Act. The courts were therefore called upon to assess the two above-mentioned criteria in each case so as not to allow unjust enrichment of the parties by awarding costs which were not fair and justified (see \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 2800 \u043e\u0442 26.02.2019\u00a0\u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a05907/2018 \u0433., \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 2804 \u043e\u0442 26.02.2019 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a03781/2018 \u0433., \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 4408 \u043e\u0442 14.04.2020 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a07914/2019 \u0433., \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 5728 \u043e\u0442 16.04.2019 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a0789/2018 \u0433., \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 3513 \u043e\u0442 9.03.2020 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116\u00a07400/2019 \u0433.; \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 5263 \u043e\u0442 30.04.2020 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u211615010/2018 \u0433.).",

The Court notes that the applicant association participated in the domestic proceedings and that its legal personality has never previously been disputed. Nor its entry in the register of non-profit legal persons acting for the public benefit has any relation to its existence as a legal entity. Based on the documents in the case file it is evident that it continues to exist as a legal person and to take part in various environment-related proceedings. The Government did not provide any evidence that the applicant association had been wound up or been the subject of winding-up proceedings. There is no indication that the applicant association does no longer exist as a legal entity.

In particular, the national legislation did not provide for sufficient flexibility with regard to the allocation of costs, since the courts could not carry out an individual assessment depending on the particular circumstances and the conduct of the parties.

Even if the courts allowed an objection under Article\u00a078\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 43 above), their assessment was subjective as there were no criteria on which to evaluate whether the lawyer\u2019s fees were excessive.

They further argued that in the event of inadmissible or unfounded claims the award of costs pursued the legitimate aims, on the one hand, of discharging the winning party of the incurred costs and, on the other hand, of imposing discipline on individuals and legal entities on pain of bearing the costs, so that the judicial system was not overloaded with obviously inadmissible or unfounded claims.",

The costs award was also limited to the fees for one lawyer. In the Government\u2019s opinion, by allowing the applicant association\u2019s objection and reducing the amount of the costs, the SAC had made a fair and proportionate costs award which had corresponded to the legal assistance provided to the KNPP and had compensated the nuclear power plant for the costs it had actually incurred.

Under this principle the unsuccessful party in the proceedings has to pay the successful party\u2019s costs. This rule is counterbalanced by two safeguards laid down in the Bulgarian legislation. On the one hand, Article 78 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure entitles the losing party to object to the amount of the lawyer\u2019s fees on the grounds that they were excessive. The competent court then has to assess the amount in the light of the actual legal and factual complexity of the case. If it allows the objection, the court may reduce the costs award, but cannot order an amount lower than the minimum amount provided for in the Regulation (see paragraph 43 above).",

In determining these amounts, the seven-judge panel of the SAC took into account the following factors: (i) the objection raised by the applicant association\u2019s lawyer under Article\u00a078\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the allegedly excessive amount of the lawyer\u2019s fees, and (ii) the legal and factual complexity of the case (see paragraph 25 above).",

In this regard, the Court notes that the statutory minimum remuneration at the material time for legal assistance in proceedings for reopening, including attendance at a court hearing, was fixed at BGN 500 (approximately EUR\u00a0250; see paragraph 52 above). The Court cannot disregard the fact that the costs order in favour of the KNPP was twenty-four times above the minimum remuneration set out in the Regulation. While it seems that the main proceedings did involve more complex legal and factual issues, the SAC did not provide any detailed explanation for its assessment of the complexity of the proceedings for reopening. In this context the Court observes that the proceedings were initiated by the applicant association on the ground that its right to participation in the cassation proceedings had allegedly been breached (see paragraphs 21-22 above). This legal issue was of a procedural nature, does not appear to be particularly complex and had to some extent already been dealt with by the SAC in the main proceedings (see paragraph\u00a019 above). The court also provided no reference to any method of calculation of the lawyers\u2019 fees and consequently of their reasonableness in the specific case. The proceedings did not involve the collection of new evidence and the SAC held only one hearing (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, in the two ensuing requests for reopening lodged by another non-governmental organisation, the CSD, the SAC awarded much lower sums in lawyer\u2019s fees to the KNPP, namely BGN\u00a05,000 (approximately EUR 2,500) and BGN\u00a02,000 (approximately EUR 1,000; see paragraphs 27-28 above).",

Indeed, as already noted, Bulgarian legislation provides for a mechanism allowing a degree of review of the proportionality of the litigation costs (see paragraphs 78-79 above). However, in the present case the SAC applied those rules without giving sufficient consideration to the specific circumstances of the applicant association\u2019s case, especially the fact that the amount of the costs award had been substantial and that in the light of the complexity of the reopening proceedings and the volume of the legal work carried out, the costs order for one level of jurisdiction did not appear reasonable (compare with Hoare, decision cited above, \u00a7 60). Thus, by awarding such an amount in costs for the lawyer\u2019s fees of the opposing party, without providing sufficient and relevant reasons so as to ensure that those fees were actually fair and justified as required by domestic law, the SAC failed to properly balance the various interests at stake. Consequently, the applicant association suffered an individual and excessive burden which upset the requisite fair balance between the general interest of society and the individual\u2019s fundamental rights.",
