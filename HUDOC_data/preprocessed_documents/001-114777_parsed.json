Relying on medical reports, the applicant submitted that his illness was incurable and progressed rapidly. The facility where he was detained did not have means, medical specialists or medicines to provide him with the medical care he needed, which could have reduced the severity of his symptoms. Citing various internal regulations of the Russian Health Ministry and Ministry of Justice, the applicant further argued that the domestic law listed his illness among those which relieved a convict from serving a sentence of imprisonment. At the same time, the conditions of detention in remand facilities were far worse than those in correctional colonies. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, it was only logical to relieve him from being detained in worse conditions in a remand facility, taking into account the state of his health.

As to the first argument, the Government stressed that the applicant had not complained to a court that he was not receiving adequate medical assistance. The procedure for making claims before a court was established in Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as clarified by the Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling no. 2 of 10 February 2009. Having relied on two cases examined by the Russian courts and the Court\u2019s findings in the case of Popov and Vorobyev v. Russia (no. 1606/02, 23 April 2009), they submitted that it had also been open to the applicant to lodge a tort action claiming compensation for damage caused by allegedly inadequate medical assistance. Relying on Resolution no.\u00a0CM/ResDH(2010)35 adopted at the 1078th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the Government further noted that statistics and a number of cases presented to the Committee had demonstrated the developing practice of the Russian courts in awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unsatisfactory conditions of detention. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s failure to apply to a Russian court with a complaint had to be interpreted by the Court as his unwillingness to comply with the admissibility requirements set out by Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention. The Government stressed that his complaint under Article 3 should therefore be dismissed for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and the complaint under Article 13 was obviously manifestly ill-founded.",

The facilities were equipped with medicines and medical equipment according to established norms.

He further stressed that he was unable to obtain the medical assistance he needed while in detention. He relied on various documents issued by detention authorities, which confirmed that it was impossible to provide him with adequate medical care. The applicant stated that if it was not for the care of his relatives who had managed to provide him with a number of the medicines prescribed by prison medical staff, his condition could have been far worse. He argued that despite the continuing and rapid deterioration of his health the Russian authorities had refused to admit him to a prison hospital or to release him from detention. While prison medical staff tried to monitor his condition they were not equipped to do so, as they were not trained in the relevant medical field and did not have sufficient knowledge to treat rheumatology patients. He was only seen by a specialist, a rheumatologist, twice during the entire period of his detention, in August 2009 and June 2010, and even when such a visit took place, the recommendations of the specialist were not complied with, as the detention facility did not have necessary resources. The lack of medical assistance, including the absence of prescribed therapeutic exercise and physical therapy, subjected him to extreme suffering. At a certain point during his detention he was unable to get up or walk unaided and was carried around, including to court hearings, on a stretcher. The applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention to the Government\u2019s statement that in June 2010 he had been released from the hospital in a satisfactory condition. At the same time, the Government did not dispute that merely two weeks later, in the end of June 2010, given his condition the applicant had been transported to the court-house on a stretcher and that the examination of his case had been stayed in view of the poor state of his health. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, the Government\u2019s argument of the proper quality of medical care was rebutted by the fact that his illness had progressed rapidly, with his disability moving from Category 3 to Category 2 in less than a year.",

The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. The Court reiterates that, in the absence of a specific procedure, the ability to appeal to various authorities cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because such appeals aim to urge the authorities to utilise their discretion and do not give the complainant a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Dimitrov v. , no. 47829/99, \u00a7 80, 23 September 2004).

The ombudsman\u2019s task is different: he identifies various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at his disposal, highlights problems in his annual reports, and works out solutions in cooperation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 50-52 above). While his activities may usefully contribute to a general improvement in the level of medical care afforded to detainees, the ombudsman remains unable, in view of his specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention.

However, in its assessment of the effectiveness of tort proceedings for cases of inadequate medical care of detainees, the Court considers the following considerations to be more important. To prove the existence of the selection and successful use of mechanisms of redress, the Government cited two cases in which claimants, former inmates, had been granted compensation for damage to health resulting from inadequate medical care in detention. Without embarking on an analysis of the relevance of the cases to the case at hand and deciding whether the two cases sufficiently demonstrate the existence of a developed, consistent and coherent practice of remedies being available for victims of Article 3 violations resulting from a lack of medical assistance or its poor quality, the Court reiterates that to be adequate, remedies for the implementation of accountability of a State should correspond to the kind and nature of the complaints addressed to it. Given the continuous nature of the violation alleged by the applicant, in particular his complaint that he was suffering from an extremely serious medical condition and that his health was continuing to deteriorate in the absence of appropriate medical treatment, the Court considers that an adequate remedy in such a situation should imply a properly functioning mechanism of monitoring the conduct of national authorities with a view to putting an end to the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights and preventing the recurrence of such a violation in the future. Therefore, a purely compensatory remedial avenue would not suffice to satisfy the requirements of effectiveness and adequacy in a case of an alleged continuous violation of a Conventional right and should be replaced by another judicial mechanism performing both the preventive and compensatory functions.",

Being convinced that a preventive remedial measure would have had an evidently pivotal role in a case such as the applicant\u2019s, with his pleas of ongoing deterioration of his health in view of a lack of proper medical care, the Court finds that a tort claim was not able to provide the applicant with relief appropriate for his situation. The purely monetary compensation afforded by a tort action could not extinguish the consequences created by the alleged continuous situation of inadequate or insufficient medical services. A tort claim would not have entailed the ending or modification of the situation or conditions in which the applicant found himself. It would not have brought about an order to put an end to the alleged violation and to compel the detention authorities to offer the applicant the requisite level of medical care, and it would not have provided for any sanction for failure to comply, thus depriving a court examining the tort claim of the opportunity to take practical steps to eliminate the applicant\u2019s further suffering or to deter wrongful behaviour on the part of the authorities. This logic has been applied in a large number of cases raising an arguable claim under Article 3, with the Court insisting that if the authorities could confine their reaction in such cases to the mere payment of compensation, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice. The State cannot escape its responsibility by purporting to erase a wrong by a mere grant of compensation in such cases (see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Krastanov v.

The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the cases relating to conditions of detention or medical assistance that have previously come before it. The absence of established judicial practice in this regard appears all the more clear in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law\u00a0no.\u00a048661 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which have Impaired Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms (\u201cthe Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms (Judicial Complaints) Act 1993\u201d).

The Government also did not explain how, in the light of the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court which concerned complaints about conditions of detention, the Chapter 25 procedure would work in respect of complaints of ineffective medical care for detainees, given the specificity of those complaints.",

The evidence shows that until his release on bail in December 2010 the applicant was either left without any medical attention for months (see paragraph 35 above) or was attended by a prison nurse or medical assistant or, occasionally, by a prison doctor (see paragraph 33 above). The inadequacy of their response to the applicant\u2019s health complaints is demonstrated by the fact that they prescribed another painkiller or a herbal sedative without carrying out a comprehensive examination of his current condition. Even on the rare occasions when the applicant was seen by a proper medical specialist or obtained treatment in a prison hospital, the recommendations of the specialists or the hospital could not have been followed through, as the detention facilities did not have the necessary resources to provide the prescribed treatment, and did not employ a rheumatologist to continue monitoring the applicant\u2019s state (see paragraph 36 above). In fact, it appears that the applicant\u2019s relatives played a major part in ensuring that he received medicines, at least those which they were able to purchase.",

Each time, having found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the Court noted the fragility of the reasoning employed by the Russian courts to authorise an applicant\u2019s remaining in custody. From case to case it pointed out the following major defects in the courts\u2019 argumentation: reliance on the gravity of the charges as the primary source to justify the risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding; reference to the applicant\u2019s travel passport, his financial resources and the fact that his alleged accomplices are on the run as the basis for the assumption that the applicant would follow suit; a suspicion, in the absence of any evidentiary basis, that the applicant would tamper with witnesses or use his connections in state bodies to obstruct justice, and a failure to thoroughly examine the possibility of applying another, less rigid, measure of restraint, such as bail.",

They consistently relied on the gravity of the charges and the likelihood that the applicant would abscond or obstruct justice, having based their fear on the same set of assumptions as in the cases cited above. The Court notes that, while accepting the investigators\u2019 allegations that the applicant was likely to avoid or pervert the course of justice, the courts gave no heed to important and relevant facts supporting the applicant\u2019s pleas for liberty and reducing the risk that he would abscond or collude. Among those the Court can identify the applicant\u2019s serious state of health; his argument that he had never changed his place of residence, that he had not attempted to escape, and that the authorities\u2019 decision to place him on a wanted list was erroneous; his strong family ties; lack of a previous criminal record; his offer to post bail, and lack of any evidence that he had ever tried to contact the victims or witnesses in the course of the criminal proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the domestic courts failed to assess the applicant\u2019s personal situation and to give specific reasons, supported by evidentiary findings, for holding him in custody. It also does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that a similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of the  on 7 December 2010 (see paragraph 21 above). In particular, the Supreme Court held that the court detention orders, as well as the investigator\u2019s requests for the extension of the detention on which those orders were based, did not contain any reference to evidence or circumstances which could have warranted the applicant\u2019s detention.",
