If there had been unreasonable delay attributable to the State, in the absence of any possible damage to the defendant beyond the very limited uncertainty that we have mentioned we are quite satisfied that this could not possibly have been a case in which the appropriate remedy would have been a stay of the confiscation process for abuse of process. There would simply have been nothing remotely unfair about the defendant eventually having to disgorge the confiscation which was the consequence of his offending. The appropriate remedy would, hypothetically, as it seems to us, have been a declaration. But that does not in the end arise.

In giving due weight to the various aspects of a fair trial guaranteed by Article\u00a06, difficult decisions have to be made by the domestic courts in cases where these aspects appear to be in conflict.

Thus in assessing whether the length of proceedings was reasonable, particularly in a case where an applicant relies upon the court\u2019s responsibility to take steps to advance the proceedings, this Court must have regard to the reasons for the delay and the extent to which delay resulted from an effort to secure other key rights guaranteed by Article 6 (see Beggs v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a025133/06, \u00a7\u00a0240, 6\u00a0November 2012).",

Legal aid remained with the applicant\u2019s solicitors, who would have been aware of the initial deadline of six weeks to file a response. It was at the instigation of the prosecution that the matter returned to court in October 2001 (see paragraph 12 above). The Court rejects the applicant\u2019s assertion that delay was incurred at this stage, or during later stages, as a result of being detained in prisons located far from his legal representation. The applicant has failed to provide specific examples or evidence to support his assertion and therefore no blame or criticism can be made of the State authorities in this regard. The applicant\u2019s failure to respond to the confiscation application within this timescale and failure to make any contact with the court caused a delay that was entirely of his making.",

The Court notes that the trial judge was astute in ensuring that the matter properly returned to court at regular intervals in order to monitor progress and avoid unnecessary delay. It is unfortunate that no progress was made during this time and that interlocutory hearings were required in relation to abuse of process, wasted costs and disclosure of information from the receiver.

On 16 December 2002 the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in a similar case, R v Knights and Others (see paragraph 22 above). As a result of Knights and Others proceeding to the House of Lords, the applicant was notified on 24 March 2003 that his appeal would be held in abeyance pending judgment from the House of Lords, which was not delivered until 21 July 2005 (see paragraph\u00a023-27 above). As a result of the applicant\u2019s jurisdictional appeal being stayed, and its direct impact upon his pending confiscation proceedings, a lapse of three years occurred between the lodging of the jurisdictional appeal and its conclusion. The judgment in Knights and Others held consequences, in terms of delay, for a number of other appeals that were stayed pending its determination. No fault as such can be laid at the door of the national judicial authorities. Indeed, when examining the adjournment of the confiscation proceedings pending that judgment \u2013 which had been requested by the applicant himself \u2013 the Court of Appeal commented that it was in his interests to await the House of Lords ruling. Nonetheless, the objective consequence for the applicant was that, by reason of the working of the British system of administration of justice, and through no fault of his own, the pace of the confiscation proceedings brought against him was slowed for a not insignificant period. This being so, responsibility for the resultant delay must be considered attributable to the respondent State. Since, even in the best of circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect an appeal court to deliver judgment immediately after the lodging of an appeal, the Court assesses the delay which accrued at this point at approximately two years.",

However, the Court finds otherwise for the following reasons. First, the cumulative effect of the identified periods of delay attributable to the State totalling approximately three years is not insignificant. Secondly, when considering the longest period of delay, namely the approximately two years caused by the awaited House of Lords judgment in Knights and Others, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was in the applicant\u2019s interest to await the outcome. The Court of Appeal, in finding no unreasonable delay, can be understood as having placed some reliance on the fact that the possible damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the extraordinary length of the proceedings was only a \u201cvery limited uncertainty\u201d \u2013 namely whether he and his wife would lose their family home (his main asset), whereas his assets remained the same throughout the whole period concerned and he had continued to enjoy his home which might otherwise have been taken from him. The Court of Appeal went on to conclude that since the applicant had himself \u201cdeployed every possible legal stratagem to delay the confiscation process\u201d, \u201che [could] not now be heard to say that as a result of having succeeded in delaying it, it ha[d] become unfair for the confiscation order to proceed\u201d (see paragraph 42 above). For this Court, these considerations, invoked by the Court of Appeal, while not immaterial for the case, in that they go to the assessment of any just satisfaction to be accorded, do not preclude a finding of unreasonable length of proceedings on account of the periods of delay nonetheless attributable to the respondent State.",
