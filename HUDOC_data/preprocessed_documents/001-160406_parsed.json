The Government adduced no evidence in support of their submission that considerable improvements in Prison no. 13 had taken place during recent years. In such circumstances, the Court considers that there are no reasons to depart from the conclusions reached in its previous judgments (see among recent authorities Hadji v.\u00a0Moldova, nos. 32844/07 and 41378/07, \u00a7 20, 14\u00a0February 2012; Silvestru v.\u00a0the Republic of Moldova, no. 28173/10, 13 January 2015; Pisaroglu v.\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Moldova, no. 21061/11, 3 March 2015). The Court thus considers that the hardship endured by the applicant during his detention in Prison no. 13 went beyond the unavoidable level of hardship inherent in detention and reached the threshold of severity required by Article 3 of the Convention. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",

However, he did not substantiate this complaint and the Court notes that on 14 June 2011 the applicant was convicted on the same charges on which he had been kept in detention on remand. Moreover, the Court notes that one of the main reasons relied upon by the domestic courts to place the applicant in detention on remand was the fact that he had been in hiding in another country for eight years. In such circumstances the Court considers this complaint to be manifestly ill-founded. Accordingly, it must be declared inadmissible under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

The Court recalls that pre-trial detention starts when the person is taken into custody and ends when the detainee is either released or convicted, even if only by a court of first instance (see, among other authorities Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2002VI and Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 27561/02, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 16 January 2007). Since the applicant was convicted on 14 June 2011 and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment, his detention after that date was no longer to be considered detention on remand but fell under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention as detention \u201cafter conviction\u201d.
