According to the Government, the applicant had been disciplined twenty-six times for breaching the internal rules, and had only received four good-conduct awards. On six occasions he was punished for keeping an unauthorised mobile telephone and/or charger and SIM cards for it in his cell; once for keeping an item which could be used to make a hand-knife; and another time for keeping a small foldable hand-knife. On two occasions the punishments were for violent altercations with other life prisoners. One of those occasions was described by the prison authorities as \u201cnot having escalated to the level of lasting tension, but rather being a momentary emotional outburst not uncommon for both the inmates involved\u201d. In the other incident, the physical engagement had been preceded by verbal arguments on the part of both prisoners, and the prison guards rapidly managed to separate the inmates and defuse the tension. When the applicant considered a situation was detrimental to him, he usually threatened legal action, and sometimes attempted self-harm or suicide as a means of \u201cpersuading\u201d the prison authorities. He was emotionally unstable and had a tendency to contest the decisions of the prison authorities. Because of all this the prison authorities were not considering a change in the applicant\u2019s prison regime.",

He referred to the recommendation of the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers REC/2003/33, which stipulated that risk assessments should be accompanied by other means for deciding on changes in the regime of life prisoners in order to minimise the potential for error, and that assessments of life prisoners should be done at a regular interval, given that the degree of danger and the penological considerations change frequently. Consequently, the applicant claimed, the personality assessments carried out by the prison administration in his respect were neither sufficiently frequent or regular, nor did they assess important aspects of his life as an inmate, such as his psychological and physical state, motivation to reform, level of re-socialisation, and participation in communal activities with other inmates.",

The applicant further emphasised that, although a toilet and a sink had been installed in August 2012 in Varna Prison, there was no separation between them and the rest of the space. The toilet was practically unusable, given that the prison authorities had refused to provide him with cleaning and hygiene products, such as toilet paper, brushes and disinfectants. The consequent impossibility of using the toilet caused him extreme daily hardship. Each time he needed to use the toilet he had to ask prison guards to open the cell so he could go to the communal toilet situated in the corridor.",

This was the case throughout the time he was serving his life sentence in Varna Prison, namely between 1999 and 2004, and again from 2007, when he was placed in the high-security wing in Varna Prison together with the other lifers (see paragraph 30 above). This situation was only interrupted between 2004 and 2007, when the applicant was in Pleven Prison and his cell was locked only at night, so he could move around in the corridor of his wing together with other life prisoners (see paragraph 12 above, describing a situation also established by the CPT in their report on their 2006 visit to Pleven Prison).",

The submissions of the other detainees provided to the Court by the applicant (see paragraph 34 above), coupled with the findings of the CPT in its reports on its 2010 and 2012 visits to Varna Prison (see paragraph 18 above), showed that lifers remained locked in their cells and were only let out regularly for their three daily visits to the toilet, an hour\u2019s exercise, table tennis practice lasting half an hour to an hour a week, and that the occasional group activities observed in 2010 had been discontinued in 2012.
