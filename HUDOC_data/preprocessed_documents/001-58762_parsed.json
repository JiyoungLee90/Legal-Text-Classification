The Court of Justice of the European Communities has developed a restrictive interpretation of this derogation. In its judgment of 17 December 1980 in the case of Commission v. Belgium (C-149/79, ECR 3881) it decided that the derogation concerned only posts which involved direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities, and which thus presumed on the part of those occupying them the existence of a special relationship of allegiance to the State and a reciprocity of rights and duties which formed the foundation of the bond of nationality.",

France [GC], no.\u00a028541/95, ECHR 1999-VIII) the nature of the legal relation between an official and the State \u2013 whether governed by statutory conditions of service or stipulated in a contract \u2013 was not considered to have any bearing on assessment of the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention, it nevertheless provided a valuable indicator as to whether or not a post entailed the exercise of powers conferred by public law. The general framework of rules within which the applicant had carried out his duties therefore had its importance. In that connection, the applicant pointed out that he did not belong to the category of commercial attach\u00e9s and advisers created by the decree of 19 April 1950, who were the representatives abroad of the Minister for Economic Affairs, or that of the agricultural attach\u00e9s created by the decree of 3 December 1956. These two texts had public-service overtones, particularly in those clauses which laid down the duties of officials of the Economic Development Department, who were posted to embassies or consulates and were responsible, among other matters, for assisting with the preparation and negotiation of international commercial treaties. However, especially in departments working overseas, the administrative authorities, at least up to the level of officials working in a specific sector (who were therefore technical specialists), sometimes called upon the services of officials working under individual contracts, some established and others not, and even of foreign nationals recruited on the spot whose remuneration and social security arrangements were governed by local law. The applicant belonged to that category, since he was subject to the general terms and conditions of service of officials working overseas under individual contracts, as laid down by the decree of 18 June 1969, which did not give any definition of the precise duties of such officials. Although officials under individual contracts were obviously bound by the constraints of public service too, they did not exercise any powers conferred by public law, their employment could be terminated at any time and there was between them and the administrative authority which employed them no special bond of trust and loyalty. With more particular regard to economic development offices overseas, the applicant submitted that their main role was to inform and advise importers and exporters of French products. The officials concerned did not participate in the performance of diplomatic duties and did not exercise any portion of the State's sovereign power.",

The agricultural attach\u00e9 was responsible to the chief commercial adviser at the Washington office, who was answerable to the ambassador, who took his instructions from the government in Paris. The applicant had no financial responsibilities, did not participate in negotiations concerning commercial treaties and did not represent the Minister for Economic Affairs at trade fairs. For the purposes of the European Commission's communication of 1988, he therefore considered himself a civil servant employed in an administrative capacity rather than a civil servant exercising authority.",

To that end, economic development staff carried out economic surveys in their respective geographical areas. They also assisted with the preparation, negotiation and execution of international treaties between France and the country where they were in post. In doing so, they sometimes had to collect and transmit, by encrypted diplomatic telegrams, confidential information intended to be used for the elaboration of French economic strategy, for example when the highest authorities of the State made visits abroad to promote French commercial interests. They thus represented the Minister for Economic Affairs. Secondly, the work of the economic development offices included informing and advising French firms conducting market research with a view to establishing a presence abroad. The information provided for that purpose was related both to the local economic context and to the administrative formalities foreign businesses were required to complete, and the fee charged for this service, in accordance with the public-service philosophy, was well below what would have been charged by a private consultancy firm. In addition, a favourable opinion from the economic development offices was a prerequisite for any business that sought to have a particular commercial risk guaranteed by COFACE (Compagnie fran\u00e7aise d'assurances pour le commerce ext\u00e9rieur \u2013 the French company for the insurance of foreign trade), a body financed by public funds. Lastly, under the applicable legal rules the staff of the economic development offices formed part of the diplomatic or consular staff, whose premises they often shared moreover, and were placed under the authority of the ambassador or consul.",

In their submission, the importance of the applicant's role was evidenced by the fact that he was classified in the highest category included in the decree used as the basis for calculation of his remuneration. They argued on that account that the applicant was one of those officials held by the Court in Pellegrin to be excluded from the scope of Article 6, because their posts typified the specific activities of the public service, which had responsibility for safeguarding the general interests of the State or of other public bodies. The same conclusion could be drawn from the European Commission's communication of 1988, which had included the diplomatic corps, described as a specific activity in the national public service excluded from freedom of movement for workers, in the category of posts involving the exercise of public authority.",
