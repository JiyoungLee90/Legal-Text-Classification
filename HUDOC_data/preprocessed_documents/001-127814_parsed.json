As the highest instance for criminal proceedings, it found that it had, in principle, the competence to take the necessary decisions in fulfillment of its obligations arising from the Federal Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. However, in order to safeguard the principle of legal certainty, it had to apply the same admissibility criteria as the European Court of Human Rights under the Convention. This meant that applying Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention per analogiam, a request for a renewal of the criminal proceedings had to be submitted within a period of six months after the conviction had become final and that the applicant had to have exhausted domestic remedies. It rejected the applicant\u2019s request because it had been introduced outside of the six-month period and, as regards the first set of proceedings, on the additional ground that the applicant had failed to raise his complaint before the domestic courts.

However, as soon as one partner reached the age of 19, such acts constituted an offence under Article 209. They became legal again when the younger partner reached the age of 18. Given that Article\u00a0209 applied not only to occasional relations but also to ongoing relationships, it led to rather absurd results \u2013 namely, a change of periods during which the homosexual relationship of two partners was first legal, then punishable and then legal again \u2013 and could therefore not be considered to be objectively justified.",

This provision prohibits sexual acts with a person under 16 years of age if, for certain reasons, that person is not mature enough to understand the meaning of the act and the offender takes advantage of that immaturity, or if the person under 16 is in a predicament and the offender takes advantage of that situation. Article 207b also penalises the inducing of persons under 18\u00a0years of age to engage in sexual activities in return for payment. Article\u00a0207b applies irrespective of whether the sexual acts at issue are heterosexual, homosexual or lesbian.

On 21\u00a0June 2002 following a request by the Innsbruck Regional Court for a constitutional review, the Constitutional Court ruled that Article 209 of the Criminal Code was unconstitutional as being arbitrary (see \"Relevant Domestic Law and Background\" above). Moreover, in a series of cases against Austria, the Court has found that Article 209 of the Criminal Code, which only punished sexual relations between male adults and male persons between the ages of 14 and 18 years, and not lesbian sexual relations, was discriminatory and in violation of Article\u00a014 taken in conjunction with Article\u00a08 of the Convention (see L. and V. v.

Moreover, that remedy could be used only in the event that the Supreme Court had not decided on the same case in the past, which was the case for some of the applicants. For this reason, the Supreme Court did not and could not decide on the merits of their requests. The other remedy they had tried, a request to have their criminal record amended, was also dismissed by the authorities because, in the view of the Constitutional Court, a decision of the Federal Minister for the Interior on a request to amend the criminal record without an underlying decision by an ordinary court was in violation of the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Lastly, they emphasised that the principal issue in the proceedings instituted by them was the maintaining of their convictions under Article\u00a0209 of the Criminal Code on their criminal record, and not the convictions themselves, which had occurred between 1982 and 2001. Thus remedies which might have been available at that time against the convictions themselves were of no relevance for the violations suffered today.",

In the event that such a request had been successful, it would have had repercussions on the entries in their criminal records. As regards the latter remedy, it should be noted that this provision was, according to the wording of Article 363a, possible only in respect of violations of the Convention found by a judgment of the Court. The Supreme Court, however, considered it its duty, under Article 46 of the Convention, to guarantee compliance with the constitutional and international obligations flowing from the Convention in the field of criminal jurisdiction by extending the scope of application of Article\u00a0343a of the CCP to cases where no judgment against Austria had been issued. In so doing, the Supreme Court found that it would be in accordance with the spirit of Article 35 of the Convention if its review of domestic decisions were limited in time, and therefore adopted the six-month time-limit stipulated in Article 35 of the Convention. Since the applicants had not applied to the Supreme Court for a renewal of the criminal proceedings within that time-limit, their requests were inadmissible.

Thus, an entry in the criminal record which corresponded to a judgment by a criminal court could not be eliminated in that way. As regards the second remedy, the Supreme Court rejected all the applicant\u2019s requests for the renewal of the criminal proceedings that had led to their convictions under Article 209 of the Criminal Code because they were introduced more than six months after the final judgment had been given in their cases, a time-limit which the Supreme Court applied per analogiam, referring to Article 35 of the Convention.
