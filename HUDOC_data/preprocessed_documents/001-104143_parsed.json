The object of the six-month time-limit is to promote legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with within a reasonable time and that past events and decisions are not continually open to challenge. It also reiterates that in cases where there is a continuing situation, the six-month period runs from the cessation of that situation (see Koval v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 65550/01, 30\u00a0March 2004).

Therefore, with respect to the Government's objection that the complaint about detention conditions in remand prison no. 52/1 between 8 July 2003 and 12 January 2005 had been submitted too late, the question to be resolved is whether the whole period of the applicant's detention constitutes a \u201ccontinuing situation\u201d, and thus meets the six-month criterion.",

In respect of the remand prison no. 52/1 the Government cited an average number of inmates per cell detained together with the applicant which implies that at times the actual number of detainees had been higher. As the Government have not produced any official record indicating the number of detainees per cell detained with the applicant, it is impossible for the Court to establish this number. Nevertheless, it is obvious that, in times when the number of inmates detained in the same cell together with the applicant reached the maximum number indicated by the Government in respect of remand prison no. 77/3 and, respectively, the average number cited for the remand prison no. 52/1, detainees were afforded less than three square metres of floor space per person (see paragraphs 17-18 and 20-21 above). Therefore, the Court finds that for the majority of the applicant's detention in remand prisons nos. 52/1 and 77/3 which lasted for approximately two years and seven months, the applicant was afforded less than three square metres of personal space and was confined to his cell day and night, save for one hour of outdoor exercise per day.",

The Court has already established that applicants complaining of a lack of medical assistance in  should raise their complaints with the competent domestic authorities, including the administration of the detention facility (see, among the most recent authorities, Popov and Vorobyev v. Russia, no.\u00a01606/02, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, 23 April 2009).
