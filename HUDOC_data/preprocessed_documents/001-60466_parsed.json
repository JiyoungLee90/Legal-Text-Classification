The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, for example, Fredin v.

The loss suffered by Heidi, Jussi and Petri Jokela would have corresponded to the difference between the inheritance tax calculated on the basis of the amounts given above, and the tax imposed would have been FIM 8,125 less in respect of each of those applicants. In addition, if the reference point to be used was the market value of FIM 7.50 per square metre, changes in the total value of the land in respect of which inheritance tax was levied could have affected the inheritance tax rate and thereby the amount of loss sustained. Moreover, a smaller inheritance tax had the effect of increasing the possible tax on capital gains. Therefore, the actual loss which each of the three applicants might have incurred as a result of the excessively high inheritance tax would have amounted to about FIM 8,000.",

In these circumstances there is, for the purposes of Article 41, also a sufficient causal link between the violation and the pecuniary damage suffered. On the other hand, the Court cannot speculate as to the exact amount of the pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards EUR 1,600 (FIM 9,513.17) to each of those three applicants.
