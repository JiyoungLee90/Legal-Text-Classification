While it is true that the applicant complained that in the period between 1999 and 2002 the opportunities for taking outdoor exercise had been notably irregular and the food supplies had been particularly meagre, it transpires from his submissions that there were only slight improvements in the situation later in his detention and his personal circumstances did not change significantly.

It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7\u00a052, ECHR 2000-III). The expression \u201clawful\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 essentially refers back to national law and lays down an obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. The Court may review whether national law has been observed for the purposes of this Convention provision; however, it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see as a recent authority Korneykova v. Ukraine, no. 39884/05, \u00a7 33, 19 January 2012). The Court further reiterates that the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary, but not always the decisive element. The Court must, in addition, be satisfied that the detention, during the period under consideration, was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary manner (see Yeloyev v. Ukraine, no. 17283/02, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 6\u00a0November 2008).",
