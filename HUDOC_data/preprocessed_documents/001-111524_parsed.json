Otherwise the press would loose its audience and would no longer be able to fulfil its protection and warning role. In fulfilling this role the press was entitled to resort to exaggeration and provocation in their reporting and this right was not restricted to textual reporting but also extended to images illustrating the articles. It was true that the applicant company had published one picture of Christian which could be considered as showing his suffering and despair while clinging to his brother, but that picture had been published only for the purpose of rousing the public from apathy. The essential question was therefore whether the importance of the events on which the applicant company was reporting justified the publication of pictures which also showed the pain and suffering of the persons concerned by the events. For the above reasons the answer must be in the affirmative.",

The applicant company was not subject to a fine imposed in criminal proceedings but was ordered to pay compensation for the injury caused to the person with whose right to respect for his strictly private life it had interfered. The amount of compensation, EUR 9,000, relates to three published articles. The amounts appear reasonable taking into account the length of the articles, their contents, which, on account of the details given and the photographs published, constituted a serious interference given the vulnerable situation of Christian as the victim of the custody dispute and the particularly wide circulation of the applicant company\u2019s media.",
