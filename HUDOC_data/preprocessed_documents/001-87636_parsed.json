In contrast to the other provisions in the Convention, it is cast in absolute terms, without exception or proviso, or the possibility of derogation under Article 15 of the Convention. As regards the types of \u201ctreatment\u201d which fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention, the Court's case-law refers to \u201cill-treatment\u201d that attains a minimum level of severity and involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, p. 66, \u00a7 167, and V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 1999-IX). Where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for, or diminishing, his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual's moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition of Article 3 (see amongst recent authorities, Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, \u00a7\u00a7 24-30, ECHR 2001-VII, and Vala\u0161inas v. , no. 44558/98, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2001-VIII). Although the public character of a sanction or treatment may be regarded as a relevant element, it is sufficient if the victim is humiliated in his or her own eyes (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 120, ECHR 1999-VI\u00a0).",

Their arguments, relying on a practice in four schools and the risk that they would be stigmatised, remained of a general nature and in the realm of speculation. The placement of the individual applicants in Roma-only classes for a certain period during their education in elementary schools does not reveal any sign of an intent to humiliate or debase them or any lack of respect for their human dignity. The Court notes also that the second to tenth applicants attended both Roma-only and mixed classes, while in respect of the remaining five applicants, who attended Roma-only classes all the time, no evidence was presented showing that it had such an adverse effect on them as to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. Furthermore, the Court notes that most of the applicants attended extra-curricular activities in a mixed group organised by the schools. The fact that such activities were available to all pupils showed that the schools made an effort to provide an opportunity for Roma and non-Roma pupils to socialise outside the classroom. Therefore, having examined the relevant facts presented before it, the Court considers that it has not been established that the applicants were submitted to ill-treatment attaining the necessary level of severity to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention.",

None of the authorities' decisions mentioned the applicants' Roma origin or had, at the time of the applicants' placement in Roma-only classes, been opposed by the applicants' parents. Placements of that type were in all cases preceded by a psychological examination by an expert team aimed at establishing the level of each child's command of the Croatian language and level of personal development. Furthermore, most classes in all three schools in question had been mixed. The curriculum for the Roma-only classes had been identical to the one in regular classes. Most of the applicants had attended a Roma-only class for a limited period of time.",

By binding themselves not to deny the right to education the Contracting States guarantee to anyone within their jurisdiction a right of access to educational institutions existing at a given time and the possibility of drawing, by official recognition of the studies which he or she has completed, profit from the education received. The setting and planning of the curriculum fall in principle within the competence of the Contracting States. This mainly involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule and whose solution may legitimately vary according to the country and the era (see Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark, judgment of 7\u00a0December 1976, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a023, p.\u00a026, \u00a7\u00a051). The education of children is the whole process whereby, in any society, adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs, culture and other values to the young, whereas teaching or instruction refers in particular to the transmission of knowledge and to intellectual development (see Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1982, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a048, pp.\u00a014 and 15, \u00a7\u00a033).",

However, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article (see \u201cCase relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d v.

First and foremost, as to the nature of the impugned practice, while the Court found that in the Czech Republic Roma children were placed in schools for the mentally challenged, as being of lower intellectual capacity, in Croatia Roma children found to lack sufficient or even basic knowledge of the Croatian language are placed in separate classes upon their enrolment in regular elementary school. It is obvious that these two measures differ significantly in their nature and severity. In the Court's view placing a disproportionate percentage of children belonging to a specific ethnic minority in schools for the mentally retarded bears no comparison with placing Roma children in separate classes on the ground that they lack adequate knowledge of the Croatian language. The Croatian authorities, by keeping Roma children in ordinary schools, made the change from a separate class to a regular class more flexible, despite it not being a matter of clearly set procedures and standards but obviously subject to individual assessment by a class teacher. While such a practice could not totally exclude any form of arbitrariness, and it would be preferable to have clearly set standards and procedures to operate the transfers from a Roma-only to a mixed class, it nevertheless allowed for a change from a separate class to a regular class without formalities. In the Court's view it presents some positive aspects in relation to the applicants' rights under Article 14 of the Convention when compared to the practice analysed in the case of D.H.\u00a0and Others, since the majority of the applicants in the present case attended both Roma-only and mixed classes.",

This ground, however, allows for a wider margin of appreciation. Unlike in the Czech Republic, where the placing of Roma children in schools for the mentally challenged was found to be a nationwide practice and where about seventy percent of Roma children attended such schools (see D.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 18.), in Croatia the placing of Roma children in separate classes is a method utilised in a very small number of elementary schools, namely, four, in a single region, owing to the high representation of Roma pupils in those schools.",

In the  twenty-six percent of pupils were Roma and forty-six percent of them attended a Roma-Only class. These statistics show that out of three of the elementary schools in question, only in the Macinec Elementary School did a majority of Roma pupils attend a Roma-only class, while in the two remaining schools the percentage was below fifty percent, which shows that it was not a general policy in these schools to automatically place Roma pupils in separate classes. The Government submitted that the tests taken had shown that a majority of Roma children in these communities lacked adequate knowledge of the Croatian language. The Court accepts that this problem had to be addressed by the relevant State authorities.
