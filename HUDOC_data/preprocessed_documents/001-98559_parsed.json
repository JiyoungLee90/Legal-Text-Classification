Turkey, nos. 14526/07, 14747/07, 15022/07, 15737/07, 36137/07, 47245/07, 50371/07, 50372/07 and 54637/07, \u00a7 18, 20 October 2009, and the cases cited therein). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence. It observes that the applicants were the editor-in-chief and owner of G\u00fcnl\u00fck Evrensel, and considers that there can be no doubt that their exercise of the freedom to impart information was directly affected by the seizure orders.",

That closure order and the conviction of Yeni Evrensel's editor-in-chief have already been examined by the Court and the conviction of that applicant was held to be in breach of Article 10 of the Convention (see Falakao\u011flu v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a077365/01, \u00a7\u00a7 30-37, 26 April 2005). This makes it unnecessary for the Court to examine the impugned articles published in Yeni Evrensel. What the Court must determine in the present case is whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the seizure orders for G\u00fcnl\u00fck Evrensel are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d (see Erdo\u011fdu, cited above, \u00a7 60) and whether the \u201cneed\u201d for the interference was convincingly established (ibid, \u00a7 53).",
