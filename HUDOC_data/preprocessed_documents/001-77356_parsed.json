As to the grounds of divorce, he alleged that he had been subjected to aggressive behaviour and harassment by his wife and disputed her claim that he was an alcoholic. In this connection, he principally requested the exclusion from the case file of a document from his medical records that his wife had, according to him, obtained by fraudulent means and on which she had relied to show that he was an alcoholic. The document in question was an operation report of 2 April 1994 concerning a splenectomy which the applicant had undergone. It had been sent on 20 April 1994 in a letter from Doctor C. (a specialist in digestive surgery) to the applicant\u2019s general practitioner. The applicant claimed, however, that he had never provided his wife with a copy of the document, nor had he released the doctor who signed it from his duty of medical confidentiality in that connection. As to the ancillary arrangements decided by the court below, he considered that the restrictions on his right of contact were unjustified, arguing that the welfare report and the additional documents he had produced proved his attachment to his children and the guarantees he was able to give in order to receive them. The applicant\u2019s ex-wife, for her part, reiterated the complaints she had made before the court below. She also denied that she had obtained a medical document fraudulently, alleging that her husband had entrusted her with \u201cthe management of paperwork\u201d, rejected any accusation of violence, and considered that the applicant\u2019s demands, in respect of his right of contact, were premature as he was living with his parents and had not yet overcome his drink problem.",

Similarly, a report drawn up without judicial authorisation, at the request of the husband, on premises of which he has possession, may be taken into consideration by the tribunals of fact (Court of Cassation, Second Civil Division, 14 December 1983).

In the same vein, a private investigation report is admissible when corroborated by other evidence such as comments written in a diary (Court of Cassation, Second Civil Division, 3 March 1983, unreported) or witness statements. As regards letters exchanged between one of the spouses and a third party within the meaning of the former Article 259-1 of the Civil Code, a court, in order to declare inadmissible letters from a wife to third parties, together with her diary, is not entitled to find that their production breached her privacy unless the husband obtained those documents by fraud or duress (Court of Cassation, Second Civil Division, 29 January 1997, Juris-classeur p\u00e9riodique 1997, Bull. civ.

They did not deny that the complaint related to the protection of private and family life, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, but observed that the applicant had simply relied in his grounds of appeal, in an elusive and laconic manner, on the fraudulent production of a medical document and a breach of medical confidentiality in order to justify the exclusion of the document in question. In those circumstances, having regard to the elusive, summary and indirect nature of the applicant\u2019s arguments before the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation, the Government submitted, as their principal argument, that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. In the alternative, the Government considered that the applicant had lost his victim status in the course of the proceedings. They observed that the applicant, in his presentation of the facts to the Court, had claimed that the production of the medical documents in issue had been decisive as regards his right of contact with his children and his line of argument was thus no longer going to the reclassification of the grounds of divorce as mutual fault. In this connection the Government pointed out that the Court of Appeal, in its judgment of 21 February 2000, before ruling on the request for an extension of the applicant\u2019s right of contact, had ordered a medical and psychological report on the couple and their two children, and that, in the meantime, the applicant had still benefited from the ancillary arrangements decided by the courts below. Consequently, the applicant could not claim to have been deprived of the right to see his children. Lastly, and above all, following the filing of the expert\u2019s report, the Court of Appeal had granted the applicant\u2019s request in its judgment of 7 June 2001. In those circumstances, the consequences of the production of the operation report had thus, in any event, been negated.

However, taking into account the applicant\u2019s lack of resources and the fact that legal representation was mandatory (in the context of divorce proceedings), the Court considers that the applicant cannot be accused of having failed to exhaust domestic remedies by discontinuing the appeal procedure after the decision dismissing his request (see, mutatis mutandis, Gnahor\u00e9 v. , no.\u00a040031/98, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48, ECHR 2000IX).",

He further indicated that he had never given her a copy of that report, nor had he released the doctor who signed it from his duty of medical confidentiality in that connection. Whilst it is true that the complaint thus submitted before the Court of Appeal was premised, in its first limb, on an allegation of fraud on the part of his wife, the second limb of the complaint nevertheless raised issues concerning release from a duty of medical confidentiality (which the applicant denied having granted for that purpose) and therefore relating to the admission in evidence of a document protected by such confidentiality.

Refusal by a judge to give consideration to such evidence, on the pretext that it might interfere with the private and family life of the parties, would be tantamount to limiting their right to a hearing, because certain material evidence, or evidence capable of influencing the outcome of the dispute, as regards, for example, the determination of arrangements for the exercise of parental responsibility, would be declared inadmissible. This would have the effect of endangering family life and the stability of children. In this connection the law provided that \u201c[f]acts relied on as grounds for divorce or as a defence to a divorce petition [might] be established by any type of evidence\u201d (Article 259 of the Civil Code), as long as such evidence had been obtained honestly. The Government thus emphasised the fact that to refuse evidence relating to private life would, in this sense, be contrary to the applicable legislation. They cited in this connection a judgment delivered on 29 January 1997 by the Court of Cassation, which held that a court of appeal was wrong to declare inadmissible letters from a wife to third parties and her diary, on the ground that the production of such evidence would interfere with her private life, without first considering whether the husband had obtained those documents by duress or fraud.",

As the Government themselves have acknowledged (see paragraph\u00a030 above), the production of the disputed document was not decisive in the granting of the divorce on grounds of fault by the applicant alone and was in fact only one of the items of evidence on which the domestic courts based their findings. The relevant domestic decisions referred, above all, to testimony concerning the applicant\u2019s alcohol addiction and to the \u201cduly substantiated\u201d medical certificates referring to \u201cthe reality of the acts of violence to which [the wife had] been subjected\u201d, thus concluding that the acts attributable to the husband constituted serious and repeated breaches of marital duties and obligations which had led to an irretrievable breakdown in the marriage. In reality, it was only on an alternative and secondary basis that the domestic courts used the disputed medical document in justifying their decisions, and it thus appears that they could have declared it inadmissible and still reached the same conclusion. In other words, the impugned interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life, in view of the fundamental importance of the protection of personal data, was not proportionate to the aim pursued and was therefore not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d.",
