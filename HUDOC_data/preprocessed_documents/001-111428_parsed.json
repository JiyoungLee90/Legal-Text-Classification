He refused his extradition under Article\u00a02442\u00a0(1) because Kyrgyz Community was not banned in . The prosecutor further noted that the statute of limitations for those offences had not expired, either in Russia or in . The prosecutor pointed out that, in line with the Minsk Convention and the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, differences in the classification of the offences and their elements under Russian and Uzbek criminal law were not a sufficient basis to refuse extradition.

Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review by appeal proceedings (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25\u00a0October 2007). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid).",

What is taken into account is the diligence shown by the authorities, any delay attributable to the applicant and any factors causing delay for which the State cannot be held responsible (Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09194, 21 December 2000, and G.B.\u00a0v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a027426/95, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03439, 30\u00a0November 2000).

The Court reiterates in that connection that Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(f) of the Convention does not require that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or absconding. In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law (see, among others, Liu v. Russia, no.\u00a042086/05, \u00a7 78, 6\u00a0December 2007).",

The Convention requirement for an act of deprivation of liberty to be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny is of fundamental importance in the context of the underlying purpose of Article 5 of the Convention to provide safeguards against arbitrariness (see Al-Nashif and Others v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a050963/99, \u00a7 92, 20 June 2002). It is for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable the courts to comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Butusov v. Russia, no.\u00a07923/04, \u00a7\u00a034, 22\u00a0December 2009). While some delay could be tolerated, exceptionally, on account of a public holiday, the Court considers that the requirement of diligence required the State to ensure expedite handling of pressing judicial issues\u00a0-\u00a0involving the right of liberty and security of persons\u00a0-\u00a0where the holidays lasted for eleven days.",
