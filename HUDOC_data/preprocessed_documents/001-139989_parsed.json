It found that the book disclosed a lot of information about the Prime Minister\u2019s private life but that he had already widely disclosed information about his family and habits as well as about his relationship with the applicant. Even though he himself had published an autobiography in 2005, had given several interviews, ran a blog and even permitted photographs to be taken at his home, he was known as a politician who strictly controlled his public image. The book also contained some information which had not previously been disclosed to the public. In this respect the court found that these new details only completed the information the Prime Minister had disclosed earlier. It was never suggested that the facts disclosed were not true. The book covered a period of nine months in the applicant\u2019s and the Prime Minister\u2019s private life. The court found that the applicant had the right to recount her private life. She also described the Prime Minister, his actions and family in a compassionate manner. The court found that, even though the information disclosed in the book had no direct relevance to the Prime Minister\u2019s political functions or his hierarchical position in the State, it had relevance as far as the Prime Minister\u2019s person was concerned. The Constitution required that ministers were \u201cknown to be honest and competent\u201d. Moreover, the book described a situation in which two different realities of present day Finnish society met: a wealthy party leader and Prime Minister on the one hand, and a single mother with everyday money problems on the other hand. The court found that the fact that the applicant was writing about her life and her relationship with one of the highest authorities in the country did not restrict but in fact widened her freedom of expression. When weighing the freedom of expression against the protection of private life, the court found that the need to resort to criminal liability decreased when the disclosed information became more widely known. Criminal liability was the last resort in guiding human behaviour and its use had to be proportionate. The court could therefore not hold that the publication of the applicant\u2019s book was a criminal act. Moreover, as the applicant was not a professional writer, she could not be regarded as having acted with intent and could not therefore be considered as a perpetrator.",

The proceeds of the crime, 4,270 euros, were ordered forfeit to the State. The court found that the passages in the book concerning the Prime Minister\u2019s intimate dating and his children\u2019s feelings and behaviour unnecessarily violated the core areas of his protected private life. He had not disclosed these details of his private life earlier in the media. The fact that he had disclosed some parts of his private life, the protection of which was, due to his status, much narrower than a private person\u2019s, did not mean that he could not benefit at all from any protection of his private life. He had thus not waived his right to the protection of private life, nor implicitly consented to the disclosure of information concerning details about his private life. Even though the applicant had the right to write about her private life, disclosure of intimate details of another person\u2019s private life always required his or her consent. The aim of the applicant\u2019s book had been to discuss matters of private life and it had no relevance to the Prime Minister\u2019s political functions or his hierarchical position in the State. Nor had it any relevance to the assessment of his personal qualities, such as his lack of honesty and judgment, as the relationship fell within the core areas of his private life and had no relevance to his position as a Prime Minister. Moreover, the applicant could be held as a perpetrator even though she was not a professional writer. Her acts had been intentional.",

In particular, by referring extensively to the Court\u2019s case-law, it gave a more narrow scope to the Prime Minister\u2019s private life than the Appeal Court. The court found that information about the Prime Minister\u2019s sex life and intimate events and his children\u2019s feelings and behaviour had not been disclosed to the public before. The fact that some details of his private life had been disclosed before did not mean that they could not fall within the scope of criminal liability under Chapter 24, section 8, of the Penal Code. The Prime Minister had not waived his right to protection of private life in these respects. Nor had he given his consent to their publication by consenting to the use of his photograph on the cover of the book. The court considered, contrary to the Appeal Court, that the information about how and when the Prime Minister had met the applicant and how quickly their relationship had developed had had relevance to general public discussion as these issues had raised the question of whether, in this respect, he had been dishonest and lacked judgment. Also the information concerning the great differences in the standard of living between the applicant and the Prime Minister, his lifestyle, the data protection concerns and the protection of the highest political authorities in general had had relevance to general public discussion. The court found also that disclosure of information about the Prime Minister\u2019s children was not conducive to causing him damage, suffering and contempt as the applicant had only given her own interpretation of the children\u2019s attitudes. However, the only references which, according to the court, had illegally disclosed information about the Prime Minister\u2019s private life were the applicant\u2019s information and hints about their sex life and intimate events between her and the Prime Minister. The court enumerated in particular seven parts of the book which contained information about the start of the sex life in the beginning of their relationship, descriptions of their brief and passionate intimate moments as well as giving massages to each other, and accounts of their sexual intercourse. The court found that such information and hints fell within the core area of private life and their unauthorised publication was conducive of causing the Prime Minister suffering and contempt. It was thus necessary to restrict the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression in this respect in order to protect the Prime Minister\u2019s private life.",

The Supreme Court had defined in the present case that sex life and details of intimate events fell within the core area of private life: not even a leading politician\u2019s private life, and especially its core area, could be excluded from the protection of private life. In this respect the protection of privacy had superseded the freedom of expression. The Supreme Court had not considered the applicant\u2019s book, when assessed as a whole, to violate the privacy of the former Prime Minister. On the contrary, the court had noted that the former Prime Minister himself had disclosed many of the facts presented in the book. The Supreme Court held that only the references to the sex life and intimate events between the applicant and the former Prime Minister had violated the privacy of the latter. The applicant should have had his consent to describe them.

Thus, this information had not previously appeared in the public sphere. The fact that the content and the tone of the description of his private life had not been insulting was without significance.

The impugned measures taken had thus not been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The Government further noted that imprisonment had not even been requested by the prosecutor. Moreover, the Supreme Court had, in its judgment, fully recognized that the present case had involved a conflict between the right to impart ideas and information, on one hand, and the reputation and rights of others, on the other hand. It had thus undertaken a balancing exercise in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law.

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, it is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 \u00a7 2, which must, however, be strictly construed. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 103; and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

All domestic courts, and especially the Supreme Court, balanced in their reasoning the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression against the former Prime Minister\u2019s right to reputation, by considering them from the point of view of \u201cpressing social need\u201d and proportionality. The Supreme Court also narrowed down the scope of the problematic passages in the book. It enumerated only certain parts of the book which it considered to contain information falling within the core area of the private life of the former Prime Minister (see paragraph 14 above). The Supreme Court found that such information and hints and their unauthorised publication was conducive of causing the former Prime Minister suffering and contempt. According to the Supreme Court, it was thus necessary to restrict the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression in this respect in order to protect the former Prime Minister\u2019s private life.",

The restrictions of the exercise of the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression were established convincingly by the Supreme Court, taking into account the Court\u2019s case-law. The Court recalls its recent case-law according to which the Court would require, in such circumstances, strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], cited above, \u00a7 107; and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a088).",

Moreover, the Court notes that, according to the domestic law, no entry of the conviction was made on the applicant\u2019s criminal record as the sanction imposed only concerned a fine (see paragraph 19 above). The Court finds the sanction imposed reasonable (compare and contrast Flinkkil\u00e4 and Others v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 89-91; and Lahtonen v.
