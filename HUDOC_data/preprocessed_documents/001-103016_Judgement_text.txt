The case originated in an application (no. 17860/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Suat Çetinkaya (“the applicant”), on 10 April 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Kansu, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 27 August 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (former Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in İzmir.
On 8 July 1999 the İzmir Public Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant, charging him with a violation of the Associations Law.
On 19 November 2003 the İzmir Criminal Court sentenced him to a fine.
On 9 March 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 19 November 2003.
On 28 November 2006 the İzmir Criminal Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant, holding that the prosecution was time-barred.
