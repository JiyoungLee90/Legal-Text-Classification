In the instant case, the Court observes that one of the steps taken for that purpose was the questioning of one of the school teachers (see paragraph 7 above). Given the content of her statement and in view of the fact that a request for an investigation concerning the criminal offence of sexual abuse of a minor was ultimately lodged against the applicant, the Court presupposes that the police must also have taken other measures in order to gather evidence in support of the reasonable suspicion against him. Clearly, any such measures resulted in interference with the applicant's right to respect for his private life, it being precisely this aspect of his life that the police and the prosecution authorities had to scrutinise. The Court thus concludes that the activities of the police in the preliminary proceedings must have substantially affected the applicant's situation at the material time (see, mutatis mutandis, Casse v. Luxembourg, no. 40327/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a031-33, 27\u00a0April 2006; Diamantides v. Greece, no.\u00a060821/00, \u00a7\u00a021, 23 October 2003; and Amann v.
