The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the receiving country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is liability incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 90-91, Series A no. 161).",

However, it appears that any criminal suspect held in custody faces a serious risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment both in order to extract confessions and as punishment for being a criminal. Moreover, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the applicant's entire family had been either arrested or prosecuted in Uzbekistan, that their accounts of ill-treatment are mutually consistent and appear to be credible, and that the applicant personally had been previously arrested and convicted in suspicious circumstances. The Court notes that the applicant's description of previous ill-treatment in 2000-2001 is very detailed and convincing. Despite the fact that the applicant is wanted for an offence which is not politically motivated, the Court considers that there are sufficient reasons for a fear that a criminal suspect in such a situation would be at serious risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (compare Soldatenko v. Ukraine, no. 2440/07, \u00a7 72, 23 October 2008).",

As for the Government's argument that torture and ill-treatment were prohibited by Uzbekistan's domestic law and the relevant international treaties, the Court reiterates that the existence of domestic laws and accession to international treaties guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights in principle are not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of illtreatment where, in the present case, reliable sources have reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 147, and Muminov v.

The Court observes, however, that it is not at all established that the Deputy Prosecutor General or the institution which he represented was empowered to provide such assurances on behalf of the State (compare Soldatenko, cited above, \u00a7 73). In any event, even if such assurances were obtained, they were not in themselves sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of illtreatment and would not have absolved the Court from the obligation to examine whether such assurances provided, in their practical application, a sufficient guarantee that the applicant would be protected against the risk of treatment prohibited by the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 148). Given that the practice of torture is described by reputable international human rights reports as being systematic, the Court is not persuaded that the assurances from the Uzbek authorities offered a reliable guarantee against the risk of ill-treatment.",

However, in the applicant's situation, while the prosecuting authority decided whether to extradite the applicant or not, his detention pending that decision on extradition could be (and was) ordered only by a court. In such circumstances, the Court does not see how the applicant could have used the procedure under Articles 449-451 of the CCrP to obtain the review of lawfulness of his continued detention, for the simple fact that the order of his detention was not an \u201cact or decision of a prosecuting authority\u201d.

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article\u00a046 of the Convention (see Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7 95). By finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 in the present case, the Court has established the Government's obligation to take appropriate general and individual measures to remedy the existing legal deficiencies. Whether such measures would involve amending the domestic law, issuance of binding clarifications by the domestic courts, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State. The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004II, with further references).",
