The prosecutor disagreed with the application. While noting that the examination of the evidence had already been concluded, he claimed that a rehearing would only delay the proceedings. Having heard the prosecution and the defence, Judge P.S. dismissed the application by the defence. He concluded that he had been assigned to the applicant\u2019s case as a substitute judge, and thus in accordance with Article 436 of the CCP he did not have to restart the trial. He further noted that the case material was sufficient for him to continue with the examination of the case. The defence also filed an application with the court requesting the examination of two more witnesses on the applicant\u2019s behalf. The defence claimed that those witnesses, as employees of Mtskheta Hospital, could provide more precise information concerning the circumstances in which the second ultrasound examination of G.M. had taken place.

Subsequently, when at around 1.00 p.m., G.M. had had an ultrasound examination, it had been noted that she had liquid in her abdominal cavity, which had implied that she was in need of an urgent medical intervention. However, G.M. had died at 3.50 p.m. without being provided with such an intervention. The appeal court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s argument that she could not have started a surgical intervention without an anaesthesiologist. In that connection, it relied on the evidence given by several doctors that no measures to prepare for G.M.\u2019s operation had been undertaken between 1.00\u00a0p.m. and approximately 3.15 p.m., and that the applicant had made no request for an anaesthesiologist to be present.",

Indeed, as concluded by the Supreme Court of Georgia in its decision, there was no obligation for a substitute judge to be assigned to a case or to follow hearings from the very beginning (see paragraph 20 above). In the Court\u2019s view, there is nothing to suggest the existence of a \u201cflagrant violation of domestic law\u201d that would allow it to question the above interpretation of the relevant domestic provisions (see Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7\u00a0114, 28\u00a0November 2002; DMD GROUP, a.s., v. Slovakia, no. 19334/03, \u00a7\u00a061, 5\u00a0October 2010, and Miracle Europe Kft v. Hungary, no. 57774/13, \u00a7\u00a050, 12\u00a0January 2016). Furthermore, the applicant has never argued that Judge\u00a0P.S.\u2019s appointment as Chair of the Mtskheta District Court by the President of Georgia was in breach of the relevant domestic law (compare Fatullayev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 40984/07, \u00a7 145, 22 April 2010; see also Shaykhatarov and Others v.\u00a0Russia [Committee], no. 47737/10 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a040, 15\u00a0January 2019). In such circumstances, the Court is not in a position to conclude that Judge P.S. was assigned to the applicant\u2019s trial unlawfully (contrast Chim and Przywieczerski v. Poland, nos. 36661/07 and 38433/07, \u00a7\u00a7 138-139, 12 April 2018; see also Richert v. Poland, no. 54809/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050 and 55, 25 October 2011). Moreover, there were valid grounds for the trial court\u2019s reassignment of the case to Judge P.S. (see 12 above); the applicant knew about the reason for that, and there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the appointment of Judge P.S. was not compatible with Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (compare Sutyagin v. Russia, no.\u00a030024/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a018490, 3 May 2011). In view of the above mentioned, the Court finds this complaint of the applicant to be manifestly ill-founded and dismisses it in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

Italy, no. 10075/02, \u00a7 38, 10 February 2005, with further references therein). The principle of immediacy is an important guarantee in criminal proceedings in which observations made by the court about the demeanour and credibility of a witness may have important consequences for the accused (see Beraru v. Romania, no. 40107/04, \u00a7 64, 18\u00a0March 2014, and Cutean v. Romania, no. 53150/12, \u00a7 60, 2\u00a0December 2014).",

Very clear administrative or procedural factors may arise which render a judge\u2019s continued participation in a case impossible. The Court has indicated that measures can be taken to ensure that the judges who continue hearing the case have the appropriate understanding of the evidence and arguments, for example, by making transcripts available, where the credibility of the witness concerned is not in issue, or by arranging for a rehearing of the relevant arguments or of important witnesses before the newly composed court (see Cutean, cited above, \u00a7 61). Furthermore, the possibility exists that a higher or the highest court might, in some circumstances, make reparation for defects in the firstinstance proceedings (see De Cubber v.

In the Court\u2019s view, the situation in the current case was peculiar, given that Judge P.S. did not participate in the oral examination of the evidence at all, that is, he did not hear any of the seventeen witnesses, including the two experts and the applicant\u2019s co-defendants, and he convicted the applicant only on the basis of the court transcripts.",

In order to establish these facts, which were clearly central to the decision to convict the applicant, Judge P.S. relied on the transcripts of witness statements rather than other written documents. It is true that Judge P.S. had all the transcripts relating to the examination of those witnesses at his disposal while he made his decision. However, given the complex factual background of the case and the fact that Judge P.S. examined the case as a single judge, the Court considers that his inability to make any direct assessment of the statements and demeanour of the persons concerned deprived him of the opportunity to form his own opinion as to their credibility, and diminished his ability to have an appropriate understanding of the evidence and arguments so that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial could be respected (see Cerov\u0161ek and Bo\u017ei\u010dnik v.

The Supreme Court reached an identical conclusion (see paragraph 19 above). In that context, the Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant could have requested the re-examination of particular witnesses before either the first-instance court or the court of appeal, but failed to do so (see paragraph 24 above). The documents before the Court indicate that as soon as the trial against the applicant resumed with the involvement of Judge P.S., the defence requested, with reference to Article\u00a0435 of the CCP, that the evidence be re-examined. However, Judge P.S. rejected that application (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, the applicant requested the examination of two additional witnesses, but that application was also rejected (see ibid). It was equally dismissed by the appeal court, which simply concluded that the firstinstance court had already dealt with the application (see paragraph\u00a019 above).

None of those individuals were directly heard by Judge P.S. He also refused to allow two other defence witnesses to be interviewed in his presence. In addition, as indicated in paragraph 35 above, the background of the case was factually complex and Judge P.S. examined the case as a single judge. In these circumstances, the availability of transcripts of witness statements could not compensate for the lack of immediacy (see Beraru, cited above, \u00a7\u00a066). Furthermore, the higher courts upheld the first instance court\u2019s judgment without directly hearing any of the evidence, although they were entitled to do so.
