They furthermore submitted that HIV-positive inmates served their sentences in penal institution LIU-19 under the same conditions as other prisoners. The inmates working at the LIU-19 sewing workshop, including HIV-positive inmates, were each allotted a personal sewing machine. In order to prevent the risk of the spread of HIV infection, all the premises of LIU-19 were wiped daily with disinfectants, as well as treated with quartz lamps twice a day for one hour. Regular counselling was given to detainees by the administration of the facility regarding risky behaviour, modes of HIV transmission and personal hygiene. All HIV-negative inmates (including the applicant during his stay there) underwent laboratory tests for HIV twice a year. There had been no instances of HIV being contracted in LIU-19.

The Court furthermore notes that, aside from the daily disinfection of the premises, regular counseling was provided by the administration of the penal institution regarding risky behaviour and modes of HIV transmission and the personal hygiene of inmates; twice-yearly laboratory testing of HIV-negative inmates was also undertaken. Although the applicant deplored the quality of the counseling provided by the administration of penal institution LIU-19 to inmates and the alleged irregularity of the sanitary cleaning of the premises, the case file shows that there were no instances of HIV being contracted in LIU-19 and that the applicant himself did not contract HIV during his detention at LIU19 either. It appears, therefore, that the measures undertaken by the administration of LIU-19 were sufficient to shield inmates from the risk of contracting HIV.

The applicant\u2019s confession had triggered his arrest as a suspect (with the drawing-up of the relevant record), upon which he had been informed of his rights and granted access to a legal-aid lawyer. All subsequent investigative actions in respect of the applicant as a suspect and as an accused were carried out initially with the participation of the legal-aid lawyer, and subsequently with the participation of a privately retained lawyer. The Government noted the absence of any proof of duress having been exercised by the police when the confession had been made. They referred in this connection to the findings of the forensic medical examination carried out on 23 March 2005 (which had revealed no fresh injuries on the applicant\u2019s body), as well as to the applicant\u2019s failure to appeal against the decision of 27\u00a0May 2005 not to institute criminal proceedings into his allegations of ill-treatment. They furthermore noted that the applicant had challenged the admissibility of his confession during his trial but that the domestic court had found this challenge to be illfounded and had dismissed it.

He had therefore been entitled to access to legal advice from 6 p.m. on 22\u00a0March 2005. However, the police had subjected him to coercion and had forced his confession without affording him the benefit of legal advice. The confession had therefore constituted a disguised record of his interrogation as a suspect. As soon as the applicant had been appointed a legal-aid lawyer he had retracted his confession and had complained about having been subjected to coercion by the police. However, no meaningful investigation into his allegations had been conducted by the domestic authorities. In such circumstances the applicant\u2019s confession, which had been used as a basis for his conviction, had rendered the proceedings against him unfair, especially having regard to the absence of other credible evidence of his involvement in the murder.",

The Court therefore concludes that, having regard to the central position of the applicant\u2019s confession in the prosecution\u2019s case, it can be considered to have formed an integral and significant part of the probative evidence upon which the conviction was based (compare Ibrahim and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0309, and contrast Artur Parkhomenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a040464/05, \u00a7\u00a087, 16\u00a0February 2017).",
