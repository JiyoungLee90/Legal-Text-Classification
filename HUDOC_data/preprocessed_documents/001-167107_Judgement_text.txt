The case originated in an application (no. 54929/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Aleksandr Vasilyevich Mandrykin (“the applicant”), on 7 September 2009.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 1 October 2014 the complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lived, prior to his arrest, in Irkutsk.
On 14 May 2008 the applicant was arrested. On an unspecified date he was charged with three counts of pimping and pandering, extortion and illegal keeping of firearms. The court remanded him in custody.
On 5 March 2009 he was committed for trial before the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Irkutsk.
On 3 August 2009 the District Court extended his pre-trial detention on the ground that the circumstances of the case had not changed since the applicant’s arrest, he was accused of a serious crime, did not live at his domicile, hence he could abscond, threaten witnesses and interfere with the investigation.
On 26 November 2009 and 2 March 2010 the District Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention referring to the above grounds and stating that the victims of his crimes were minors. The court also took into account the applicant’s character, his state of health and age.
The applicant’s appeals against the detention orders were rejected.
On 29 March 2010 the District Court convicted him as charged.
