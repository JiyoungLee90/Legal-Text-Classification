The Court notes that under domestic law, it was open to the applicant to have recourse to various types of proceedings in order to have the 2001 judgment implemented in practice and, in particular, to have these complex claims and counterclaims determined by the courts. The applicant had recourse to them, firstly by instituting several sets of proceedings in which he sought damages from the enterprise for the use of the property after the expropriation decision had been declared null and void in 2001. The courts ruled in his favour in two of these sets of proceedings and awarded damages to him. The Court further notes that the applicant also successfully instituted proceedings in which he sought to have possession of the factory returned to him. Furthermore, it was open to him to claim damages for the period during which the State Treasury had been using his property. The first-instance court dismissed his claim. It was open to the applicant to lodge an appeal, but he failed to do so (see paragraphs 38- 42 above).",
