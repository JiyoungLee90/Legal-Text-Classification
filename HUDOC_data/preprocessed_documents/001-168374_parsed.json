The expert was provided with the sketch of the accident (see paragraph 9 above) and photographs of the two vehicles, and asked to determine the location of the collision, to estimate the speed of the motorcycle before the collision, and to establish who had been responsible for the accident. The expert report, delivered on 31 January 2007 (hereinafter \u201cthe first expert report\u201d), stated that the description of the skid marks and the fragments of glass and plastic on the road indicated that the collision had occurred in the right-hand lane.

The expert report, delivered on 16 June 2008 (hereinafter \u201cthe second expert report\u201d), did not make a fresh estimate of the speed of the applicant\u2019s motorcycle but relied on the findings of the first expert report and considered that the applicant had been travelling at a speed of at least 70.3 km/h. It found that the speed limit at the location of the accident had been 60 km/h and not 50\u00a0km/h, as assumed in the first expert report, which nonetheless meant that the applicant had exceeded the speed limit. Having examined the sketch of the accident and the damage to both vehicles, the second report confirmed the conclusion of the first report that the collision had occurred in the righthand lane, while the motorcycle was moving into it from the left-hand lane. It found no data indicating that M.N. had been driving at speeds in excess of the speed limit or that he had done anything which might have caused the accident. The report concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant: the main cause had not been the speed of the motorcycle but the difference between the speed of the two vehicles, and the fact that the applicant had not started to brake in time to avoid the collision.",

It also observed that the judgment of the Vilnius Regional Court of 22\u00a0March\u00a02011 (see paragraph 39 above) could not be interpreted as affirming M.N.\u2019s responsibility for the accident. As a result, the court concluded that it had not been established that M.N. had breached any legal requirements, which was a pre-condition for his civil liability to arise. The court also noted that the applicant had bought the motorcycle only two days before the accident, that he had not had any prior experience in driving that kind of vehicle, and that the motorcycle had not undergone a technical examination before the accident. Accordingly, the court found that the applicant himself may have breached road traffic safety regulations.

The procedural obligation under Article 3 of the Convention requires that any investigation should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible for an offence. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as by taking witness statements and gathering forensic evidence, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see N.D. v.

Nonetheless, the total duration of the pre-trial investigation was five years and one month \u2013 from the day of the accident on 28 April 2006 until the prosecutor\u2019s decision to discontinue the investigation as time-barred on 31\u00a0May 2011. Already during the first year of the investigation the district prosecutor drew the investigators\u2019 attention to the fact that it was being conducted slowly (see paragraph 22 above), but it does not appear that any effective measures were taken to increase its promptness. In this connection the Court also observes there were some short periods of inactivity which had not been explained by the authorities \u2013 for example, it appears that no investigative measures at all were taken between May and September 2007 (four months) and between December 2008 and February 2009 (two\u00a0months). While those periods do not seem problematic as such, the Court is of the view that there are other serious reasons to consider that the investigation taken as a whole was ineffective (see paragraphs\u00a060-62 below).",

The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s mother, acting on his behalf, claimed in many of her complaints that after the collision the motorcycle had risen up in the air and landed in the right-hand lane, as submitted by some eyewitnesses at the beginning of the investigation (see paragraphs 28, 33 and 37 above), but that claim was finally refuted by the court-appointed experts only in May 2011, after four forensic examinations and two rounds of additional questions (see paragraph 41 above). The Court also notes that, while it is not its role to assess the evidentiary value of the specialist\u2019s opinion commissioned by the applicant\u2019s mother, it took nineteen months and two reports by court-appointed experts to refute its findings (see paragraphs 34-35 above).

In the domestic proceedings the applicant\u2019s mother complained that those reports had been based on an inaccurate sketch of the accident, as proven by the fact that it had never been signed by either of the drivers (see paragraphs\u00a020, 26, 28 and 29 above). While it is understandable that the authorities may have been unable to obtain the signature of the applicant immediately after the accident due to his serious state of health, there do not appear to have been any obstacles for obtaining the signature of the other driver. In this context the Court notes that the domestic authorities acknowledged that the investigator who had failed to obtain the drivers\u2019 signatures had not properly fulfilled her official duties (see paragraph 25 above). However, that shortcoming was not remedied in the subsequent proceedings and each fresh expert examination was based on that same sketch (see paragraphs 18, 27, 31 and 35 above). In this regard, the Court shares the view of the district prosecutor that the applicant had legitimate reasons to doubt the accuracy of the sketch (see paragraph 25 above). That sketch became the basis for all the subsequent forensic examinations, which were central to the repeated discontinuation of the pre-trial investigation, as well as to the dismissal of the applicant\u2019s civil claim (see paragraphs 44-45 above).",

Ireland [GC], no. 35810/09, ECHR 2014 (extracts), a case concerning bodily injury between private parties in which a child had thrown a stone in retaliation, hitting the applicant\u2019s eye and resulting in partial blindness, the Court had no difficulty applying the case-law developed for police brutality under the procedural limb of Article 3. The Muta Court claimed that the Court\u2019s \u201ccase-law is consistent and clear on the point that Article 3 of the Convention requires that the authorities conduct an effective official investigation into alleged ill-treatment even if such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals (see Ay v. Turkey, no. 30951/96, \u00a7 60, 22\u00a0March 2005, and M.C. v. Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, \u00a7 151, ECHR 2003XII and, most recently, Biser Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 32662/06, 10\u00a0January\u00a02012).\u201d And further: \u201c[i]n particular, Article 3 requires States to put in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against personal integrity, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions\u201d (see Muta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60). The first two cases cited involved police brutality; only Biser Kostov concerned a private conflict, the beating of a shoplifter by shop employees. From a deliberate beating in a humiliating situation, Muta extended the breadth of Article 3 to apply to negligent injury among children, which has in the present case obliged the Court to extend Article 3 to negligent car accidents, effectively turning thousands of investigations initiated by a party at fault into potential Article 3 violations. This is a surprising development in view of the unmistakable language of the great breakthrough Article 3 case, Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria: \u201c[w]here an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously ill-treated by the police . . . there should be an effective official investigation.\u201d (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a0102, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). Note the modifier \u201cseriously\u201d!",

What is degrading or inhuman about being hit by another vehicle and suffering bodily injury? Is this humiliating? Is it an attack on personal integrity?

Where is the illtreatment aspect in a negligent car accident? It seems to us that there is a moral dimension to ill-treatment and an element of humiliation or debasement of a particular level (see Tyrer v. the United Kingdom, 25 April 1978, \u00a7 30, Series A, no.\u00a026); otherwise inflicting ill-treatment would be identical to causing bodily injury. The negligent causation of bodily injury in a car accident lacks the blameworthiness that distinguishes these acts from those capable of violating human rights. The objective indicator used in the first sentence of the Bouyid definition should be coupled with the second sentence. It is in this sentence that the elements of inhumanity are spelled out without which the bodily injury aspect is of little relevance. This understanding is in line with the original formulation of ill-treatment found in Selmouni v. France [GC] (no.\u00a025803/94, ECHR 1999V), where the psychological impact on the individual in terms of his or her human dignity is central.",

There is nothing in negligent car accidents entailing recourse to physical force diminishing human dignity. Moreover, in the light of the \u201cusually\u201d qualifier in Bouyid, one should not conclude that all bodily injury is severe enough to constitute ill-treatment. Bodily injury in negligent car accidents (and perhaps also where the investigation concerns involuntary manslaughter in cases of car accidents) usually does not constitute ill-treatment, as not even a grossly negligent driver \u201ctreats\u201d the victim in any relevant or meaningful way. Once the domestic authorities have reasonably established that the car accident is a negligent one the procedural limb of Article 3 shall not come into play.",

But in the context of negligence this duty is fulfilled with the provision of an efficient legal system. The Court here seems at pains to interpret this duty as requiring an efficient criminal investigation, even where there are civil remedies available. Why does the Court encourage recourse to criminal proceedings when, according to Perez, \u201cthe Convention does not confer [upon an applicant] any right . . . to \u2018private revenge\u2019\u201d? (see Perez v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 47287/99, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004-I) This remains a mystery: the Court is captive to an otherwise faultless procedural consideration, namely that the applicant has the right to choose among available recourses. Applying such an approach to the present context disregards the sober warning of O\u2019Keeffe: the \u201cpositive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources.\u201d (see O\u2019Keeffe, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0144; see also Mastromatteo v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7\u00a068, 24 October 2002, or Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a0116, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII).",

Still, there is hardly any other Article of the Convention or its Protocols which would have been \u201cmore applicable\u201d to the present case than Article 3.

Such deficiencies had not been found in Dragomir v. Romania (no. 43045/08, 14 June 2016), which accordingly would not have been an authority to be followed in the instant case either.",

Would such a widening of scope be justified? I do not think that, upon consideration, it would be easy to answer this question in the affirmative. For instance, had Article 6 \u00a7 1, and not Article 3, been applied in the instant case, this might have been satisfactory from the point of view of Article 3, its scope becoming close to what it had once been, but not necessarily from that of Article 6 \u00a7 1.",

Without delving into history to try and discover when it all began (which would be an extremely interesting academic exercise), I suspect that the major problem of an overly extensive interpretation of various Articles of the Convention (and its Protocols) has its roots in the approach to this international instrument as if it were a constitution, which, at least in its Kelsenian perception (to which I subscribe in essence), does not have gaps, although its text may and does have. Unlike a constitution, the Convention does not \u201ccover\u201d every field of life. It has gaps. Even when the Court sees that injustice had been done, it has to ascertain whether that factual injustice falls under the Convention or not. Sometimes it does not. On the other hand, the Convention evolves. It has been repeated hundreds of times in the Court\u2019s case-law that the Convention is a \u201cliving instrument\u201d. Can the gaps in the Convention be filled in by the Court\u2019s case-law? Should they? In my opinion, they can and should be filled in by the Court\u2019s case-law, although to a much lesser degree than that case-law \u2013 and not just that pertaining to Article 3 \u2013 has so far actually attempted.",

Yet I do not think that this particular extensiveness is the worst manifestation of extensive interpretation of the provisions of the Convention to be found in the Court\u2019s case-law. There are other examples which are much more proactive and unconvincing and have provided more dubious results. In this context one could mention, among others, an overly extensive interpretation of Articles 8 or 10, but since these issues are not relevant to this particular case I shall not go into them here. At the same time, there are also manifestations of an overly restrictive interpretation, where a \u201cliving instrument\u201d tool could and should have been made use of more decisively.",

And if none of these Articles had been interpreted extensively, that would mean that there is a gap in the Convention, which would allow, in certain circumstances, for a conflict or dispute between private parties (in particular, pertaining to negligence, but maybe not only to it) to be subject to a deliberately inefficient investigation or even not investigated at all, and still to be excluded from the ambit of this Court\u2019s scrutiny.
