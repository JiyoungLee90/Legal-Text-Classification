It thus instructed the courts below that an apology, whatever its form, was not prescribed under Russian law, including Article 152 of the Civil Code, as redress (point 18). The above does not exclude the possibility for a judge to approve a friendly-settlement agreement the terms of which require such an apology. The Supreme Court also instructed the other courts that when a citizen lodges a complaint with a public authority alleging, for instance, that a criminal offence has been committed and when such an allegation proves to be unfounded, the latter fact cannot serve as a basis for an action under Article 152 of the Civil Code. The Supreme Court explained that civil liability could not arise in such a situation in view of the applicant\u2019s exercise of his right of petition to a public authority, which was to carry out an inquiry, and that such a situation did not equate to dissemination of false defamatory information (point 10). A defamation action may only succeed if a court has established that the petition to the public authority lacked any foundation and was intended to cause damage to another person, thus amounting to an abuse of the right (ibid).",

France [GC], nos.\u00a021279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2007...). Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Indeed, whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity while the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice.\u00a0However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there will inevitably be a need for interpretation by the courts, whose judicial function is precisely to elucidate obscure points and dispel any doubts which may remain regarding the interpretation of legislation (see \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v.  [GC], no.\u00a022479/93, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 1999VI). The Court further reiterates that the scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the text in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, among others, Dzhavadov v. , no.\u00a030160/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 27\u00a0September 2007).\u00a0",

Belgium, judgment of 22\u00a0April 1992, Series A no.\u00a0235-B, pp.\u00a032-33, \u00a7\u00a032). The wording of Article 152 of the Civil Code provides for three types of redress: an obligation to issue a refutation, an award of damages or an obligation to publish the plaintiff\u2019s reply, if the respondent is part of the mass media. The Court observes that in 2005 the Plenary Supreme Court issued a ruling by which it instructed the courts below that an apology, whatever its form, was not prescribed under Russian law, including Article 152 of the Civil Code, as redress (see paragraph 13 above). It appears that this ruling was intended to harmonise the divergent case-law of the Russian courts on that matter (see, for instance, the findings made by Russian courts, as presented in the cases of Filatenko v. Russia, no.\u00a073219/01, \u00a7\u00a017, 6\u00a0December 2007; Dyuldin and Kislov v. , no.\u00a025968/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 31\u00a0July 2007; Zakharov v. , no.\u00a014881/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011 and 13, 5\u00a0October 2006; Grinberg v. , no.\u00a023472/03, \u00a7\u00a012, 21\u00a0July 2005; and Godlevskiy v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a014888/03, 9 December 2004). The Court does not exclude that before the 2005 resolution the courts were reasonably inclined to interpret the notions of refutation or rectification as possibly including an apology. Thus, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court is ready to accept that the interpretation of the relevant legislation by the Russian courts was not such as to render the impugned interference unlawful in the Convention terms.",

The applicant, himself a former military officer, wrote to the supervising commander, complaining that the conduct of the unit commander had not been even-handed and had at times been unlawful. It appears that the applicant acted within the framework established by law for making complaints (see, in a similar context, Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a022). Apparently, the applicant\u2019s concerns were shared by other persons living in the military compound.",

Austria, judgment of 19\u00a0December 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0302, \u00a7\u00a036). Notwithstanding that, it is not open to the national authorities to rely on such rules for the purpose of frustrating the expression of opinions, even if these are directed against the army as an institution (see Grigoriades v. Greece, judgment of 25 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VII, \u00a7\u00a045). However, it appears that the applicant, being a former officer, was no longer bound by the rules of subordination. Thus, the applicant should be considered as a private individual raising a complaint against a public servant. In that connection, the Court has observed in several cases that it may be necessary to protect public servants from offensive, abusive and defamatory attacks which are calculated to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold (see Janowski v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a025716/94, \u00a7\u00a033, ECHR 1999I).\u00a0In the present case, the Court is prepared to accept that a military unit commander may be considered to belong to that category of official.",

Chernysheva v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a077062/01, 10\u00a0June 2004).

Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, \u00a7 48, 20\u00a0April 2006).

Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the applicant\u2019s complaint was vexatious or that the applicant otherwise acted in bad faith.",

In its view, to make someone retract his or her own opinion by acknowledging his or her own wrongness is a doubtful form of redress and does not appear to be \u201cnecessary\u201d. This point of view has also subsequently been acknowledged by the Supreme Court of Russia which considered an apology, whatever its form, to be contrary to the law (see paragraph 13 above).",
