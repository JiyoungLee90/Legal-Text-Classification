Both experts were appointed by an investigating judge, that is, by the judicial authority. As no reasons are given in the Assize Court\u2019s judgment it cannot be known to what extent the jurors, in declaring the applicant guilty, took the psychiatric reports into account. Jurors are very sensitive to opinions expressed by qualified experts. By using such expressions in the reports, the experts reinforced the opinion that the applicant was guilty and so created a situation in which the principles of presumption of innocence and fair trial were not observed.",
