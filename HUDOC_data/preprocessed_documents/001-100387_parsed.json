It clarified, nevertheless, that the term \u201cadministration of justice\u201d did not cover the judicial proceedings in their entirety, but only extended to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case. Other judicial acts \u2013 mainly of a procedural nature \u2013 fell outside the scope of the notion \u201cadministration of justice\u201d. State liability for the damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act, such as a breach of the reasonable length of court proceedings, could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge has been established in civil proceedings. The  emphasised, moreover, that the constitutional right to compensation by the State for the damage should not be tied in with the personal fault of a judge.
