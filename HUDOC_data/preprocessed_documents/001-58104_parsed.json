Technical aspects are undeniably important, but the grant or refusal of a licence may also be made conditional on other considerations, including such matters as the nature and objectives of a proposed station, its potential audience at national, regional or local level, the rights and needs of a specific audience and the obligations deriving from international legal instruments (judgment cited above, p. 14, \u00a7\u00a032).",

It is therefore surprising that only two frequencies were reserved for private radio stations transmitting in the  region. However, it is not necessary for the Court to consider whether such a restriction is compatible with Article 10 \u00a7 2, as it resulted from a law of which certain provisions were declared null and void by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 13 above), and as this invalidated the decisions refusing Radio ABC\u2019s applications, it put the association back in the legal situation which had obtained before that law\u2019s entry into force, thus prolonging the violation of Article 10 already found in connection with the first period (see paragraph 31 above).",
