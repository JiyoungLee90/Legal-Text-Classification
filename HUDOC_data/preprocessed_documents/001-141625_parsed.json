Relying on the findings of the domestic prosecutorial authorities, they submitted that most of the injuries in dispute had been inflicted on the applicant as a result of proportionate force being applied to restrain him during his arrest. As regards the rib injuries, which had first featured in an expert assessment as consolidated fractures four months after the applicant\u2019s arrest, the time of their infliction had never been established; it had probably predated the applicant\u2019s arrest. The Government further argued that the allegations of illtreatment had been part of the applicant\u2019s defence strategy. In particular, he had not made them until several weeks after his arrest. The Government also maintained that, notwithstanding the delay in the submission of the relevant complaint by the applicant, the prosecutorial authorities had conducted an effective investigation, which had led to the establishment of the origin of the applicant\u2019s injuries. The applicant had not appealed against those decisions. Accordingly, the relevant investigation materials had been archived and subsequently destroyed. Insofar as the applicant had reiterated his complaints during the judicial proceedings, the courts of two instances had examined them thoroughly and had rejected them as unsubstantiated.",

However, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events at issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of those under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as lying with the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII).",

Ukraine, no. 39598/03, \u00a7 68, 21\u00a0July 2011). A medical examination, together with the right of access to a lawyer and the right to inform a third party of the detention, constitute fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of detained persons which should apply as from the very outset of deprivation of liberty. This would not only ensure the applicant\u2019s rights but would also enable the respondent Government to discharge their burden of providing a plausible explanation for those injuries (ibid. 70). The Court also notes that Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force for the purposes of effecting an arrest. However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see, among other authorities, Mikiashvili v. Georgia, no. 18996/06, \u00a7\u00a070, 9 October 2012). In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 336).",

At the same time, it clearly follows from the case file that the applicant sustained a number of injuries as a result of his encounter with law-enforcement officers in December 2002. In particular, according to medical assessments, he had at least one wound and a number of abrasions and bruises on various parts of his body. He also sustained injuries to his wrists resulting in a long-term neural dysfunction of his hands and a serious chest injury, including seven fractured ribs. The Court cannot accept as plausible the Government\u2019s allegation that the applicant\u2019s ribs could have been fractured before his arrest. It notes in this respect that no materials have been presented to corroborate this version, which was also never explored by the domestic investigative authorities (see Holodenko v. Latvia, no. 17215/07, \u00a7\u00a067, 2 July 2013 and by contrast, Lobanovs v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a016987/02, 28 September 2010).

At the same time, given the nature, gravity and dispersed location of the injuries at issue and the materials on file concerning the deployment of the arrest operation, the Court is not convinced that all of them could be caused by the application of proportionate force necessary to restrain the applicant. It notes, in particular, that the account of the arrest operation presented by the Government, who relied on the findings of the domestic investigation, is very general. It does not determine the sequence of events, the manner in which the injuries were inflicted or the individual roles of the particular officers in restraining the applicant. Likewise, it does not explain which specific techniques were applied and how they correlated with the applicant\u2019s particular actions (see e.g.\u00a0Vasiliy Ivashchenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a0760/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-82, 26 July 2012 Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013, 17 and 30-31, Series A no.\u00a0269). According to the applicant, after he had exhausted his cartridges, the officers had swiftly knocked him to the floor and immobilised him without a significant struggle. Regard being had to this account and the fact that there were eight trained and well-equipped officers to restrain two resisting suspects, the Court is not convinced that such major injuries as seven fractured ribs leading to an accumulation of blood in the applicant\u2019s pleural cavity resulted from the application of proportionate force during arrest. The applicant\u2019s version, according to which his ribs were broken as a result of being beaten up after he had been handcuffed, can therefore not be ruled out.",

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 102 et seq., and Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, \u00a7\u00a099, 26 July 2012). For an investigation to be effective, those responsible for and carrying out the investigation must be independent and impartial, in law and in practice. This means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection with those implicated in the events but also a practical independence (see, for example, Kolevi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a01108/02, \u00a7 193, 5 November 2009). Moreover, the notion of an effective remedy in respect of an allegation of ill-treatment also entails effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (see Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 117).",

The case-file materials disclose no meaningful effort on their behalf to verify or disprove the applicant\u2019s account of events, including by thoroughly questioning him, organising confrontations or posing specific questions to the independent medical experts. Secondly, the investigation lacked independence, as in rejecting the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had been ill-treated by the Leninskyy police, the prosecution relied largely on the results of an internal investigation conducted by the Leninskyy police itself. Thirdly, the investigation was marked by various delays in communicating to the applicant and his lawyers the decisions taken, which significantly impeded their ability to take part in the investigation at issue and to lodge timely appeals. Delays were likewise present in the taking of evidence. For instance, the fact that the applicant had seven fractured ribs was not established until four months after his arrest, although he had complained about pain in the rib area as of the first medical assessment within twenty-four hours of his arrest. In the Court\u2019s view, the State authorities\u2019 failure to ensure that the applicant\u2019s injuries were comprehensively and thoroughly assessed immediately following his arrest and subsequently immediately following his complaints concerning ill-treatment by the police, as well as to question promptly all the parties involved, irretrievably prejudiced their ability to establish the relevant facts.",

Lithuania, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 100-101, ECHR 2001-VIII). Cases concerning allegations of inadequate conditions of detention do not lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in such instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations (see, for example, Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, \u00a7\u00a089, 23 July 2013). Accordingly, the Court is mindful that the applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Nevertheless, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide \u2013 to the greatest possible extent \u2013 some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a032362/02, \u00a7 45, 20 May 2010 and Ukhan v. Ukraine, no. 30628/02, \u00a7\u00a064, 18 December 2008).",

It also appears from the case file that the applicant received medical treatment for his pulmonary problems in the SIZO, as a result of which his state of health improved. His medical history does not indicate any lasting consequences of the hemothorax or pneumonia treated in the Odessa SIZO. As regards other health conditions, the applicant did not provide any details concerning the medical assistance received or denied. Regard being had to the general improvement of the applicant\u2019s health during his stay in the Odessa SIZO and lack of details in his description of his treatment sequence, it is not clear in which way the medical assistance provided to him in the Odessa SIZO fell short of Article 3 requirements.",

These allegations are denied by the Government and not supported by any evidence. Insofar as the public interest groups raised them before the domestic prosecutorial authorities on the applicant\u2019s behalf, he refused to pursue them (see paragraph 46 above).
