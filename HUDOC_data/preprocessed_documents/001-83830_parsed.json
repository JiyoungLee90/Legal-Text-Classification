The question which gave rise to the defamation action was put by the applicant on a television show. The show was broadcast live a mere four days ahead of the general and regional elections in  and hosted three prospective candidates who represented different political factions. Viewers were invited to contact the editors on the phone and put their questions to the candidates. Although the parties to the defamation proceedings disagreed on the actual wording of the question as it had been put by the applicant, it was undisputed that it referred to the tearing-off of the  flag from the car which had campaigned in support of Mrs Salchak, the Otechestvo party candidate. The incident had taken place somewhere near the campaign headquarters of the Edinstvo political movement, the main competitor of the Otechestvo party in the forthcoming elections. That matter had been an event of the first magnitude, for it appears that such an assault on the republican flag had happened for the first time in the region. The Court reiterates that, as a general rule, any opinions and information pertinent to elections, both local and national, which are disseminated during the electoral campaign should be considered as forming part of a debate on questions of public interest (see, for example, Kwiecie\u0144\u00a0v. , no.\u00a051744/99, \u00a7\u00a051, ECHR 2007...). According to its constant case-law, there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest and very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions (see, most recently, Krasulya\u00a0v. , no.\u00a012365/03, \u00a7\u00a038, 22\u00a0February 2007, with further references).",

The applicant was the presenter and channelled the questions, received from the audience and noted on pieces of paper, to the participants. The show was broadcast live on television, so the applicant had but a limited possibility of reformulating, refining or retracting any statements before they were made public (compare G\u00fcnd\u00fcz\u00a0v. , no.\u00a035071/97, \u00a7\u00a049, ECHR 2003XI; and Fuentes Bobo v.

The applicant had consistently denied making any such allegation; he only admitted to having specified, by way of clarification, that the incident had taken place near the Edinstvo campaign headquarters.

(an assistant to the head of the republican branch of the Edinstvo movement), Ms O.K. (a lawyer at the Edinstvo headquarters), Ms\u00a0B.I. (a receptionist at the Edinstvo headquarters), and Ms O.Ch. (an avowed Edinstvo supporter). The District Court accepted their statements as the basis of its findings of fact, holding that it had no grounds \u201cto doubt their objectivity\u201d. It did not address the reliability of those witnesses in the light of their apparent association with the Edinstvo movement. However, as regards the statements by the applicant's co-workers, it was precisely their connection with the defendant broadcasting company that prompted the District Court to reject their testimonies as unreliable, without any assessment of their individual credibility. That difference of treatment, for which the District Court's judgment did not give any satisfactory account, was still more prominent in its decision to reject the testimony of the show participant Mr P.A. on the ground that he had worked for Edinstvo's political competitor, but to accept the testimony of another participant, Mr\u00a0V.S., notwithstanding his position as an assistant to the head of the Edinstvo regional branch. The distinction drawn by the District Court between the two Edinstvo structures does not appear convincing to the Court as it was only a matter of internal organisation and had no bearing on the witness's continued political affiliation with Edinstvo. Furthermore, the District Court's decision to reject the statement by Ms\u00a0N.G., an independent and professional media observer, on the sole ground that it contradicted the testimonies of the Edinstvo-affiliated witnesses, likewise appears unpersuasive to the Court. In sum, the Court finds that the District Court failed to make an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts and give sufficient reasons for the finding that the applicant's question had contained an independent factual allegation against the plaintiffs.",

Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a statement as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Dyuldin and Kislov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a025968/02, \u00a7\u00a044, 31\u00a0July 2007, and the Supreme Court's case-law in paragraph 24 above).

The reasons on which this finding was premised do not appear sufficient to the Court. It notes, firstly, that no witness linked the allegation to any individual claimant. All of them spoke about a general feeling of indignation which the mentioning of the Edinstvo campaign headquarters in the context of the flag incident had aroused in them. In fact, it appears that the plaintiffs had also believed that it had been the campaign headquarters' \u2013 rather than their personal \u2013 reputation that had been affected. A clear indication of that conviction is the fact that the defamation claim had initially been filed by the Edinstvo political movement as a legal entity (see paragraph 10 above). However, once it transpired that under Russian law a legal entity would not be able to recover non-pecuniary damages, five individual members of the Edinstvo campaign headquarters stepped into the proceedings in their personal capacity (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). The District Court did not address the distinction between the reputation of the Edinstvo political movement and that of individual plaintiffs and allowed them to substitute themselves for the political movement without further inquiry. In these circumstances, the Court does not consider that the District Court gave \u201csufficient\u201d reasons for establishing an objective link between the statement in question and the individual claimants in the defamation action.",

The Court is not persuaded that the police report was a sufficient piece of evidence or indeed a relevant one. It is noted, firstly, that criminal liability may only arise in the event of desecration of the State flag of the  (see paragraph 25 above). Accordingly, in the instant case the accusation could not have entailed criminal prosecution even if it had been true (see, by contrast, Pedersen and Baadsgaard\u00a0v.\u00a0 [GC], no.\u00a049017/99, \u00a7\u00a080, ECHR 2004XI). Thus, the findings of the police inquiry were irrelevant. On a more general level, the Court reiterates its constant approach that the standard of proof for establishing the well-foundedness of a criminal charge can hardly be compared to that which ought to be observed by a journalist when expressing his opinion on a matter of public concern, as the standards applied when assessing someone's actions in terms of morality are quite different from those required for establishing an offence under criminal law (see, mutatis mutandis, Karman\u00a0v. , no.\u00a029372/02, \u00a7\u00a042, 14 December 2006; Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a028525/95, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002I; and Wirtschafts-Trend Zeitschriften-Verlags GmbH v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a058547/00, \u00a7\u00a039, 27 October 2005). This distinction is of direct relevance to the instant case, given that the flag incident was an event of major public concern and that by putting the question, the applicant merely solicited an assessment of that event by the show participants rather than made an affirmation. There could be no serious doubts about his good faith, as there is no indication that his intention was to accuse anyone of committing a criminal offence. Nor can he be criticised for a failure to verify the factual basis for the question, given the obvious constraints of a live television show where time was of essence. In any event, a representative of the Edinstvo political movement (Mr V.S.) was present among those show participants who had been invited to reply to the viewer's question, and he could have immediately dispelled any allegation which he considered to be untrue and presented his own version of the flag incident (compare G\u00fcnd\u00fcz, cited above, \u00a7 51, on counterbalancing of the applicant's statements by the intervention of other participants).",

A perusal of the Russian courts' judgments issued in the present case reveals that they failed to recognise that the case involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of the reputation or rights of others and therefore did not carry out the relevant balancing exercise (see Kwiecie\u0144, cited above, \u00a7\u00a052, and, by contrast, Keller v. Hungary (dec.), no.\u00a033352/02, 4 April 2006; and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, loc. cit.). Likewise, they did not take into consideration the crucial importance of free political debate in a democratic society in the context of free elections or the wider limits of criticism that politicians should be prepared to tolerate (see Malisiewicz-G\u0105sior v. Poland, no.\u00a043797/98, \u00a7 67, 6 April 2006, and Kwiecie\u0144, loc. cit.). Thus, the national authorities cannot be considered as having applied the standards embodied in Article 10 of the Convention and the Court's case-law.",

That the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature does not detract from the fact that the standards applied by the Russian courts were not compatible with the principles embodied in Article 10 since they did not adduce \u201crelevant\u201d and/or \u201csufficient\u201d reasons justifying the interference at issue. Therefore, the Court considers that the domestic courts overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation afforded to them for restrictions on debates of public interest and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",
