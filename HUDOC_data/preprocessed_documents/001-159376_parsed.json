Case-law development is not, in itself, contrary to the proper administration of justice, since failure to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk hindering reform or improvement (see Atanasovski v. \u201cthe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no.\u00a036815/03, \u00a7 38, 14 January 2010).",

In all other cases they accepted the claims as specified by the plaintiffs and reasoned that the Serbian authorities had indeed been responsible for the lives and safety of all persons residing in Kosovo until the actual transfer of effective control to KFOR in respect of each of the municipalities, considered separately (see paragraphs 10, 11, 17, 18, 22 and 23 above). The only exception in this regard was the judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation Rev. 1540/10 of 10 March 2010, but even this matter was subsequently resolved in favour of the plaintiffs, albeit after the intervention of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 24 above). As for the applicants themselves, they have also acknowledged that throughout the period in question the domestic courts predominantly ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, while the rejection of their claims was exceptional. It would appear, therefore, that the Serbian judiciary had, generally speaking, harmonised their case-law on the matter at the relevant time, but that as regards the applicants the courts had ruled against them. While this is obviously upsetting for the persons concerned, as already noted above, the possibility of conflicting court decisions is an inherent trait of any judicial system which is based on a network of trial and appeal courts with authority over a certain area. Such divergences may also arise within the same court. That in itself, however, cannot be considered to be in breach of the Convention.",

In particular, the municipal and district courts held that the respondent State could not be deemed liable, since it was up to KFOR to provide for the safety of all citizens of Kosovo from 9 June 1999 onwards. This approach, while at odds with the views expressed by the courts in other cases of this type, was certainly not untenable, particularly bearing in mind the somewhat vague national and/or international provisions that needed interpreting (see paragraph 6 above).",
