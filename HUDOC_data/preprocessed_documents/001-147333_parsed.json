Extradition may also be refused if exceptional circumstances disclose that it may entail a danger to the person\u2019s life and health on account of, among other things, his or her age or physical condition. Russian authorities dealing with an extradition case should examine whether there are reasons to believe that the person concerned may be sentenced to the death penalty, subjected to ill-treatment or persecuted because of his race, religious beliefs, nationality, ethnic or social origin or political opinions. The Supreme Court further stated that the courts should assess both the general situation in the requesting country and the personal circumstances of a person whose extradition is being sought. They should take into account the testimony of the person concerned and that of any witnesses, any assurances given by the requesting country, and information about the country provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, competent United Nations agencies and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.",

No evidence has been presented by the Government to demonstrate that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office made any effort to evaluate the risks of extradition to the country where, according to reputable international sources, the use of torture is commonplace and defence rights are habitually circumvented. Furthermore, the Deputy Prosecutor General\u2019s outright and unreserved reliance on the assurances provided by the Uzbek authorities was incompatible with the Court\u2019s established position that in themselves these assurances are not sufficient (see paragraph 134 above) and that the national authorities need to treat with caution the assurances against torture given by a State where torture is endemic or persistent (see Yuldashev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 1248/09, \u00a7\u00a085, 8 July 2010 with further references).

It is beyond doubt that promptness is a key factor in investigating a disappearance and suspected international abduction and for this reason, the period of six days spent by the law enforcement agencies in settling jurisdictional issues and transferring the case file was evidently excessive and demonstrated a lack of diligence on their part. In the Court\u2019s view, the delayed commencement of the inquiry resulted in a loss of precious time, which had a negative impact on the success of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Mikheyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7 114, 26 January 2006; Polonskiy v.

Despite the authorities\u2019 awareness of similar previous incidents, the investigation refused to entertain abduction as one of the possible theories for his disappearance, due to an alleged lack of evidence capable of substantiating it (see paragraph 75 above). The Court finds this approach of the investigative authorities disconcerting, since out of the five theories adopted by the investigation (see paragraph 73 above) there had seemingly been no evidence for the majority of them either. For example, while nothing in the material supplied by the parties indicates that the applicant was of poor health, his disappearance due to health-related reasons featured in two of the working theories of the investigation. By contrast, the applicant\u2019s abduction for forcible transfer purposes had not been adopted even as a working theory, despite falling within the factual pattern of other cases involving stayed extraditions to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the investigation in the applicant\u2019s case was excessively restrictive in its interpretation of the events and ignored certain valid and plausible accounts of the events.",

The Government did not provide any information, and the applicant\u2019s representatives alleged that there had effectively been no progress in the case. Under these circumstances, the Court must presume that after August 2013 the investigation stalled without any results being achieved, new actions planned or conclusions reached by the law enforcement agencies. No reasons were advanced by the respondent Government to justify this unexpected suspension of activities. Thus, despite the initial active approach of the investigative authorities, the Court concludes that the subsequent cessation of activities irreparably undermined the effectiveness of the investigation.",

The Ruling was considered as the tool allowing the judiciary to avoid such failings as those criticised in that judgment and further develop emerging domestic case-law that directly applies the Convention requirements through judicial practice. Despite finding in the present case that the Supreme Court itself fell short of applying its Ruling no. 11 of 14 June 2012 (see paragraph 157 above), the Court still maintains its opinion that a genuine and rigorous application of that Ruling by all Russian courts is capable of improving domestic remedies in extradition and expulsion cases.",
