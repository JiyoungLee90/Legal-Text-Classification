This implies the putting in place of effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October\u00a01998, \u00a7\u00a0115, Reports 1998VIII).",

This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. The mere fact that the authorities have been informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article\u00a02 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see,\u00a0for example, Railean v. Moldova, no. 23401/04, \u00a7\u00a028, 5 January 2010; Basyuk v. Ukraine, no.\u00a051151/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a056-57, 5 November 2015; and Igor Shevchenko v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056). This is not an obligation of results to be achieved but of means to be employed. The Court accepts that not every investigation is necessarily successful or comes to a conclusion coinciding with the claimant\u2019s account of events. However, it should, in principle, be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and, if the allegations prove to be true, to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Paul\u00a0and\u00a0Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a046477/99, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 2002II).",

More specifically, the exhumation conducted on 29\u00a0March 2012 fell short of the procedural requirements, and thus the court declared the results of the subsequent forensic medical examination inadmissible. Furthermore, since another exhumation was conducted on 6\u00a0May 2014, nearly three years after the incident, the subsequent forensic medical examination was unable to determine the cause of death, because the body was in an advanced state of decomposition. There is no indication that the substantive discrepancies between the expert forensic medical examinations \u2013 regarding the fact that the scene of the incident was covered with the blood of the applicants\u2019 daughter \u2013 were resolved.",
