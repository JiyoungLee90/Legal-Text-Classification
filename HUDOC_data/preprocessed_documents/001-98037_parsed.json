He described in detail the circumstances of his son's abduction by armed men in camouflage uniforms in several vehicles and pointed out that when the abductors had been stopped at the GAI station one of them had produced a special permit which had allowed the vehicles to pass without a check. The second applicant also stated that he had managed to find out that his son had been abducted by officers of the Ingushetia department of the FSB, the Chechnya department of the FSB and the Regional Department of the FSB in the North Caucuses; that he had been taken to the headquarters of the Ingushetia department of the FSB in Magas and put in a basement; that on the following day his son had been taken to the settlement of Khankala in Chechnya, where he was still detained. According to the second applicant, that information had been provided to him by officers of the above-mentioned departments of the FSB, who had asked him not to disclose their names; they had also told the second applicant that Bashir Mutsolgov had been subjected to beatings and torture and pressurised to confess to an unspecified crime. Lastly, he stressed that both he and the first applicant had experienced enormous suffering because of the lack of news about their son and the investigating authorities' failure to take any measures to find him or to identify the perpetrators.",

The applicants further stated that it was common knowledge that State agents participating in special operations always removed the number plates from their vehicles and insignia from their uniforms. As regards officer Ch., according to the Government's own submissions, eleven months after Ch.'s first interview the investigation had compiled a photofit image based on his description of the abductor.

Those minor differences in no way undermined the overall credibility and consistency of their submissions on the most important elements of the sequence of the events. In any event, it had been the task of the investigation to clarify those details and, by blaming the applicants for it, the Government unfairly shifted that task onto them.",

However it took the town prosecutor's office seven days to launch the investigation because during that period of time they were allegedly waiting for confirmation from the Ingushetiya department of the FSB as to whether officers of that authority had arrested the applicants' relative (see paragraph 68 above). The Court has already stressed in a similar situation that once the law-enforcement authorities are duly and promptly made aware of the disappearance, it is incumbent on them to organise cooperation between various State agencies in such a manner that would guarantee the effectiveness of the investigation (see Takhayeva and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a023286/04, \u00a7\u00a090, 18\u00a0September\u00a02008). Bearing this in mind, the Court is particularly struck by this laxity on the part of the town prosecutor's office at the critical time when urgent action was needed from them, having regard to the applicants' submission, uncontested by the Government, that upon receipt of the applicants' complaint about the abduction, the investigator, in the third applicant's presence, immediately called the Ingushetiya department FSB and received a reply to the same question which had allegedly prompted the seven-day delay in launching the investigation. Hence, the Court cannot agree with the Town Court's findings and considers that the investigating authorities failed to promptly commence the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event.",

The same holds true for the investigation's failure to take any steps to identify the abductors' vehicles, despite the existing information in that respect, and the delay in interviewing one of the key witnesses, M.B., particularly in the absence of a convincing explanation for those omissions put forward either by the Government or the domestic courts (see paragraph\u00a068 above).",

In this respect it cannot but observe that the grant of victim status to the third applicant appears to have had no bearing on his ability to have specific investigative measures carried out. Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicants did, in fact, complain to the courts about the alleged omissions of the investigation. Having examined the applicants' complaints, the domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction dismissed their submissions and upheld the decision to suspend the investigation, for reasons which the Court found hard to accept. In any event, the effectiveness of the investigation was undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take necessary and urgent investigative measures, such as identifying and interviewing a number of eyewitnesses or inspecting the crime scene. Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of occurred, it is doubtful whether those investigative measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could usefully be conducted. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor's office.

To assess this evidence the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0161).",

However, the exact way in which he died and whether he was subjected to ill-treatment while in detention are not entirely clear and the information at the Court's disposal does not permit it to establish to the requisite standard of proof whether Bashir Mutsolgov was subjected to ill-treatment after his arrest. As to the alleged use of force against him during the arrest, the Court considers that the witness statements available to it are not consistent in that respect and do not contain conclusive evidence to support the applicants' allegations (see paragraph 9 above, and compare Bazorkina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0132). Furthermore, the Court has doubts that the abductors' alleged actions attained the threshold of severity required by Article 3 (see ibid). In sum, the material in the case file does not lay down an evidentiary basis sufficient to enable the Court to find \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the applicants' relative was subjected to ill-treatment during or after his abduction on 18\u00a0December 2003.",

The applicants have had no news of Bashir\u00a0Mutsolgov for over six years. Throughout this period they have applied to various bodies with enquiries about his fate.
