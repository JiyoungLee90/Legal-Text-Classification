Having regard to the findings of expert H., the court was convinced that the applicant had reduced mental capacities which had been caused by infantile brain damage. This damage, combined with failings in his upbringing (he had repeatedly been hit by his father with a stick himself), had caused a consciousness disorder and the sadistic sexual tendencies the applicant had disclosed in his offence. These disorders amounted to an \u201cother serious mental abnormality\u201d for the purposes of Articles 20 and 21 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 26-27 below). Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of the applicant\u2019s personality revealed that, as a result of his condition and notably the sadistic tendencies which had manifested themselves in the offence of which he was found guilty, he could be expected to commit further unlawful acts and was therefore dangerous to the general public.",

It appeared that it had not been possible to continuously pursue sex therapy with the applicant during his long psychiatric internment. There was a risk that, if the applicant were overstrained or frustrated, he might commit offences as a result of sadistic tendencies. The expert stated, however, that it was impossible for him to assess how far the applicant was still driven by sadistic fantasies.

After the applicant had failed in his attempts to complete a sex therapy course on a number of occasions, the Lippstadt Psychiatric Hospital authorities decided to discontinue attempts at sex therapy for some time. The applicant was transferred to the so-called \u201clong-stay\u201d department of the hospital in 2006, where he was detained during the time covered by the proceedings at issue and where he did not undergo any sex therapy. The purpose of the applicant\u2019s placement in the \u201clong-stay\u201d department was in fact to grant him a break from his failed attempts to complete sex therapy. He was being prepared for another attempt at completing sex therapy in psychotherapeutic one-to-one meetings with a psychologist. However, he had repeatedly declined offers to restart such individual or group therapy.",
