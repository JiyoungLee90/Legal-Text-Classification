In my opinion, all of the arguments used by the Court in paragraph 37 of the judgment reflect a violation of the right enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, namely the right to have one's civil rights determined within a reasonable time. The Court in paragraph 37 based its analysis on factors \u2013 such as the period of time which elapsed from the moment of bringing the civil action to claim LTL 749,847 and the date of the final decision in that case; the absence of complexity; the domestic courts' disputes in determining the jurisdictional question and establishing appropriate respondents; and no lack of diligence on the part of the applicant \u2013 which, under the above-mentioned principles as developed by the Court, must be assessed when analysing the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the length of proceedings. Accordingly, I have departed in this case from my colleagues' decision not to examine separately the merits of the claim under Article 6 \u00a7 1 with regard to the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the length of proceedings since, in my opinion, there has been a separate violation of this provision.",

In my opinion, the Court should placed greater emphasis on the most important aspect of the applicant's claims, namely the fact that he could not obtain adequate compensation, at least the value of the auction proceeds, for a prolonged period of time. In my opinion, this aspect contains two different elements. Firstly, it should be remembered that the applicant was awarded LTL 590,056.05 in pecuniary damages by the decision of the Supreme Court of Lithuania of 26 May 2006 (see paragraphs 23 and 24 of the judgment). The question to be determined is whether, in these particular circumstances, the deduction of the total amount of the auction expenses (LTL 132,325.95) from the sum awarded to the applicant is to be regarded as a disproportionate and excessive burden, placed solely on the applicant even after his final acquittal. In my opinion, this question should be answered in the affirmative, despite the fact that the State was acting as an honest acquirer in the case, and had had legitimate grounds to start an investigation and the right to require compensation for the expenses incurred in maintaining the property, in line with the Civil Code of Lithuania. Ultimately, however, the applicant was acquitted of the criminal charges brought against him. This crucial factor should have led the State to reconsider and to agree to pay at least some of the auction expenses, which have now been placed solely on the applicant's shoulders.",

                        "content": "6. Secondly, my main problem in this case relates to the interest paid to the applicant for only 20 days (see paragraph 26 of the judgment). I cannot agree with the domestic courts' evaluation concerning the period for which the State was liable to pay interest. I accept the argument that the State is obliged to pay interest only from the date on which the fact of unjust enrichment became known. However, I do not share the domestic courts' conclusion that this date was 26 May 2006, when the Supreme Court of Lithuania adopted a decision under which compensation for the seized mink furs was to be paid to the applicant. In my opinion, the starting point was the day of the applicant's final acquittal. It should be noted that certain contradictions may be observed in the reasoning of the domestic courts. On the one hand, the Supreme Court of Lithuania, in its decision of 12 October 2007 (see paragraph 26 of the judgment) upholding the decisions of the lower courts, clearly stated that, in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure, the confiscated goods should be returned to the acquitted person after his acquittal. It further added that, as an honest acquirer of the auction proceeds, the State could not be liable to pay interest \u201cuntil the end of the criminal proceedings\u201d. On the other hand, the State was deemed an honest acquirer, even after the applicant's acquittal. Consequently, an issue arises, namely the fact that the applicant was acquitted in January 1997 but the State was deemed an honest acquirer even after that date, until the issue of compensation for the auction proceeds was resolved by the civil courts approximately nine years later. In my opinion, this means that the applicant should have been paid interest for the whole period from his acquittal on 30\u00a0January 1997 until the compensation for the seized mink furs was actually paid to him (20 days after the decision of the Supreme Court of Lithuania was adopted on 26 May 2006).",
