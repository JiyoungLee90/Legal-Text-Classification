Several witnesses were questioned, the crime scene was inspected, and numerous requests were forwarded to various law-enforcement authorities in different regions of the Northern Caucasus. However, after having taken the initial necessary measures to solve the crime, the investigators became inactive and failed to follow up on important investigating leads by questioning the officers who had been on duty at the \u201cVolga-20\u201d checkpoint on 14 June 2004 (see paragraph 47 above) or requesting the Chechen lawenforcement authorities to confirm the identity and the service documents of captain V.K., who had crossed the checkpoint on that day and had been driving a vehicle matching the description of the abductors' cars (see paragraph 49 above). In addition, without having taken a number of other investigating measures (see paragraph 55 above) the prosecutor's office suspended the investigation for almost 3 years and 6 months (see paragraphs 54-55 above) and resumed it only after the communication of the application by the Court. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious matter (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7\u00a094, ECHR 2004XII).",

The applicant contended that she had in fact applied to the domestic courts, but this remedy had been ineffective (see paragraph 58 above). Without deciding on the credibility of either version, the Court notes the effectiveness of the criminal investigation had already been undermined in its early stages by the authorities' failure to take the necessary and urgent investigative measures. Moreover, even assuming that the examination of the applicant's complaint by the district court would have led to the resumption of the investigation, this procedural measure would not have produced any tangible results for the applicant, taking into account that by then the investigation had been pending for almost three years. Further, it is clear that the investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, in spite of the fact that not all of the possible investigative measures had been taken to identify the perpetrators. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor's office. Accordingly, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicant's failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
