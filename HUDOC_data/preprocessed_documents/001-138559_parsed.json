It had been established in the case that the HVCA had learned of the breaches of the law by those transactions on 3\u00a0July 2000, from the report by the SAO. Accordingly, when lodging its claim for the annulment of the land lease decision and the decision to sell the plot of land to Galina Bogdel, the HVCA had not missed the three-year statutory deadline. In the view of the Supreme Court, it would have been unreasonable to calculate the term of statutory limitation from 10\u00a0February 1995, the date when the land was sold to Galina Bogdel, because when the counties had been created [in 1995] the administration of each county had not been entrusted with the task of reviewing all the administrative decisions and contracts which the municipalities falling under its competence had adopted or concluded in the past.",

Secondly, the applicants maintained that their spouse and mother, Galina Bogdel, had been an honest acquirer: neither she nor the applicants had ever committed any breach of the law. It was therefore unfair for the applicants to bear responsibility for the mistakes of the municipal institutions, which, moreover, should have known the applicable laws at the time of the transaction. On this last point the applicants referred to the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that if a mistake was made by the authorities themselves, without any fault on the part of a third party, a different proportionality approach must be taken in determining whether the burden borne by an applicant was excessive (see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, \u00a7\u00a073, 15\u00a0September 2009). They also argued that the mistakes or errors of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the defendant. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authorities must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, \u00a7 50, 24 May 2007).",

On the contrary, in every case many other aspects had to be evaluated, for example, how the State property was used and whether it was in the public interest. In this connection, they submitted that most of the neighbouring plots of land in Karaim\u0173 Street in Trakai had been privatised by private persons who used them for economic and commercial activities. The applicants then challenged the pertinence of the territorial planning scheme in respect of Trakai old town, maintaining that their plot was no different from neighbouring plots and thus had no exceptional importance. The fact that after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the State had leased that particular plot of land to them for eighty-seven years confirmed that ownership of the plot by the applicants and its use as a caf\u00e9 would not conflict with any public interest.",

That being so, there was a genuine and clear legitimate interest in having the plot returned to the State\u2019s ownership: the impugned plot of land was located in an urban heritage area, a territory subject to the strictest legal protection and which was of unique cultural and historic value, situated in the heart of one of the most unique areas of cultural and historical heritage in Lithuania, the Trakai Historical National Park, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court in its decisions of 14\u00a0March\u00a02006 and 9 February 2010 (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Moreover, the existence of a public interest was perfectly illustrated by the fact that the initiative for the annulment of the land purchase agreement had come not from the State authorities, but from the residents of Trakai town themselves, who were concerned that the historic old town was being destroyed (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). In this context the Government also relied on the reasoning of the Court\u2019s judgment in Moskal (cited above, \u00a7 73) to the effect that public authorities should not be prevented from correcting their mistakes, even those resulting from their own negligence, because holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment.",

Most importantly, after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the HVCA had granted the applicants\u2019 request and leased them the same plot of land for a period of eighty-seven years. That meant that the applicants had never been precluded from exercising their commercial activity on that land. It was also noteworthy that after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the appellate and cassation courts had ordered full restitution, and the applicants had received the sum of LTL 2,874 which Galina Bogdel had paid for the plot. Given that the applicants had not questioned the adequacy of that sum in their appeal on points of law, it had to be considered that the sum was fair. Lastly, if the applicants considered that the sum was too low, it had been and still was open to them to seek damages from the State under Article 6.271 of the Civil Code.",

In this connection the Court reiterates the particular importance of the principle of \u201cgood governance\u201d.

However, the need to correct an old \u201cwrong\u201d should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority\u2019s action in good faith (see, mutatis mutandis, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a036548/97, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2002VIII). In other words, State authorities which fail to put in place or adhere to their own procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations (see Lelas v. Croatia, no.\u00a055555/08, \u00a7 74, 20 May 2010). The risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Pincov\u00e1 and Pinc, cited above, \u00a7\u00a058; Gashi v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a032457/05, \u00a7 40, 13 December 2007; and Trgo v.

Once the auditors had confirmed breaches of the law with regard to the privatisation of the State\u2019s land, the HVCA started court proceedings within months (see paragraphs 14-20 above). Above all, the Court cannot find that the earlier mistakes of the Trakai municipality were remedied at the expense of the applicants. Firstly, immediately after the land lease agreements and land purchase agreement were annulled by the Supreme Court, at the applicants\u2019 request the HVCA leased the same plot to the applicants for a fairly long period \u2013 eighty-seven years. The Court also notes that the appellate and cassation courts applied a double restitution procedure and that even though the plot of land was returned to the State\u2019s ownership, the applicants received the sum of LTL 2,874 which Galina Bogdel had paid for the plot. Lastly, the Court takes note of the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants have continuously remained the owners of the caf\u00e9 built on the plot of land and have continued to be able to use that property. That being so, and observing that the applicants indeed did not dispute the adequacy of the sum they received before the Supreme Court, the Court finds that the applicants were fairly compensated for the Trakai municipality\u2019s authorities\u2019 mistakes in privatising that plot of land in 1994-5 (see, by converse implication, Maksymenko and Gerasymenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 49317/07, \u00a7 67, 16 May 2013).

Accordingly, the principle of equality of arms required that the same interpretation of the above-mentioned provision be applied both in cases where the claimant was a private entity and when the claimant was the State, represented by its officials or institutions. However, the domestic courts\u2019 decisions showed two different results in civil cases: when examining claims submitted by private entities, the limitation period for challenging the validity of a contract was considered to begin on the date when the parties became aware that the contract had been concluded (see paragraph\u00a036 above), and when deciding claims lodged by State authorities, the courts took as the starting-point the date when the claimant had been provided with sufficient data to prove that a particular legal act or transaction was against the law, as in the case in issue (see paragraph 34 above).",

They noted, firstly, that under Lithuanian law the limitation period started to run on the date on which the right to bring a civil action became enforceable, that is, the date when the person became aware of the violation of his right. That reasoning had been confirmed by the Supreme Court on a number of occasions (see paragraph 35 above). Similarly, when a case had been brought before a court in order for a public interest to be protected, the commencement of the limitation period was to be held to be the date when the claimant was provided with sufficient data to prove that a public interest had been violated (see paragraph 34 above).",

However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. It is also noteworthy that limitation periods are a common feature of the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States. They serve several important purposes, namely to ensure legal certainty and finality, protect potential defendants from stale claims which might be difficult to counter, and prevent the injustice which might arise if courts were required to decide upon events which took place in the distant past on the basis of evidence which might have become unreliable and incomplete because of the passage of time (see, mutatis mutandis, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).",

This reasoning runs counter to the majority\u2019s other argument that the aim of the annulment of the contract was to \u201cprotect cultural and historical heritage\u201d. In their capacity as lessees, the applicants were entitled to use the plot of land in question in the same way as they would have done had they been its proper owners. In fact, as the majority themselves underlined, since the annulment of the land purchase contract, \u201cthe applicants have continuously remained the owners of the caf\u00e9 built on the plot of land and have continued to be able to use that property\u201d. The Government themselves admitted that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s property right to the caf\u00e9 situated in the land plot at issue remained unchanged\u201d and that \u201cin reality the applicants were never precluded (and are not precluded at present) to continue in exercising their commercial activity in the cafe owned by them, which is constructed in the land plot at issue\u201d. But by renting out the plot of land to the applicants for a period of eighty-seven years after the annulment of the land purchase contract, the administration was implicitly admitting that the use of the plot of land for the commercial exploitation of a caf\u00e9 was not in conflict with any public interest. Hence, it is contradictory to maintain at the same time that the annulment of the purchase of the land was necessary to protect the public interest and avoid its use for commercial purposes, but that the public interest is compatible with the lease of that same land and its future commercial use in the exact same way as that in which it had been used in the past.",

In fact, the majority did not dispute, and even accepted, the Supreme Court\u2019s argument that the administrative reorganisation of the State and the creation of new territorial entities were sufficient grounds on which to justify the restarting of the statutory limitation period for the benefit of the administration.",

This is the common rule established by law and any exception to this rule must be provided for by statute (see Article 1127 of the Civil Code and Article 86 of the previous Civil Code of 1964). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has made a different interpretation of the domestic legal norms as to the calculation of the limitation period when applied to actions brought by the administration. According to this interpretation, the limitation period only starts running at the time when the administration is \u201cprovided with sufficient data to prove that the public interest was breached\u201d. Applying this interpretation to the present case, the Supreme Court concluded that the limitation period started running neither from the date of signature of the land purchase agreement by the applicants (10 February 1995), nor from the time of the creation of new administrative entities (an undetermined date in 1995), but from the moment when the authorities of those new administrative entities were provided with evidence about the unlawfulness of the land purchase agreement, that is, 3 July 2000, the date when the National Audit Office allegedly found out about the breach of the legislation.",

                        "content": "Firstly, we note that this interpretation has no express legal basis. It results from creative case-law of the Supreme Court, reflected in its ruling of 28 April 2010. Since this interpretation creates an exception to the general rule established in Article 1127 of the Civil Code and Article 86 of the previous Civil Code of 1964, it should have an express basis in law, but that is not the case. Secondly, this interpretation is at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s own interpretation of the subjective and objective requirements of statutory limitation, because it does not apply the objective criterion for the calculation of such periods (\u201cshould have become aware\u201d) to the administration and its officials and representatives. The administration is bound to act according to the law and refrain from committing any unlawful acts. Administrative entities and their officials and representatives are obliged to verify, in the performance of their functions, whether their acts are in accordance with the law, on pain of disciplinary, civil and possibly criminal liability. If the limitation period did not start running for the administration when its officials and representatives should have become aware of the unlawfulness of their acts, this would promote negligence and disrespect for the rule of law among administrative officials and representatives. Thirdly, the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation referred to above creates an unjustified benefit for the administration which can prolong indefinitely any time bar, allowing the courts to proceed with an annulment claim by the administration even though a private party\u2019s claim would have been left without examination in similar circumstances. In other words, the pure inertia of the administration, even in cases where it is aware or should have been aware of the unlawfulness of administrative acts and contracts, does not trigger the starting date for the limitation period, as long as no evidence (\u201csufficient data\u201d) of the said unlawfulness is presented to it. That interpretation of domestic law, allowing the administration to challenge a contract between the administration and a private party despite the expiry of the general limitation period, albeit valid for the private party, is clearly contrary to the principle of legal certainty protected by Article 6 of the Convention.",

The limitation period for an action seeking to have that contract annulled was three years under Article\u00a084 of the 1964 Civil Code then in force, as the Supreme Court itself affirmed, bearing in mind that the rules which were in force at the time when the period started running are applicable. This leads to the conclusion that as of 18 January 1998 there was no legal basis whatsoever on which to file for the annulment of the contract of purchase and therefore the interference with the applicants\u2019 property right was unlawful.",

Firstly, Lithuanian law did not provide at the relevant time, and still does not, for any cause of suspension or interruption of the limitation period for the annulment of administrative contracts by virtue of any succession of the parties to the contract. Secondly, the counties were created by legislation of 1995 prior to the time when it became impossible to annul the purchase contract on any grounds, that is, 18 January 1998. The new administrative entities had the duty to review the pending contracts since they succeeded the former administrative entities and therefore inherited their contractual position and obligations in respect of all contracts entered into by the former administrative entities. Hence, the new administrative entities, through their competent institutions and officials, should have acted promptly and instituted court proceedings in order to quash the alleged unlawful municipal decisions and land purchase contract in good time. Thirdly, the change in the law on the powers of review and inspection of administrative decisions and contracts between the administration and private parties is an internal matter of the State as a single entity, and therefore cannot in any way change the mode of calculation of the limitation period. Public authorities which fail to abide by their own rules of internal organisation and procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations.",

A period of six years of inertia on the part of the administration is clearly excessive. That was so in the present case, since the land purchase contract was signed in 1995 and the proceedings for its annulment only started in 2001, well beyond the statutory three-year deadline established for that purpose.",

In other words, it was the total lack of diligence on the part of the administration on 18 January 1995 and 10 February 1995, and in the consecutive years, that allowed for the consolidation of an alleged unlawful transaction between the administration and a bona fide private party. In fact, it was only on the initiative of some private persons that the administration started to investigate the said transaction many years after it was agreed. To count the starting date of the limitation period as 3 July 2000, when allegedly the National Audit Office found out about the breach of the legislation, or as 6 October 2000, when allegedly the Trakai District Municipality Audit Office reached that same conclusion in another autonomous investigation, would be tantamount to rewarding the negligence and inertia of the administration and punishing a bona fide private party. Having ignored the statutory limitation period of three years, and remedied an allegedly unlawful administrative decision and contract at the expense of the individuals concerned, the national authorities breached the principle of legal certainty enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention.",

The miscalculation of the limitation period by the public authorities of the respondent State not only infringed the principle of legal certainty, but also negated the applicants\u2019 property right. For these reasons, we are of the opinion that there has been a violation of both Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 of the Convention in the present case.",
