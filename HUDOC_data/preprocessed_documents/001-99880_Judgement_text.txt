The case originated in an application (no. 609/07) against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by six Albanian nationals, Mr Refat Puto, Ms Violeta Puto, Ms Saime Puto, Mr Pandi Allabashi, Ms Ermira Allabashi and Ms Roza Allabashi (“the applicants”), on 16 November 2006.
The applicants were represented by Ms S. Puto, a lawyer practising in Tirana. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agent, Ms S. Meneri.
The applicants alleged that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards the lengthy non-enforcement of a final court decision. They also relied on Article 13 in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards the lack of an effective remedy and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as regards a disproportionate interference with their right to property.
On 14 February 2008 the President of the Section to which the case was allocated decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
On 24 July 2008 the President of the Section ruled, pursuant to Rule 38 § 1 of the Rules of Court, that the Government's observations should not be included in the case file for consideration by the Court since they had been submitted outside the time-limit and neither an extension of time had been requested, nor had any reasons been given by the Government for non-compliance with the time-limit.
On 2 September 2008 the applicants submitted their observations together with their claims for just satisfaction, to which the Government responded.
The applicants were born in 1930, 1933, 1928, 1925, 1957 and 1959 respectively and live in Albania and .
On 22 June 1994 the Commission on Restitution and Compensation of Properties (Komisioni i Kthimit dhe Kompensimit të Pronave - “the Commission”) recognised the applicants' property title over a plot of land and a building on the land. As reconstruction works which had started on an unspecified date before 1990 had not been completed, the building had become uninhabitable. For that reason, the Commission also awarded damages to the applicants in the amount of 997,230 Albanian leks (“ALL”).
The applicants contested the amount of damages awarded by the Commission. On 14 March 1995 the Saranda District Court, relying on an expert report, awarded the applicants damages in the amount of ALL 4,600,000, approximately 33,065 euros (“EUR”). That judgment became final on 14 April 1995.
In a letter dated 11 November 1998, the Ministry of Finance informed the applicants that joint guidelines had to be issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice concerning the enforcement of judicial decisions that had an impact on the State budget.
On 25 May 2000 the Saranda District Court issued an execution writ in respect of its 1995 judgment.
In a letter of 5 July 2000 the Ministry of Finance informed the applicants that they were to be compensated by means of State bonds.
In a letter of 7 November 2002 Mr Refat Puto requested the Saranda Bailiff's Office to execute the District Court's judgment.
In response to the applicants' letter, the Ministry of Justice's General Director for the Bailiff's Office requested the Saranda Bailiff's Office on 16 February 2002 to enforce the District Court's judgment. A similar letter was sent by the General Directorate of the Bailiff's Office to the Saranda's Bailiff's Office on 7 April 2004.
On 22 October 2005 and 3 March 2006 the applicants sent two letters to the Ministry of Justice. No response had been received by the date on which the application was introduced with this Court.
In their comments to the applicants' claims for just satisfaction, the Government submitted that on 25 April 2002 the applicants had sold the plot of land and the building thereon to third parties. The sale contract, concluded by a notary deed, was submitted in support.
By a letter of 4 July 2008 the Saranda Office for the Registration of Immovable Property (Zyra Vendore e Regjistrimit te Pasurive te Paluajtshme Sarande) certified that the applicants' property had been transferred to third parties by virtue of the sale contract of 25 April 2002.
