However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see, for instance, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

It cannot but note that the sentence imposed on the applicant by the Court of Appeal was in reality shorter than the period that she had spent in pre-trial detention (four years and nearly six months). That practice, i.e. of holding an accused in pre-trial detention for a period which practically corresponds or, as in the present case, is longer than the sentence subsequently imposed on him/her is, in the Court's view, questionable. In this respect, it recalls that continuation of detention cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (Letellier v.

Poland, no.\u00a028904/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 4\u00a0October 2005) and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention (see, Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7 37). It is also accepted that in such cases, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present concerning organised criminal gangs, the risk that a detainee, if released, might bring pressure to bear on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is by the nature of things often particularly high.",
