As regards the issue of exhaustion, the Government explained that while the applicant had complained to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Ministry of the Interior of his and the second applicant\u2019s unlawful detention and of violence having been used against them by the police officers, he had never actually raised the issue of the alleged failure on the part of the police officers to allow his hospitalisation for surgical treatment in due time. In any event, the applicant had never challenged the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers before the courts. The Government further submitted that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegations: the medical assessment and the statements by hospital doctors submitted by the applicant to the  date from 2003 but had never been submitted to the domestic courts. Besides, the evidence in question had, to a large extent, been based on the applicant\u2019s own account of events, had appeared long after the circumstances complained of and had been drawn up by doctors practicing in the Volgograd Region and not in Saransk, where the applicant had undergone the operation. The Government stressed that the domestic courts had not found the applicant\u2019s surgery to have been caused by the actions of the police officers. The Government were unable to produce the records of the applicant\u2019s examinations by ambulance doctors between 15\u00a0September and 18\u00a0September 1999 requested by the Court, the relevant documents having been destroyed on 9\u00a0January 2005 and 3 July 2006 due to the expiration of the time-limit for their storage.",

The rule is based on the assumption that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system, whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated into national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0December 1976, \u00a7\u00a048, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a024). At the same time, it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available both in theory and in practice at the relevant time \u2013 that is to say, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Selmouni v.\u00a0France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-V, and Mifsud v. France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7\u00a015, ECHR 2002-VIII). The Court further reiterates that the domestic remedies must be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 158, ECHRXI).",

For instance, in the case of Buzychkin v. Russia the Court found that as the applicant was no longer held in the detention facility where it was alleged that no adequate medical assistance had been made available to him, a civil claim for damages was capable of providing redress in respect of his complaint and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Buzychkin v. Russia, no.\u00a068337/01, \u00a7\u00a083, 14\u00a0October 2008). The Court further notes that in the case of Gladkiy v. Russia (no.\u00a03242/03, 21\u00a0December 2010) the applicant brought civil proceedings against a detention facility and the Ministry of Finance, seeking compensation for damage resulting from a denial of access to adequate medical services, and the Government did not voice any objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies by the applicant.
