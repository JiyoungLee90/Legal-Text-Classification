The case originated in an application (no. 28381/12) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Mr Duarte José Trigo Saraiva (“the applicant”), on 12 April 2012.
The applicant was represented by Mr J. J. F. Alves, a lawyer practising in Matosinhos (Portugal). The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms. M. F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy-Attorney General.
On 17 October 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Matosinhos.
On 27 October 2004 the Union for Tax Workers (Sindicato dos Trabalhadores dos Impostos) brought an administrative action against the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the applicant and three other employees regarding their early retirement before the Administrative and Fiscal Court of Lisbon (domestic proceedings no. 2594/04.2BELSB).
The Administrative and Fiscal Court of Lisbon dismissed the action on 20 October 2005. The Union appealed to the Central Administrative Court of the South.
On 27 March 2008, the Central Administrative Court of the South reversed the first instance decision and ordered the Ministry of Finance to revoke the contested administrative Act which had not accepted the early retirement and to proceed with a new evaluation of the applicant’s request.
On 29 December 2008 the Union started enforcement proceedings against the Ministry of Finance before the Administrative Court of Lisbon.
On 31 May 2012 the Administrative Court of Lisbon dismissed the action.
