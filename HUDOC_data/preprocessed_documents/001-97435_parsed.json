However, these groups reported that prisoners did not receive adequate food or warm clothing and were often denied a bed, sheets, change of clothes, and restroom privileges.

A few weeks earlier, the Belarusian authorities had finally given their consent to the opening of an infopoint on the Council of Europe in , an idea initiated by the Assembly itself and developed by the Slovak Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers. The opening ceremony of the Infopoint took place in June 2009.",

Firstly, the parliamentary elections of September 2008 were a missed opportunity for a decisive change towards democracy, as they failed to meet European standards of freedom and fairness. As highlighted by the OSCE/ODIHR, serious shortcomings affected all stages of the electoral process, from the availability of pluralist information for voters to the lack of transparency of the vote count. These shortcomings inevitably cast a doubt over the representativeness of the present Parliament, where no single opposition candidate managed to gain a seat. It is, however, to be welcomed that, following the final OSCE/ODIHR assessment, the Belarusian authorities agreed to work with the OSCE/ODIHR on the reform of the country's electoral legal framework and practice, in order to align them with ' OSCE commitments.",

It takes note, however, of the numerous statements emanating from the Belarusian leadership on their willingness to ensure that the new media law is not implemented in such a way as to restrict freedom of expression.

In cases such as the present the Court must examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the applicant to the receiving country, bearing in mind the general situation there and his personal circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 October 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0215, \u00a7\u00a0108 in fine). To that end, as regards the general situation in a particular country, the Court has often attached importance to the information contained in recent reports from independent international human-rights-protection associations such as Amnesty International, or governmental sources, including the US State Department (see, for example, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100; M\u00fcslim v. Turkey, no. 53566/99, \u00a7\u00a067, 26\u00a0April 2005; Said v. the Netherlands, no. 2345/02, \u00a7 54, 5\u00a0July 2005; Al-Moayad v.\u00a0Germany (dec.), no. 35865/03, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, 20\u00a0February 2007; and Saadi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0143-146, 28\u00a0February 2008). At the same time, it has held that the mere possibility of ill-treatment on account of an unsettled situation in the receiving country does not in itself give rise to a breach of Article 3 (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0111, and Fatgan Katani and Others\u00a0v. Germany (dec.), no. 67679/01, 31 May 2001) and that, where the sources available to it describe a general situation, an applicant's specific allegations in a particular case require corroboration by other evidence (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 73, ECHR\u00a02005I).",
