Since it had not appeared that, in addition to belonging to one of the \u201crisk categories\u201d, any other special circumstances existed which could give rise to the assumption that the Sri Lankan authorities wished to apprehend the applicant, he was not eligible for residence in the Netherlands. As regards the applicant's argument that the Deputy Minister of Justice ought to have sought the advice of the Ministry's Medical Adviser to have his scars examined, it was held that such a step would only have been called for if doubts existed as to the truthfulness of the applicant's account, which was not the case.

If he was arrested and detained for a second time, he would certainly not be treated well or released after only a few days.

In UNHCR's view, the presence of torture-related scars on the body of a returnee should be a relevant consideration in assessing the likelihood of danger upon the return of Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers.

The most significant of these factors were an inability to produce identity papers, a failure to register with the police or to provide a valid reason for his or her stay in Colombo, the presence of scars, or nervous or frightened behaviour suggestive of LTTE involvement. Bearing in mind that there had been no large-scale round-ups in Colombo since the summer of 2001, and that after the CFA took effect not a single report had been received of Tamils arrested in Colombo after being stopped and asked for their identity papers at a checkpoint, the risk of arrest must now be deemed to have declined considerably.

However, in exercising their right to expel such aliens, Contracting States must have regard to Article 3 of the Convention which enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic societies. The expulsion of an alien may give rise to an issue under this provision where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if expelled, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In such circumstances, Article\u00a03 implies an obligation not to expel the individual to that country (see, for example, Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2001-II, and Ahmed v.

Further, since the nature of the Contracting States' responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the expulsion (see Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, 30\u00a0October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 36, \u00a7\u00a0107, and H.L.R. v.

He was nevertheless arrested and detained by the army on suspicion of being an LTTE supporter, tortured and ill-treated, and confronted with an informant. Not having been recognised by the informant, he was released without charge two days later. In view of the fact that he was also issued with the requested travel pass, the Court considers it unlikely that the army were aware of the applicant's activities for the LTTE or that a file drawn up on the applicant would contain a mention of any suspicion of involvement in the LTTE. In these circumstances, the Court finds that it has not been established that the applicant is known to the authorities as a (suspected) LTTE supporter and that, therefore, they would have an interest in him. The Court is further not persuaded that the applicant's failure to return from Colombo within the prescribed one-week period would have resulted in him being regarded with suspicion by the authorities.",

In this connection, the Court has noted the considerable improvement in the development of the security situation in Sri Lanka in recent years as set out in various reports referred to in paragraphs 41-43 and 46-48 above. The Court thus observes that, for some time now, no round-ups and no large-scale and/or arbitrary arrests of Tamils have taken place and that Tamils no longer require prior permission before travelling to certain areas (see paragraphs 41-42 and 47 above). In addition, the fact that a person bears scars does not, by itself, engender an increased risk of suspicion of LTTE-involvement, of arrest or of detention longer than 48 to 72 hours (see paragraphs 45 and 52 above). It is further reported that persons who are arrested on suspicion of membership of, or involvement in, the LTTE are not subjected to ill-treatment and torture as has occurred in the past (see paragraph 42 above).",

As pointed out above (paragraph 63), the Court has to assess whether at the present time and in the present situation there exists a real risk of the applicant being subjected to treatment proscribed by Article\u00a03 if he was returned to his country of origin. Whilst stability and certainty are factors to be taken into account in the Court's assessment of the situation in the receiving country, the fact that peace negotiations have not yet been successfully concluded does not preclude the Court from examining the individual circumstances of the applicant in the light of the current general situation (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, \u00a7 108).",
