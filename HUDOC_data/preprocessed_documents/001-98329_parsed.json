When the applicant refused, on 14\u00a0June 2002, to stay voluntarily in hospital, at noon the same day a psychiatric panel had examined him and found that his condition warranted further hospitalisation. According to the Government, the hospital administration had been unable to file the application for judicial authorisation for the applicant's continued hospitalisation on the same day because of the substantial amount of time necessary to prepare such an application. As 14\u00a0June 2002 was a Friday, it had not been possible to apply to the court during the weekend since it was closed. Accordingly, the application had been filed on 17\u00a0June 2002, that is the first working day after the weekend of 15 and 16\u00a0June 2002. The Government opined that the hospital had acted in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure, notably Article\u00a0108 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the , which permitted such a delay in lodging an application should the prescribed time-limit expire on a non-working day.",
