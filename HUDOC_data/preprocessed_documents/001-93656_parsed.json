It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legalaid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legalaid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III KZ 139/99).

The manner in which Article 6 is applied to proceedings before courts of appeal depends on the special features of the proceedings involved, and account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein (see Ekbatani v.\u00a0Sweden, judgment of 26\u00a0May 1988, Series A no.\u00a0134, \u00a7\u00a027, and Monnell and Morris v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).\u00a0\u00a0 Proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, despite the fact that the appellant is not given the opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal or cassation court, provided that a public hearing is held at first instance (see, among other authorities, Monnell and Morris, cited above, p.\u00a022, \u00a7\u00a058, as regards the issue of leave to appeal, and Sutter v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 22\u00a0February 1984, Series A no.\u00a074, p.\u00a013, \u00a7\u00a030, as regards the court of cassation).",

In order to decide this question, regard must be had, among other considerations, to the specific features of the proceedings in question and to the manner in which the applicant\u2019s interests were actually presented and protected before the appellate court, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it (see Belziuk v.\u00a0Poland, referred to above, \u00a7\u00a037, and Hermi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a018114/02, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR 2006...). However, where an appellate court has to examine a case as to the facts and the law and make a full assessment of the issue of guilt or innocence, it cannot determine the issue without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused for the purpose of proving that he did not commit the act allegedly constituting a criminal offence (see Dondarini v.\u00a0San Marino, no.\u00a050545/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 6\u00a0July 2004). The wider concept of a fair trial also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The latter means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party (see, among other authorities, Brandstetter v.\u00a0Austria, 28\u00a0August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066 and 67, Series A no.\u00a0211).",

The court reviewed the findings of the trial court on the basis of the material in the case file and considered the pleadings submitted by the applicant\u2019s lawyer in support of the appeal as well as the counter-arguments of the prosecution. All the evidence gathered in the case was available to the defence. \u00a0The Court notes that although the applicant was not present before the Court of Appeal, the presence of his legal-aid lawyer at that hearing was obligatory. As noted above, the lawyer attended the hearing and was given the opportunity to conduct the applicant\u2019s defence. The Court also notes that while the court of appeal was empowered under domestic law to accept new evidence in certain circumstances (see paragraph 27 above), it has not been shown or argued that the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested that new evidence be admitted and examined by the appellate court.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that in the context of criminal proceedings it is essentially the responsibility of the courts to ensure that a trial is fair (Lala v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 297A). It is therefore essentially the responsibility of the State to make available to the courts effective access to information about persons deprived of their liberty at the time of the trial. It was also for the court to ensure, by making the necessary administrative arrangements, that the court correspondence was served on the applicant who at the time of the trial remained in custody.",

As a result, he could not attend the hearing before the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , as he learned about it through unofficial channels only a few days before the hearing was to be held. The Court observes that in consequence the applicant was unable to address the court of appeal either through his lawyer, personally or in writing, to submit any comments he wished to make on the observations made by the prosecution or to put forward any submissions on the matters which he regarded as relevant to the outcome of his case (compare and contrast P.O. v.\u00a0Poland, (dec.), no.\u00a042618/98, 14\u00a0January 2003).",

The Polish Supreme Court stressed in a previous case that it was mandatory to bring a defendant to a hearing before the appellate court, regardless of whether he or she had made a relevant request (see paragraph 29 above). In a subsequent case, the same court emphasised that the right to a fair hearing demanded that a defendant convicted by a first-instance court should be informed of his procedural rights concerning his presence before the court of appeal (see paragraph 32 above). Ultimately, the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended so as to impose on the appellate court an unequivocal obligation to inform the defendant of his right to attend the hearing before that court (see paragraph 33 above). Hence, it is not open to doubt that the domestic legal system acknowledged that a defendant\u2019s personal participation in the appellate hearing was an integral part of fairness requirements.",
