The Court observes that the applicant claimed compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss he had sustained as a result of the accident and further, that he did not claim any damage as a consequence of the length of the proceedings. Since there is no causal link between the violation found and the damage alleged, the Court therefore rejects these claims.",

Greece, no.\u00a041354/98, \u00a7\u00a034, 12\u00a0April\u00a02001; Nikolova v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a031195/96, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 1999-II). It is also recalled that \u201cconditional fee agreements\u201d, as in the present case, may show, if they are legally enforceable, that the sums claimed are actually payable by the applicant and the Court must, as always, assess whether they were reasonably incurred (see Young v. the , no.\u00a060682/00, \u00a7\u00a053, 16 January 2007). The Court notes that the applicant did not provide any supporting documents or particulars to substantiate the costs and expenses claimed in respect of the domestic proceedings: it therefore rejects the claim under this head. On the other hand, the Court considers reasonable, regard being had to the above criteria and in particular the scope of work done by the applicant's representative, to award the sum of EUR 600 for the proceedings before the Court.",
