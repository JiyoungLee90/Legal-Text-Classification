Following the second decision on the refusal to institute criminal proceedings, the applicant had chosen to appeal to the supervising prosecutor, by sending a letter of complaint to the Prosecutor General. The latter had upheld the investigator's decision. The applicant argued that using the other alternative (appeals to supervising courts) did not offer him any prospect of success as the courts routinely upheld decisions of the prosecution authorities.

The Court notes that, had these appeals been lodged and been successful, they would have resulted in the quashing of the relevant decision and a renewed inquiry, possibly followed by a decision to institute criminal proceedings. However, the Court observes that, in any event, on 7\u00a0June 2006, pursuant to a decision by the Deputy Prosecutor General, criminal proceedings were actually instituted in the present case. Even assuming that the remedies suggested by the Government were otherwise effective, the Court accepts the applicant's argument that the institution of criminal proceedings produced the same outcome as the remedies suggested by the Government, making it no longer necessary for the applicant to pursue them. Moreover, the Court notes that, in the context of the criminal proceedings, the applicant repeatedly challenged various procedural decisions by the investigation authorities before the supervising courts, all of which challenges produced repetitive results, as the investigation was repeatedly suspended and his appeals were dismissed (except for one occasion when the supervising court instructed the investigation authorities to resume the investigation and ordered remedial measures, after which the investigation was in any event suspended again after a short period). Thus, in any event, the Court is not persuaded that any additional appeals would have made any difference in the present case.",

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from another individual or, in particular circumstances, from himself (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-III; and Renolde v. France, no. 5608/05, \u00a7\u00a081, ECHR 2008...). However, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising (see Osman, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116).",

However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating suspicious deaths may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, mutatis mutandis, McKerr, cited above, \u00a7 114, with further references). For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next-of-kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests (ibid., \u00a7 115, with further references).",

Furthermore, according to the authorities, the decision to move the applicant's belongings out of the dwelling was taken on the spot, only after Chichek Mammadova had immolated herself, in order to guarantee the safety of these belongings in the absence of the applicant and the rest of his family (all of whom had presumably left to accompany Chichek Mammadova to hospital). However, the Court is not convinced by this explanation. It notes that at least five police officers and several other officials were involved in this operation. Some witnesses testified (see, for example, the testimony of K.A. in paragraph 71 above) that an order to bring a lorry had been given as soon as the authorities had arrived at the applicant's dwelling, prior to Chichek Mammadova's suicide attempt. No meaningful explanation was provided as to why so many police officers were needed and why a lorry was brought, if the authorities' only intention on that day was to have a \u201cprophylactic conversation\u201d with the applicant. Moreover, even assuming that the dwelling and the belongings of the applicant's family were left unattended by them after Chichek Mammadova's suicide attempt, it has not been explained why the SCEA officials had to move the belongings out of the dwelling and transport them to another location, apparently at the State's expense, and why they could not secure their safety by other, more effortless means. In the light of the above, the Court considers that the only reasonable explanation for engaging so many police officers and bringing a lorry to the scene was that, from the very beginning, the operation was aimed at having the applicant's family vacate the dwelling on that same day, either by persuading them to do so voluntarily or by evicting them by force. This conclusion is supported by the fact that their personal belongings were indeed moved out of the dwelling on that same day. In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that, regardless of various vague terms such as \u201cprophylactic measures\u201d or \u201cprophylactic conversation\u201d, which were subsequently used, the real aim of this operation was to evict the applicant's family from the dwelling.",

The Court considers that, reasonably speaking, self-immolation as a protest tactic does not constitute predictable or reasonable conduct in the context of eviction from an illegally occupied dwelling, even in a situation involving such a particularly vulnerable sector of the population as refugees and internally displaced persons. When deciding to send the police to the applicant's dwelling in order to evict his family, the authorities could not have reasonably anticipated that the applicant's wife might react by committing suicide. There is no evidence to suggest that, in advance of the operation, the State agents involved had been aware, or should have been aware, of Chichek Mammadova's state of mental health and her alleged propensity for erratic behaviour.",

In this context, it is necessary to determine whether this specific situation triggered the State's positive obligation under Article 2; that is, whether at some point during the course of the operation the State agents became aware or ought to have become aware that Chichek Mammadova posed a real and immediate risk of suicide and, if so, whether they did all that could reasonably have been expected of them to prevent that risk.",

Such steps could also have included providing immediate first aid, calling an ambulance or assisting in hospitalising the victim. The Court acknowledges that, given the unpredictability of human conduct and the relatively short time span between the verbal threat and the act of self-immolation, there may indeed have been very limited time and facilities available to the State agents to react meaningfully.",

Owing to the contradictory nature of the witness testimonies, it is not clear exactly when the State agents became aware of the threat to Chichek Mammadova's life. More specifically, it is impossible to establish conclusively whether some or all of the State agents were inside or outside the applicant's dwelling during the period from the moment when Chichek Mammadova started preparing for her suicide attempt until the moment when she set herself on fire. It is therefore not clear whether any of the State agents heard the verbal threats made by her, whether they observed her preparations, or whether they only became aware of the suicide attempt after it was too late to prevent it. If there were any State agents inside, it is not clear how far away they were standing from the victim. If all the State agents were outside, it is not clear whether they could actually have observed Chichek Mammadova's relevant actions from where they were situated. It is not clear how much time elapsed from the moment the threat was made until the moment the victim set fire to herself, and how much time elapsed while she was burning.

It was therefore incumbent on the investigation authorities to determine, inter alia, which specific State agents, if any, were in close proximity to Chichek Mammadova, whether they were physically able to take steps to interrupt her suicide attempt, and how much time elapsed from the moment she made a verbal threat until she soaked herself in kerosene and, further, until she set fire to herself.",

On the other hand, some of the State agents, notably E.G., Y.A. and K.A., specifically stated that several police officers had entered the applicant's dwelling (see paragraphs 49, 51 and 71 above), although it is not clear from these statements whether the police officers were still in Chichek Mammadova's immediate vicinity at the time when she attempted suicide.

Such impossibility, however, must be effectively established by a thorough and comprehensive investigation. The Court notes that, in the present case, despite discrepancies in witness testimonies, the investigating authorities disregarded the importance of establishing the exact circumstances of the incident and did not take any effective steps to clarify the points on which various witnesses either disagreed or failed to provide a complete account. This could have been accomplished by, inter alia, posing specific questions to witnesses with a view to clarifying specific details of the sequence and timing of how events unfolded, conducting face-to-face confrontations between those witnesses who gave conflicting testimonies, and seeking to identify and question other eyewitnesses to the incident such as the applicant's relatives and other onlookers whom most of the State agents mentioned in their respective testimonies. The investigating authorities' failure to take the above steps contributed to the investigation's inability to produce a complete and detailed factual picture of the incident.",

It is clear, however, that Chichek Mammadova was not questioned while she was in hospital for three days before she died, despite the applicant's claim that she had been physically able to communicate during that period. Obviously, obtaining the victim's testimony, if possible, was indispensable for the effectiveness of the investigation. After the incident, the authorities were aware of the fact that she had suffered life-threatening injuries making her survival uncertain and were therefore obliged to act in a prompt and diligent manner in order to try to obtain evidence which would no longer be available after her death. No explanation was provided by the Government or the domestic investigation authorities as to the reasons for the failure to do so. In the Court's view, this failure undermined the effectiveness of the investigation (compare Esat Bayram v. , no. 75535/01, \u00a7 49, 26 May 2009).",

Thus, it should be noted that the overall length of the domestic investigation was more than four years. The investigation was adjourned and resumed a number of times without any evident progress in its effectiveness and without any substantive improvement in the adequacy of the investigative measures taken. While on several occasions the supervising prosecutors or courts criticised the deficiencies in the proceedings and ordered remedial measures (see, for example, paragraphs 33 and 39 above), those instructions were not complied with.",
