The applicants observed that the  judgments relied on by the Government concerned cases that had been decided before that amendment and could under no circumstances be regarded as reflecting its current case-law. They noted that the Constitutional Court's recent judgments showed that it had departed from its earlier case-law and now considered that where an appellant had sought leave from the appeal court to appeal on points of law, the appeal on points of law was regarded as the final remedy requiring exhaustion, so that a constitutional appeal could only be brought once the Supreme Court had decided whether or not to grant leave.

The rules on the procedure and time-limits for appeals are designed to ensure the proper administration of justice and, in particular, legal certainty. This principle of legal certainty, which is one of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law, requires that all litigants should have an effective judicial remedy enabling them to assert their civil rights (see Brum\u0103rescu v.

For this reason, the Court considers that the start of the sixty-day period for lodging the constitutional appeal should have been the date of service of the Supreme Court's decision refusing leave.

The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The Court has to ensure that the last two rules are applicable before determining whether the first one has been complied with. The three rules are not, however, \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected.

They said that the applicants had not adduced any evidence of the nature of the land in question, in particular as to its surface area, and contested the method the applicants had used to calculate their loss. They also observed that there was no expert evidence supporting the market value the applicants had put on the land, which appeared highly unreliable.
