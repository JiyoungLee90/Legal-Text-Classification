Germany, 21 February 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 48-50, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a073). The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere. This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a039665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-86, ECHR 2003-X). It is further noted that the Court has held that Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head applies fully to proceedings concerning contempt of court in the context of criminal proceedings (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005XIII).",

It cannot be excluded that the imposition of a sentence of solitary confinement on a serving prisoner like the applicant for a breach of internal prison regulations for the purpose of maintaining prison discipline might be considered a purely disciplinary measure and therefore outside the scope of Article 6 (see, \u0160titi\u0107 v.

In its caselaw the Court has already recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article\u00a06 on account of subjective bias and for this reason has, in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues, focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions, since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (the objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal convictions (the subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0119). The Court further notes that in his letter to the applicant the President of the Elbl\u0105g Regional Court stated that Judge E.O. had felt offended by the allegations made in the applicant\u2019s letter and that Judge E.O. was envisaging bringing criminal proceedings against the applicant for defamation punishable under Article 212 of the Criminal Code. In these circumstances, given that the judge decided a case concerning criticism directed personally against him alone, the absence of that watertight division is even more pronounced.",

The Court notes that the decision to place the applicant in solitary confinement was found to be unlawful by the appellate court after the applicant had already served the penalty. The Court acknowledges that the remedy cited exists in domestic law and that it allows a person to seek damages from the State Treasury arising from unlawful decisions given by authorities exercising the State\u2019s powers. However, the Court notes that, under the resolution of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 22) above, only a flagrant and manifest breach of law could give rise to a successful compensation claim under this provision of the Civil Code. It has not been argued, let alone shown, that in the applicant\u2019s case such a manifest breach of domestic law was committed. The Court notes in this connection, firstly, that in its decision of 22 July 2009 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal noted the discrepancies in the doctrine as to whether section 49 of the Courts Act could be resorted to where insults against a court were proffered in writing (see paragraph 15 above). It notes, secondly, that in its letter of 29\u00a0September 2009 (see paragraph 19 above) the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal stated that the judge\u2019s conduct in the applicant\u2019s case did not give rise to disciplinary liability. In addition, the Court observes that the Government have not cited any decisions of the domestic courts indicating that individuals in a situation similar to the applicant\u2019s have succeeded in obtaining compensation on the ground of unlawfulness of the State\u2019s acts.",

To be sure, however, the formula adopted in \u00a7\u00a059 is more suitable when the test, to be applied in determining whether or not there has been a breach of more than one article of the Convention, is identical, or at least very similar. In the instant case the test applied for the purpose of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is that of the objective and subjective impartiality of the judge. For the purpose of Article 10, however, the test would have been different toto coelo: the interference, although possibly necessary in a democratic society for maintaining the authority of the judiciary, was not one prescribed by law (see \u00a7\u00a014). There seems to be precious little caselaw or guidelines as to when the formula used in \u00a7\u00a059 should or should not be applied. In the absence of such case-law or guidelines, the Court\u2019s decision that \u201cit does not consider it necessary to examine separately\u201d whether one or more other provisions of the Convention have been breached often appears to lack strict judicial logic.",
