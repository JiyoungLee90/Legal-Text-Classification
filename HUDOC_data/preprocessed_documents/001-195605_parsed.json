Austria, 20\u00a0September 1994, Series A no. 295A). The pornographic videos produced and distributed by the applicant came under the category of such information. Production and distribution of pornography was a criminal offence in Russia. Moreover, under the 1923 Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in Obscene Publications, Russia had an obligation to punish the production, distribution, public showing and hiring out of pornographic material. The Government also referred to Recommendation No. R (89) 7 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member states concerning principles on the distribution of videograms having a violent, brutal or pornographic content, which they interpreted as requiring a complete prohibition of pornographic videos (paragraph 3.3, see paragraph 32 above).",

Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society for the following reasons. The applicant had previously been granted film reproduction licences on many occasions. However, on this occasion it had been established that the film he intended to distribute was clearly pornographic. If that film had been distributed, it would not have been subject to any form of control by the authorities and could have been viewed by children (compare Hoare v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a031211/96, Commission decision of 2 July 1997). The domestic courts had found that there were relevant and sufficient reasons to prohibit the film\u2019s distribution, and it was not the Court\u2019s role to question that finding. Furthermore, at the material time the applicant had been involved in a criminal investigation relating to the production of pornography. A limitation of his freedom of expression had therefore been justified.",

The Court has recently found that even a temporary ban on distributing a piece of pornographic material to any audience was not justified. It held that the domestic authorities could have applied a less restrictive measure, for example a ban on selling the material in question to persons under eighteen years old, an obligation to sell it with a special cover with a warning addressed to persons under eighteen years old, or an obligation to sell it via a subscription only (see Kaos GL, cited above, \u00a7\u00a061).",

There is no evidence in the text of the domestic judgments that the domestic courts weighed the impact which the refusal of a film reproduction licence would have on the applicant\u2019s ability to distribute the films for which he had distribution certificates or on his freedom of expression in general.

The evidence also supports the conclusion that exposure to pornographic material and content increases the acceptance of the proposition that women like to be forced into sexual practices, or in more colloquial terms, that the woman who says \u201cno\u201d really means \u201cyes\u201d.

In paragraphs 129-30 of the Centro Europa judgment the Court stressed that \u201cit is of the essence of democracy to allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even those that call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Manole and Others v.

The Court went on to observe that \u201cto ensure true pluralism in the audio-visual sector in a democratic society, it is not sufficient to provide for the existence of several channels or the theoretical possibility for potential operators to access the audio-visual market. It is necessary in addition to allow effective access to the market so as to guarantee diversity of overall programme content, reflecting as far as possible the variety of opinions encountered in the society at which the programmes are aimed\u201d.

Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions, which is essential for a democratic society. In paragraph 52 of the judgment the Court referred to its case-law to support the above idea, including the case of Kaos GL v.

There was no dispute between the parties that erotic scenes took up about 95% of each of the applicant\u2019s films.
