As to the legality of her deprivation of liberty, the Government stated that section 13 of the Police Act of 2011 contained the statutory basis on which the police drew up reports relating to administrative offences under Articles 19.3 and 20.2 of the CAO. Article 27.1 of the CAO was the legal provision empowering the police to take a person to a police station in circumstances where it was necessary in order to put an end to an offence. Article 27.2 of the CAO allowed the police to escort a person to a police station where it was not possible to compile an offence record at the place where the offence had been discovered. The police had had no opportunity to compile a report on the spot because \u201cthe place had been full of other participants of the rally\u201d. Moreover, in view of the applicant\u2019s active conduct during the rally, the compiling of an offence record on the spot would not have resulted in suppressing the offence.

As to the aim of putting an end to an offence, the escort record only referred to the statutory aim of compiling an offence record (see paragraph 8 above). The examination of the case in a correct and expedient manner was indicated as the statutory aim of the applicant\u2019s administrative arrest (see paragraph 10 above). However, neither any domestic authority nor the Government before the Court put forward any justification as to why the case had been considered \u201cexceptional\u201d within the meaning of Article 27.3 of the CAO, in order to justify the arrest procedure, in particular after the offence record had been compiled at around 8\u00a0p.m. on 12 June 2017.

None of the documents drawn up at domestic level (for instance, the escort record, the reports by the police officers, the offence record or any judicial decision) clarify the factual and legal elements which could explain why an offence record could not be drawn up on the spot. The Government\u2019s submissions before the Court shed no light on those elements, beyond a reference to the rally venue being \u201cfull of other participants\u201d or to the applicant\u2019s active conduct during the rally. There is nothing to doubt that the applicant\u2019s conduct was peaceful or to contest her submission that the rally was peaceful (compare with Kasparov and Others v. Russia (no. 2), no. 51988/07, \u00a7 39, 13 December 2016, and Frumkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 74568/12, \u00a7 148, 5 January 2016). Furthermore, despite the Government\u2019s argument before the Court, it is noted that the escort record did not refer to any (arguably, statutory) aim which might have justified under Russian law recourse to the escort procedure for putting an end to any ongoing offence, instead of the primary statutory aim of this procedure, that is for compiling an offence record (see paragraphs 8 and 30 above).",

As to the aim of the \u201ctimely and correct examination of the case\u201d referred to in the arrest record (see paragraph 10 above), it remains the case that the CAO required the measure to be justified with reference to \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances. No such circumstances, beyond mere convenience, were adduced at the domestic level or, at the latest, before the Court. Nothing in the file suggests that there was a risk of the applicant reoffending, tampering with evidence, influencing witnesses or fleeing justice, which would plead in favour of her continued detention. Even if those considerations could be considered to constitute an \u201cexceptional case\u201d referred to in Article 27.3 \u00a7 1 of the CAO as part of the rationale for avoiding excessive and abusive recourse to the administrativearrest procedure, there is nothing in the file that could lead the Court to conclude that such considerations had been weighed and justified the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty after 10 p.m. on 12 June 2017 until her release at around 8 p.m. on 13 June 2017 (see Navalnyy v.

Norway, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108, and Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia [GC], no. 14939/03, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2009). The Court has also held that an approach which emphasises the legal characterisation of the two offences is too restrictive on the rights of the individual and risks undermining the guarantee enshrined in Article 4 \u00a7\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a07 (see Sergey\u00a0Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 81, and Boman v. Finland, no.\u00a041604/11, \u00a7 33, 17\u00a0February 2015). Accordingly, it cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument (see paragraph 45 above) that the duplication of proceedings in the present case was justified by the distinct types or areas of protection pertaining to each offence (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0160imkus v. Lithuania, no.\u00a041788/11, \u00a7\u00a048, 13 June 2017, and Rivard v. Switzerland, no.\u00a021563/12, \u00a7 26, 4\u00a0October 2016). What matters is that there is an overlap of the facts constituting the basis for the defendant\u2019s prosecution in the second set of proceedings with facts that are substantially the same in the first set of proceedings. The Court notes that in each set of proceedings the applicant was accused in relation to participating in an unlawful rally, namely, of (i)\u00a0refusing to comply with a police officer\u2019s order to cease her participation in it (Article 19.3 \u00a7 1 of the CAO) and (ii) failing to comply with her statutory obligation under the Public Events Act to comply with police orders, in the present case, the order to cease her participation in the event (Article\u00a020.2\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05 of the CAO read with section 6(3) of the Public Events Act). As acknowledged in substance by the Plenary Supreme Court, such accusations are intertwined and entailing a conclusion, in terms of Russian law, that only a charge under Article 20.2 \u00a7\u00a05 of the CAO was permissible (see paragraph 25 above).",

It is primarily for the State concerned to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the means to be used under its domestic law to comply with that obligation. However, with a view to helping the respondent State in that task, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken in order to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see, as a recent authority, Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7 182).",
