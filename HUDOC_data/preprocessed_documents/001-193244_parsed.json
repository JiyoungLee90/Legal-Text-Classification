The investigator arrived at the conclusion that Z.\u2019s decision to commit suicide had not been provoked by any actions of Ch. amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment. Z. had been in a state of severe alcohol intoxication and could not have fully understood her actions when taking the decision to take her own life. The bruises and abrasions on Z.\u2019s face and body could have originated during a heated altercation with Ch. shortly before the former\u2019s death. No direct evidence in support of the theory that Ch. had ill-treated Z. had been discovered. Even assuming that the two disclosed instances of Z. being beaten by Ch. (in 2005 and 2007) had indeed taken place, they would have been one-off unrelated events occurring under unspecified circumstances and could not have been connected to Z.\u2019s decision to take her own life. Furthermore, Z. had not been fully dependent on Ch. or particularly vulnerable. According to Z.\u2019s relatives, she could have left Ch. at any time, divorced him, taken the children and changed her place of residence. She could also have sought medical assistance, and/or complained about Ch.\u2019s actions to the police. However, she had not done so. At the same time she had told her relatives that she loved her husband and did not want to divorce him. The case file further contained information indicating that Ch. had inflicted beatings on Z. in June 2006, of which Z. had complained to the police. However, Z.\u2019s submissions had been inconsistent and she had eventually refused to pursue those proceedings. The applicant\u2019s theory that Ch. had staged the suicide had been checked and found to be unsupported by the material in the case file.",

The applicant contended that this was a strong indicator of the ineffectiveness of the investigation. It had been repeatedly noted by the supervising prosecutors and the courts that the inquiries had been incomplete and the decisions refusing to institute criminal proceedings had been unlawful and unsubstantiated. The applicant outlined the major deficiencies of the investigation which had undermined the authorities\u2019 ability to establish the true cause of her daughter\u2019s death and to identify the perpetrator. She further noted that the investigators had been limited in their powers since the pre-investigation inquiry had never progressed to the stage of a criminal investigation and had therefore not been capable of meeting the requirements of an effective investigation under Article 2 of the Convention. The criminal proceedings opened against Ch. in June 2010 had been limited to the beatings inflicted on Z.
