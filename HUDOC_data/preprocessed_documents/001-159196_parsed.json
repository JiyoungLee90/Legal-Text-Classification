Consideration must be given in particular to the question of whether the applicant, on acquiring the property, knew \u2013 or should have reasonably known \u2013 about the restrictions on the property, or possible future restrictions (see Allan Jacobsson v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 1), 25 October 1989, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06061, Series A no. 163, and \u0141\u0105cz v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 22665/02, 23 June 2009), the existence of legitimate expectations with respect to the use of the property or acceptance of the risk on purchase (see Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), 18\u00a0February 1991, \u00a7\u00a054, Series A no. 192), the extent to which the restriction prevented use of the property (see Katte Klitsche de la Grange v.\u00a0Italy, 27 October 1994, \u00a7\u00a046, Series A no. 293\u2011B, and SCEA Ferme de\u00a0Fresnoy v.

The corresponding resolution of the Council came into force on 1\u00a0January 1989. The applicant\u2019s property was incorporated in the area of the Park, however he was not deprived of his possessions and he retained the property rights to his land. In particular, he was free to divide his property and to dispose of it, which he did on several occasions (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above).",

He thus could not reasonably have expected that he might obtain a permit to develop it, in particular to construct on it, and must already have accepted the risk on purchase. As is apparent from the documents submitted by the applicant, even before the entry into force of the 1994 local land development plan, the previously binding plan for the Suwa\u0142ki Municipality excluded the possibility of any new construction on the applicant\u2019s plots in the vicinity of the Wigry Lake (see paragraphs 22 and 43 above). The local land development plan of 1994 did not change the designation of the applicant\u2019s property, which was still classified as farmland with recommended afforestation. Moreover, the plan adopted in 2006 included a \u201cprohibition of any construction\u201d on the applicant\u2019s land (see paragraph 42 above). The classification of the applicant\u2019s property has not changed since.",

The importance of this kind of procedural guarantee of the owners\u2019 rights was later highlighted by the fact that on 7 December 2000 the 1991 Conservation of Nature Act was amended and the authorities were then expressly obliged to seek the consent of owners if they wanted to incorporate their property into the national park (see paragraphs 60 and 61 above). Similar provisions are contained in the currently binding 2004 Conservation of Nature Act (see paragraph 64 above). Nonetheless, these provisions do not extend these procedural rights to owners of land included in parks created prior to their entry into force.",

In his letter of 19 October 1999 the Director drew the applicant\u2019s attention to the fact that the property in question was exclusively farmland or forests and estimated its value at PLN 351,800. The applicant was also informed that he could not demand for the property a price calculated on the basis of land designated for construction purposes (see\u00a0paragraph 15 above). In 2009 the applicant again offered to sell his property to the Park, apparently in return for certain amendments to the local land development plan. In his letter of 23\u00a0April 2009 the Director of the Park expressed an interest in buying the plots but informed the applicant that it was not possible to amend the plan (see paragraph 58 above).

The provisions providing compensation for a decrease in the value of a property caused by the adoption of a local land development plan entered into force on 1 January 1995 (see paragraph 72 above). It follows that the applicant could not make use thereof. However, even if these provisions had applied to his situation from the temporal point of view, compensation was available only to owners whose property had changed its classification as a result of the adoption of a new local land development plan. As noted above, this was not so in the applicant\u2019s case: his land was acquired and remained classified as \u201cfarmland\u201d.
