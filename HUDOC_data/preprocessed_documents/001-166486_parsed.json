The applicant\u2019s own words are insufficient to prove his allegations (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no.\u00a05829/04, \u00a7 106, 31 May 2011).

Malta, no. 55352/12, \u00a7\u00a089, 23\u00a0July 2013), they are nevertheless expected to corroborate their allegations as much as the circumstances allow them (see Kyriacou Tsiakkourmas and Others, cited above, \u00a7 283). In similar situations the Court has considered, for example, written statements by fellow detainees provided by applicants in support of their allegations (see Visloguzov, cited above) or documents showing that relevant issues had been brought to the attention of the domestic authorities as sufficient evidence to declare the complaint wellfounded (see Daniliuc v.

The applicant claimed that on 11 March 2015 (that is to say, after the submission of the Government\u2019s observations) his legal representative had attempted to visit the Gaziantep Removal Centre in order to be able to provide a firsthand account of the conditions of detention there, but had been denied access. The Court notes, however, that there is no written record of such a denial of access to the removal centre in the case file, and nor is there any evidence of any complaints having been made to the relevant State authorities in this regard.",

Bulgaria, no. 41035/98, \u00a7 66, 18 January 2005, and Kurkaev v. Turkey, no. 10424/05, \u00a7 34, 19 October 2010). The Court notes that Human Rights Watch and the CPT observed some of the problems raised by the applicant (such as lack of access to daily outdoor exercise and unhygienic conditions) in certain removal centres that they visited in June\u00a02008 and 2009 respectively (see Tehrani and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos.\u00a032940/08, 41626/08 and 43616/08, \u00a7 52, 13 April 2010, and Yarashonen, cited above, \u00a7 28, respectively). However, the problems noted in those reports were specific to the facilities visited, which did not include the Gaziantep Removal Centre, and the Court does not have sufficient evidence in its possession to allow it to conclude that these were systemic problems that affected all removal centres.",
