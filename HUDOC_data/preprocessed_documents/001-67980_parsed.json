The presumption was only rebuttable in very exceptional circumstances where even a hypothetical possibility of absconding, reoffending or collusion was excluded, due to serious illness or other exceptional factors. It was moreover incumbent on the detained person to prove the existence of such exceptional circumstances, failing which he was bound to remain in detention throughout the proceedings.

It is true that in order to exclude the application of the exception of paragraph 2 of Article\u00a0152 of the CCP the authorities stated that there was a likelihood that the applicant would try to abscond. However, the only reasoning they provided in support of this conclusion was the fact that the applicant had allegedly gone into hiding prior to his arrest, which is quite dubious (see paragraphs 14, 18, 21, 81 and 88 above). Also, they disregarded other relevant arguments presented by the applicant in support of his requests for release, such as the fact that he had a family, was studying in university and had a newborn baby (see paragraphs 81, 84 and 86 above). The Court considers that while succinct reasoning may be inevitable in practice, it is difficult to accept that a detention was based on sufficient reasons if, in disregard of repeated arguable submissions, no reasons were given in respect of several of the relevant criteria.",
