The situation in the present case, however, was quite the contrary. The applicant had used the five-pointed red star in a political context, as a sign of solidarity with a fellow party member, that is, because he had identified himself with the symbol and with what it means to the outside world. His own political conviction was immaterial since the law prohibited everyone from the use of totalitarian symbols, including the five-pointed red star associated with Communist dictatorship, whether or not possessing multiple meanings.",

For the spectators, it had not been possible to appreciate the defendant\u2019s reasons for this conduct, but it had been obvious that the bearer of the symbol had identified himself therewith and had in this way represented a danger to society.

Hungary (no. 33629/06, \u00a7\u00a7 48 to 58, July 2008). It held that, for a restriction on the display of that symbol to be justified, it was required that there was a real and present danger of any political movement or party restoring the Communist dictatorship. However, the Government had not shown the existence of such a threat prior to the enactment of the ban in question. The Court perceived a risk that a blanket ban on the use of that symbol might also restrict its use in contexts in which no restriction would be justified. It therefore considered that the ban in question was too broad in view of the multiple meanings of the red star: it could encompass activities and ideas which clearly belonged to those protected by Article 10, and there was no satisfactory way to sever the different meanings of the incriminated symbol. Indeed, the relevant Hungarian law did not attempt to do so. Moreover, even if such distinctions had existed, uncertainties might have arisen entailing a chilling effect on freedom of expression and self-censorship. The Court furthermore stressed that even the potential propagation of Communist ideology could not be the sole reason to limit the display of the red star by way of a criminal sanction. However, in any case, a symbol which might have several meanings in the context of the case of Vajnai, where it had been displayed by a leader of a registered political party with no known totalitarian ambitions, could not be equated with dangerous propaganda.",

Just like Mr Vajnai, the applicant wore the symbol in question as a member of a registered political party and at a lawful demonstration. That display formed therefore part of his political expression and as such enjoyed the protection of Article 10. Indeed, the only element which may distinguish the present application from the Vajnai case is the Government\u2019s submission that the applicant\u2019s conduct represented danger to society because it symbolised his identification with totalitarian ideas (see paragraph 15 above). However, the Court considers that it is not called upon to examine the purported justification for the interference in question from this perspective, since the Government admitted (see paragraph 16 above) that the sanction had been applied merely on account of the display itself, without any judicial scrutiny of its dangerousness having taken place. For the Court, the applicant has thus been subjected to the same indiscriminate restriction as Mr Vajnai.",

However, the position of the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 8 above) expressly denies the necessity of an examination of the context in which the impugned expression appears. Therefore, no meaningful distinction can be made between those shocking forms of expression which are protected by Article\u00a010, and unjustifiably offensive ones which forfeit their right to tolerance in a democratic society. The Court would note in particular that the Court of Appeal did not even analyse if the expression had resulted in intimidation (cf. the above-mentioned Vajnai judgment, \u00a7 53). In the absence of a scrutiny of the proportionality of the interference, as precluded by the interpretation of the Court of Appeal, the Court cannot find that the Government have proven that the restriction corresponded to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d.",
