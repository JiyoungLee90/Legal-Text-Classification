The case was about a plot of land which had been allocated for the construction of a school in the zoning plan. After its owner had brought a compensation case, firstly, Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance accepted the compensation claim of the owner as there was a seizure without expropriation. However, Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation quashed Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance\u2019s decision on the ground that the land at issue had not been controlled or used effectively by the public administrations. Subsequently, Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance insisted on its previous decisions and the case was brought before the Plenary Court of Cassation (civil divisions) in accordance with section\u00a015\u00a0(1) of the Court of Cassation Act (Law no. 2797). The Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions) noted in its decision, dated 11\u00a0May 2004 and numbered E.2004/5-555 K.2005/17, that as it terminated alternative possibilities of using the land, the designation of land as a public use area in zoning plans amounted to seizure without expropriation and thus the decision of Ankara 24th Civil Court of First Instance was in conformity with the law in this respect.",

The criteria that guide the Court\u2019s assessment of the conditions in which conflicting decisions are in breach of the fair trial requirement enshrined in Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention consist in establishing whether profound and longstanding differences exist in the case-law of the domestic courts, whether the domestic law provides for a mechanism for overcoming these inconsistencies, whether that mechanism has been applied and, if appropriate, to what effect (see Iordan Iordanov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a023530/02, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50, 2 July 2009, and Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 53, 20 October 2011).",

While it is true that Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation reached different conclusions in the applicants\u2019 cases which were seemingly very similar to that examined by the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation in 2004, it cannot be said that there were \u201cprofound and long-standing differences\u201d in the relevant caselaw. The Court further notes that, although it is not directly accessible to the applicants, according to section 16 (5) of the Court of Cassation Act (Law no. 2797), in cases where there is inconsistency between a decision of a civil division of the Court Cassation and the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions), the Grand Plenary Court of Cassation renders a legally binding decision settling the conflict of case-law. Taking these aspects into consideration, the Court finds no reason to further examine whether the aforementioned provision for overcoming the judicial inconsistencies could have been applied in the instant case and to what effect (see, mutatis mutandis, Ari\u015fanu v. Romania (dec.), no.\u00a017436/09, 28\u00a0January 2014). In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that interpretation is inherent in the work of the judiciary (as case-law is evolutive in essence) and that it is not the Court\u2019s function to compare different judgments of national courts, even if delivered in respect of similar proceedings, the Court considers that the difference of interpretation between the decisions of the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions) and Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation does not, in itself, constitute a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Emel Boyraz, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a026, ECHR 1999I, and the cases cited therein). Although Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their rulings, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the ruling and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (Ruiz Torija v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no. 303A; Hiro Balani v.\u00a0Spain, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 303B; and Garc\u00eda Ruiz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a026). Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court\u2019s judgment (Helle v.\u00a0Finland, 19\u00a0December 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII; Hirvisaari v.

However, neither during the first-instance proceedings nor in the cassation proceedings did the domestic courts consider the applicants\u2019 submissions when concluding that the applicants did not have a right to compensation on the ground that their land were not controlled or used effectively by the public administrations. In the Court\u2019s opinion, while an earlier judgment delivered by the Plenary Chamber of the Court of Cassation (civil divisions) was in conflict with the approaches of the first-instance courts and Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation in the present cases, the applicants\u2019 submissions regarding the said judgment required an adequate and express response. In the absence of such a response, it is impossible to ascertain whether the domestic courts simply neglected to deal with the applicants\u2019 submissions or whether they intended to dismiss their argument and, if that was their intention, what their reasons were for so deciding (see Hiro\u00a0Balani, cited above, \u00a7 28; and Emel Boyraz, cited above, \u00a7 75).",
