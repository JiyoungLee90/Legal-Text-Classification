The applicant's claims were sent for re-consideration, following which the Town and Regional courts substantially reduced the amount of the initial award, despite the fact that the reasons given in their judgments were identical to those of the judgment of 11 March 2001. Thus, the applicant was prevented from receiving the initial award through no fault of his own. The quashing of the enforceable judgment frustrated the applicant's reliance on the binding judicial decision and deprived him of an opportunity to receive the money he had legitimately expected to receive. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the quashing of the enforceable judgment of 11 March 2001 by way of supervisory review placed an excessive burden on the applicant and was incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01. There has therefore been a violation of that Article.",
