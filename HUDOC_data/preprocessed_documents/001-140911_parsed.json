No bedding was provided. The cell did not have a window in the proper sense of that word \u2013 a small window was covered with a metal sheet, blocking access to natural light and air. In the absence of any artificial ventilation in the cell, it was hard to breathe owing to the thick smoke and the humidity. The cell was lit by a small bulb inserted in a recess in the concrete wall above the door. Thick metal bars separated the bulb from the cell. According to the applicant, there was no furniture, wash-bowl or lavatory pan in the cell. Once a day, in the morning, inmates were taken to a public lavatory outside the police station. For the rest of the day, they had to use a bucket as a lavatory pan. They were allowed to clean the bucket once a day, in the morning. The foul smell permeated the cell, as the bucket had no cover. The police station did not have a recreation yard and inmates were therefore confined to their cells day and night. Food was provided once a day. The daily food ration consisted of half a bowl of cabbage soup and a piece of bread. In addition, inmates were given tea, which they drank from containers cut from plastic bottles. Medical assistance was unavailable.",

He had usually been taken from the detention facility IZ-73/3 to the ward early in the morning and had been returned to facility IZ-73/3 in the evening, only to be sent back to the police ward in the following morning or several days later. The Government observed that he had spent ten days in the police ward during the pre-trial investigation: five days while attending the court hearings, four days while he was re-acquainting himself with the case-file materials, and an additional three days while he was studying the court records. The Government acknowledged that the material and sanitary conditions in the ward had not \u201centirely satisfied the established legal requirements\u201d. They stressed that the cells had had no furniture, save for bunk beds, or radios, the lighting had been \u201cinsufficient\u201d, the cells had not been equipped with lavatory pans as the police ward was not connected to the water mains or the sewerage system. They further conceded that there had been no artificial ventilation system, the cells had not been disinfected and detainees had not been provided with bedding. Following a number of warnings from the prosecutor, in April 2004 the director of the police station sent a request for additional funding and took the necessary steps to comply with the legal norms governing conditions of detention. The Government provided the Court with a copy of a prosecutor\u2019s order issued on 15\u00a0February 2004. Having seen for himself the conditions of detention in the police station and talked to inmates, the prosecutor noted the following problems requiring immediate improvement: occasional overcrowding, failure to provide inmates with bedding, scarce food and lack of sanitary facilities. The Government described the detention authorities\u2019 response to the prosecutor\u2019s orders, and submitted that after the applicant\u2019s detention in the ward the metal shutters had been removed from the cell windows and inmates had been guaranteed an individual sleeping place and personal space of no less than four square metres. Furniture had been installed in the cells and inmates had started receiving food three times a day. The police station administration was now organising daily walks for detainees, had introduced disinfection of the facilities and was providing inmates with the opportunity to take a shower and wash their clothes and bedding.",

There is no standard by which pain and suffering, physical discomfort and psychological distress and anguish can be measured in terms of money. The Court has no doubt that the domestic courts in the present case, with every desire to be just and eminently reasonable, attempted to assess the cumulative effect which the conditions of detention had had on the applicant\u2019s well-being (see, mutatis mutandis, Dougoz v. Greece, no.\u00a040907/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001-II) and to determine the level of physical suffering, emotional distress, anxiety or other harmful effects sustained by the applicant by reason of his detention in those conditions (see Nardone v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25\u00a0November 2004). However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the amount of RUB 500 awarded for an aggregate period of a month on twenty-three occasions of detention, that is, a rate of approximately RUB 16 per day, was disproportionately lower than the damages that it generally awards in comparable Russian cases (see, for example, Labzov v.

Such an assessment should be carried out in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and take into account the standard of living in the country concerned, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases (see Cocchiarella, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080, and the finding in paragraph 31 above).

While the Court agrees that the length of time the applicant spent in the cell is an acutely relevant factor for the determination of the appropriate amount of compensation, it is not convinced that that factor alone should have been adopted by the Russian courts as the underlying reason for such a disproportionately small award. It appears that the degree of responsibility of the police station administration and their lack of financial resources were taken into account by the Russian courts as additional reasons justifying the amount of compensation. In this respect, the Court reiterates its findings in the case of Shilbergs v. Russia (cited above), in which it was confronted with an identical issue of assessing the national court\u2019s reasoning for awarding compensation in a case of poor conditions of detention. In that case, the Court held as follows:",

However, it reiterates its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, may not be cited by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State\u2019s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 63, 1 June 2006). The same logic applies to domestic courts\u2019 reasoning in awarding damages when entertaining actions against a State in respect of its tortious conduct. The Court finds it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter\u2019s lack of funds. It considers that in circumstances such as those under consideration the means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and are thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court is of the opinion that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State\u2019s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach in the present case, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State\u2019s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State may not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity.\u201d (ibid, \u00a7 78).",
