Furthermore, the Court observes on the basis of the material in the case file that the applicant was detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed criminal offences. The Court accordingly finds that the decision to place the applicant in custody had a legal basis and was issued by the appropriate judicial authority. There is nothing to suggest that the legal basis for his detention was not clearly defined or lacked the necessary foreseeability required under the Convention. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s detention complied with the requirements of Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (c). Moreover, the Court does not see any appearance of arbitrariness on the part of the relevant judicial authorities when deciding on the applicant\u2019s detention.",
