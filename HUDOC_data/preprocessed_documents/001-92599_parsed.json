Subsequently, after having been admitted to the colony hospital in early September 2002, the applicant was diagnosed with a kidney disease (according to the applicant) or with diabetes (according to the documents submitted) (see paragraph 20). A surgeon at the colony hospital examined the applicant and diagnosed him with \u201can injury to the left side of the chest\u201d (see paragraph 21). More than a month later, the applicant underwent a \u201clarge picture from photoroentgenography\u201d, which revealed no pathological changes\u201d (see paragraph 22).
