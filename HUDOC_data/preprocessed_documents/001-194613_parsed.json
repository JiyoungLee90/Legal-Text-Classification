An association could not, inter alia, open a bank account, hire employees, or receive in its name any grants or financial donations which constituted one of the main sources of financing of non-governmental organisations (see Article 3 of the Law on Grants in paragraph 42 above; see also Ramazanova, cited above, \u00a7 59, and third-party submissions and the Court\u2019s assessment in Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 101-02, 108-10 and 123; see also the extracts from the Venice Commission Opinions cited in paragraphs 43-44 above).
