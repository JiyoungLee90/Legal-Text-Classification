                                "content": "23.\u00a0\u00a0On 7 February 2005 the cantonal immigration authorities decided that the applicant\u2019s residence permit would not be extended and that he had to leave Switzerland for an indeterminate period of time. They held that over the preceding years, owing to the applicant\u2019s continuously accumulating debts and his failure to pay maintenance, his family had been dependent to a considerable degree on social welfare, and he had not proved that he was capable of observing public order and safety in Switzerland. In accordance with section 10 \u00a7 1 (b) and (d) of the Federal Act on the Temporary and Permanent Residence of Foreigners (hereinafter \u201cthe Foreigners\u2019 Residence Act\u201d - see paragraph 29 below) and section 16 of its Implementing Ordinance (see paragraph 30 below), he could therefore be expelled. They reasoned that since 1994, when the applicant had entered Switzerland for the second time, he had repeatedly been convicted of offences. Furthermore, despite the immigration authorities\u2019 repeated warnings, his financial situation was serious and had continuously deteriorated. As at the date of the decision, his debts amounted to about CHF\u00a0352,890 (approximately EUR 288,918) and the outstanding maintenance payments to CHF\u00a074,710 (EUR 61,166). In addition, from June 2004, he had worked as an associate of a company in the gastronomic sector without having previously applied for the necessary work permit. Although he had never paid maintenance or complied with the debt repayment agreements, he had invested capital of CHF 20,000 (approximately EUR\u00a016,374) in that company. The cantonal immigration authorities therefore concluded that the applicant had not complied with the conditions previously set out by them for renewal of his residence permit. Furthermore, the fact that the applicant had resumed matrimonial life with his wife on 25\u00a0October 2004 did not alter those findings, since his wife had already filed for divorce twice and there had been incidents of domestic violence in the past. The applicant had, moreover, registered his residence at the family home only after he had been informed by the immigration authorities in October 2004 of their intention to expel him. However, he had spent many months between September 2004 and March 2005 in Turkey and it could therefore hardly be assumed that he had actually re-established family life. The applicant\u2019s return to his country of origin \u2013 Turkey \u2013 was also feasible, because he had spent most of his life there and maintained close social and family ties with that country, as evidenced by his regular visits there. Additionally, even though he claimed that his relationship with his children was close, he had not paid maintenance for them since the separation from his wife. Lastly, the children were not prevented from visiting him in Turkey and the contact could be maintained at a distance. The applicant\u2019s expulsion was therefore proportionate and he was required to leave Switzerland by 7\u00a0May 2005.",

                                "content": "25.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of the cantonal immigration authorities with the director of the Department for Security of the Canton of Basel-Stadt (Vorsteher des Sicherheitsdepartement des Kantons Basel-Stadt \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe director\u201d), who dismissed the appeal on 16\u00a0January 2006. The director established that the applicant had met the criteria for expulsion under domestic law in several respects. To begin with, the applicant had been logged in the criminal register nineteen times since 1995. While the majority of the sentences had been for minor offences \u2013 mainly against the Road Traffic Act \u2013 three of them were serious convictions. These were: one for domestic violence in 1999, resulting in a suspended custodial sentence of three months\u2019 imprisonment, and two others for wilful negligence of his obligation to pay maintenance, warranting sixty\u00a0days\u2019 imprisonment in 2003 and a suspended custodial sentence of forty-five days in 2005. Since the applicant had thus been found guilty of imprisonable offences (see paragraph 31 below), he fulfilled the criterion for expulsion as provided in section 10 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Foreigners\u2019 Residence Act (see paragraph 29 below). Secondly, despite repeated warnings by the cantonal immigration authorities, the applicant\u2019s financial situation had continuously deteriorated. In this regard the director held that, despite having had several jobs in the gastronomic sector, the applicant had repeatedly tried to start his own business and had frivolously invested money in projects with poor prospects. His debts were therefore self-imposed and, from an overall perspective, he had, continuously throughout the years, failed to show any willingness to observe public order and to integrate into the Swiss system. He therefore additionally fulfilled the condition for expulsion according to section 10 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Foreigners\u2019 Residence Act (see paragraph 29 below) and section 16 of its Implementing Ordinance (see paragraph 30 below). By contrast, despite still not having paid back to the State all the maintenance received for his family, after 30\u00a0September 2004 the applicant\u2019s family had no longer been dependent on social welfare. Therefore, section 10 \u00a7 1 (d) of the Foreigners\u2019 Residence Act (see paragraph 29 below) no longer applied to the applicant. With regard to Article 8 of the Convention, the director further established that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was a proportionate interference with his right to respect for family life. The applicant had maintained close ties with his home country, which he had visited on many occasions. The applicant\u2019s wife had lived in her home country until the age of nineteen and she had visited Turkey, together with the children, on many occasions. Moreover, she had also accumulated debts amounting to CHF\u00a0134,830 (approximately EUR 110,388) and was receiving an invalidity pension. Lastly, the children were still relatively young (the oldest daughter being ten years old at the time of the decision) and they would therefore not encounter any serious difficulties if they returned to Turkey with the applicant. The public interest in expelling the applicant to Turkey therefore outweighed his personal interest in remaining in Switzerland.",

With particular regard to the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention, both courts held that, considered as a whole, his expulsion was proportionate. Even though the applicant had been living together with his wife again since October 2004, his matrimonial situation had not proved to be very stable in the past. Furthermore, despite having maintained a close relationship with his children, for many years \u2012 until September 2004 \u2012 he had completely neglected his obligation to pay them maintenance. Moreover, it would be possible to maintain a relationship with them at a distance without serious difficulty. The courts also found that the family would not encounter any major obstacles if they returned to Turkey with the applicant. The children were still at an age where they could easily adapt to a new environment and the Turkish language was their mother tongue. Furthermore, his wife had not proved to be particularly well integrated in Switzerland and was receiving an invalidity pension. The expulsion order against the applicant was therefore upheld.",

The Court therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s request to strike out the application pursuant to Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.

Furthermore, he had been sentenced for that offence in 1999, more than eight years before the final domestic decision. In addition he claimed that it was due to his financial difficulties that he had not been able to pay the maintenance, and his behaviour could therefore not be considered criminal sensu stricto. He had not thereby endangered public safety or public order or the economic wellbeing of Switzerland. It had also been the social security department, and not his wife, who had brought a criminal complaint against him in that respect. Lastly, the applicant argued that the rest of his offences had been minor ones: most of them concerned breaches of the Road Traffic Act which dated back ten to fifteen years. Hence, the applicant\u2019s convictions were not of a kind that would lead to the conclusion that he did not have the will or capacity to adapt to public order.",

This was the reason why he had been unable to pay maintenance and his family had been dependent on social welfare. Nevertheless, neither the Canton of Basel-Stadt nor Switzerland had been damaged by his behaviour.

The applicant had been sentenced repeatedly for criminal offences between 1995 and 2005. His convictions in 1999, 2003 and 2005 were particularly serious, not only because they included custodial sentences but also because they had been directed against members of his own family.

However, Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see Pretty\u00a0v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002-III) and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity (see Mikuli\u0107\u00a0v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 53176/99, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-I). It must therefore be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8.

While the Court agrees with the applicant that his convictions for failing to pay maintenance do not reveal strong criminal intentions, it considers that his conviction for domestic violence in 1999 was a serious one, especially since it was based on not only one but multiple incidents of domestic violence which were in part committed with a dangerous object. The Court further notes that the applicant had received repeated warnings from the immigration authorities and he must therefore have been aware that, under the Foreigners\u2019 Residence Act, he could be expelled if he committed an offence punishable with imprisonment (see paragraph 29 above). The Court has therefore no reason to doubt that those convictions, especially when considered in the context of the applicant\u2019s behaviour on a whole, were valid reasons for expulsion.

In this regard they had considered that despite the immigration authorities\u2019 repeated warnings, the applicant\u2019s financial situation had continuously deteriorated because of his unsuccessful attempts to establish a business of his own. The Court therefore agrees with the domestic authorities that the applicant lacked the necessary diligence and responsibility in financial and professional matters, with the result that the number of debts increased and he and his family were dependent on social welfare until September 2004. Since the applicant, furthermore, only changed his behaviour in financial matters once he had been informed by the immigration authorities in October 2004 that his expulsion was imminent, the Court takes the view that the domestic authorities rightly assumed that the applicant\u2019s behaviour had been a threat to public order.",

However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant\u2019s residence status remained uncertain between 1989 and 1993, when he was awaiting the outcome of his asylum request, and also between September 2004 and October 2007, when the domestic proceedings regarding his residence permit were pending. The Court is therefore not willing to attribute the same weight to the duration of the applicant\u2019s stay in Switzerland as it would do if he had lived there with a valid residence permit throughout that period. Moreover, after 1997 the applicant was repeatedly cautioned by the immigration authorities and he must therefore have been aware that immigration measures were imminent if his situation and behaviour did not improve.",

Unlike the case of Emre (cited above, \u00a7 77), he had spent his childhood in his home country, Turkey, where he had received a school education. Furthermore, his parents still lived there and, as stated by the Government, between 2003 and 2007 he had regularly returned to Turkey for periods as long as several months. While the Court is prepared to accept that in 2008, at the time he returned to Turkey, the applicant\u2019s ties with his country of origin might have weakened after all the years spent in Switzerland, it regards it as sufficiently established that the applicant had retained some social and cultural \u2013 including linguistic \u2013 ties in addition to family ties.",

In financial matters, however, he grossly neglected his duties towards them. Furthermore, from 2004 until 2008 he once again lived with his wife and helped her with the upbringing of the children. The separation from his family between 2008 and 2013 therefore certainly affected all family members. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s submissions, the Court however considers that his expulsion to Turkey had not impeded him to maintain a family life. On the one hand, the Court holds that, it had been possible for the applicant to stay in contact with his family even from a distance without difficulties. It thereby takes into account that between 2008 and 2013, the applicant had been allowed to visit his family once in Switzerland and that his family also had the possibility to visit him in Turkey. On the other hand, the Court also takes the view that no major obstacles existed in 2008 for the applicant\u2019s family to accompany him to Turkey. In this regard it reiterates that the applicant\u2019s wife also originates from Turkey, where she lived until the age of nineteen and where she had regularly returned, together with her children, for holidays. It therefore seems clear to the Court that she had maintained social and linguistic ties with her country of origin. Furthermore, the Court agrees with the domestic authorities that at the time of the final domestic decision on 24\u00a0October 2007 the children were still of an age where they would be able to adapt to a new environment without serious difficulties, not least because Turkish was their mother tongue, they knew Turkey from their holidays when they were visiting relatives, and they were to return to Ankara, a city with a well-established education system. Therefore, the Court holds that even if their relocation would have led to a certain uprooting since they had spent all their previous life in Switzerland, it cannot be said that their interests as children were not duly taken into account.",

Based on those particular facts, the Court therefore holds that the entry ban was not overly intrusive as regards the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see, by contrast, Emre, cited above, \u00a7 85, and the case-law referred to therein).",

The Court also reiterates that the domestic authorities had in their judgment already noted the fact that the applicant had resumed matrimonial life and had been fulfilling his financial duties towards his family from October 2004 onwards. The Swiss authorities decided at that time, however, that the public interest in favour of deportation prevailed. The Court considers that, having identified the relevant factors, the domestic authorities\u2019 assessment of the weight to be accorded to each of these factors was within their margin of appreciation according to Article 8 of the Convention.",

It may well be that domestic legislation, including a concept such as \u201cpublic order\u201d, can be applied by domestic authorities to a foreigner\u2019s financial situation, as seems to have been the case here.
