However, during her detention she was not provided with the treatment needed for her pregnancy and therefore she could have suffered a miscarriage. Furthermore, according to her, the detention centre authorities did not provide her with any food or water until the next morning. The food she received was unsavoury, and she was warned by her cellmates not to eat it. Moreover, she was detained in a cell measuring 5 square metres with three smokers, even though she had informed the authorities that she was a non-smoker and that smoke was harmful to someone in her condition. The cell had four bunk beds and was cold. She was forced to sleep in a bed that had a mattress but no bed linen or duvet. The cell had a sink and a squat toilet. The toilet was separated from the rest of the cell by a curtain and was covered with a plastic device to prevent rats from entering the cell. A shower was fitted above the toilet which was also used for flushing it. No warm water was available and the cold water from the sink was contaminated and could not be used for drinking. Furthermore, she was allowed only thirty minutes of outdoor exercise at the same time as her other three cellmates, in a yard measuring 6\u00a0or\u00a07\u00a0square metres. It had walls three metres high and was covered by a metal grill. The other three cellmates smoked constantly in the yard, so it was filled with cigarette smoke because fresh air could not enter as a result of the very high walls.",

These medical documents had also been the only documents presented by the applicant to the prosecutor on 31 October 2014 and prior to 6 November 2014. Given the information contained in the documents, the prosecutor investigating the case could have only acknowledged the fact that the applicant had been suffering from an inflammation of the uterus and had been prescribed Utrogestan, a medicine which could have been prescribed both before her pregnancy as well as during it. However, none of the available medical documents stated that the applicant was pregnant. Furthermore, she had never informed the investigating authorities verbally that she had been in a vulnerable state. The ultrasound image was at best an inconclusive piece of evidence, considering that the applicant herself had stated that after the gynaecological examination of 31 October 2014 (when the ultrasound image had been produced), the doctor himself had not been able to confirm whether she was pregnant.
