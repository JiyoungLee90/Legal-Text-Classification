In the opinion of the court the provision in question should also apply to all procedural decisions during the criminal proceedings, such as, for example, the imposition of pre-trial detention. The court underlined the fact that in respect of such procedural decisions the broad definition \u201cparticipation in a case\u201d should apply. On the contrary, if the disqualification of a judge only meant that no second judgment could be given by the same judge, then the legislator would have adopted a narrower definition, namely, \u201cparticipation in examination of the merits of the case\u201d (\u201cwy\u0142\u0105czony od udzia\u0142u w rozpoznaniu sprawy\u201d).

In this regard, it would observe that the investigation was completed by the prosecution authorities within a short period of time. The Court notes that it took the trial court three and a half months to prepare the case for the first hearing. Moreover, the hearings were held at regular intervals (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). Lastly, the Court notes that the criminal case at issue was a complex one on account of the number of co-accused and the charges against them. A significant amount of evidence had to be examined in the course of the proceedings.
