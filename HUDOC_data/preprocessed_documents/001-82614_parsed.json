Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable-time requirement in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation, since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have fully understood the situation by choosing to combine the two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (see S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], cited above, \u00a7100).",
