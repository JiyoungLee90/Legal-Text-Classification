The courts noted that there was \u201cinformation\u201d (see paragraph 9 above) confirming that the applicant, together with an associate, had intended to eliminate evidence and incriminating documents, thereby impeding the on-going investigation; this \u201cinformation\u201d was, however, not specified. The Court would add at this juncture that the reliance by the courts on elements undisclosed to the suspect is hardly reconcilable with the principle of \u201cequality of arms\u201d generally required in the field of guarantees against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The Court acknowledges \u201cthe need for criminal investigations to be conducted efficiently, which may imply that part of the information collected during them is to be kept secret in order to prevent suspects from tampering with evidence and undermining the course of justice. However, this legitimate goal cannot be pursued at the expense of substantial restrictions on the rights of the defence. Therefore, information which is essential for the assessment of the lawfulness of a detention should be made available in an appropriate manner to the suspect\u2019s lawyer\u201d (see \nGarcia Alva v. Germany, no. 23541/94, \u00a7 42, 13 February 2001).",

Poland, no. 33079/96, \u00a7 93, 22\u00a0February 2001). The absence of the risk of collusion was indeed reflected in the domestic court decisions given during this period. Similarly, following the termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate at the Municipal Council, the authorities found the risk of reoffending unfounded (see paragraph 19 above). In fact, after 22 November 2010 references were made only to the danger of the applicant\u2019s absconding (see paragraph 21 above).

Austria, 27\u00a0June 1968, \u00a7 10, Series A no. 8). Nor did the authorities give any reason for not countering the risk of the applicant\u2019s potential absconding by a measure less stringent than pre-trial detention, such as house arrest. Even more striking is the lack of any assessment or reasoning in this regard, in the face of the fact that release on bail had already been considered on 25 January 2011 (see paragraph 22 above) and the applicant had actually been released into house arrest on 13 May 2011.",

In applying this consideration, the courts relied on section 129(2) b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 27 above). However, for the Court, this reasoning, which borders on speculation in the absence of ascertainable information concerning the actual situation, sits uncomfortably with the letter of the law, which requires in this hypothesis that a reason \u201cother\u201d than that of absconding should necessitate the continued detention, in order to secure the suspect\u2019s availability to justice. In the Court\u2019s eyes, however, the reasons invoked by the courts can hardly be construed to demonstrate such a reason, distinct from the risk of absconding.",
