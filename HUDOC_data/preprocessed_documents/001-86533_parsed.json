The prison management confirmed to the ad hoc commission that special measures had indeed been considered, but that it had been unable to introduce any such measures because of the lack of prison staff, the lack of space (80 prisoners more than the prison\u2019s official capacity), the lack of another maximum-security prison in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the fact that prison transfers between the Entities were not envisaged. Seven other prisoners detained in Zenica Prison (six Bosniacs and one Serb), who had also been convicted of war crimes, testified before the ad hoc commission, claiming that the applicants had good reasons to fear for their lives. The witness of Serb origin, D.S., maintained that he had also been and still was subjected to persecution by his fellow prisoners because of the nature of his offence.

The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of secure custody and care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. Further, management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority. Specific security measures adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered (including effective search procedures) may well be required; however, such measures can never be more than an adjunct to the above-mentioned basic imperatives.

Another approach is to disperse prisoners suspected or convicted of sexual offences throughout the prison concerned. If such an approach is to succeed, the necessary environment for the proper integration of such prisoners into ordinary cell blocks must be guaranteed; in particular, the prison staff must be sincerely committed to dealing firmly with any signs of hostility or persecution. A third approach can consist of transferring prisoners to another establishment, accompanied by measures aimed at concealing the nature of their offence.

The criteria for considering a claim as \u201carguable\u201d cannot be construed differently from the criteria applied when declaring claims \u201cmanifestly ill-founded\u201d (see Powell and Rayner, cited above, \u00a7 33, and Kienast v. Austria, no.\u00a023379/94, \u00a7\u00a054, 23 January 2003).\u00a0At the same time, notwithstanding the terms of Article 13 read literally, the existence of an actual breach of another provision of the Convention (a \u201csubstantive\u201d provision) is not a prerequisite for the application of Article 13 (see Klass and Others v. Germany, judgment of 6 September 1978, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a028, p.\u00a029, \u00a7\u00a064, and Boyle and Rice, cited above, p.\u00a023, \u00a7\u00a052).",

The applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 2 is thus likewise manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and must be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7 4.",

It is crucial that the complaint in issue was not declared manifestly illfounded\u00a0and\u00a0that it accordingly necessitated an examination on the merits (see \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v. , no.\u00a044093/98, \u00a7\u00a057, 26 October 2004).\u00a0The applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 13 taken in conjunction with Article 3 must therefore be declared admissible.
