France, 29\u00a0July 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 34-44, Reports 1998-V). The question before the Court is, rather, whether the respondent State has taken all the measures available to it to organise its judicial system in a way that would render the rights guaranteed by Article 6 effective in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Uni\u00f3n Alimentaria Sanders S.A. v.\u00a0Spain, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 38, Series A no.\u00a0157, and Davran v.

In examining this question, the Court is conscious of the context in which the case arose, notably that of the hostilities in the region, and notes that it would be artificial to examine the facts of the case without considering that general context (see Khlebik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 2945/16, \u00a7 71, 25 July 2017, with further reference).",

Whilst the final decision as to observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court, it is no part of the Court\u2019s function to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best policy in this field. Nonetheless, the limitations applied must not restrict the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Cordova v. Italy (no. 1), no. 40877/98, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2003-I, and Lupeni\u00a0Greek Catholic Parish and Others, cited above, \u00a7 89).",

Equally, in the present case the Court considers that the domestic authorities took the steps reasonably expected of them to ensure the proper functioning of the judicial system making it accessible to the residents of the territories currently outside the control of the Government (see, a contrario, Khamidov, cited above, \u00a7 156). In the absence of any evidence that the applicants\u2019 personal situation precluded them from making use of that system, the Court concludes that in the circumstances of the present case the applicants\u2019 inability to bring their claims before the courts in their city of residence did not impair the very essence of their right of access to court. The limitation of that right was due to the objective fact of the hostilities in the areas the Government do not control (see paragraph 47 above) and, taking into account the objective obstacles that the Ukrainian authorities had to face, was obviously not disproportionate.",
