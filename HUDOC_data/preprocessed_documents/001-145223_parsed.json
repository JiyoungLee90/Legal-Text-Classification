She had decided jointly with the children to leave the marital home and the children refused to return to the former family environment which they considered hostile as a result of the father\u2019s abusive behavior. It noted inter alia that according to the children they had not perceived their father as a model and disapproved his abusive behavior. They referred to restrictions and physical punishments which they had considered unfair. They had witnessed their parents\u2019 disputes and they had perceived their mother as a victim. Consequently, they empathised with her. In the case of divorce they wished to live with their mother because they felt close to her and because she had constantly supported them both morally and affectively. They wished to remain in the mother\u2019s custody and from the beginning they had been happy with the idea of moving to Bra\u015fov. They had been familiar with the new environment because they had often visited their maternal grandparents during the holidays and had contact with the mother\u2019s extended family. They had been enrolled in school and they were adapting gradually to the new situation. They had made friends and the language barrier problem had almost disappeared.",

It held that after the children had arrived in Romania they had settled in Bra\u015fov together with their mother and had been enrolled in school. The social inquiry had shown that the children had been familiar with the new environment because they had often spent their holidays there with their maternal grandparents and with their mother\u2019s wider family. However, according to the decision of the U.S. courts and the available evidence, the applicant enjoyed joint custody of the children and had a right to decide where they should live. Moreover, while the applicant had agreed that the children could leave the U.S., his wife\u2019s failure to return them to the U.S., the country of their habitual residence, was unlawful. Although, the applicant and his wife had discussed the option to leave the U.S. and to return to Romania, a final decision had not been taken in that regard prior to her departure. Furthermore, her argument that the applicant\u2019s strict social and religious upbringing of the children posed a serious risk if they were to return to the U.S. and would expose them to physical and psychological harm, within the meaning of Article 13 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Hague Convention, was unfounded. However, citing the Elisa Perez-Vera Explanatory Report and Article 13 \u00a7 2 of the Hague Convention, and taking into account the available evidence, the court held that the children\u2019s views concerning the essential question of whether they should return to the U.S. or remain in Romania could be decisive, because they had attained an age and degree of maturity sufficient for their views to be taken into account. This was the only reason the court refused to order their return to the U.S. In this context, it acknowledged that the twins were less than ten years old at the time, an age considered by Romanian law to be the minimum age for the views of a child to be taken into account. However, A.H.B. was eleven years old and she had stated freely and unequivocally that she wished to stay in Romania, where the children were integrated in their new school and extra-curricular environment. Consequently, the opinion of the twins could not be ignored by the court, given that it was not in the best interests of the children to be separated and that their potential return to the U.S. would generate new and potentially traumatic circumstances affecting their psychological development.",

Also, the court had failed to provide any reasons why it considered all his children sufficiently mature in order to rely on their opinion. He argued that allowing A.H.B. to make decisions also for her siblings was unacceptable. The Romanian Ministry of Justice argued on behalf of the applicant that the court had incorrectly assessed the evidence in the file and had considered the opinion of an eleven year-old sufficient for its decision. Since there was no evidence in the file to suggest that the children\u2019s return to the U.S. would expose them to serious harm, the Romanian authorities had a duty to return them to their State of habitual residence.",

At the same time, the refusal to order the return of the children was based on Article 13 \u00a7 2 of the Hague Convention; it did not amount to a transfer of jurisdiction to the Romanian courts in respect of custody matters because the Hague Convention itself provided for the refusal to return in exceptional circumstances and gave precedent to the child\u2019s best interest.

They had all freely and unequivocal stated, in the absence of any parents or relatives, that they did not wish to return to the U.S. The children had shown a sufficient degree of maturity in expressing their opinions. They understood their situation and made logical assessments which were not plagued by contradictions concerning their relationship with their parents, their future perspectives in the two countries and their views on family life. In this context, the argument that the twins were under ten years old at the time and that therefore their opinions could not be considered relevant for the case was unfounded. In addition, the lower court\u2019s reliance on Article 13 \u00a7 2 of the Hague Convention was also justified by A.H.B.\u2019s clear refusal to return to the U.S. Her refusal was compelling and had been expressed at an age and maturity which fulfilled the requirements set out in Article 13 \u00a7 2 of the Hague Convention. According to the evidence and the psychological evaluation reports available in the case file, the connection between the three siblings was very strong. Consequently, an assessment that the twins did not show a sufficient degree of maturity in expressing their opinions would not serve the best interests of the children. A separation of the siblings would be traumatic and would have a detrimental impact on their future psychological development. Also, according to the conclusions of the psychological evaluation reports the children\u2019s separation from the current environment would result in a serious risk for them. Furthermore, there was no evidence in the file to support the applicant\u2019s argument that his wife had denied him personal relations with his children and had deprived him of his family life. In addition, the present case did not concern custody rights; consequently, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that under the domestic legislation it should not attach more weight to the children\u2019s statements than to those of the parent exercising his parental rights or that by doing so it had discriminated against him in relation to his wife.",

It had not misinterpreted the provisions of Article 12 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Hague Convention, given that its decision had been based on the best interests of the children, as required by Article 13 \u00a7 2.

It appears from this report that, in order to discourage the possibility for the abducting parent to have his or her action recognised as lawful in the State to which the child has been taken, the Convention enshrines, in addition to its preventive aspect, the restoration of the status quo, by an order for immediate return of the child, which would make it possible to restore the situation that had been unilaterally and wrongfully changed. Compliance with custody rights is almost entirely absent from the scope of this Convention, as this matter is to be discussed before the relevant courts in the State of the child\u2019s habitual residence prior to removal. The philosophy of the Hague Convention is to fight against the multiplication of international abductions, based always on a wish to protect children by acting as interpreter of their real interests. Accordingly, the objective of prevention and immediate return corresponds to a specific conception of \u201cthe child\u2019s best interests\u201d. However, as the child\u2019s removal may be justified for objective reasons which have to do either with his or her person, or with the environment with which he or she is most closely connected, the Convention allows for certain exceptions to the general obligations on the States to ensure an immediate return (\u00a7 25). Since the return of the child is the basic principle of the Convention, the exceptions to the general duty to secure it form an important element in understanding the exact extent of this duty, and it is possible to distinguish exceptions which derive their justification from three different principles (\u00a7 27). Firstly, the authorities of the requested State are not bound to order the return of the child if the person requesting the return was not actually exercising custody rights or where his or her behaviour shows acceptance of the new situation (\u00a7 28). Secondly, paragraphs 1b and 2 of Article 13 contain exceptions which clearly derive from a consideration of the interests of the child, to which the Convention gives a definite content. Thus, the interest of the child in not being removed from his or her habitual residence without sufficient guarantees of stability in the new environment gives way before the primary interest of any person in not being exposed to physical or psychological danger or being placed in an intolerable situation (\u00a7 29). Lastly, there is no obligation to return a child when, in terms of Article 20, his or her return \u201cwould not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\u201d (\u00a7 31). The explanatory report, which sets out those exceptions, also emphasises the margin of appreciation inherent in the judicial function.",

Although primarily intended for the new Contracting States and without binding effect, especially in respect of the judicial authorities, this document seeks to facilitate the Convention\u2019s implementation by proposing numerous recommendations and clarifications. The Guide repeatedly emphasises the importance of the Explanatory Report to the 1980 Convention, known as the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report, in helping to interpret coherently and understand the\u00a01980\u00a0Convention (see, for example, points 3.3.2 \u201cImplications of the transformation approach\u201d and 8.1 \u201cExplanatory Report on the Convention: the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report\u201d). In particular, it emphasises that the judicial and administrative authorities are under an obligation, inter alia, to process return applications expeditiously, including on appeal (point 1.5 \u201cExpeditious procedures\u201d). Expeditious procedures should be viewed as procedures which are both fast and efficient: prompt decision-making under the Convention serves the best interests of children (point 6.4 \u201cCase management\u201d).",

He had therefore incurred much higher legal costs than the children\u2019s mother.

Accepting that there was an interference in the applicant\u2019s right to family life, it is clear that such interference was based on law, since the Hague Convention, which entered into force in Romania in September 1992 (see paragraph 72 of the judgment), must be considered as a part of that country\u2019s domestic law. The Romanian courts applied that law, taking the evidence that they examined into account in an immediate and direct way. They relied on different types of evidence: a private report (paragraph 15), an official report prepared by the Brasov Guardianship Authority (paragraph 17) and testimony by the applicant\u2019s children (paragraph 20). As a result, the Romanian courts (the Bucharest County Court initially, and the Bucharest Appeals Court in a final decision) ruled that the best interests of the children would be better protected if the applicant\u2019s action were dismissed, and the children were allowed to remain in Romania. The reasoning of both the County Court and the Court of Appeal was extended and detailed (see paragraphs 20 and 31), and explicitly assessed the credibility and reliability of the children\u2019s testimony, given their youth (nine-year old twins and an eleven-year old sister). Furthermore, it must be stated that this is also the approach followed by Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003, concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibilities, Article 11 of which states that \u201cWhen applying Articles 12 and 13 of the Hague Convention, it shall be ensured that the child is given the opportunity to be heard during the proceedings unless this appears inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity\u201d.",

They concluded that the return of the children would be detrimental to their psychological equilibrium, and would have subjected them to pressures which could have affected negatively their future development (see paragraph 34).",

On the contrary, the facts of the case show that the Romanian courts did indeed carefully assess the balance of interests at stake. It is always possible to propose or suggest additional and alternative elements to those present in the domestic courts\u2019 rulings. But the question here was whether those courts took the relevant facts of the case into account (such as the psychological reports and the testimonies of the children) and whether, in view of those facts, they reached a decision and explained it in a rational and non-arbitrary way. Since they did, and since this Court lacks any means for directly assessing those elements, I do not believe that this Court can deem the Romanian courts\u2019 determination of what constituted the best interest of the children as \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d.",

But here, once again, I do not find that the duration of the proceedings violated that Convention provision. The entire proceedings lasted eleven months. Yet the initial judgment of the Bucharest County Court was given less than two months after the Romanian Minister of Justice instituted proceedings on behalf of the applicant. Moreover, the substantive content of that judgment, dismissing the applicant\u2019s petition, was ultimately upheld by the Bucharest Court of Appeal after the applicant\u2019s two appeals. Given this circumstance and the importance of the matter, the length of the proceedings was not excessively long. Furthermore, the proceedings were further extended by the fact that the Romanian legal system allowed the applicant to resort to internal remedies to defend his position against the initial decision denying his petition.",

In view of Article 11 of the Hague Convention, a provision which states that \u201cthe judicial and administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children\u201d, and for the reasons set out above, the Chamber ought to have ruled that the Romanian Courts acted with the required rigour and expedience, and thus fulfilled their obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.",
