In particular, he stated that the crime he had been convicted of had been of moderate gravity, that he had been living in Russia permanently and legally since 1991, that he had obtained his university degree in Moscow, that he spoke fluent Russian, and that he was the head of a company in Moscow, where he also had real estate. Furthermore, the applicant pointed out that prior to his conviction he had had no record of criminal or administrative violations, and that there had been no evidence that he would pose a threat to society when released from prison. He further stressed that all the members of his family, that is Ms\u00a0N.\u00a0A. and his daughters, were Russian citizens, that he had had an ongoing family life since 1995, and that Ms N. A. and his two daughters maintained regular contact with him in prison by visiting him, making regular telephone calls and frequently exchanging letters. Lastly, the applicant pointed out that his family members were unable to relocate to India, as Ms N. A. had a permanent job in Russia, both daughters went to school there, and none of them spoke the main language needed to reside in India. The applicant argued that the courts of first and second instance had not taken all of the above factors into account when upholding the exclusion order, and had based their conclusions only on the fact that he had a criminal record.",
