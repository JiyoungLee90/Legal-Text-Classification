There had been Russian military checkpoints on the roads leading to and from the settlement. The armed men who had abducted Balavdi Ustarkhanov had Slavic features and spoken Russian without an accent, which proved that they were not of Chechen origin. The men had arrived in the vehicles commonly used by the military, late at night, which indicated that they had been able to circulate freely past curfew. The men had carried out an identity check and taken away two passports, one of which was later found in the vicinity of the local checkpoint of the Russian federal forces. They were wearing specific camouflage uniform, were armed and had portable radio sets. Since Balavdi Ustarkhanov had been missing for a very lengthy period, he could be presumed dead. That presumption was further supported by the circumstances in which he had been arrested, which should be recognised as life-threatening.",

They further argued that there was no convincing evidence that the applicant's son was dead. The Government raised a number of objections to the applicant's presentation of facts. The fact that the perpetrators of the abduction spoke unaccented Russian and were wearing camouflage uniforms did not mean that these men could not have been members of illegal armed groups, criminals pursuing mercenary goals or the men with whom Balavdi Ustarkhanov had fought on the night of 31 December 2002 to 1 January 2003. The Government further alleged that the applicant's description of the circumstances surrounding the abduction was inconsistent. In particular, referring to the statements provided by the applicant and other witnesses to the domestic investigation, the Government stressed that they had not seen in person Balavdi Ustarkhanov being taken away in a grey UAZ vehicle and a ZIL lorry, and that therefore this information was unsubstantiated; that the applicant had failed to inform the investigators about Mr Magomed M.'s neighbours across the street, who had witnessed the abduction, and that she had failed to provide the investigators with the name of the intermediary who had approached her with an offer to assist in obtaining the release of her son. In addition, the applicant had not informed the investigators that on 3 January 2003 she had gone to Zakan-Yurt to take her son to the hospital.

The investigation in case no.\u00a044011 was instituted on 21 January 2003, that is, fourteen days after Balavdi Ustarkhanov's abduction. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that a number of essential steps were subsequently either delayed or were not taken at all. For instance, the Court notes that although, according to the Government, the domestic investigation questioned a number of persons about the circumstances of the abduction, it appears that the vast majority of them were residents of Achkhoy-Martan (see paragraph 46 above) and not of Zakan-Yurt, where the abduction had taken place; that the eight residents of Zakan-Yurt questioned by the investigators had not witnessed the events (see paragraph 43 above); that the investigators also failed to question the neighbour of Mr Magomed M. who lived across the street and those relatives of Mr Madomed M. who were present during the abduction (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). Further, the Court observes that the investigators did not identify or question any representatives of lawenforcement agencies or the military who could have had information about the group driving around in Zakan-Yurt during the curfew hours, or that they identified and questioned the servicemen who had manned the checkpoints in the vicinity of Zakan-Yurt. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities' failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7 64, Reports 1997III).",

The Court thus doubts that legal drafting was necessarily time-consuming to the extent claimed by the representatives.
