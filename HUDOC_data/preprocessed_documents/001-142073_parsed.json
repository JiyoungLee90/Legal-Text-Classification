The Court has found that the following conditions of detention raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention: lack of appropriate furniture in the cells; poor sanitary facilities, such as a limited number of toilets and sinks for a large number of detainees; toilets in cells with no water supply; sinks in cells providing only cold water for a wide range of needs (personal hygiene, washing clothing and personal objects, cleaning the toilets); limited access to showers providing hot water; poor sanitary conditions in general, including the presence of cockroaches, rats, lice and bedbugs; worn-out mattresses and bed linen; and poor quality food (see Iacov Stanciu, cited above, \u00a7 175).",

It would also be desirable for alternative solutions to solitary confinement to be sought for persons considered dangerous and for whom detention in an ordinary prison under the ordinary regime is considered inappropriate (see Piechowicz v. Poland, no. 20071/07, \u00a7 164, 17 April 2012). Indeed, solitary confinement, which is a form of \u201cimprisonment within the prison\u201d, should be resorted to only exceptionally and after every precaution has been taken, as specified in paragraph 53.1 of the European Prison Rules adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006 (see \u00d6calan v.

Therefore, it may be questioned whether the living space available to the applicant for a period of ten years and seven months in Craiova Prison could be regarded as attaining acceptable standards.
