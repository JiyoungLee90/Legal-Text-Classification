The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether the systematic nature of the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was, in itself, sufficient to find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, as, in any event, the Government have not offered any compelling reasons for the restriction or demonstrated that the absence of legal assistance at the initial stage of the investigation did not irretrievably prejudice the applicant\u2019s defence rights (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 58, and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3\u00a0others, \u00a7 274, ECHR 2016). In that respect, the Court notes that in convicting her, the first-instance court relied on the applicant\u2019s statements to the police. Moreover, it did not examine the admissibility of evidence at the trial. Likewise, the Court of Cassation dealt with this issue in a formalistic manner and failed to remedy this shortcoming (see Bayram\u00a0Ko\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 38907/09, \u00a7 23, 5 September 2017).",
