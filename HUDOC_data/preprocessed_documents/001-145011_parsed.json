Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court\u2019s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would legitimise particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weaken the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98).",

Firstly, the Court reiterates that there was a lacuna in Turkish law at the material time regarding the detention of foreign nationals in the context of immigration controls, whereby such practice was not regarded as a deprivation of liberty but as mere \u201caccommodation\u201d or \u201csheltering\u201d of foreigners in removal centres or \u201cguest houses\u201d pending their deportation (see, for instance, Abdolkhani and Karimnia, cited above, \u00a7 120, as well as the relevant extract from the Amnesty International report cited in paragraph 32 above). The wholly arbitrary practice governing the deprivation of liberty of immigration detainees raises a legitimate concern about the extent to which these individuals\u2019 rights would be upheld when challenging the conditions of their unrecognised detention. Secondly, as noted by the UN Special Rapporteur and the European Commission, at the material time there was no comprehensive regulation in Turkey on the conditions in which irregular immigrants should be detained (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). In its response to the CPT report of 16 December 2009, the Government indicated that the Directorate General of Security had been tasked with preparing a directive concerning, inter alia, the material conditions in foreigners\u2019 removal centres and that the \u201cbasic elements\u201d set out in Circular no.\u00a0632 would apply in the interim (see paragraph 29 above). The Court notes that the Government have not provided any information on whether the \u201cbasic elements\u201d are being enforced. Nor have they indicated whether the aforementioned directive has come into force. In these circumstances, even assuming that detention conditions in foreigners\u2019 removal centres were amenable to review, as indicated by the Government, the standards against which such conditions would be assessed are unclear.",

In these circumstances, the Court has no option but to make an approximate assessment of floor space per detainee, by dividing the total area of the rooms allocated to the male detainees (674 sq. m) by the total number of those detainees. Accordingly, having regard to the numbers provided by the Government, even on 28\u00a0February 2011, when the male detainee population was at its lowest (a total of 156 as indicated in the chart in paragraph 20 above), the personal space per male detainee was approximately 4.32 sq. m, which is marginally higher than the recommended minimum area of 4 sq. m. The Court notes that the floor area per detainee dropped as low as 3.58 sq. m on 1\u00a0March 2011, when the total number of male detainees recorded by the Government increased to 188. In the light of those figures, which in reality should be significantly lower in view of the fixtures in the rooms, it is reasonable to consider that the applicant did not have sufficient personal space in his dormitory room even on the basis of the more favourable data provided by the Government.",

In particular, the number of male detainees reported by the MPs, which was 297 on the day of the scheduled visit, shows that the personal space per male detainee at the relevant time was only 2.27 sq. m, which in itself would lead to a violation of Article 3.",

Russia (dec.), no.\u00a030138/02, 16 September 2004), the Court considers that the applicant did not enjoy sufficient freedom of movement either. The Court notes first and foremost, and with grave concern, the applicant\u2019s allegation that he was not allowed to step outside the building even once during the entire period of his detention, that is, for approximately six months. While the Government indicated by way of response that detainees were authorised to go outdoors \u201cin appropriate weather conditions\u201d, they did not state whether the applicant had benefited from that right or how often such authorisation was granted. In any event, access to outdoor exercise is a fundamental component of the protection afforded to persons deprived of their liberty under Article 3 and as such it cannot be left to the discretion of the authorities; according to the CPT, all detainees, even those confined to their cells as a punishment, have a right to at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day regardless of how good the material conditions might be in their cells (see the CPT standards, document no. CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1Rev. 2013, \u00a7 48). This, however, was clearly not the case at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre at the relevant time, as also reported by the CPT, the UN Special Rapporteur and the delegation of Turkish MPs (see paragraphs\u00a028, 30 and 26 above, respectively). Bearing in mind the purpose of detention of individuals pending deportation, the Court notes furthermore that certain aspects of the conditions in which the applicant was detained were even stricter than the Turkish prison regime for prisoners serving a life sentence (see X v. Turkey, no. 24626/09, \u00a7\u00a7 25 and 26, 9 October 2012 for the relevant domestic-law provisions governing the Prison Service and execution of sentences).",

It is therefore not necessary to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining allegations regarding the conditions of his detention. The Court nevertheless wishes to stress that although there is no conclusive proof that the applicant contracted tuberculosis during his detention at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre, overcrowding, coupled with the absence of regular exercise and lack of hygiene in places of detention, may lead to the spread of contagious diseases which the national authorities have a duty to prevent, as the CPT has indicated time and again (see, for instance, paragraph 27 above).",
