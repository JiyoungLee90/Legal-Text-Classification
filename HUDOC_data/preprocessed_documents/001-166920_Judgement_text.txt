The case originated in an application (no. 55382/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Mr Viktor Aleksandrovich Zabelin and Ms Galina Pavlovna Zabelina (“the applicants”), on 10 December 2007. Ms Zabelina died on 24 December 2013.
The applicants were represented by Mr M. Krylovskiy, a lawyer practising in Tambov. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the removal of their travel documents had been unlawful.
On 10 September 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1942 and 1943, respectively, and lived in Tambov.
On 25 April 2007, the applicants’ son, P.Z., was charged with largescale fraud; his name was placed on the list of fugitives from justice.
On 7 May 2007 the Basmannyy District Court in Moscow authorised a search of the applicant’s flat in Tambov with a view to locating P.Z. and removing accounting, legal and financial documents relating to the alleged fraud.
The search was carried out three days later and a number of documents, communication devices and the applicants’ travel passports were removed.
The applicants complained to a court about the investigator’s actions. They submitted, in particular, that there had been no legal basis for removing their identity documents.
On 9 July 2007 the Basmannyy District Court rejected their complaints. It held that it was not competent to review the way in which the evidence in the criminal proceedings had been obtained, and that the applicants’ constitutional rights had not suffered any impairment.
On 10 October 2007 the Moscow City Court upheld the District Court’s decision in a summary fashion, without addressing the applicants’ arguments.
