The Court of Appeal took the view, in sum, that this was tantamount to implying that only an adjournment of the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the commission\u2019s work could have preserved its fairness. Noting that the courts were frequently confronted with media interest in a given case, the Court of Appeal was of the view that this fact, in itself, did not suffice for the fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant to be called into question.",

In the present case, the Court of Appeal could not identify any circumstance that would lead it to believe that the witnesses heard by the Regional Court had been influenced by the content of their previous statements to the commission or by those of other witnesses.",

It has also pointed out, in Konstas v. Greece (no.\u00a053466/07, \u00a7\u00a036, 24 May 2011), that the Convention must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory, and that therefore the presumption of innocence cannot cease to apply in appeal proceedings simply because the accused was convicted at first instance.",
