The Court is therefore not satisfied with the Government's explanations as to how the applicant sustained the injuries found on his body (see Getiren v.

Bearing in mind the authorities' obligation to account for injuries caused to persons under their control in custody, and in the absence of a convincing explanation by the Government in the instant case, the Court considers that the injuries recorded in the medical report of 27 February 1999 were the result of treatment for which the Government bear responsibility. The Court further observes that the respondent Government failed to make any submission as regards the nature and degree of the ill-treatment. In the absence of such an explanation, and having regard to the extent of the injuries noted in the medical report of 27\u00a0February 1999, as well as to the strong inferences that can be drawn from the evidence that the ill-treatment was inflicted in order to obtain information from the applicant about his suspected connection with the MLKP, the Court is led to conclude that the ill-treatment involved very serious and cruel suffering that can only be characterised as torture (see, among others,\u00a0Salman v.
