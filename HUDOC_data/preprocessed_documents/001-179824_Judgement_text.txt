The case originated in an application (no. 41333/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Ivan Viktorovich Makarskiy (“the applicant”), on 23 February 2015.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 1 December 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1989.
On 27 December 2010 the applicant was arrested on drug-related charges and placed in custody.
On 14 December 2012 the case was submitted for trial to the Voronezh Regional Court.
On 11 July 2013 the court returned the case to the deputy Prosecutor General for remedying certain procedural defects.
On 20 September 2013 the Investigations Department of the Federal Drug Control Service received the case file and forwarded it to its regional branch in St Petersburg.
On 1 November 2013 an investigator asked the St Petersburg City Court to extend the applicant’s detention for a further four months, until 31 March 2014. On 8 November 2013 the City Court granted the application. The applicant filed an appeal. He pointed out that the maximum statutory time period for keeping him in pre-trial detention had expired a long time ago and that any further extensions had been unlawful.
On 27 November 2013 the St Petersburg City Court rejected his appeal in a summary fashion, without examining his arguments in detail.
