Thus, the fact that a number of aliens are subject to similar decisions does not in itself lead to the conclusion that there is a collective expulsion if each person concerned has been given the opportunity to put arguments against his expulsion to the competent authorities on an individual basis (see Andric, cited above).",

Switzerland, 15 June 1992, \u00a7\u00a034, Series A no. 238; Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 36, Reports [of Judgments and Decisions] 1996-III; Dalban v.

It is clear that these conditions were not fulfilled in the instant case, since it appears that the reason the applicant was not expelled on the collective flight of 20 December 2005 was because of the interim measure adopted by the Court on the basis of Rule 39 of its Rules of Court. The Government are therefore mistaken in alleging that the complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 has become devoid of purpose.",

In their decisions rejecting those requests, and particularly the request of 10\u00a0January 2006, the domestic authorities took account not only of the overall context in Afghanistan, but also of the applicant\u2019s statements concerning his personal situation and the risks he would allegedly run in the event of a return to his country of origin. Accordingly, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s situation was indeed examined individually and provided sufficient grounds for the contested expulsion (contrast, \u010conka, cited above).",
