According to the testimony given by the investigating judge, there was nothing to establish that the witnesses had not told the truth or wanted to incriminate the applicant; the witnesses had testified because they had been concerned about the applicant\u2019s health and had feared another attack by him. Furthermore, the police superintendent who had registered the witnesses\u2019 criminal charge on 26\u00a0November 2011 had testified that on this occasion he had been spontaneously told by the witnesses - prior to their subsequent questioning - that the applicant had attacked members of his family with an axe. The  pointed out that as opposed to the witnesses\u2019 subsequent testimonies to the police, these spontaneous statements did not have to be excluded from the trial pursuant to section 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but constituted admissible evidence. In addition, another policeman had testified that the applicant\u2019s mother had called him spontaneously on 3 December 2003 and had asked what further action would be taken as a result of the criminal complaint with a view to preventing a renewed unannounced visit and attack by the applicant.

The failure to appoint counsel prior to the hearing before the investigating judge did not exclude the latter\u2019s testimony about the witnesses\u2019 statements as long as the proceedings, seen as a whole, remained fair. To this end the investigating judge\u2019s testimony had to be carefully assessed. A conviction could only be based on the investigating judge\u2019s testimony if this testimony was corroborated by other important considerations.",

Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, \u00a7 34, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0194A; Luc\u00e0, cited above, \u00a7 40 and Gossa v. , no. 47986/99, \u00a7\u00a054, 9 January 2007). This implies that the use made of evidence admitted by the trial court must comply with the rights of the defence, in particular, where the accused has not had an opportunity at any stage in the earlier proceedings to question the persons whose statements are introduced into the trial (see, mutatis mutandis, Unterpertinger, cited above, \u00a7 31) and where they form the sole or decisive evidence for a conviction or related decision by the trial court (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 119). The Court has held in this context that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so-called \u201csole or decisive rule\u201d; ibid.).",

The court also referred, inter alia, to the witnesses\u2019 statements made prior to their formal testimonies vis-\u00e0-vis the police officer who had recorded the criminal charges brought against the applicant on 26\u00a0November 2003 as well as the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s enquiry of 3\u00a0December 2003 regarding the further steps taken by the police as a result of the criminal complaint. It further had regard to the injuries sustained by the applicant\u2019s brother, the submissions of the doctor who had treated the applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s wounds and the corpus delicti handed over to the police by the latter.

As regards the applicant\u2019s recollection of the events following the assault, the Court notes that this could at best provide indirect support for the claim that the applicant had attacked his sister and brother.",

In its judgment of 28 February 2005, the Regional Court in fact emphasised that its establishment of facts was not only based on the testimony by the investigating judge but also on three consistent witness statements that gave a coherent account of the events in issue and were credible. It thus appears that the \u2019s finding relied, at least to a significant extent, on the hearsay testimony of the only direct witnesses of the events in issue and whom neither the defence nor the trial court had an opportunity to examine. It was obviously evidence of great weight and the Court therefore concludes that the witness statements made by the applicant\u2019s mother, brother and sister at the pre-trial stage were decisive for the trial court\u2019s decision-making (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0131).",

At the same time the Court found that where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, it must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7 147). The Court observes that similar considerations are reflected in the Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 28\u00a0February 2005 stating, with reference to the Federal Court of Justice\u2019s related case-law, that since neither the accused nor counsel had been able to examine the witnesses against the accused, the trial court was requested to assess the investigating judge\u2019s testimony particularly critically and could only base its decision on such testimony if the latter was corroborated by other significant factors.",

In the Government\u2019s view they had thus had the possibility to form their own impression of the latter\u2019s credibility.

It is therefore questionable whether any statements made on that date or thereafter vis-\u00e0-vis the police officer can still be considered as being made spontaneously as assumed by the trial court. It is further not surprising that after such a considerable period of time the witnesses, having had ample opportunity to compare their recollection of the events, gave similar and coherent accounts of the alleged assault during their examination by the investigating judge. As regards the injuries sustained by the applicant\u2019s brother, the Court notes that the latter himself had adduced vis-\u00e0-vis the doctor who had treated him in hospital on 2 September 2003 and who had subsequently testified at the applicant\u2019s trial, that he had fallen through a glass pane. While this doctor, when examined at trial, expressed doubts as to the explanation given for the injuries, there is nothing in his testimony to establish that the injuries could in principle not have been caused by such an accident or that they had actually been caused by the axe that constituted the alleged corpus delicti. The Court further cannot but take note of the fact that even though the sister had undisputedly accompanied her brother to the hospital, she had not been examined by a doctor and no circumstantial evidence exists for any injuries, such as strangulation marks, sustained by her.",
