The Court of Appeal found that on 20 June 2012 the applicant\u2019s divorce claim was delivered to S.\u2019s representative. In that claim the applicant also sought to establish sole custody of the child; however, that claim did not mean that the applicant disagreed with the child\u2019s ongoing stay in Ukraine. Moreover, in July 2012, the applicant had spent a holiday with S. and M. in Ukraine and in August 2012, after his return to the USA, he had sent M.\u2019s vaccination certificate in order to facilitate M.\u2019s admission to a child-care centre in Ukraine. The Court of Appeal concluded that in these circumstances the applicant enjoyed custody rights in relation to M. and that he had failed to demonstrate that those rights had been violated. For those reasons the child\u2019s retention in that period could not be considered wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Convention.",

The Court of Appeal examined the evidence relating to the child\u2019s place of residence in Ukraine, and the social and medical care provided to him in Ukraine, and found that M. was assured of all the conditions necessary for his proper development. Based on the evidence presented and having regard to the overall period during which the child had lived in Ukraine, the Court of Appeal found that M. was entirely settled in his current environment. It also considered that M.\u2019s return to the USA without his mother \u2013 who no longer had legal basis for entering and living in the USA \u2013 would not be in the best interests of the child. The Court of Appeal therefore quashed the Desnyansky District Court\u2019s decisions of 19\u00a0June and 2 July 2013 (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) and dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim as unsubstantiated.",

The dispute arose as regards the subsequent period of the child\u2019s \u201cretention\u201d in Ukraine. In his final submissions before the domestic courts the applicant claimed that the retention began to be wrongful as of 20 June 2012 (see paragraph 31 above). With regard to that period the Court of Appeal found, in particular, that the applicant had visited the family in Ukraine, had spent holidays there and had also sent a vaccination certificate for the child\u2019s admission to the child-care centre in Ukraine (see paragraph 32 above). On the facts, the Court of Appeal concluded that the child\u2019s retention had not been wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Convention and that, in any event, given the length of the child\u2019s stay in Ukraine, he was entirely settled in the new environment and his return to the USA \u2013 a country in which the child\u2019s mother had no legal basis to live \u2013 would be contrary to his best interests (see paragraph 33 above).

They concluded that in fact the applicant had not objected to the child living in Ukraine until 14 August 2012, the date of his request to the Ukrainian authorities to ensure the child\u2019s return to the USA. Following such a finding, the question arose as to whether or not the child had been \u201chabitually resident\u201d in the USA on the date of the applicant\u2019s request and, consequently, whether there had been \u201cwrongful retention\u201d in the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention.",

Accordingly, taking into account the long period of residence in Ukraine, the parental views on the child\u2019s place of residence before the commencement of the Hague Convention proceedings, the young age of the child, and his close attachment to his mother \u2212 with whom he was sharing his family, social and everyday life \u2212 the child\u2019s country of habitual residence might have shifted from the USA to Ukraine, thereby precluding grounds under the Hague Convention for seeking the child\u2019s return to the USA.",

Nevertheless, the domestic courts, having regard to the above factual findings and to the manner the applicant exercised his custody rights, eventually concluded that the child\u2019s retention in Ukraine could not be regarded as wrongful in the meaning of the Hague Convention and there were therefore no grounds to make the return order. The courts also found in substance that the child was entirely settled in his current environment in Ukraine and that his removal to the USA, in the particular circumstances, would be contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. It follows that the domestic courts gave due consideration, within the scope of the Hague Convention proceedings, to the child\u2019s interests and carefully correlated them with other interests at stake. In these circumstances the Court takes the view that, having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the authorities in such matters, the decision of the courts to refuse to order the child\u2019s return was based on relevant and sufficient grounds and that the interference in the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention and considered in the light of the Hague Convention, was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

The Court accepts that the applicant\u2019s inconsistent position on the facts, and notably on the date from which he considered the retention of the child to have been wrongful, might have influenced the length of the proceedings.

Even though the domestic courts acted without evident delays, ensuring procedural rights of the parties in dispute, the overall length of the proceedings exceeded by far the six-week time-limit recommended in Article 11 of the Hague Convention. Furthermore, the Government have not explained the delay of about eight months between the submission of the request of 14 August 2012 to the Ukrainian Central Authority (see paragraph 14 above) and 10 April 2013, when the Chernihiv Regional Chief Department of Justice, acting in the applicant\u2019s interests, lodged a claim with the Desnyansky District Court (see paragraph\u00a017 above).
