On 13\u00a0November 2008, the Munich Regional Court issued the injunction and confirmed it on 15\u00a0December 2008 after hearing both parties. It held that even though there was a public interest in reporting about organised crime, the author had acted in breach of her journalistic duties. The internal reports of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation constituted an insufficient source for the allegations made in the book, since the reports were not intended for publication. The investigating authorities themselves had not come to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence of an offence having been committed by the plaintiff. Moreover, the Regional Court stated, a report on a suspicion also had to include the circumstances exonerating the party affected. Accordingly, the book should have stated that the investigating authorities had not obtained any indications which would have served as a basis for filing an indictment, much less a sentence, and that in fact the investigations pursued against the plaintiff had not resulted in any such bringing of charges or in any sentencing. In addition, the court held, the publication had not made it clear that the pizza restaurant \u201cDa Bruno\u201d, in which the murders had been perpetrated, was not identical to the pizza restaurant of the same name in which the plaintiff had worked as a pizza baker many years prior to those deeds. Lastly, the court continued, the book had been published unlawfully because the plaintiff had not been given any opportunity to make a statement regarding the suspicion prior to publication.",

It held that the book expressed a serious allegation that the plaintiff was a member of a criminal organisation and therefore seriously interfered with his personality rights. The section of the book dealing with the plaintiff did not allow an average reader to infer that the plaintiff\u2019s membership of the criminal organisation \u2018Ndrangheta could only be assumed vaguely. Rather, the court continued, the interplay of the many individual statements in the book created the impression that there was a very strong suspicion that the plaintiff was a member of the \u2018Ndrangheta. The evidentiary facts researched by the author and published by the applicant company did not constitute sufficient proof of the exceptionally grave suspicion raised in the book. The court established that even the internal report by the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation only mentioned a number of vague suspicious circumstances, for the most part without providing any details or naming any specific sources. For example, it said that because of the high respect in which the plaintiff was held in the \u201cItalian milieu\u201d, he must be a fully fledged member of the \u2018Ndrangheta. The internal reports only showed that owing to certain information compiled in them, some of which had not been corroborated by evidence, assumptions had been made as to the existence of certain connections. This did not seem to be a sufficient basis for publicly branding the plaintiff as a presumed \u02bdNdranghetista. Moreover, the court continued, certain statements in the book were incorrect, such as the region in which the plaintiff had been born. Other statements were fragmentary, as the investigation during which the plaintiff\u2019s restaurant was searched by the police had been discontinued. In that regard, the court held that the book had failed to report exonerating circumstances. Even though authors did not have to await the outcome of an investigation before reporting on a corresponding suspicion, if the reporting on a suspicion was reliant on investigations that had been carried out six or seven years previously, the author could not ignore the fact that the investigation proceedings had come to an end without any charges having been brought.",

The court stated that the prerequisite for any entitlement to pecuniary compensation was a serious violation of personality rights which could not be compensated in any other way. It found that that prerequisite had been met in the plaintiff\u2019s case. As far as the violation of the plaintiff\u2019s personality right was concerned, the Court of Appeal endorsed the reasoning of the Regional Court. It expressly conceded to the applicant company that there was great public interest in obtaining information about criminal organisations and \u201cthat the motivation of the author and of the defendant [in the instant case: applicant company] for informing the public on the activities pursued by the \u2018Ndrangheta in Germany was commendable and honest\u201d. However, the Court of Appeal continued, the applicant company had acted culpably to a significant extent. It had been grossly negligent on the part of the applicant company to disseminate an allegation based on a suspicion which seriously interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s personality right in spite of the fact that the plaintiff had obviously not been given an opportunity to be heard and that the allegation had been disseminated without including the necessary information that the murder investigation addressed by the book subsequently had been discontinued. This charge of gross negligence could not be put aside because the author had tackled a subject of strong public interest. The applicant company should have realised that the information compiled about the plaintiff was not corroborated by evidence and that there were insufficient evidentiary facts to support the allegation reported in the book. The applicant company could not argue that it had not acted culpably, as it had based its publication on information obtained from a governmental authority. That principle, the court held, had been developed by the courts in adjudicating for official press releases issued by German authorities. However, the author had relied solely on internal analyses prepared by the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation as well as evaluation reports and documents generated in the course of intra-agency communications between Italian government authorities.",

There had been sufficient reliable sources for that suspicion, including official reports of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, which had been identified as a source in the book. Since the report had come from an official and reliable source, the author was justified in refraining from further corroborating the information. The Court of Appeal had also neglected to take into account the fact that the author had researched the mafia for several years and interviewed a multitude of prosecutors, criminal investigators and other insiders, as well as the fact that the court had refused to hear the witnesses put forward by the applicant company. In addition, the applicant company had not been required to give S.P. an opportunity to be heard, as he had already denied his alleged membership when interviewed for a television report in 1997.

The Government emphasised parts of the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning and argued that a violation had been found not because the author and the applicant company had relied on an internal official report without any further research, but because they had gone beyond the suspicion mentioned in the report and insinuated that it was highly likely that S.P. was a member of the \u2018Ndrangheta. In addition, they had neither directly quoted the internal report by the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation nor clearly identified which information stemmed from the report. Moreover, the book contained false and misleading information corroborating the suspicion. The applicant company had failed to publish any information exonerating S.P. and lessening the degree of suspicion, as conveyed by the book. Having taken all those aspects into account, the Court of Appeal legitimately awarded S.P. damages. The amount of EUR 10,000 had been appropriate, as the violation of S.P.\u2019s personality right was serious and there had been no other effective alternatives, such as a printed retraction, to counter the misleading information published in a non-fiction book.",

Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78). The latter issue must be determined in the light of the situation as it presented itself to the newspaper at the material time (see Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no.\u00a021980/93, \u00a7 66, ECHR 1999III, and Yordanova and Toshev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 5126/05, \u00a7 50, 2 October 2012) and requires, in turn, consideration of other elements such as the authority of the source, whether the newspaper had conducted a reasonable amount of research before publication (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 313), whether the newspaper gave the persons defamed the opportunity to defend themselves (see Bergens Tidende and Others v.\u00a0Norway, no. 26132/95, \u00a7 58, ECHR 2000IV; Flux v.

In relation to the last point, the Court has emphasised that, as far as the press is concerned, news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 60, Series A no.\u00a0216, and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26\u00a0November 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 217).",

The Court of Appeal held that certain statements had been incorrect and that the internal reports of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation had only indicated vague suspicious circumstances regarding S.P.\u2019s alleged membership. The applicant company had exaggerated the level of suspicion conveyed by the internal official reports, and had been unable to prove the presented high level of suspicion by means of additional facts.

While journalists may rely on the former without further research, the same cannot be held for the latter. The Court concludes that even though internal official reports can be an important source, they cannot exonerate journalists completely from their obligation to base their publications on sufficient research. In this regard, the Court emphasises again that it is important that both categories of sources are clearly identified and the information taken from these sources is not presented in an exaggerated way. This holds particularly true in regard to reports concerning allegations of criminal conduct, where the right to be presumed innocent is at issue.

It is true that, when taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern, an individual is allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements. However, the Court considers that there is a difference between acceptable exaggeration or provocation, or somewhat immoderate statements, and the distortion of facts known to the journalists at the time of publication (see Kania and Kittel v. Poland, no.\u00a035105/04, \u00a7 47, 21 June 2011). Nonetheless, it is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, \u00a7 146, ECHR\u00a02007V). The question is not how the Court or a national court would have worded particular statements, but whether statements went beyond the limits of responsible journalism (see Yordanova and Toshev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053). In particular, where criminal allegations are concerned, it has to be kept in mind that the suspect has a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proven guilty and that the courts are the proper forum for the determination of a person\u2019s guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (see Erla Hlynsdottir (no. 3), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 65).",

It also observes that the Court of Appeal awarded S.P. only half the amount he had asked for and ordered the applicant company, but not the author, to pay damages. Lastly, it notes that the German courts awarded an even higher amount in a comparable case (see paragraph 28 above). The Court agrees with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal that in the particular circumstances of the present case, namely a book that has already been published, a mere injunction could not fully rectify the interference with S.P.\u2019s reputation. It further agrees with the Government\u2019s argument that, in contrast to a publication in a newspaper, a printed retraction would not have constituted effective redress either. Lastly, the applicant company did not submit any evidence regarding the overburdening character of the amount or the specific consequences for their financial situation (compare Ashby Donald and Others v. France, no.\u00a036769/08, \u00a7 43, 10 January 2013).",

This assumption was based on a variety of sources, including the official reports of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation. In those circumstances, contrary to the findings of the present case, the case-law does not require that journalists undertake independent research. The case-law also provides that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without further verification (see Koniuszewski v. Poland, no.\u00a0619/12, \u00a7 58, 14 June 2016, with references to other case-law).",

Moreover, the possible meaning of \u201chigh level of suspicion\u201d (see paragraph 47 of the judgment) in terms of the Court\u2019s case-law is also unclear to me.
