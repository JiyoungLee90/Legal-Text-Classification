However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity (see Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 100\u2013101, ECHR 2001-VIII). Whether the severity of the ill-treatment or neglect reaches the threshold prohibited by Article 3 will depend on the particular circumstances of the case, including the age and state of health of the person concerned as well as the duration and nature of the treatment and its physical or mental effects (see Sawoniuk v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a063716/00, 29 May 2001).",

However, this provision does require the State to ensure that prisoners are detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, their health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland\u00a0[GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94, ECHR 2000XI).",

There is no reason to believe that the treatment administered to him was inadequate. He was regularly examined by specialists, including twice by Dr S., a prominent neurologist and a member of the  of Medical Science. He received timely and regular treatment which apparently improved his condition. Admittedly, the treatment did not prevent the applicant\u2019s having two ischaemic strokes and several hypertensive attacks. However, the Court does not consider on the basis of the material before it that the authorities can be held responsible for those incidents. It appears that they were the intrinsic consequence of the applicant\u2019s chronic cardiac diseases rather than the result of any discernible shortcoming in the treatment (see, for similar reasoning, Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 96 and 97, and Sakkopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 40).",

Indeed, the applicant\u2019s condition since December 2007 has been stable. He has not had any recurrences of his illness and his blood pressure appears to have returned to normal. His condition has been monitored by a doctor and he has received regular treatment.

France, no.\u00a058749/00, \u00a7\u00a7 82, 83 and 89, 15 January 2004).

The applicant in the present case did not allege that his state of health prevented him from taking care of his personal needs. Nor did he describe the physical conditions of his detention in remand centres SIZO-3 and SIZO-4 in any detail. Therefore, his complaint about the alleged incompatibility of his state of health with detention is generic and unsubstantiated. Moreover, it transpires from the materials in the case file that the domestic authorities were mindful of the applicant\u2019s situation and tried to improve the conditions of his detention. Hence, they transferred him from SIZO-3 to SIZO-4 precisely in order to ensure better conditions of detention and higher quality of medical supervision and care (see paragraphs 38 and 74 above).",

Accordingly, the City Court had repeated opportunities to consider the applicant\u2019s circumstances, including his state of health, and to examine the arguments for release advanced by him. Indeed, on 7 June 2007 the City Court had an occasion to observe the applicant\u2019s condition when he was brought to the courtroom on a stretcher accompanied by a doctor and a signlanguage interpreter. However, it rejected the applicant\u2019s arguments and extended his detention, finding that he might abscond or intimidate witnesses (see paragraph 33 above).",

As the Court has consistently held, the second limb of Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until his conviction, the accused must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continued detention ceases to be reasonable. A person charged with an offence must always be released pending trial unless the State can show that there are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons to justify his or her continued detention (see, among other authorities, Castravet v. Moldova, no.\u00a023393/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 and 32, 13\u00a0March 2007; McKay\u00a0v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a0543/03, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2006-...; Jab\u0142o\u0144ski\u00a0v.

Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as unconditionally authorising detention provided that it lasts no longer than a certain period. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a038822/97, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2003-I).",

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a054071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005, and Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 84-85, 26 July 2001). The national judicial authorities must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and must set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release.

Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Letellier v.\u00a0, 26 June 1991, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 207; also see Panchenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a045100/98, \u00a7 102, 8\u00a0February 2005; Goral v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a038654/97, \u00a7 68, 30 October 2003; and Ilijkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a081).

Indeed, several witnesses had requested, and were granted, anonymity because they had feared threats from the applicant, and one of them made written submissions to the remand court accusing the applicant of intimidation (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). Moreover, the judicial authorities took into account the applicant\u2019s position as the director of the companies whose business activities were under investigation, a position which gave him an opportunity to destroy evidence.

His restricted ability to move and, for some time, to speak, as well as the necessity for him to remain under constant medical supervision considerably reduced the danger of his absconding, reoffending, interfering with witnesses or destroying evidence. However, the domestic courts failed to take the changed circumstances into account and continued to extend the applicant\u2019s detention without any assessment of whether, considering the applicant\u2019s medical condition, that danger remained real. It is even more striking that after the applicant was brought to the courtroom on a stretcher accompanied by a doctor and a sign-language interpreter, since he could neither walk nor speak, the City Court found, without giving any reasons for that finding, that the risk of his fleeing from justice, reoffending or obstructing the proceedings still persisted (see paragraph 33 above). The Court is not persuaded by that finding. In its opinion, after June 2007 that risk was mitigated by the applicant\u2019s medical condition so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.",

The thrust of the applicant\u2019s complaint was directed against the alleged practical impossibility of lodging an application for release in the particular circumstances of his case, due to the fact that no hearing was held between 7\u00a0November 2007 and 11\u00a0February 2008. The Court is, however, not convinced by the applicant\u2019s allegation. It transpires from the documents in the case file that counsel for the applicant lodged an application for release on 20 December 2007 and that it was examined by the trial court on the same day (see paragraph 39 above).

Indeed, the hearings of 14, 21 and 28 January 2008 were postponed because the applicant could not be transported to the courtroom due to the unavailability of transport fit for his condition (see paragraph 13 above). However, the delay incurred as a result was negligible. On the other hand, there were circumstances that slowed the proceedings down through no fault of the authorities, such as the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation which prevented him from attending the hearings in November and December 2007, and counsel\u2019s leave in July and August 2008 (see paragraphs 12 and 16 above).
