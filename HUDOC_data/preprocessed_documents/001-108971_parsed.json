This \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access is an aspect, may be relied on by anyone who considers on arguable grounds that an interference with the exercise of his or her civil rights is unlawful and complains that no possibility was afforded to submit that claim to a court or tribunal meeting the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, inter alia, Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2005-X). Only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence of the executive and also of the parties, amounts to a \u201ctribunal\u201d within the meaning of the said provision (see, among other authorities, the Beaumartin v. France judgment of 24\u00a0November 1994, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 296-B). In determining whether a body can be considered to be \u201cindependent\u201d account must be taken of the manner of appointment of its members, the duration of their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures, and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see Campbell and Fell v. the , 28 June 1984, \u00a7 78, Series A no. 80).\u00a0The Court further recalls that decisions of administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 should be subject to subsequent control by a \u201cjudicial body that has full jurisdiction\u201d (see, Ortenberg v. , 25 November 1994, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 295B).",

However, irrespective of whether or not these changes resulted in the bodies concerned thereafter fulfilling the requirements of a \"tribunal\", the legislation in question only entered into force on 1 July 2006, which was more than a month after the Department of Geodesy had already rendered its decision in respect of the applicant\u2019s request (see paragraphs 16 and 30 above).",

This only changed with the adoption of the new Cadastre Act which entered into force on 11 September 2009 (see paragraphs 20, 22 and 23 above). In this regard the Court recalls that the issue of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally determined by reference to the date when the application was lodged with the Court (see Baumann v. France, no.\u00a033592/96, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2001-V (extracts)), this rule being, of course, subject to exceptions which may be justified by the specific circumstances of each case (see Demopoulos v. Turkey and 7 other cases (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99, 3843/02, 13751/02, 13466/03, 14163/04, 10200/04, 19993/04 and 21819/04), \u00a7 87, 1 March 2010, Nogolica v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a077784/01, ECHR 2002-VIII). In the present matter, however, the applicant lodged his application with this Court on 3 November 2006. It was not until 11\u00a0September 2009, almost three years later, that he could arguably have re-filed his registration request with the Municipal Cadastre Office and the Department of Geodesy and only then, if unsuccessful, have sought judicial review by means of an administrative dispute. Accordingly, it would be disproportionate to require the applicant to make use of this potential avenue of redress (see, mutatis mutandis, Piki\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 16552/02, \u00a7\u00a031, 18 January 2005; and Parizov v. \u201cthe \u201d, no. 14258/03, \u00a7 46, 7 February 2008).",

In particular, following the adoption of any civil judgment in favour of the applicant the registration of the easement at issue would still have been at the discretion of the same administrative authorities. Further, having offered no relevant domestic case-law in support of their contention, the Government have failed to show that in the specific circumstances of the present case a civil claim such as the one referred to would have been anything but theoretical (see, mutatis mutandis, Stojanovi\u0107 v.
