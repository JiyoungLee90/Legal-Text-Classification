Though the sums appear to be lower during the first few months, he had been subsequently receiving around 390 euros (EUR) per month in waiting period allowance. The regional ZPIZ relied on section 123 of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (hereinafter \u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d) and section\u00a0446 of the new Pension and Disability Insurance Act (hereinafter \u201cthe 1999\u00a0Act\u201d \u2013 see paragraphs 24 and 25 below). It noted that the applicant had been registered as unemployed on 3\u00a0March 2003 and had been a beneficiary under section 22 of the 1999\u00a0Act from 1 March 2003 to 7\u00a0October 2004. Thus, once his unemployment allowance had come to an end he had become entitled to a waiting period allowance under section 123 of the 1992 Act (see paragraph 24 below). The regional ZPIZ also noted that, under section\u00a0193 of the 1992 Act, beneficiaries were entitled to a waiting period allowance until they fulfilled the conditions for retirement (ibid.).",

Subsequently, on 28\u00a0June 2011 it adopted a decision granting him a disability allowance (nadomestilo za invalidnost) from 24 February 2011 onwards. The regional ZPIZ relied on the 1999 Act, which had introduced certain new disability benefits (the term \u201cdisability benefit\u201d is used to cover any type of allowance that arises from a disability) and discontinued some of those provided for under the 1992\u00a0Act, including the waiting period allowance. Sections 397 and 446 of the 1999 Act stipulated that a right to a disability allowance applied as from 1 January 2003 (see paragraph 25 below). The regional ZPIZ noted in its decision that the applicant had not been insured under the compulsory insurance scheme at the onset of his disability, but had been registered as unemployed on 3 March 2003 within thirty days of the final decision on his disability, as required by section\u00a097 of the 1999 Act. It was established that his capacity to work had in fact further reduced, even though the category (III) of his disability remained unchanged. The regional ZPIZ found that, pursuant to section\u00a094(1)(1) and (3)(1) of the 1999 Act, he should receive a benefit in the form of disability allowance, which in his case amounted to EUR\u00a0192.91. It drew the applicant\u2019s attention to section 185 of the 1999\u00a0Act, which required beneficiaries to inform the ZPIZ of any change in circumstances which could affect their rights under that Act (see paragraph\u00a026 below).",

In cases where a fresh assessment was made the 1999 Act was to be applied. The court concluded that the 1999 Act did not contain the right to a waiting period allowance. Instead, under section 94, it provided for the disability allowance (see paragraph 25 below) which had been correctly granted to the applicant.",

In judgment no.\u00a0VIII\u00a0Ips\u00a0389/2009 of 18 April 2011, the Supreme Court emphasised that the acquisition of rights under the 1999 Act meant that a beneficiary could no longer exercise his or her rights under the 1992 Act. In judgment no.\u00a0VIII Ips 402/2007 of 7 September 2009, it confirmed that the worsening of a medical condition which resulted in further workplace limitations had to be interpreted as the worsening of a disability within the meaning of section 397(3) of the 1999 Act, which in turn meant that a beneficiary\u2019s rights should be determined under the 1999 Act. In the case under consideration, this implied that the beneficiary could no longer receive the waiting period allowance but was instead entitled to disability allowance. The Supreme Court further confirmed that beneficiaries of the rights based on a remaining capacity to work (namely category II and III) continued to enjoy their rights acquired under the 1992 Act only if, at the time of reassessment of their rights, the factual situation, which was the basis for the decision granting rights under the 1992 Act, remained unchanged.",

It observes that he had been receiving a monthly waiting period allowance of about EUR 390 until February 2011, on the basis of a decision by the regional ZPIZ (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). The applicable legislation, both before the legislative reform in 1999 and afterwards, made the granting of a disability benefit dependent, inter alia, on the condition of having a limited capacity to work on medical grounds. The legislation also stipulated that beneficiaries were obliged to inform the authorities of any change in circumstances (see paragraphs 10 and 26 above). After the applicant sustained a shoulder injury and the regional ZPIZ, in 2011, reassessed his level of disability, finding that his capacity to work had further reduced, his waiting period allowance was replaced with a disability allowance of around EUR\u00a0190 per month, which is less than half of the amount he was receiving under the provisions of the 1992 Act (see paragraph 10 above). That was not because he no longer met the relevant eligibility criteria (compare and contrast Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7\u00a7 67-74, 8\u00a0December 2009, and Iwaszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 30614/06, \u00a7\u00a056, 26 July 2011), but because of changes in the law (see, mutatis mutandis, Laki\u0107evi\u0107 and Others v. Montenegro and Serbia, nos.\u00a027458/06 and 3 others, \u00a7 70, 13\u00a0December 2011, and Kjartan \u00c1smundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2004-IX) which were applicable to those who had either become disabled after 1 January 2003 or whose disability had worsened after that date (see section\u00a0397 of the 1999 Act, cited in paragraph 25 above, and the Supreme Court\u2019s position, cited in paragraph 28 above).",

That reinforced the applicant\u2019s legitimate expectation of continuing to receive a waiting period allowance after the legislative reform and, provided that he remained unemployed, until his retirement (see paragraphs 8 and 24 above). It was only when his disability was found to have deteriorated \u2212 a fact which he could have hardly predicted and prepared for \u2212 that he became affected by the new legislation. In the Court\u2019s view, this differential treatment of two groups of unemployed disabled workers \u2013 those whose disabilities remained unchanged and those whose disabilities had deteriorated after 1 January 2003 \u2013 which resulted in the applicant being suddenly divested of half of his disability benefit while being at the same time further limited in working opportunities, carries great weight in the assessment of the proportionality issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatits mutandis, Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

That vulnerability was precisely what the disability benefit in question was meant to address. The Court further notes that the applicant had been dependent on the waiting period allowance he had been receiving on a regular basis for more than six years (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). Even if he had certain savings (see paragraphs\u00a035 and 38 above), they appeared to have played no role in his eligibility for the disability benefit and moreover were clearly insufficient to provide for his long-term subsistence. The Court also observes that the decrease in the applicant\u2019s disability benefit, which seriously affected his means of subsistence (see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, \u00a7 74, 15\u00a0September 2009, and, by contrast, Valkov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos.\u00a02033/04 and 8 others, \u00a7 97, 25 October 2011), was not mitigated by any transitional measure allowing him to adapt to the new situation (see, mutatis mutandis, B\u00e9l\u00e1n\u00e9 Nagy, cited above, \u00a7 124).",
