He argued that he was a law-abiding citizen, a student of two university faculties and a member of the Municipal Council of his town. He had not given any reason to be beaten, verbally insulted and humiliated just at the whim of the police. The police should not intervene in private property at night and hit, insult and humiliate people just because they looked, or lived, differently. The facts as established by the prosecutor did not correspond to what had happened. All the facts had been established on the basis of the arguments of the police, who had apparently been instructed by police lawyers as to what they should say. During the questioning the prosecutor had made unpleasant remarks about the hairstyles, clothes and views of the young inhabitants of the house, which had influenced her decision to discontinue the proceedings.

As for the criteria concerning the notion of \u201cdegrading treatment\u201d, the Court notes that the treatment itself will not be degrading unless the person concerned has undergone humiliation or debasement attaining a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it has to be assessed with regard to the circumstances of any given case (cf., among many authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, cited above, and Dougoz v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a040907/98, \u00a7 44).",

Moreover, it is sufficient if the victim is humiliated in his or her own eyes (see Tyrer v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no.\u00a026, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a032, and Smith and Grady v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a033985/96 ; 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a0120).",

The Court notes that\u00a0it was at that moment that the police officers used truncheons against the applicants. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the manner of intervention of the police at that stage is particularly open to criticism. It has not been shown or argued that the applicants at that time\u00a0had\u00a0behaved in an aggressive manner which would have warranted the use of truncheons against them. Nor has the Court been presented with any evidence to show that at that juncture the applicants had offered any physical resistance. It must be noted that the young people, including the applicants, were at that time confronted by a group of police officers, specially trained and equipped to overcome physical resistance. Even assuming that when remonstrating with the police they questioned the need to show their identity documents or expressed objections as to the purpose of the intervention, the use of truncheons against the applicants can only be considered disproportionate to the situation. It cannot be ruled out that at that stage the use of force against the applicants was motivated rather by punitive intentions than by any genuine need to break or discourage any physical opposition.",

It is difficult to accept the Government\u2019s argument that, in the circumstances, any consent given by the applicants was free.

As the Court stressed in a similar case, Ku\u010dera v.\u00a0Slovakia (no.\u00a048666/99, judgment of 17\u00a0July 2007), safeguards should be in place in order to avoid any possible abuse in such circumstances and to ensure the effective protection of a person\u2019s rights under Article\u00a08 of the Convention.
