It has observed that the application of section 63(1)(1) is a matter of the police\u2019s \u201coperational freedom\u201d, \u201cwith a view to establishing a possible link between the person arrested and the offence committed\u201d and bearing in mind the police\u2019s task to prevent and investigate crime (\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 4453 \u043e\u0442 28.03.2012 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 5390/2011 \u0433., III \u043e.). The SAC has in addition held that when making an order under section 63(1) of the Act the police are not under an obligation to specify the offence which the arrestee is suspected of having committed (\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 3475 \u043e\u0442 09.03.2012 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 5290/2011 \u0433., V \u043e.; \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 4453 \u043e\u0442 28.03.2012 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 5390/2011 \u0433., III \u043e.). In some cases it has required that the detention order under section 63(1)(1) of the Act should mention the factual grounds substantiating the suspicion required (\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 4410 \u043e\u0442 02.04.2009 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 6839/2008 \u0433., III \u043e.), but in another case it has held that the order did not necessarily have to refer to the relevant factual circumstances (\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 5651 \u043e\u0442 15.05.2008 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c.\u00a0\u0434. \u2116 9712/2007 \u0433., III \u043e.).",

That provision has not been construed by the domestic courts as allowing the arrestee to apply for release prior to the expiry of the statutory limit of twenty-four hours, but only as permitting subsequent judicial review of the respective detention order, carried out in accordance with the standard rules of administrative procedure. Arrestees taken into police custody have attempted to seek to obtain immediate release relying on Article 250 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, which provides that everyone can seek the cessation of the unlawful actions of an administrative body (\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 13420 \u043e\u0442 16.10.2013 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 13132/2013 \u0433., V \u043e.). However, in one case the SAC found such an application for release inadmissible, on the ground that there was a written detention order, which precluded the applicability of Article 250 of the Code of Administrative Procedure. Moreover, the SAC noted that at the time of examination of the application for release, the actions complained of, namely the claimant\u2019s detention by the police, had already ended. It observed further that as the detention order was subject to judicial review, this would also include a review of the lawfulness of the police\u2019s actions taken in its implementation (\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 12313 \u043e\u0442 21.10.2010 \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 12343/ 2010 \u0433., I \u043e.).",

As regards the detention in Stara Zagora, the suspicion had been based on the fact that several thefts had been committed in the city with a modus operandi unlike any previously known to the police. In respect of the first applicant\u2019s arrest in Burgas, the suspicion stemmed from the way he and Mr D. had behaved when approached by the police and from their alleged attempt to hide objects they had been carrying. It was not necessary at such an early stage for the police to dispose of sufficient evidence for the bringing of charges.

They pointed out that the Convention required a \u201creasonable\u201d suspicion, and not mere doubts, and that the Government\u2019s allegations that such a suspicion existed were \u201carbitrary\u201d. The applicants noted, in addition, the police\u2019s statement, in relation to their arrest in Stara Zagora, that it was necessary to check them because they had been behaving rudely and arrogantly (see paragraph 12 above). They considered this as recognition on the part of the authorities of the unfoundedness of their detention. As to the first applicant\u2019s arrest in Burgas, the applicants pointed out that in the proceedings brought by Mr D. concerning identical factual circumstances, the Burgas Administrative Court had found that it had been unclear what offence the claimant had been suspected of (see paragraph 23 above). Moreover, still in relation to that case, it was noteworthy that the objects allegedly found by the police, a pair of pliers and gloves, had never been seized for the purposes of a criminal investigation (see paragraph 21 above). Lastly, the applicants reiterated their statements that while in custody they had not been allowed, or were allowed very briefly, to see their counsel.",

As regards the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d required under that provision, the Court reiterates that the fact that an applicant has not been charged or brought before a court does not necessarily mean that the purpose of his detention was not in accordance with that provision. Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges. However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention (see \u0130pek and Others v. Turkey, nos. 17019/02 and\u00a030070/02, \u00a7 29, 3 February 2009). For there to be reasonable suspicion there must be facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed an offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 32; Labita v.

Lastly, the Court notes that the suspicion should relate to a specific offence (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, \u00a7 102, Series A no. 39, and Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 145B).",

In particular, the Government alleged that the applicants had been detained, as provided for by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (c), for the purpose of bringing them before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence.

In most cases, including those under examination, the courts have not construed section 63(1)(1) as allowing the police discretionary power to detain and have sought to establish the existence of a reasonable suspicion. However, the SAC has also held that the police had the \u201coperational freedom\u201d to decide whether to arrest (see paragraph 26 above). Moreover, the Court notes that section 63(1)(1) of the MIAA does not expressly provide that an arrest can only be lawful if it is carried out with the purpose of bringing the person concerned before a judicial body and instituting criminal proceedings; nor have the parties submitted information and decisions of the national courts showing that that requirement has been applied to cases concerning police detention. Thus, as will be discussed below, even though in the present cases the applicants were not detained with the purpose of a criminal investigation, the domestic courts found the detention to be in compliance with section 63(1)(1) of the MIAA.",

There are indeed instances where such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others.

The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov\u00a0v.

However, despite this wording, the courts have interpreted that provision as only permitting subsequent judicial review of the respective detention order, which, if successful, could lead to the award of compensation (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). The provision has not been construed as allowing an arrestee to seek release. Moreover, applications under this provision are examined under the general rules of administrative procedure, which do not contain any particular requirements for speediness. Thus, when the applicants availed themselves of the remedy under section 63(4) of the MIAA, the examination of their applications for judicial review took many months and, in the case concerning the first applicant\u2019s detention in Burgas, more than a year (see paragraphs 11, 15, 19 and 22 above).
