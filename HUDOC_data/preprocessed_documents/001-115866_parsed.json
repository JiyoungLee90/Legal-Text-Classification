In contrast, as stated in the certificates issued by the acting director of the colony, dormitory room no. 6 was equipped with 39 sleeping places and dormitory room no. 3 had 27 sleeping places. Furthermore, the acting director noted that it was impossible to provide statistical information on the number of detainees kept together with the applicant in the dormitories, as daily logs of the prison population had not been drawn up. At the same time, given that the number of inmates had never exceeded the design capacity of the colony dormitories and the inmates had always been distributed evenly among the dormitories, there was no doubt, in the acting director\u2019s view, that the applicant had always had a sleeping place. In particular, as confirmed by the certificates presented by the Government, each year between 2006 and 2011 the Stavropol Regional Service for the Execution of Sentences capped the number of detainees who could be detained in correctional colony no. 8. In particular, for 2006, 2007 and 2008 the cap was 833 persons, with the actual number of detainees being 807, 679 and 696 in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, when the cap was set at 1,035 inmates, the colony had accommodated 822 detainees. In 2010 and 2011 the maximum number of inmates detained in the colony had varied slightly between 1,040 and 1,057, with the maximum capacity of the facility having been set at 1,056 and 1,100 persons, respectively.",

Another hour between 8.30 and 9.30 a.m. was devoted to the morning roll call of the prisoners. Between 9.30 and 11.30 a.m. detainees underwent various medical procedures. After lunch, from 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m., and another hour-long roll call, detainees were given more than three hours to take a bath in the colony bathhouse. Dinner from 6 to 8 p.m. preceded an hour and a half of personal time. The lights-out call was made at 10 p.m. The daily schedule of the colony population slightly varied on weekends, with educational and cultural activities or hobbies replacing the time afforded for medical procedures. The Government also submitted that the time for daily walks or personal time which inmates could spend outside the dormitories was never limited. The strict obligation to remain in the dormitory only applied at night time, between the lights-out and wake-up calls. Detainees could take walks in recreation yards, which measured between 365 and 380 square metres for each of the dormitory buildings.",

The applicant submitted that the situation had been particularly serious until 2009, when a new dormitory had been built in the colony. While not disputing the size of dormitory room no. 6, he argued that it had had 66 sleeping places. He, however, confirmed that he had at all times had an individual sleeping place. At the same time, given the number of detainees in the dormitory rooms, the entire space in them was taken up by two-tier bunks, thus leaving almost no personal space for inmates. He further submitted that the windows were not double glazed. In the absence of an artificial ventilation system, it was very cold in winter and hot in summer. The windows did not provide sufficient ventilation with fresh air, which had a further negative impact on the health of detainees suffering from tuberculosis. He insisted that inmates were not permitted to open window casings to let the fresh air in.",

The bunks were installed in such a way that some of them blocked the windows. The photos also showed a heavily scratched floor and walls with peeling paint.

On 30 November 2006 another examination of the applicant led to his treatment being amended. The tuberculosis specialist drew up a list of drugs which were to comprise the applicant\u2019s chemotherapy regimen, including isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, paracetamol and another medicine, which appears to have been an antibacterial drug. Three antibacterial drugs were crossed out from the list, with only rifampicin being left.

Those certificates recorded a calculation of the anti-tuberculosis medicines which remained in the colony on the last days of each year between 2006 and 2011. As is evident from those certificates, from 2006 to 2010 the colony did not have second-line anti-tuberculosis medicines, with the exception of kanamycin.

He prescribed the applicant a dose of antibacterial medicine based on a combination of isoniazid and ethambutol. The applicant did not cease to complain of coughing, fever, chest pain and headache.

On the basis of that exam, the doctor concluded that the applicant\u2019s tuberculosis had become destructive to lung tissue. A week later, ethambutol and a complex antibacterial drug based on isoniazid were introduced to his regimen. In October 2007 the applicant was sent for a chest tomography examination and his sputum and blood were taken for testing. Despite the fact that the doctor noted a clearly negative dynamic in the applicant\u2019s condition, the examinations did not lead to any recommendations or amendments in the treatment until the applicant started coughing up blood in December 2007. Having given him an injection of potassium chloride and having prescribed a synthetic analogue of vitamin K, a cough medicine, nasal drops, paracetamol, a muscle relaxant and antibiotics, the prison doctor sent the applicant for testing.

In March 2008 a medical panel declared that the applicant should be classed as category 2 disabled. Until December 2008 the applicant complained of permanent pain in the chest, fever, fatigue, a dry mouth, and coughing up blood.

As to the first argument, the Government stressed that the applicant had not complained to a court that he was not receiving adequate medical assistance and that the conditions of his detention were unsatisfactory. The procedure for making claims before a court was established in Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as clarified by the Supreme Court\u2019s Ruling no. 2 of 10 February 2009. Having relied on two cases examined by the Russian courts and the Court\u2019s findings in the case of Popov and Vorobyev v. Russia (no. 1606/02, 23 April 2009), they submitted that it had also been open to the applicant to lodge a tort action claiming compensation for damage caused by the allegedly inadequate medical assistance and poor conditions of his detention. Relying on Resolution no.\u00a0CM/ResDH(2010)35 adopted at the 1078th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the Government further noted that statistics and a number of cases presented to the Committee had demonstrated the developing practice of the Russian courts in awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by unsatisfactory conditions of detention. In the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s failure to apply to a Russian court with a complaint had to be interpreted by the Court as his unwillingness to comply with the admissibility requirements set out by Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention. The Government stressed that his complaints under Article 3 should therefore be dismissed for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and the complaints under Article 13 were obviously manifestly ill-founded.",

He further stressed that he had been unable to obtain the medical assistance he needed while in detention. He relied on various medical records showing that his condition had continued deteriorating even after the authorities had acknowledged that he had become disabled. He noted that for years the colony had not received necessary antibacterial medicines. It did not employ a sufficient number of medical specialists. It was impossible for inmates to receive daily medical assistance, given that doctors only saw patients for two-and-a-half hours per day, thus affording only a very short visit to each inmate. The applicant submitted that a large number of inmates died each year, with the number of deaths being bigger than at any other correctional facility in . The lack of medical assistance had subjected him to extreme suffering. The applicant further argued that his condition had been further exacerbated by the appalling conditions of his detention. He had been detained with many sick inmates in severely overcrowded conditions for years. His ability to leave the dormitory and to stay in the recreation yard could not have compensated for the lack of personal space, as the yard had also been too small to accommodate such a large number of inmates and had not offered any protection from the rain, sun or cold.",

In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000XI, and Handyside v. the , 7 December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 24).",

Even though the prosecutors\u2019 review undeniably plays an important part in securing appropriate conditions of detention, including the proper standard of medical care for detainees, a complaint to a supervising prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy, because of the procedural shortcomings that have previously been identified in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for instance, Pavlenko v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a042371/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89, 1 April 2010, and Aleksandr Makarov v. , no. 15217/07, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, 12 March 2009, with further references).

Croatia, no.\u00a051585/99, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001-VIII, and Gibas v. Poland, no. 24559/94, Commission decision of 6 September 1995, Decisions and Reports 82, pp. 76 and 82). The Court accepts the assertion that detainees may send their complaints to a prosecutor. However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings, which would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. The Court reiterates that, in the absence of a specific procedure, the ability to appeal to various authorities cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because such appeals aim to urge the authorities to utilise their discretion and do not give the complainant a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Dimitrov v. , no. 47829/99, \u00a7 80, 23 September 2004). Moreover, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant\u2019s complaints to various prosecutors resulted in their finding no flaws either in the level of the applicant\u2019s medical care or the quality of the conditions of his detention (see paragraph 33 above).

The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter\u2019s lack of funds. It considered that the scarcity of funds available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 71-79).",

Without embarking on an analysis of the relevance of those cases to the case at hand and deciding whether the two cases sufficiently demonstrate the existence of a developed, consistent and coherent practice of remedies being available for victims of Article 3 violations resulting from inadequate conditions of detention, a lack of medical assistance or its poor quality, the Court reiterates that to be adequate, remedies with which to hold a State accountable should correspond to the nature and kind of the complaints addressed to it. Given the continuous nature of the violation alleged by the applicant, in particular his complaint that he was suffering from an extremely serious medical condition, that his health was continuing to deteriorate in the absence of appropriate medical treatment and that he had continued to be detained in particularly poor conditions, the Court considers that an adequate remedy in such a situation should imply a properly functioning mechanism of monitoring the conduct of national authorities with a view to putting an end to the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights and preventing the recurrence of such a violation in the future. Therefore, a purely compensatory remedy would not suffice to satisfy the requirements of effectiveness and adequacy in a case of an alleged continuous violation of a Conventional right and should be replaced by another judicial mechanism performing both the preventive and compensatory functions.",

Being convinced that a preventive remedial measure would have had an evidently pivotal role in a case such as the applicant\u2019s, with his pleas of ongoing deterioration of his health in view of a lack of proper medical care and poor detention conditions, the Court finds that a tort claim was not able to provide the applicant with relief appropriate for his situation. The purely monetary compensation afforded by a tort action could not extinguish the consequences created by the alleged continuous situation. A tort claim would not have entailed the ending or modification of the situation or the conditions in which the applicant found himself. It would not have brought about an order to put an end to the alleged violation and to compel the detention authorities to offer the applicant the requisite detention conditions and medical care, and it would not have provided for any sanction for failure to comply, thus depriving a court examining the tort claim of the opportunity to take practical steps to eliminate the applicant\u2019s further suffering or to deter wrongful behaviour on the part of the authorities. This logic has been applied in a large number of cases raising an arguable claim under Article 3, with the Court insisting that if the authorities could confine their reaction in such cases to the mere payment of compensation, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice.

The Russian Government, however, did not submit any judicial decision showing that a complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the cases relating to conditions of detention or medical assistance that have previously come before it (see, for similar reasoning, Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0110). The absence of established judicial practice in this regard appears all the more clear in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which have Impaired Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms (\u201cthe Citizens\u2019 Rights and Freedoms (Judicial Complaints) Act 1993\u201d). The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness.

Furthermore, the Government also did not explain how, in the light of the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which concerned complaints about conditions of detention, the Chapter 25 procedure would work in respect of complaints of ineffective medical care for detainees, given the specificity of those complaints.",

While not losing sight of the Government\u2019s argument that a large number of tests were performed during the applicant\u2019s detention in the colony, the Court observes that it took the Russian authorities almost five years to perform the most essential test which should have guided the applicant\u2019s treatment through all those years. Despite the authorities\u2019 knowledge of the applicant\u2019s long-term illness and his remaining a smear-positive patient for so many years without any positive dynamic in his condition being recorded, it was not until 2011 that drug susceptibility testing was performed (see paragraph 31 above). The test revealed that the applicant suffered from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, being infected with strains resistant to at least two of the first-line drugs with which he had been treated during all those years. Without attempting to determine whether the applicant\u2019s MDR tuberculosis resulted from either primary infection with resistant bacteria or developed in the course of his treatment as a result, inter alia, of a failure to administer an adequate chemotherapy regimen, the Court finds it unsatisfactory that for so many years the colony medical personnel did not take any steps to establish the cause of the applicant\u2019s failing treatment with the most effective, first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, having disregarded the continuous deterioration of his condition.",

In particular, while accepting the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant was provided with anti-tuberculosis treatment, it reiterates that the mere fact that a detainee is seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical assistance was adequate (see Gladkiy v. Russia, no. 3242/03, \u00a7 89, 21 December 2010, with further references). It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that on a number of occasions the colony doctors recorded the absence of antibacterial medicines, having taken them out of the applicant\u2019s treatment regimen (see paragraphs 22, 29 and 30 above). It appears that the choice of medicines which the prison doctors were able to include in the applicant\u2019s treatment regimen was limited to those which the colony could obtain or the applicant\u2019s relatives could provide (see paragraph 24 above). While in other circumstances that situation may not be a matter of concern, the Court observes that in the applicant\u2019s case it was another sign of the colony\u2019s inability to provide him with adequate medical care. It reiterates that the authorities\u2019 inability to assure a regular, uninterrupted supply of essential anti-tuberculosis drugs to patients is a key factor in tuberculosis treatment failure (see, for similar reasoning, Yakovenko v. , no. 15825/06, \u00a7\u00a7 98-102, 25\u00a0October\u00a02007). As is clear from the records presented by the Government, until 2010 the colony only received one second-line tuberculosis medicine. Another medical certificate showed that, until at least the beginning of 2008, the colony only received a scarce amount of that second-line drug (see paragraph 22 above). The Court is concerned that the absence of the reserve antibacterial drugs may well have been the reason behind the colony doctors\u2019 decision to delay the applicant\u2019s drug susceptibility testing.",

For instance, almost two months passed between the tests revealing that the applicant had become smear-positive and his starting to receive treatment with antibacterial drugs (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). The evidence put before the Court also shows that the treatment the applicant was able to receive was unregulated and erratic. It appears that with a limited choice of antibacterial drugs, the colony doctors were juggling them in an attempt to respond to the applicant\u2019s growing health complaints and given the absence of any signs that any of the prescribed medicines were proving effective (see paragraph 27 above). While understanding the difficulty of the task faced by the colony medical personnel, the Court once again is not prepared to accept financial or logistical difficulties as circumstances relieving the domestic authorities of their obligation to organise the State\u2019s penal system in such a way so as to secure the health and well-being of detainees. The Court, accordingly, finds no excuse for the failure to promptly provide the applicant with anti-tuberculosis medicines appropriate for his state of health and notes with concern that the treatment which the applicant received on his admission to the colony hospital either did not differ at all or was substantially similar to that administered to him on an outpatient basis in the colony itself. The applicant\u2019s short-term admissions to the colony hospital demonstrated attempts by the colony personnel to at least temporarily stop the applicant\u2019s condition from further deteriorating. But at the same time, they also show the absence of any comprehensive plan to manage the applicant\u2019s illness. It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that even when the treatment in the colony hospital was amended and led to a certain positive dynamic in the applicant\u2019s condition being recorded, on his release from the hospital the medical staff reinitiated treatment which had already proven to be ineffective, without giving any further thought to the necessity to reconsider that therapy (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).",

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161, Series A no. 25). However, Convention proceedings, such as the present application, do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the validity of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see, among other authorities, Kokoshkina v. Russia, no. 2052/08, \u00a7 59, 28 May 2009, and Ahmet \u00d6zkan and Others v. Turkey, no. 21689/93, \u00a7 426, 6 April 2004).",

He submitted colour photographs of his rooms in the dormitory, the sanitary facilities and recreation yard confirming his description. The Government, by contrast, confined their supporting evidence to numerous certificates from the colony management issued in July 2011, that is in the last month of the applicant\u2019s detention in the colony. They have not submitted any source materials on the basis of which the assertions of comfortable conditions of detention contained in those certificates could be verified. The Court would reiterate that on several previous occasions it has declined to accept the validity of similar certificates on the grounds that they could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable given the lapse of time involved and the absence of any supporting documentary evidence (see Kokoshkina, cited above, \u00a7 60; Sudarkov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3130/03, \u00a7 43, 10 July 2008; and Belashev v. Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7 52, 13 November 2007). When looking into the specific data provided by the Government to support their argument regarding how much personal space was afforded to detainees, the Court notes that the colony management either provided information which contradicted the Government\u2019s submissions (see paragraph 9 above, as regards the number of sleeping places) or provided no support for the Government\u2019s assertions, in view of the lack of any information on the basis of which the assertion could be made (see the same paragraph concerning the absence of inmate population logs). The certificates are therefore of little evidentiary value for the Court.",

He supported his submissions with colour photos of the dormitory room, confirming that the inmates\u2019 personal space was limited to their sleeping place and a narrow passage between the bunks. The Government argued that the applicant had had an individual sleeping place at all times and had been afforded between 2.75 and 3.13 square metres of personal space during the entire period of his detention, either in the colony dormitory or in its hospital. The Court, however, does not need to settle the differences between the parties\u2019 submissions for the following reasons.",

In those cases applicants were usually afforded less than three-and-a-half square metres of personal space (see, among others, Lind v. Russia, no.\u00a025664/05, \u00a7 59, 6 December 2007). At the same time, the Court has always refused to determine, once and for all, how many square metres should be allocated to a detainee in terms of the Convention, having considered that a number of other relevant factors, such as the duration of detention, the possibilities for outdoor exercise, the physical and mental condition of the detainee and so on, play an important part in deciding whether the detention conditions complied with the guarantees of Article 3 of the Convention (see Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, \u00a7 92, 19\u00a0July\u00a02007). As to post-trial detention facilities such as correctional colonies in , the Court has considered that personal space should be viewed in the context of the applicable regime, providing for a wider freedom of movement enjoyed by detainees in correctional colonies during the daytime and their unobstructed access to natural light and air. In a number of cases the Court has found that the freedom of movement allowed to inmates in a colony and unobstructed access to natural light and air have served as sufficient compensation for the scarce allocation of space per convict (see, among others, Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107, 24 July 2001; Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16\u00a0September 2004; Shkurenko v.

Even proceeding on the assumption that the Government\u2019s submissions pertaining to the personal space afforded are more accurate, the Court is not convinced that other aspects of the applicant\u2019s detention compensated for the cramped living conditions in the dormitory or the hospital. The Court does not lose sight of the fact that the colony where the applicant was detained was a medical detention facility, primarily meant to accommodate inmates suffering from serious forms of tuberculosis, including, such as the applicant, those who were smear-positive and thus extremely infectious. The applicant submitted, and the Government did not dispute that assertion, that the freedom of the inmates\u2019 movement was limited to their dormitory, the colony hospital, the sanitary facilities and the open recreation yard, which was used by approximately 250 detainees from the same division. While accepting the Government\u2019s argument that inmates were not restricted in their freedom of movement within the aforementioned facilities from the wake-up call in the morning to lights out at night, the Court does not find it surprising that inmates, seriously ill individuals, spent the major part of their day inside the dormitory. In fact, photographs of the dormitory room submitted by the applicant showed a large number of inmates in the room during the daytime. In this respect, the Court also notes the applicant\u2019s argument, as well as the colour photographs submitted by him in support of his claims, that the recreation yard was too small to accommodate the entire dormitory population and, in addition, did not offer any protection from bad weather or too much sun. The yard did not have benches or any other equipment which could have been used for rest or recreation. In addition to being in a rather rundown state, the yard was also used for storing garbage.",

The photos attest to the inmates\u2019 attempts to obtain at least some privacy by barricading their bunks with uniforms or bedding. The Court considers that in such circumstances the lengthy detention of the applicant, a seriously ill inmate, in particularly cramped conditions without a minimum level of privacy being afforded to him amounted in itself to inhuman treatment.",

However, the Court takes note of the photographs showing the interior of the applicant\u2019s dormitory rooms, the recreation yard and the sanitary facilities. The dormitory rooms, as well as the service premises, were evidently in a deplorable state of repair and cleanliness. The concrete walls, the ceiling and the floor were damaged. The metal beds were rusty and dilapidated, while the bedding was worn out and dirty. The toilet facilities were decrepit and did not offer sufficient privacy. The washbasin appeared to be eaten away with rust (see paragraph 19 above). The Court considers that such conditions can only be described as degrading and unfit for human habitation (see, for similar reasoning, Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 12555/04, \u00a7\u00a0126, 10 June 2010).",

The Court also considers that a metal net installed on the windows and visible on certain photographs served as an additional barrier to light. The Court therefore finds it established that the window arrangements in the dormitory rooms allowed little access to natural light and that the circulation of fresh air was equally limited although the dormitories housed inmates, such as the applicant, suffering from a serious pulmonary disease and thus requiring a good supply of fresh air.",
