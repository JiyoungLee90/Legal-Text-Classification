According to the families\u2019 complaints, those who ran the CEIS managed to bring about a complete change of personality in their followers, leading them to break off ties with their family and friends and inciting them to prostitution and other activities designed to obtain money for the organisation. The DGSC infiltrated an officer into the CEIS to check the truth of the complaints and, in the light of the findings, brought the facts to the attention of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the  Audiencia Territorial, who forwarded the complaints and the information gathered to the judicial authorities. Acting on this information,  investigating court no. 6 opened a preliminary investigation in June 1984 and ordered searches of the homes of members of the CEIS, including the applicants. The searches took place on 20 June 1984 and numerous people were arrested, including the applicants. After the applicants were arrested, they were transferred to the seat of the investigating court. In the light of information from A.T.V., an official at the DGSC, which was confirmed by the prosecuting authorities, there was a danger that the members of the sect would react unpredictably if they were released, and might even commit suicide. The duty judge nevertheless decided to release the applicants but gave oral instructions to the police that those detained, including the applicants, should be handed over to their families, to whom it should be suggested that it would be as well to have them interned in a psychiatric centre, on a voluntary basis as regards the persons of full age, in order for them to recover their psychological balance. The judge in question confirmed his oral instruction in a decision of 26 June 1984. In that decision he also ordered the chief of the Catalan police (mossos d\u2019esquadra) to interview and question all those detained during the searches who had subsequently been released.",

Once at the hotel, the applicants were taken to individual rooms under the supervision of persons recruited for the purpose, one of whom remained permanently in each room, and they were not allowed to leave their rooms for the first three days. The windows were firmly closed with wooden planks and the panes of glass had been taken out.

On 29 and 30 June 1984, after being informed of their rights, they were questioned by C.T.R., the Assistant Director-General of Public Safety, aided by A.T.V., in the presence of a lawyer not appointed by the applicants.

That isolation lasted for a very limited time and, it must be emphasised, with the agreement of those concerned and their families. \u2026 It cannot be maintained, in order to argue the contrary, that the wishes of the persons who underwent deprogramming could only have been overridden by the members of their families after proceedings to establish incapacity, seeing that the position of those concerned called for immediate treatment, without any delay, as appears from the judgment under appeal, which refers to fears that the members of the sect might commit suicide.",

In the Government\u2019s submission, the responsibility for the alleged deprivation of liberty lay with the members of the applicants\u2019 families and with the persons belonging to the Pro Juventud private association and not at all with the authorities and officials of the Catalan government.

Those instructions were confirmed in a decision of the investigating judge dated 26\u00a0June 1984. From the undisputed account of the facts it appears that, in accordance with the judge\u2019s instructions, the applicants were transferred by Catalan police officers in official vehicles to a hotel about thirty kilometres away from . There they were handed over to their families and taken to individual rooms under the supervision of people recruited for that purpose, one of whom remained permanently in each room, and they were not allowed to leave their rooms for the first three days. The windows of their rooms were firmly closed with wooden planks and the panes of glass had been taken out. While at the hotel the applicants were allegedly subjected to a \u201cdeprogramming\u201d process by a psychologist and a psychiatrist at Pro Juventud\u2019s request. On 29 and 30 June 1984, after being informed of their rights, they were questioned by C.T.R., the Assistant Director-General of Public Safety, aided by A.T.V., in the presence of a lawyer not appointed by the applicants.

The Government did not deny that there was no legal basis for the deprivation of liberty. That being said, they argued that the measure in issue could not in any circumstances be attributed to the Catalan police officers, as the responsibility was that of the applicants\u2019 families, who had organised their reception and detention at the hotel and their supervision.",

From the applicants\u2019 statements it appears that their transfer to the hotel by the police did not take place with their consent but was imposed on them. The fact that they were not handcuffed during the journey cannot alter the fact that they were transferred under duress. Once they had been handed over to their families, the applicants underwent detention similar to false imprisonment, which ended only on 30 June 1984, when they were allowed to leave the hotel. In this connection, the Court notes that on 29 and 30 June 1984, that is to say at a time when the applicants were still being held at the hotel, police officers questioned them in the presence of a lawyer after informing them of their rights. That shows that the Catalan authorities knew all the time that the applicants were still held at the hotel and did nothing to put an end to the situation.",

They thus did not fully comply with the judge\u2019s order, according to which the psychiatric assistance that would enable them to recover their psychological balance had to be provided on a voluntary basis as regards the persons of full age, which is what all the applicants were. At all events, even supposing that there was a danger of suicide, a risk of that kind did not justify such a major deprivation of liberty. The fact that, once free, the applicants lodged a criminal complaint alleging false imprisonment and other offences against officials of the Catalan government and all others responsible clearly shows that they had been confined in the hotel against their will.",

While it is true that it was the applicants\u2019 families and the Pro Juventud association that bore the direct and immediate responsibility for the supervision of the applicants during their ten days\u2019 loss of liberty, it is equally true that without the active cooperation of the Catalan authorities the deprivation of liberty could not have taken place. As the ultimate responsibility for the matters complained of thus lay with the authorities in question, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",
