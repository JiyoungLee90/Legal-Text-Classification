However, it further observes that more than half of the adjournments were attributable to the conduct (requests and absences) of the defendant \u2013 a State entity. Furthermore, it recalls that it is the role of the domestic courts to manage their proceedings so that they are expeditious and effective, particularly, to decide whether to adjourn the hearings at the parties' requests as well as whether to take any action against the parties, whose behaviour caused unjustified delays in the proceedings. It recalls that it has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see e.g., Smirnova\u00a0v. , no.\u00a036655/02, 8\u00a0November\u00a02005 and Karnaushenko\u00a0v. , no.\u00a023853/02, 30\u00a0November\u00a02006).",
