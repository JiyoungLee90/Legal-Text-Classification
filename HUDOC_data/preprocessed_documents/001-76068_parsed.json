They also relied on the alleged threats issued against Dr Ayhan on account of his refusal to accommodate a police officer at the hospital (see paragraph 12 above). In view of these elements, the Court considers that the alleged events preceding the death of Dr Mehmet Emin Ayhan and the killing of a number of Kurdish figures at the relevant time give some support to the applicants' allegation that Dr Ayhan was killed by, or at least with, the connivance of State agents.",
