It must be stated at this juncture that it is not the Court\u2019s task to verify whether the domestic courts correctly applied domestic criminal law; what is in issue in the present proceedings is not the individual criminal-law liability of the officers, but the Convention responsibility of the State. For this reason, although the Court should grant substantial deference to the national courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for ill-treatment by State agents, it must exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed (see Nikolova and Velichkova v.

Accordingly, provocation can never be regarded as a justification for the infliction of severe ill-treatment on an individual, in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, as regards the circumstances of the present case, the Court fails to see the relevance of a defence of provocation once the events in the street had ended, yet the assault on the applicant continued at the police station (see paragraph 7 in fine above). Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the reduction of the prison sentence imposed on the police officer on grounds of provocation fell short of the Convention standard of protection from ill-treatment. Lastly, it is to be noted that the police officer in question did not have to serve any term in prison because the execution of his sentence was suspended (see paragraph 16 above).",
