He alleged that the witness accounts which formed the basis of the charges were false and that there was a conspiracy against him. As concerned the alleged massacre on 7 April 1994, it had been investigated by the Danish police but the investigation had been discontinued as there was insufficient evidence against him. This lack of evidence applied to all the crimes of which he was accused. Moreover, in his view, the accusations were of a political nature as he was a Hutu and he was convinced that he would be seriously persecuted if returned. The applicant further claimed that the Rwandan justice system was corrupt and dysfunctional and lacking in independence and impartiality. In particular, it would be very difficult for him to call and question witnesses in his defence on an equal basis with witnesses called by the prosecution. Thus, he would suffer a flagrant denial of justice in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. He also referred to several decisions in which the ICTR had found that there were impediments to transferring genocide suspects to Rwanda and noted that no other country had accepted such requests from . Lastly, he invoked his poor health, stating that he had undergone a heart bypass operation and would be in need of another such operation within a few years.",

It first stressed that the examination was limited to the question of whether there were any impediments to the applicant\u2019s extradition. In carrying out this examination, the Supreme Court had to consider the 1957 Act as well as Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention. Turning to the circumstances of the case, the court first agreed with the Prosecutor-General\u2019s assessment that there was probable cause to believe that the applicant was guilty of the charges against him and that, since these crimes were also crimes under Swedish law, it was permissible to extradite him (exception was again made for the sixth charge for the same reason as above). The court further found that the crimes were not of a political nature and that, hence, this did not constitute an impediment. Furthermore, in regard to the applicant\u2019s Hutu ethnicity, which had been of great importance when the Danish authorities granted him asylum, the court noted that the definition of refugee status had been expanded in many countries. The court then noted that neither the Danish decision nor the investigation on which it was based had been adduced in the extradition matter. The court however found that the Danish decision was several years old and that the evidence at the court\u2019s disposal did not support the assessment that the applicant was at a real risk of persecution due to his ethnicity. The court also considered that the applicant\u2019s state of health did not pose any problem for the extradition. Thus, there were no impediments under the 1957 Act to the extradition of the applicant.",

As concerned Article 6, the court noted that, according to  case-law, only a \u201cflagrant denial of justice\u201d in the receiving country could lead to a finding of a violation against the extraditing country. Hence there was no requirement to ensure that the person would be guaranteed a fair trial in all aspects. Moreover, it was for the applicant to show that there were substantial grounds for believing that he would suffer a flagrant denial of justice. In the instant case, the applicant had given information about  and had submitted a letter of 16 October 2008 from Amnesty International (see further below at \u00a7\u00a7 41-43) and decisions by the ICTR of 28\u00a0May and 6 June 2008. He had also presented a decision by the Ministry of Justice of Finland of 20 February 2009 and a decision by the High Court in London of 8 April 2009, both of which declined to extradite some persons to  to stand trial. In this respect, the court noted that the Finnish decision was based on ICTR\u2019s decisions. However, these decisions concerned transfer of suspects from the ICTR to the Rwandan national courts. According to Article 11 bis of the ICTR\u2019s Rules of Procedure and Evidence, extradition was possible if the tribunal was satisfied that the accused would receive a fair trial in the courts of the State concerned. This, in the Swedish Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, was clearly a much more rigorous demand than that under Article 6 of the Convention. ICTR\u2019s decisions could therefore not lead to the conclusion that the extradition of the applicant in the present case would be in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. In regard to the decision of the UK High Court, the Supreme Court noted that, contrary to the lower court, the High Court had found that the extradition of the persons in question would put them at real risk of suffering a flagrant denial of justice, with respect to both the difficulty of adducing evidence and the doubts pertaining to the independence and impartiality of the Rwandan judiciary. While this gave reason to doubt whether the extradition of the applicant would be possible, the Supreme Court observed nevertheless that, according to international sources and reports from the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Swedish Embassy in Kigali, the judicial system in  had made clear improvements after the above-mentioned decisions, although much remained to be done. For instance, a new witness protection programme had been launched and the punishment of life-time imprisonment in isolation had been abolished.",

However, the circumstances of the case did not constitute a general legal impediment to the extradition of the applicant to  to stand trial on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. The court then expressed that it assumed that consideration would be given to the need for further information before the Government made a final decision in the case.",

However, it rejected the request in relation to the sixth charge. The Government first agreed with the Supreme Court that there were no impediments to the extradition under Swedish law. As concerned the examination under the Convention, the Government noted that the death penalty had been abolished in 2007 and that life imprisonment with special conditions (such as isolation) had been abolished in November 2008. A new prison had been built which was considered to reach an acceptable international standard and which, inter alia, was meant for persons convicted of genocide. There was also nothing to suggest that the  sanctioned torture or inhuman treatment of convicted persons or persons suspected of serious crimes. Thus, extradition would not be contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. In regard to Article 6, the Government observed that the standards set by the ICTR were more rigorous than the standard set by the Convention and the \u2019s case-law. It noted that the judicial system in Rwanda had improved over the last couple of years and that new laws had been promulgated during the spring of 2009 to improve the witness protection programme and the possibility to hear witnesses who were not present in Rwanda. Hence, the Government concluded that the extradition would not violate Article 6 of the Convention and therefore approved it.",

There have been reports of local gacaca officials and citizens abusing the process to pursue personal matters and settle grudges unrelated to the genocide, including making false accusations in order to acquire land.

In the first case, Munyakazi, the Trial Chamber found (on 28 May 2008) that there were three obstacles to a transfer: the applicable sentence would be life imprisonment in isolation without appropriate safeguards, the trial court\u2019s composition with a single judge involved a risk of its being unable to withstand direct or indirect pressure from the Rwandan Government, and the defendant would not be able to secure the attendance of and examine witnesses on his own behalf under the same conditions as the prosecutor\u2019s witnesses. Following an appeal by the ICTR Prosecutor, the Appeals Chamber upheld (on 8 October 2008) the Trial Chamber\u2019s first and third rulings. However, it granted the appeal in so far as the second ruling was concerned: it found that the trial chamber had erred in concluding that  did not respect the independence of the judiciary and that the composition of the Rwandan courts did not comply with the right to a fair trial. With respect to the issues relating to witness testimony, the Appeals Chamber was satisfied \u2013 contrary to the trial chamber \u2013 that video-link facilities were available and would likely be authorised in cases where witnesses residing abroad genuinely feared to testify in person. However, the Appeals Chamber considered that such arrangements would not guarantee equality of arms \u201cif the majority of Defence witnesses would testify by video-link while the majority of Prosecution witnesses would testify in person\u201d (paragraph 42 of the decision). It also shared the concerns of the Trial Chamber in regard to the treatment of witnesses in  and their fears of harassment, arrest and detention. There were reports of murders of genocide survivors who had provided or intended to provide testimony in genocide trials. Moreover, there were justified fears among witnesses that their appearance would lead to indictments being issued against them, for instance for promoting \u201cgenocidal ideology\u201d, a term laid down in the Rwandan Constitution and given a wide interpretation by Government officials to cover an extended range of ideas, expressions and conduct, including those perceived to display opposition to Government policies.",

Thus, the High Court found it likely that the appellants would be unable to call supporting witnesses who declined to give evidence in person out of a professed fear of reprisals (paragraphs 64-66). Furthermore, having regard, inter alia, to a report by Human Rights Watch of July 2008 and the testimony given by three expert witnesses, the High Court concluded that there was evidence of judicial interference by the Rwandan executive and that the appellants would suffer a flagrant denial of justice also in regard to the judiciary\u2019s impartiality and independence (paragraphs 119-121).

It also considered that there was no reason to assume that, if extradited to , he would be subjected to persecution that would threaten his life or freedom or otherwise be of a serious character. The court noted that the Norwegian police (as well as, apparently, Mr Bandora\u2019s counsel) had visited the Mpanga Prison (where, if convicted, Mr Bandora would be incarcerated) and had found that the conditions there, including medical care, corresponded to international standards \u2013 a conclusion that had been shared by the ICTR.

While Mr Bandora\u2019s counsel had claimed that problems persisted in practice in regard to the independence of the judiciary and the equality of arms, the court found that the legislative and other changes, as well as the possibility for observers to follow the trial, meant that there was no real risk that the trial would be unfair. There was thus reason to reach a different conclusion than that drawn in earlier ICTR transfer decisions and in the judgment of the UK High Court. The court also took into account that the Norwegian police had made ten investigative visits to  since September 2009 and had interviewed a total of 149 witnesses in the country in regard to four different cases. According to the report of the police, there had been no indication that the witnesses \u2013 whether testifying for or against the suspects in question \u2013 had been influenced or instructed by the Rwandan authorities to give particular statements or that they had been threatened in any way. Nor had any of the witnesses expressed a fear of the authorities or a reluctance to give testimony to the Norwegian police. In the court\u2019s view, these findings \u2013 together with the Rwandan witness protection guarantees and the alternative ways of giving testimony in cases transferred to Rwanda \u2013 indicated that Mr Bandora\u2019s fear that witnesses would refuse to give testimony on his behalf if his case were to be tried in  was not sufficiently justified.",

In this respect, the Court first notes that, through a May 2009 amendment to Article\u00a013 of the Transfer Law, witnesses \u2013 as well as other participants in the proceedings \u2013 are afforded immunity from prosecution for statements made or actions taken during a trial.

It has not been shown that there is a connection between the acts for which he was ordered to pay damages and the acts covered by the charges in Rwanda\u2019s extradition request. Moreover, according to the provisions of the Transfer Law and the statements made by the Rwandan authorities in connection with the extradition request, extradited genocide suspects \u2013 including the applicant \u2013 will have their criminal liability tried by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by the gacaca courts.",

While noting that the decision is not final, the Court nevertheless considers that its conclusions have to be given considerable weight. It is the first transfer decision taken by the ICTR since the legislative changes in . The Chamber found that the issues that had led to the decisions in 2008 to refuse transfers had been addressed to such a degree in the intervening period that the Chamber was confident that the accused would be prosecuted in a manner consistent with internationally recognised fair trial standards enshrined in the ICTR Statute and other human rights instruments. While the Chamber also relied on the monitoring it ordered and its ability to revoke the transferred case if necessary, this does not, as noted above in regard to the complaint under Article 3, change the conclusions drawn. In this connection, the Court notes that Sweden has declared itself prepared to monitor the proceedings in  and the applicant\u2019s detention.",

The standard thus established clearly set a higher threshold for transfers than the test for extraditions under Article 6 of the Convention, as interpreted by the Court.",
