The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Assenov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 94, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, and Bouyid v.

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see, for example, Kopylov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a03933/04, \u00a7 133, 29 July 2010).

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question of whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention essentially refers to national law. It requires at the same time that any deprivation of liberty be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v.\u00a0France, 18\u00a0December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 111, and Kafkaris v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7\u00a0116, ECHR 2008).",

While the Court has not previously formulated a comprehensive definition of what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a casebycase basis. Moreover, the notion of arbitrariness in the context of Article\u00a05 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved. One general principle established in the case-law is that detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077-78, 9\u00a0July 2009).",
