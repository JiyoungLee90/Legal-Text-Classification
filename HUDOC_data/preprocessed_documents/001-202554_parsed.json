This incident not only resulted in the first applicant being seriously injured but also showed I.M.\u2019s particular disregard for the ordinary measures taken by the police such as preventive discussions or the ban on approaching the applicants. Nevertheless, it took the authorities more than two months to adopt more decisive actions against I.M. (his arrest on 23\u00a0July 2012, at the applicant\u2019s request, see paragraph 37 above).
