For example, he spent time in Colibaşi Prison Hospital (from 19 May to 4 June 2004), Jilava Prison Hospital (from 10 to 20 November 2000; 26 January to 13 February 2001; 18 October to 21 November 2005; 6 to 17 July, 21 to 31 August, 7 September to 13 November, and 14 to 20 December 2007; and from 4 to 17 March 2008) and Rahova Prison Hospital (from 29 March to 6 April, 14 to 20 June, and 11 to 17 October 2005; 22 to 28 August 2006; and from 19 to 22 February 2008).

They concluded that these conditions could be treated in prison hospitals.
The forensic medical reports produced by the Târgovişte County Forensic Medical Service and by the Mina Minovici Forensic Institute on 3 November 2004 and 30 November 2005 respectively noted that the applicant was suffering inter alia from peripheral vascular disease and chronic venous thromboses.

In a letter of 18 September 2006 to the Court the applicant stated that on an unspecified date in 1999 he had developed thromboses in his legs. The applicant alleged that he had developed the condition on account of the detention conditions in Ploieşti Prison, in particular the lack of physical exercise, overcrowding, lack of water and poor nutrition. He also informed the Court that the lack of medication had aggravated his condition and that although he had been transferred several times from Ploieşti Prison to civilian and prison hospitals across the country for treatment and surgery, the lack of medicines and budget to pay for the medical expenses had made it impossible for him to be treated.
In the same letter of 18 September 2006 the applicant contended that his condition had reached the final stage of development and that his legs might have to be amputated.
The forensic medical reports produced by the Prahova County Forensic Medical Service and by the Mina Minovici Forensic Institute on 24 May and 9 August 2007, respectively, stated that the applicant was suffering from inter alia chronic venous thromboses in his legs. The reports concluded that he could be treated both in prison and civilian hospitals and that his medical condition could not justify his temporary release from prison.

The relevant provisions of Law no. 23/1969 on the execution of sentences are described in Năstase-Silivestru v. Romania, (no. 74785/01, §§ 23-25, 4 October 2007).
Government Emergency Ordinance no. 56 of 25 June 2003 regarding the rights of prisoners stated, in section 3, that prisoners had the right to bring legal proceedings before a court concerning measures taken by prison authorities in connection with their rights. Emergency Ordinance no. 56/2003 was repealed and replaced by Law no. 275 of 20 July 2006 on the execution of sentences. It restates the content of section 3 mentioned above in its Article 38, which provides that a judge shall have jurisdiction over complaints by convicted prisoners against measures taken by prison authorities (see also Petrea v. Romania, no. 4792/03, §§ 21-23, 29 April 2008; Gagiu v. Romania, no. 63258/00, § 42, 24 February 2009; and Măciucă v. Romania, no. 25763/03, § 14, 26 May 2009).

The Government submitted approximately one hundred and fourteen judgments delivered by the domestic courts across the country in respect of proceedings brought by detainees against various prison facilities on the basis of Emergency Ordinance no. 56/2003 and Law no. 275/2006 seeking adequate medical treatment, better treatment during transfer to courts, nonsmoking accommodation, confidentiality of correspondence, stamps and envelopes, the discontinuance of disciplinary actions taken against them, visiting rights, conjugal visits, dental treatment, religious rights, adequate hygiene conditions, appropriate diets, a prohibition on welding beds to the floor, extended exercise rights, washing, working rights, access to a personal computer and telephone conversations.
Approximately one hundred and four of the judgments submitted by the Government were final and approximately twenty of them allowed in full or in part the actions lodged by the detainees by relying on the provisions of the domestic legislation concerning the execution of prison sentences and the evidence available in the files. The actions allowed by the domestic courts mainly concerned disciplinary proceedings opened against detainees, access to adequate medical treatment, visiting rights, the right to petition, the right to confidentiality of correspondence, the right to daily physical exercise (final judgment of 19 June 2007 of the Arad District Court), the right to wash twice a week (final judgment of 7 October 2008 of the Arad District Court), the organisation of properly ventilated designated smoking areas (final judgment of 27 June 2008 of the Piteşti District Court) and the right to dental treatment.
Six of the judgments submitted by the Government addressed the issue of overcrowding. All six judgments dismissed the detainees’ complaints in respect of overcrowding for the following reasons: they were detained in cells of five and six people measuring 18.8 sq. m and 21.76 sq. m respectively (final judgments of 10 March 2009 and 3 March 2008 of the Bucharest and Giurgiu District Courts respectively); the cell met the minimum legal requirement of 6 cubic metres per person (final judgment of 2 October 2007 of the Bucharest District Court); the courts could not hold the prison administration liable in respect of overcrowding taking into account the size of the prison and the large number of detainees housed there (final judgment of 12 May 2010 of the Bucharest District Court); the detainee was sharing a cell with twelve other inmates and the domestic legislation did not provide for a minimum number of square metres that had to be ensured for a group of detainees (final judgment of 17 September 2010 of the Bistriţa District Court); and the detainee was subject to the prison’s internal rules harmonised with the decision of 11 January 2006 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (final judgment of 4 September 2007 of the Bucharest District Court).
The relevant findings and recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) are described in Bragadireanu v. Romania (no. 22088/04, §§ 73-76, 6 December 2007), and Artimenco v. Romania (no. 12535/04, §§ 22-23, 30 June 2009).
The CPT report published on 11 December 2008, following a visit to different police detention facilities and prisons in Romania, including , conducted from 8 to 19 June 2006, indicated overcrowding as a persistent problem. The same report concluded that in the light of the deplorable material conditions of detention in some of the cells of the establishments visited, the conditions of detention could be qualified as inhuman and degrading. In respect of Ploieşti Prison the report stated that detainees’ living space was restricted to 1.5 sq. m per person and that some of them had to share a bed. The cells were poorly ventilated and measures had to be taken to remedy the low standards of kitchen hygiene and detainees’ complaints concerning poor nutrition. Detainees had access to thirty minutes of physical exercise per day, half the recommended one hour, and the shower facilities were unacceptable.
In the same report, the CPT declared itself gravely concerned by the fact that a lack of beds remained a constant problem, not only in the establishments visited but at national level, and that this had remained the case since its first visit to Romania in 1999. The CPT welcomed the changes introduced in domestic legislation providing for personal space of 4 sq. m (8 cubic meters) for each prisoner. The CPT therefore recommended that the Romanian authorities take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this requirement, as well as to ensure that each detainee had his or her own bed.
