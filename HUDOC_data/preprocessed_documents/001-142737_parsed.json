It noted that Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive (Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted), which corresponded in substance to Article 3 of the Convention, had been transposed into Belgian law by section 9ter of the Aliens Act. In adopting the latter provision, the legislature had clearly and legitimately sought to reserve the benefit of section 9ter to foreign nationals who were so \u201cseriously ill\u201d that their expulsion would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, and to ensure that the assessment in question was carried out in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law as established in the case of N. v. the United Kingdom, cited above. The fact that section 9ter referred to three specific situations did not mean that its scope differed from that of Article 3. The three types of illness, where they attained a minimum level of severity \u2013 which had to be high \u2013 were apt to satisfy the requirements of Article 3. The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat concluded that the Aliens Appeals Board had unduly extended the scope of section 9ter by ruling that this provision obliged the Belgian State to carry out a more extensive assessment than that arising out of the case-law concerning Article 3 of the Convention.",

The Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat dismissed the arguments of the Belgian State based on European law, noting that the minimum standards of protection laid down by the Convention and the Qualification Directive could not be relied on in order to narrow the scope of the Belgian legislation.",

As a rule, only persons with private health insurance have access to health care. However, measures were taken at the same time to ensure that the poorest members of society also had access to health care. Hence, Decree no. 218 of 9 December 2009 was adopted as part of a welfare programme based on the distribution of vouchers providing persons living below the poverty threshold with free access to certain forms of out-patient and inpatient care, excluding medicines. The poverty threshold is determined on the basis of a system of points and criteria listed in the decree which take into consideration the family and financial situation of the individuals concerned. Persons classified as being in need must have been entered in a register by 1 April 2013. In 2009 over a million people were eligible under this programme. Other public programmes are designed to cover all or part of certain types of health care expenditure for persons over sixty.",

The main difference, as explained by the Government, lies in the fact that only the extremely urgent procedure has suspensive effect.

Nevertheless, the Court points out that it examined the extremely urgent procedure for applying for a stay of execution in the case of M.S.S., cited above, and found that it did not afford the persons concerned, in advance of their expulsion, a sufficiently rigorous and thorough examination of the alleged risk of a violation (\u00a7\u00a7 389 and 390). The impact of that judgment on the case-law of the Aliens Appeals Board does not alter the position in the instant case, given that the change in the case-law referred to by the Government occurred after the facts in the present case (see paragraph 85 above). In those circumstances, and in view of the reasons relied on by the applicant (see paragraph 99 above), the Court considers that he could not have been expected to exercise a remedy other than the one he actually used.",

According to the information provided by Caritas at his lawyer\u2019s request, a dose of Fludarabine, needed for the treatment of his leukaemia, cost 365 Georgian lari (GEL) in Georgia (approximately 150 euros (EUR)). The health system in Georgia had been extensively privatised and, with the exception of a few social welfare programmes for the most vulnerable, health care was accessible only to people who were insured. The applicant claimed that he did not fall into any of the categories of people entitled to full cover of the cost of medication and the care needed to administer it and to have their illness treated in a hospital setting. Given that he did not have any social and family network in Georgia, that his state of health prevented him from working and that the only asset he possessed in Georgia was a plot of land, he would be unable in practice to continue with the treatment which was keeping him alive.

His ties in Belgium were very limited, he did not speak any of the national languages, had never worked in Belgium and had shown no willingness to integrate. On the contrary, he had committed serious offences of which he had been convicted on several occasions, and had spent most of his time in prison. In that connection it was also implausible that the presence of his family should be necessary from the point of view of his health, given that he had lived apart from his family for a lengthy period while he was in prison, apparently without adverse effects on his health. Also on account of his time in prison, the applicant could not be considered as his children\u2019s primary carer.

The Government alleged that, since his release, the applicant had committed several thefts (see paragraph 115 above). However, the Court observes that the Government did not furnish evidence that these suspicions had actually resulted in criminal proceedings against the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Gezginci v. Switzerland, no.\u00a016327/05, \u00a7 67, 9 December 2010). The applicant, for his part, maintained that he could no longer lead a normal life owing to his state of health and that he was no longer capable of committing the acts attributed to him by the Government. Accordingly, in view of the fact that these circumstances weigh both in favour of and against the applicant, the Court cannot attach great importance in the present case to the period after the applicant\u2019s convictions which prompted the administrative authorities to refuse him leave to remain and to order his expulsion (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Trabelsi, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

Bearing in mind also that they have Belgian residence permits and can leave and re-enter the country legally, there are no insurmountable obstacles to the maintenance of regular contact between the members of the family. Lastly, the Court points out that neither the applicant\u2019s wife nor his children are applicants before it.",

The applicant suffers from a number of serious medical conditions, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and according to his own assertions is in any event at risk of an early death if he is sent back to Georgia, where the standard of care does not match that in Belgium. This particular set of circumstances might prompt the applicant\u2019s wife and their children to leave Belgium temporarily in order to settle for a time in Georgia. While it would not wish to underestimate the difficulties which such a decision would entail for the family, the Court does not consider, in the light of the factors examined above (see paragraphs 152 and 153), that they amount to exceptional circumstances requiring the Belgian authorities to refrain from deporting the applicant or to regularise his residence status. Furthermore, the medical information in the file shows that the conditions from which the applicant suffers are currently stable as a result of the medical treatment he has received in Belgium, that there is no imminent threat to his life and that he is able to travel (see paragraph 120 above).",
