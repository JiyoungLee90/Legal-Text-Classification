However, he still suffered from feelings of futility and despair. The second applicant had been feeling better since the Court\u2019s decision not to deport them until further notice. However, she had recently been feeling worse again due to her fear of a possible deportation. She still suffered from severe depression and PTSD and was worried about the third applicant\u2019s health. The third applicant had gradually been feeling better since he had been granted a residence permit. However, his positive development had been halted by the threat of disruption of the family and he showed clear signs of falling into depression again. The fourth applicant had, due to his young age, been spared the traumatic experiences in Kosovo. However, according to the medical certificate, a disruption of the family could be expected to cause him a severe trauma.",

The implementation of these changes in the Rulebook was not uniform. Partly due to inadequate levels of information of employees in RIHI branch offices throughout , partly due to resistance to the concrete novelties and lack of sensitivity, the branch offices in certain municipalities refused to enable Roma to exercise the right to health insurance and issue health booklets under the above stated conditions. On behalf of its clients, Praxis intervened repeatedly and pointed to the changed regulations, managing to have its clients registered. Also, as the impossibility to register permanent residence makes obtaining ID cards impossible, the RIHI branch offices request that Roma submit at least birth certificates instead of ID cards. Returnees on the basis of the readmission agreements with travel documents are allowed only access to urgent medical care for which the Republic budget funds are allocated, until regulation of the status of an insured person or until the expiry of the validity of the travel document.

Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State\u2019s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest (see G\u00fcl v. Switzerland, 19 February 1996, \u00a7 38, Reports 1996-I). Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles to the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion (see Solomon v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 44328/98, 5\u00a0September 2000).",

He had also begun studies at a college for adults. However, his positive development had been halted by the threat of disruption of the family and he had showed signs of falling back into depression. While acknowledging that this information is worrying, the Court finds that it has to be taken into account that the medical certificate mainly contains a description of how the applicant himself feels and that it neither suggests that he currently has a medical condition, nor that he is undergoing psychiatric or other treatment. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the medical certificate also indicates that his state of health is connected to a large extent to the situation he is in at the moment. Furthermore, as far as the Court is informed, there has been no further deterioration of his health since June\u00a02011.",
