The investigators also failed to demonstrate due diligence when requesting information about vehicles employed by the ROVD six months after the events (see paragraph 65 above) and presenting the ROVD vehicles to the first applicant for identification ten months after the crime (see paragraph 67 above). It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation began (see Gekhayeva and Others v. Russia, no. 1755/04, \u00a7 105, 29 May 2008).",

In accordance with the Court's practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing, since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention and the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0371).",
