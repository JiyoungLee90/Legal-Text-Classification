In these circumstances, the Court, mindful of its subsidiary role, considers that it is not its task to determine whether the substantive conclusions reached by the investigation in respect of O.M.\u2019s and S.T.\u2019s innocence were correct (see e.g. Lobach v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no. 9276/02, 22 September 2009 and Kachurka v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a04737/06, \u00a7\u00a049, 15 September 2011).

By that time their overall duration had therefore been almost twelve years.

It notes, in this regard, that the domestic authorities themselves admitted various omissions, delays and irregularities in their letters to the applicant and in orders remitting the case for further investigation following repeated decisions to suspend or discontinue the proceedings (see paragraphs 14-15, 19, 25-26 and 29-31 above).

It is also not clear what actions, if any, apart from the repeated orders demanding the police to locate S.K. and V.P. were taken in fact to find them until S.K.\u2019s arrest in his hometown in 2012.",
