At the same time, the Court observes that some of the conduct attributed to the applicant dated back to his adolescence and some to a relatively young age (see, to the same effect, Moustaquim, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044; Yildiz, cited above, \u00a7 45; and Yilmaz v.

Therefore, at least some of the offences in question were committed by the applicant in a juvenile delinquency context. In this connection, the Court notes that according to the United Nations, experience has shown that juvenile delinquency tends to disappear spontaneously in most individuals with their transition to adulthood (see sub-paragraph I, 5 (e) of the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines), adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly in its Resolution 45/112 of 14 December 1990).",

Even though relationships between parents and adult children would not attract the protection of Article 8 without \u2018evidence of further elements of dependency, involving more than the normal, emotional ties\u2019 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kwakye-Nti and Dufie v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 31519/96, 7\u00a0November 2000), the Court also notes that the Federal Court itself admitted that his family ties with Turkey were far less significant than those he had made with his host country.

That obstacle had in fact been taken into consideration and discussed in the first judgment. However, the Federal Court had also observed, without being contradicted by the European Court on this point, that the applicant\u2019s presence in Switzerland represented a particularly serious danger for public order and security, because his conduct and offences showed that his \u2018mindset was hardly capable of resolving conflicts and frustrations otherwise than by violence, ready to impose his own rules, by himself or with the help of partners, without consideration for property or for the physical well-being of others, and openly contemptuous of the judicial authority\u2019 (judgment cited above of 3 May 2004, point 3.2). Moreover, the Federal Court also emphasised, and there is nothing in the European Court\u2019s judgment that would justify departing from this assessment, that the applicant had no awareness of the seriousness of his actions and that he thus presented a high risk of reoffending: he had committed further offences after his first convictions and had refused to follow psychiatric treatment during his detention (see the above-cited judgment of the Federal Court of 3\u00a0May\u00a02004, point 3.3 in initio). In those circumstances, it was not possible for the applicant\u2019s private interest in remaining in , bearing in mind that he was an adult, was single and had no children, to prevail over the public interest in his expulsion, at least for a certain period of time.

The Court observes that the Federal Court\u2019s considerations were confined to that last factor. It is of the view that, in order to fulfil the stringent obligations imposed on States under Article 46 of the Convention, the examination should in fact have addressed all these points.",

The fact that the ten-year exclusion takes effect from 2 June 2003 does not detract from that finding.",

It does not in fact appear that he has been charged again with any offences since his last convictions of 2005, one of which concerned an offence committed in 2003 and the other the offence of returning to Switzerland while banished, the latter offence thus having the same origin as the complaint submitted in the present proceedings before the Court, namely the expulsion measures that the applicant alleges to have been unjustified. Like the applicant, the Court takes the view that these are clear indications that his criminal activities may be regarded as errors of youth that he seems to have acknowledged. The Court is prepared to accept that since then he has been behaving as a responsible individual, who has been engaged in a regular professional activity consistent with his capacities and has created his own family circle.",
