Where a judgment is against the State, the defendant State authorities must be duly noti\ufb01ed thereof and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authorities responsible for compliance (see Akashev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30616/05, \u00a7 21, 12 June 2008).",

For example, a State cannot be at fault for a non-enforcement in case of deliberate withholding of writs of execution for several years by a person in absence of any explanations for it (see Gadzhikhanov and Saukov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a010511/08 and 5866/09, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, 31 January 2012).",

As it clearly transpires from the case file, and from the domestic judgments of 14\u00a0April and 10\u00a0June 2009 the respondent authority timeously received the writ and, moreover, issued a payment order on its basis (see paragraphs\u00a012 and 14 above).
