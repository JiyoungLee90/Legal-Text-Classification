In the court\u2019s view, such an interpretation would render futile the relevant procedure as a whole, whereas the fact of being caught in the act of committing an offence formed the basis on which the criminal proceedings were then initiated. In addition, since the measure in which the above-mentioned legal provision provided for keeping a record of the statements of the suspect and other persons questioned, the person concerned would be questioned as the suspect only if the prosecution had already decided to bring proceedings against that person. If not, his or her statement would be recorded as that of \u201canother person questioned\u201d. The High Court concluded on that point that, in view of the fact that at the time he was first questioned the applicant had been neither a suspect nor an accused person, there had been no statutory obligation for him to be assisted by a lawyer. Moreover, it noted that the applicant had been informed subsequently, in the presence of a lawyer of his choosing, that preliminary investigative acts (acte premerg\u0103toare) had been carried out against him in his capacity as a person caught in the act of committing an offence.",
