However, the second paragraph of that same Article specified that this was for immediate application only in respect of Catholic priests, which was done by order of the Ministry of Health and Social Security on 19\u00a0December 1977. Two subsequent Royal Decrees (nos. 487/1998 of 27\u00a0March 1998 and 2665/1998 of 11 December 1998) provided for Catholic clergy and priests who left the priesthood or ceased their religious activities to be able to count all their years of service with the church towards the years of contributions necessary to qualify for a retirement pension, provided that they made the capital payments corresponding to those years.  ministers were brought into the scheme twenty-two years after their Catholic counterparts, by Royal Decree 369/1999 of 5\u00a0March 1999, although they were not given the same possibility as Catholic priests of making up the missing annuities to qualify for a retirement pension. The court observed that by the time this decree took effect the applicant had ceased his pastoral activities, and according to the provisions of the decree his years as a minister could not be taken into account in calculating his years of contribution. The court considered that depriving the applicant of access to a retirement pension in the same conditions as those enjoyed by Catholic priests violated his right to equal treatment and freedom of worship enshrined in the Constitution. The court referred to Articles 6 and 7 of the Judicature Act (Ley Org\u00e1nica del Poder Judicial LOPJ) (see paragraph 16 below) and noted that Article 9 (2) of the Spanish Constitution stated: \u201cIt is the responsibility of the public powers to promote conditions so that liberty and equality of the individual and the groups he joins will be real and effective, to remove those obstacles which impede or make difficult their full implementation, and to facilitate participation by all citizens in political, economic, cultural, and social life\u201d. Consequently, in the interest of the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights the court considered that the provisions applied to Catholic priests \u2013 particularly Royal Decrees 487/1998 and 2665/1998 \u2013 could be applied to the applicant by analogy, enabling him to accumulate the minimum number of years of contribution thanks to his years as a minister, provided that he paid the capital corresponding to those missing years. It awarded the applicant a retirement pension from 22 July 2004 onwards, on the basis of 398.44 euros (EUR) a month.",

By a judgment of 26 July 2007 the High Court of Catalonia set aside the first-instance judgment. It noted that  ministers had been included in the general Social Security scheme by Law 24/1992 of 10\u00a0October 1992 approving the cooperation agreement between the State and the Federation of Evangelical religious entities of Spain (FEREDE). The right of Evangelical Church ministers to contribute and to receive the corresponding benefits had thus come into being under that law and the practical conditions of their integration in the general Social Security scheme had been laid out in Royal Decree 369/1999. In the instant case the court observed that the applicant had reached retirement age in 1991, prior to the enactment of Law 24/1992, which would have allowed him to pay Social Security contributions in order to be entitled to a pension. The fact that the applicant\u2019s previous years of pastoral activity could not be taken into consideration was not the result of inactivity on the part of the State but of a lack of legislation because of the failure of the State and the various  authorities to reach an agreement. In the light of these considerations the court deemed that the applicant did not satisfy the statutory conditions to qualify for a retirement pension, which was a matter of ordinary law and not of discrimination in comparison with the situation of Catholic priests.",

Thus, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee as such any right to become the owner of property (see Kopeck\u00fd v.\u00a0Slovakia [GC], no.\u00a044912/98, \u00a7\u00a035 b), ECHR 2004IX), nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, for example, Domalewski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a034610/97, ECHR 1999V, and Jankovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no\u00a043440/98, ECHR 2000X).

However, Catholic priests were included with immediate effect and in 1998 two royal Decrees allowed Catholic priests and clergy who had left the priesthood or ceased their religious activities to have their years of religious service during which they had not paid social security contributions taken into account in order to make up the minimum number of years required to entitle them to a retirement pension, provided that they were 65 or older and that they paid the capital corresponding to the number of years thus taken into account.

In order to redress the breach of the applicant\u2019s, fundamental rights, the court considered that the provisions applied to Catholic priests and, in particular, the Royal Decrees of 1998, could be applied to the applicant by analogy, thereby enabling him to complete the minimum period of contributions from his years as a minister, subject to his paying the capital corresponding to the years of contribution thus made up.",

Subsequently, Royal Decree 369/1999 laid down the conditions for the inclusion of Evangelical ministers in the general Social Security scheme. The Court considers, like the Government, that the integration of priests and ministers into the general Social Security scheme at different times was based on objective rather that on discriminatory criteria, and reiterates that the States have a wide margin of appreciation in progressively introducing full equality between individuals in pension schemes, bearing in mind the financial and social implications of changes in social security systems, which had to take into account the particularities of each group (see Stec and Others [GC], cited above, \u00a7 49).",

By various means Spain\u2019s labour legislation has provided for Catholic priests who engaged in pastoral activities before joining the Social Security scheme to be able \u2013 unlike Evangelical ministers \u2013 to have their years of prior service taken into account for the purposes of calculating their retirement pension. Under the first transitional provision of the Ministerial Order of 19\u00a0December 1977 on the inclusion of diocesan Catholic priests in the general Social Security scheme (see paragraph 18 above), in order to make up the minimum number of years of contribution required to entitle them to a retirement pension, serving Catholic priests who had reached the age of fifty by 1\u00a0January 1978 were allowed to validate up to ten years of pastoral service prior to their inclusion in the Social Security scheme (by paying the corresponding contributions, going back as far as 1\u00a0January 1967). Under Royal Decrees 487/1998 and 2665/1998 Catholic priests who had left the priesthood or ceased their religious activities could also use their years of pastoral service prior to their inclusion in the Social Security scheme to make up the minimum number of years of contribution required to entitle them to a retirement pension.",

The Court accordingly considers, in view of the circumstances of the present case, that this detrimental difference in the law amounts to an unjustified difference of treatment of the applicant, based on religious faith, compared with the treatment reserved for Catholic priests, in so far as the applicant has no means of having his years of pastoral service as an Evangelical minister before such ministers were included in the Social Security scheme taken into account for the purpose of a retirement pension. The Court finds it disproportionate that the Spanish State, having provided in 1977 for the inclusion of the ministers of Churches and religious denominations other than the Catholic Church in the general Social Security scheme (see paragraph 17 above), should not be ready, even though Evangelical ministers were included in the scheme twenty-two years later, to acknowledge the effects of that development in terms of pension entitlement in the same conditions as for Catholic priests, and in particular the possibility for the applicant of paying the missing annuities required to reach the minimum period of contributions required. While the reasons for the delay in admitting Evangelical ministers to the general Social Security scheme fall within the margin of appreciation left to the State (see paragraph 53 above), the Court considers that the Government have not explained why, once those ministers had joined the Social Security scheme, a difference of treatment between similar situations based solely on religious grounds was maintained.",

In any event, neither the Barcelona Employment Tribunal, when it found in the applicant\u2019s favour, nor the High Court of Justice when it refused the pension, made any reference to this fact to justify the difference of treatment, in similar situations, of Catholic priests and Evangelical ministers when it came to making up the minimum number of years of contribution required to qualify for a retirement pension.
