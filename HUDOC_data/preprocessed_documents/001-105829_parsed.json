The request referred to a pending investigation in the case of a certain J.S. and other doctors who had been assessing claimants\u2019 health for the purposes of social insurance proceedings. The prosecutor submitted that it was highly likely that in those cases serious irregularities concerning the assessment of the claimants\u2019 eligibility for social insurance benefits had occurred.

Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see, among many other authorities, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 52). The notion of \u201cpublic interest\u201d is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning social insurance benefits will commonly involve consideration of economic and social issues. The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a087 and Wieczorek v.

Such schemes are an expression of a society\u2019s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see Goudswaard-Van der Lans v.\u00a0the  (dec.), no.\u00a075255/01, ECHR 2005XI).\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s approach to Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 should reflect the reality of the way in which welfare provision is currently organised within the member States of the Council of Europe. It is clear that within those States, and within most individual States, there exists a wide range of social security benefits designed to confer entitlements which arise as of right. Benefits are funded in a large variety of ways: some are paid for by contributions to a specific fund; some depend on a claimant\u2019s contribution record; many are paid for out of general taxation on the basis of a statutorily defined status. In the modern, democratic State, many individuals are, for all or part of their lives, completely dependent for survival on social security and welfare benefits. Many domestic legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid\u00a0\u00a0subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility \u2013 as of right (see Stec and Others, cited above).\u00a0Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 places no restriction on the Contracting Parties\u2019 freedom to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under social security schemes (see Stec and Others, cited above).",

It is paid from a single social insurance fund financed by various compulsory contributions from employees and employers and managed by the Social Insurance Authority. It operates on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Indeed, had entitlements to disability pensions been maintained regardless of recipients\u2019 eligibility, it would have been unfair on persons contributing to the social insurance system, in particular those denied benefits as they did not meet the relevant requirements.
