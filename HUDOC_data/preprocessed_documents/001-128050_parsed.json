The court held, in particular, that the applicant was in breach of Article 185-1 of the CAO because he had not complied with the ten-day notification requirement. The court based its findings on the 1988 Decree, which provided that an application to hold an assembly had to be lodged with the relevant authority at least ten days in advance. The court further referred to the decision of the Constitutional Court and noted that the exact time-limits for notification were to be regulated by law. It further indicated that the 1988 Decree was valid in Ukraine under the Resolution of the Ukrainian Parliament on temporary application of certain legislative acts of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 19 below). The court also pointed to the fact that the applicant had been informed by the Council that the notification he had given was liable to be regarded as contrary to the requirements of the legislation and had been warned that he could incur administrative liability.",

In particular, he noted that the 1988 Decree provided that persons wishing to hold a peaceful assembly had to seek permission, whereas the Constitution provided only that the authorities had to be notified of an intention to hold such an assembly. Furthermore, Article 92 of the Constitution provided that human rights guarantees had to be regulated exclusively by laws and Article 39 of the Constitution provided that restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly could be established only by law, whereas the 1988 Decree was not a law of Ukraine. He further noted that at the time of the picket there had been no judicial decision restricting the above-mentioned picket as required by Article 39 of the Constitution. The applicant also contended that his punishment violated Article 11 of the Convention and was not necessary as the picket had been peaceful and had not violated public order. Lastly, he complained that the decision in question had not been pronounced publicly which was contrary to Article 285 of the Code of Administrative Offences (see paragraph 17 below) and to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The court referred to the 1988 Decree. The participants appealed against that judgment. On 16 May 2012 the Kyiv Administrative Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. In its decision the Court of Appeal noted that the 1988 Decree conflicted with the Constitution as it required the organisers to seek permission to hold a demonstration and authorised the executive authorities to ban such an event, whereas Article\u00a039 of the Constitution provided that the authorities should be notified that a demonstration was being planned, and empowered only the judicial authorities to place restrictions on the organisation thereof. It also noted that in its decision of 19 April 2001 (see paragraph 20 above) the Constitutional Court had not referred to the 1988 Decree as a normative act which should apply in Ukraine to the legal relations under consideration. The court also noted that the file contained no documents proving that notification about the demonstration less than 10 days in advance had not allowed the police to ensure public order during the demonstration and that the holding of such an event could create a real risk of riots or crimes or endanger the health of the population and imperil the rights and freedoms of others. It concluded that the judgment of the first-instance court was incompatible with Article\u00a039 of the Constitution and Article 11 of the Convention.",

In its decision the Administrative Court of Appeal noted that, in deciding the case, the first-instance court had had regard to the provisions of the 1988 Decree, whereas since 1996 the question of holding peaceful gatherings had been regulated by the Constitution. The court further stated that the 1988 Decree conflicted with the Constitution as it provided for a procedure for seeking permission to hold a demonstration and that the Decree concerned the holding of such events in a non-existent country (\u201cthe USSR\u201d), regulated relations between the citizens of the USSR and the executive committees of the Soviets of People\u2019s Deputies, and considered demonstrations on the basis of their compatibility with the Constitution of the USSR, the constitutions of the union and the autonomous republics, that is, non-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects. The court also noted that under the Ukrainian Constitution human rights and freedoms, and the relevant safeguards, could be defined only by the laws of Ukraine.",

He referred to examples of the domestic courts\u2019 decisions (see\u00a0paragraphs 22 and 23 above) in which the courts held that the national legislation did not regulate the procedure for organising and holding peaceful assemblies. He noted that the 1988 Decree provided that persons wishing to hold a peaceful assembly had to seek permission, whereas the Constitution provided only for advance notification to the authorities of an intention to hold such an assembly. Therefore it could not be said that the Decree complemented the constitutional provisions on freedom of assembly, since it clearly conflicted with them. Furthermore, Article 92 of the Constitution provided that human rights guarantees had to be regulated exclusively by laws and Article 39 of the Constitution provided that restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly could be established only by law, yet the 1988 Decree was not a law of Ukraine.

The practice of the domestic courts also reveals inconsistencies in this sphere [...]. It is true that the Constitution of Ukraine provides for some general rules as to the possible restrictions on the freedom of assembly, but those rules require further elaboration in the domestic law. The only existing document establishing such a procedure is the 1988 Decree, whose provisions are not generally accepted as the valid procedure for holding demonstrations and which provides, as is confirmed in the practice of the domestic courts [...], for a different procedure from the one outlined in the Constitution. Indeed, whilst the Ukrainian Constitution requires advance notification to the authorities of an intention to hold a demonstration and stipulates that any restriction thereon can be imposed only by a court, the 1988 Decree, drafted in accordance with the Constitution of the USSR of 1978, provides that persons wishing to hold a peaceful demonstration have to seek permission from the local administration which is also entitled to ban any such demonstration. From the preamble of the Decree it is clear that it had been intended for a very different purpose, namely for only certain categories of individuals to be provided by the administration with facilities to express their views in favour of a particular ideology, this in itself being incompatible with the very essence of the freedom of assembly guaranteed by the Ukrainian Constitution and the Convention. As found by a domestic court [...], demonstrations under the 1988 Decree were considered on the basis of their compatibility with \u201cnon-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects\u201d. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the \u201cprocedure\u201d referred to in Article 185-1 of the Code on Administrative Offences was formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, Mkrtchyan, ibid.)...",

Whilst the Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework during a transitional period, it cannot agree that a delay of more than twenty years is justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake.

In the circumstances of the present case the Court considers that, despite the above-mentioned disagreement between the parties as to the facts, it can decide on the applicant\u2019s complaint even assuming that the first-instance court did fail to pronounce judgment publicly, given that the Court of Appeal pronounced its decision in public and repeated the findings and reasoning of the first-instance court. Although the Court of Appeal did not address the applicant\u2019s complaint about the lack of pronouncement, it was not under an obligation to address all of the applicant\u2019s complaints and the case file contained a record of the first-instance court hearings indicating that pronouncement had taken place.
