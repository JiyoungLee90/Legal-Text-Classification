It noted that the applicant, who was represented in the proceedings by a courtappointed defence counsel but had refused to participate in an oral hearing, had numerous previous convictions of burglary for which he had spent already more than 26 years in prison. He had always made his living outside prison from crime and had hardly worked in prison, arguing that the remuneration for his work was insufficient.

The applicant was free to deny having committed the offences he was convicted of by that final judgment in 1995, which as such did not mean that he risked being found to be a recidivist.

Endorsing the reasons given by the North Rhine-Westphalia Office for the Execution of Sentences, the court argued that if prisoners received a higher remuneration, private companies might no longer place any orders in view of the considerably lower productivity of prisoners and prisoners would then not be able to work at all.

However, the applicability of one ground does not necessarily preclude that of another; a deprivation of liberty may, depending on the circumstances, be justified under one or more sub-paragraphs (see, among other authorities, Eriksen v. Norway, 27 May 1997, \u00a7 76, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III; Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 50, Reports 1998VI; and Witold Litwa, cited above, \u00a7 49).",

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2\u00a0March 1987, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2002IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a053236/99, \u00a7 65, 10 December 2002; Kafkaris v.

However, with the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and a further deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7 40, and Eriksen, cited above, \u00a7 78). The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040; Eriksen, cited above, \u00a7 78; Weeks, cited above, \u00a7 49; and M.\u00a0v.\u00a0, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

The Court was satisfied that Mr M.'s initial preventive detention within that maximum period occurred \u201cafter conviction\u201d by the sentencing court for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a). The Court took note of the fact that preventive detention was fixed with regard to the danger the person concerned presented to the public \u2013 and thus served (also) a preventive purpose. It considered, however, that an order of preventive detention under Article 66 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code was nevertheless always dependent on and ordered together with a sentencing court's finding that the person concerned was guilty of an offence and thus resulted from a \u201cconviction\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 96).",

There appear to be no special measures, instruments or institutions in place, other than those available to ordinary long-term prisoners, directed at persons subject to preventive detention and aimed at reducing the danger they present and thus at limiting the duration of their detention to what is strictly necessary in order to prevent them from committing further offences (cited above, \u00a7 128).",
