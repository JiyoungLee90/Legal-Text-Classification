He had not asked the court to order a further inquiry into his allegations. Nor had he complained about any shortcomings in the inquiry conducted. The trial court\u2019s findings had focused on the admissibility of evidence and it had not delved into the issue of ill-treatment.

They conceded that the applicant had been in a stressful situation and under pressure; however, he had not proffered any explanation as to why he had not appealed against the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrators. The fact that the applicant\u2019s lawyer had lodged a complaint with the national judicial authorities in 2006 was of no relevance.
