Greece, 9 December 1994, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 301-B; National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 112; Zielinski and\u00a0Pradal and Gonzalez and Others v.

The outcome of the proceedings is the content of a judicial decision to be rendered in a judicial procedure concerning a specific substantive-law issue (the object of the proceedings), on the legal basis of specific substantive-law provisions. In the instant case, the State indeed intervened for the purpose of modifying the content of the substantive relationship between itself and the individuals concerned, irrespective of whether the persons concerned had initiated judicial proceedings. It does not make sense to say that the legislation interferes with the outcome of the proceedings, as the subsequent proceedings are different proceedings: they have a different legal basis in (new) substantive law and a different object.

Greece (9 December 1994, Series A no. 301B) as the point of departure of the case-law protecting judicial proceedings against legislation influencing their outcome. In that case the State indeed interfered with judicial proceedings by trying to change the adjudicating body by redefining its jurisdiction. Later, the concept of \u201clegislation influencing the outcome of judicial proceedings\u201d was extended \u2013 without any deeper reflection or explanations \u2013 to substantive legislation (see, for instance, the case of Zielinski and Pradal and Gonzalez and Others v. France ([GC], nos.\u00a024846/94 and 9 others, ECHR 1999VII). Yet, as explained above, there is a fundamental difference between changes in procedural and substantive rules.

In the instant case, those persons were denied any protection. Why this moment of initiating judicial proceedings is considered so important for substantive protection remains a mystery. In my view, it is irrelevant. The price to be paid for this approach is that Article 6 narrows the legal perspective and may hide the most fundamental substantive issues at stake so effectively that it undermines the protection afforded under Article 1 of Protocol No 1.",
