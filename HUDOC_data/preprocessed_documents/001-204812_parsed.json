Thus, there was no court decision authorising the applicant\u2019s detention until 22 July 2008 when the domestic court finally addressed that question. Both the domestic court and the Government justified the failure to rule on the applicant\u2019s continued detention with a typographical error and alleged that that question had in fact been addressed and ruled upon on 14\u00a0July 2008. The Court notes, however, that the Government have failed to provide any evidence in support of their allegation. Nor is there any material in the case file to suggest that the question of the applicant\u2019s continued detention had indeed been addressed by the examining judge when adopting the decision of 14 July 2008. In any event, even assuming that this had been so, it would still not affect the fact that the relevant decision contained no ruling regarding the applicant\u2019s detention. It follows that there was no court decision authorising the applicant\u2019s detention between 15 and 22 July 2008, in violation of domestic law. The Court underlines in this connection that a mere retroactive reference to a typographical error cannot be regarded as remedying that situation.",

In the present case, the domestic courts similarly justified the applicant\u2019s continued detention with a mere citation of the relevant domestic provisions and a reference to the gravity of the imputed offence without addressing the specific facts of his case or providing any details as to why the risks of absconding, obstructing justice or reoffending were justified. The Court therefore concludes that the domestic courts failed to provide relevant and sufficient reasons for the applicant\u2019s detention.",

It is true that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against that particular initial decision. However, he did raise the issue of lack of reasons before the Criminal Court of Appeal in two subsequent appeals (see paragraphs 41 and 48 above). Furthermore, as already indicated above, the reasoning provided by the District Court remained the same throughout that entire period and was, moreover, couched in abstract and stereotyped language. Thus, the applicant can be said to have brought this issue before the Criminal Court of Appeal and this complaint cannot be dismissed for failure to exhaust the domestic remedies. The Court therefore decides to reject the remainder of the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion.",

The applicant argued that, even if the records of the statements taken by his lawyer from the persons whom he had sought to call as witnesses had been included in the case file, they had not had the same evidentiary value as witness testimony made in court and, in any event, the decision to include those records had been a mere formality since the District Court had not given them any importance.",

Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the \u201cautonomous\u201d sense given to that word in the Convention system. In the context of taking evidence, the Court has paid particular attention to compliance with the principle of equality of arms, which is one of the fundamental aspects of a fair hearing and which implies that the applicant must be \u201cafforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent\u201d. Therefore, even though it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to call a witness, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to do so was incompatible with Article 6. When a request by a defendant to examine witnesses is not vexatious, is sufficiently reasoned, is relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened the position of the defence or even led to his acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such a request. If they fail to do so, the Court may conclude that the overall fairness of the proceedings has been undermined (see, among other authorities, Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 202-204, and Murtazaliyeva v.

A similar situation was examined by the Court in a case against Armenia, in which a violation of Article 6 was found and which, moreover, concerned the same events as in the present case (see Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 200-211).",

The charge against the applicant under Article 316 \u00a7 1 of the CC was built to a large and decisive extent on the testimony of three police officers who had been actively involved in the contested events, with the other two police officers who also testified against the applicant not witnessing the alleged assault on police officer K.H. The applicant\u2019s requests to call witnesses, which were sufficiently substantiated and of direct relevance to the charge against him, were dismissed by the trial court with very brief and unconvincing reasoning (see paragraph 60 above). It is true that the contested events were not, strictly speaking, related to the applicant\u2019s conduct at a public event. They nevertheless concerned an alleged incident which on arguable grounds was related to the applicant\u2019s involvement in the rallies and in which the police officers were actively involved (see paragraph 129 below). Furthermore, the fact that the written statements taken by the applicant\u2019s lawyer from the persons whom he had sought to call as witnesses were included in the case file could not compensate for the fact that those persons were not called and questioned in court at an oral and adversarial hearing. Nor does it appear that due consideration was given to that evidence by the trial court (see paragraph 63 above). The Court therefore considers that the domestic courts, in a dispute over the key facts underlying the charges, failed to use every reasonable opportunity to verify the incriminating statements of the police officers who were the only witnesses for the prosecution and had played an active role in the contested events. Their unreserved endorsement of the police version of events, failure to address properly the applicant\u2019s submissions and refusal to examine the defence witnesses without proper regard to the relevance of their statements can be said to have led to a limitation of the defence rights incompatible with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 210).",

Referring in that regard to PACE Resolutions nos. 1609 and\u00a01620, he contended that the aim of his prosecution had been to isolate him from other opposition supporters and activists who had been organising continuing protests against the irregularities in the presidential election and to punish him for his adherence to opposition forces and his continued participation in the rallies. Even if this had been a disguised form of prosecution based on fabricated charges, a number of elements of the case showed a clear link between the formal basis and the real motives of his prosecution. In particular, his case had been joined with criminal case no.\u00a062202608 which had been a class action against the supporters of Mr\u00a0TerPetrosyan for organising the protests; he had been repeatedly questioned about his role in organising the protests during the investigation; his detention had been extended and his access to the outside world had been restricted with reference to that case; his trial had been conducted in a highly politicised atmosphere where nearly all the seats in the courtroom had been occupied by plainclothes police officers as a way of putting pressure on the courts. Even though his case had eventually been disjoined from the main criminal case, this was only because the authorities had failed in their attempt to set up charges against him for involvement in the peaceful protests. That was the reason why, at the same time, they had brought the charge of illegally carrying a baton. In support of his contention that his arrest and subsequent prosecution had been politically motivated, the applicant also drew parallels between his case and that of Virabyan v.\u00a0Armenia (no. 40094/05, \u00a7\u00a7 204-207 and 224, 2 October 2012).",

The failure of the authorities to verify whether his allegations of politically-motivated prosecution had been substantiated was also a factor to be taken into account.

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof.

It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions.

Armenia, no. 34320/04, \u00a7\u00a7 87-90, 10 April 2012; Virabyan v. Armenia, no. 40094/05, \u00a7\u00a7 203-210, 2 October 2012, which concerned similar allegations but in the context of Article 14 of the Convention; and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 241-243, which concerned the same protest movement as in the present case).\u00a0In the case of Hakobyan and Others, in particular, the Court found that during a period when opposition rallies had been held in protest against the results of the presidential election of 2003 there had been an administrative practice of deterring or preventing opposition activists from participating in those rallies, or punishing them for having done so, by resorting to the procedure of short-term imprisonment under the Code of Administrative Offences, including on such grounds as using foul language or disobeying police orders in circumstances unrelated to the rallies. Finding that the applicants, three opposition supporters, had fallen victim to that practice, the Court rejected the factual basis for their convictions on those grounds and concluded that the true reason for their imprisonment was to prevent or discourage them from participating in the ongoing opposition protests (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 90-99). A similar conclusion was reached in the case of Virabyan in respect of the applicant\u2019s arrest on suspicion of illegal possession of a weapon and subsequent administrative proceedings for alleged disobedience to police (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0203210). The Court has applied a similar approach in the context of Article 11 also in a number of cases against other countries (see Nemtsov v. Russia, no.\u00a01774/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a066-71, 31 July 2014; Karpyuk and Others v. Ukraine, nos.\u00a030582/04 and 32152/04, \u00a7\u00a7 194-206, 6 October 2015; and Huseynli and Others v.

As already noted in the case of Mushegh Saghatelyan, this was a period of increased political sensitivity in Armenia involving opposition rallies held in protest against an allegedly unfair presidential election result. The response of the authorities that followed, including the arrests and detention of scores of opposition supporters, was condemned by the PACE and described as a \u201cde facto crackdown on the opposition\u201d. The charges brought against many of them, especially those based solely on police evidence, were suspected to have been \u201cartificial and politically motivated\u201d (see Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125-131 and 243). Moreover, there was evidence suggesting some opposition activists may have fallen victim to arrests and prosecutions on \u201cseemingly artificial charges\u201d already in the period from 20 to 29\u00a0February, that is before the events of 1 March 2008 and institution of the main criminal case no. 62202608 against the leaders and supporters of the opposition (see paragraph 70 above). Bearing in mind the description of the general context provided in the above-mentioned reports by various Council of Europe bodies, which are cause for grave concern and call for special vigilance and scrutiny on the part of the Court in dealing with the applicant\u2019s particular case, the Court will refer in this connection to the following factors.",

In particular, the trigger for the applicant\u2019s arrest was an alleged anonymous telephone call received at the PDFOC alleging that the applicant and the persons accompanying him were armed. There is, however, no objective evidence to support the fact that such a telephone call was indeed received at the PDFOC, such as for example a recording of that conversation or its detailed transcript. The precise nature of that anonymous telephone call was never revealed or examined at any stage of the proceedings either, which may call into question the veracity of this fact (compare with Virabyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0205). The police officers immediately proceeded to take the applicant into custody on such precarious grounds without first making any attempts to verify the information provided or carrying out any searches or checks on the spot (ibid., \u00a7 206). This initial suspicion against the applicant was almost immediately forgotten once the circumstances of his arrest gave rise to a different charge, namely that of an assault on a police officer which, moreover, was based exclusively on the statements of the police officers concerned (ibid., \u00a7 207; Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7 94; and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 251). All the above factors, as well as the striking vagueness of all the official documents concerning the initial reasons for the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraphs 9, 20 and 21 above), prompt the Court to believe that there were no genuine reasons for taking the applicant into custody and the fact that he was arrested on such precarious grounds actually gives an impression that the intention was to deprive the applicant of his liberty at any cost and that his arrest may have been effected in bad faith (compare with Virabyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 205-207, and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 249).",

Both the record of his \u201cbringing-in\u201d and the initial police report indicated the alleged illegal possession of arms as the sole reason for the applicant\u2019s arrest and mentioned nothing about any drug-related suspicions (see paragraphs 9 and\u00a013 above). Even the investigator\u2019s decision justified the need for a drug test with nothing more than the fact that a baton had been found in the applicant\u2019s possession, although the Court has difficulty seeing the connection between the two (see paragraph 15 above). It is true that the decision to institute a criminal case stated that the applicant had been brought in on suspicion of, inter alia, drug use (see paragraph 20 above) but there is no evidence whatsoever to support that statement. For the same reasons, the Government\u2019s arguments in that connection do not appear convincing and reliable.",

Moreover, this was done with reference to his participation in organising and conducting the rallies in question (see paragraphs 32, 34 and 36 above). The materials of that criminal case and the applicant\u2019s alleged involvement in a conspiracy to \u201cusurp State power\u201d were relied on to extend the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above). Furthermore, strict restrictions were placed on his contact with the outside world, again with reference to that criminal case, even though the only formal charge against the applicant was that of minor assault (see paragraph 37 above).",

However, for unexplained reasons no charge in that respect was brought against the applicant for the following four months, which casts doubt on the credibility and genuineness of that charge. It is notable that the bringing of that charge happened around the same period when the authorities gave up on their attempts to charge the applicant with the offence of usurpation of State power, which gives an impression that the authorities wanted to secure the applicant\u2019s conviction at any cost (see paragraphs 44, 46 and 49 above and compare with Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0251). Furthermore, as for the applicant\u2019s conviction for assault, that conviction was based exclusively on the testimony of the police officers concerned and the findings of fact made in that respect by the domestic courts appear to have been a mere and unquestioned recapitulation of the circumstances as presented in that testimony (compare with Hakobyan and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 98, and Mushegh Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0243). Thus, the manner in which the proceedings relating to that charge were conducted is strikingly similar to other cases where opposition activists had been prosecuted and convicted for similar acts, in similar circumstances and on the basis of similar evidence, which points to the existence of a repetitive pattern and casts doubt on the credibility of the criminal proceedings against the applicant (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 97-98; Virabyan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 204-209; and Mushegh\u00a0Saghatelyan, cited above, \u00a7 253).",

The entirety of the materials before it allows the Court to draw sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences as to the applicant\u2019s prosecution, and consequently the resulting conviction, being linked to his involvement and active participation in the protest movement led by the opposition.
