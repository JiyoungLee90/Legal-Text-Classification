The Presidium noted the lower courts\u2019 ignorance of the important substantive evidence, such as witnesses\u2019 statements corroborating the defendant\u2019s alibi, their selective and grossly inconsistent approach to the assessment of the circumstantial evidence, the overestimation of the evidential value of the victim\u2019s testimony and the defective understanding of the medical reports.

Quashing such a judgment amounts to an interference with his or her right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see, among other authorities, Brum\u0103rescu v. Romania, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074, ECHR, and Androsov v. Russia, no.\u00a063973/00, \u00a7 69, 6 October 2005). An interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interests of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, \u00a7 69). In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others, cited above, p. 23, \u00a7 38).",
