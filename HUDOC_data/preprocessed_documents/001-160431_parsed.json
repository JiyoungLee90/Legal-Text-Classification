The essential purpose of such an investigation is to establish the facts, secure the effective implementation of domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, identify any persons at fault and thus ensure their accountability (see Pearson\u00a0v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40957/07, \u00a7 67, 13\u00a0December 2011, with further references). That is the case, for instance, where a person dies in custody in suspicious circumstances (even where the apparent cause of death is a medical condition), which, as a rule, raises the question of whether the State has complied with its positive obligation to protect that person\u2019s right to life (see Slimani v. France, no. 57671/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030 and 34, ECHR 2004-IX (extracts); Kats and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115; Geppa v.\u00a0Russia, no. 8532/06, \u00a7\u00a071, 3\u00a0February 2011; and Makharadze and\u00a0Sikharulidze v. Georgia, no. 35254/07, \u00a7 87, 22 November 2011). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see, for example, Dzieciak v.

The Court has acknowledged that human rights cases before it generally also have a moral dimension and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in seeing to it that justice is done even after the applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a033071/96, ECHR 2000XII). Accordingly, the Court normally permits the next of kin to pursue an application where the original applicant has died after lodging an application with the Court. However, the issues involved are different where the direct victim dies before his or her complaint is brought before the Court (see Fairfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a024790/04, ECHR 2005-VI). Although the locus standi of a victim\u2019s next of kin has been recognised where the victim had died or disappeared in circumstances which were alleged to engage the responsibility of the State (see paragraph 73 above with further references), the Court\u2019s approach has been more restrictive in cases where the alleged violation of the Convention was not closely linked to disappearances or deaths giving rise to issues under Article 2.",
