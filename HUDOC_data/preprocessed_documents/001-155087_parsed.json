The length of the trial was due to the complexity of the case, involving several charges and several coaccused. The case file comprised sixty-six volumes. On several occasions between 2002 and 2005 hearings were scheduled before the Regional Court following the applicant\u2019s complaints. Furthermore, three judges had to be replaced during the trial: in March 2005 one of the judges (judge G.) went on maternity leave, and in February and August 2006 two others (judges M. and Mar.) resigned. On many occasions the hearings were adjourned due to non-attendance of the defendants, their representatives, and witnesses. The proceedings were further stayed at the request of the applicant, who needed time to study the case file. In view of the foregoing arguments, the Government concluded that the length of the proceedings in the present case had not breached the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement set out in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

He explained that on several occasions between 2002 and 2005 he had indeed complained to the Regional Court about the procedural decisions of the District Court, and that the decisions in question had been found unlawful. He argued that he should not be held responsible for delays in the proceedings on account of having challenged unlawful decisions. The applicant further clarified that four judges had been replaced during the proceedings: judges A., G., S. and M. The trial, therefore, had had to start anew four times: in 2002, 2005 and twice in 2006. The applicant stressed, however, and provided evidence, that judges A. and M., who had allegedly retired in 2002 and 2005 respectively, had continued to adjudicate cases in the District Court in 2007. As to the adjournments of hearings due to the absence of the accused, the applicant submitted that throughout the preliminary investigation and the trial he had remained in the remand prison and had always been escorted to attend the court hearings. The only time when he could not be escorted was in the short period between May and July 2005 when he was in the prison hospital. That period of time was negligible compared with the overall length of the proceedings. As to the non-attendance of witnesses, the applicant contended that those who had failed to appear were prosecution witnesses, and that it was for the court to discipline them. He submitted that most of the prosecution witnesses had failed to appear and that he had had to agree to the reading out of their statements given at the pre-trial stage of the investigation in order to expedite the proceedings. He acknowledged that between 19 May and 11 July 2003 and between 10 December 2004 and 17\u00a0January 2005 the trial had been adjourned at his request, as he had needed time to study the case file. He pointed out, however, that during part of the latter period the court had not worked anyway because of the New Year\u2019s holidays. Summing up, the applicant argued that the main reason for the excessive length of the criminal proceedings against him had been the poor organisation in the work of the investigating authority and the court.",
