In a series of cases the Court considered that a clear case of overcrowding was a sufficient element for concluding that Article 3 of the Convention had been violated (see Colesnicov v. Romania, no. 36479/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a078-82, 21\u00a0December\u00a02010, and Budaca v. Romania, no. 57260/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-45, 17\u00a0July\u00a02012). Moreover, it has already found violations of Article\u00a03 of the Convention on account of the material conditions of detention in Jilava Prison, especially with respect to overcrowding and lack of hygiene (see, for example, Cucu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 82; Goh v. Romania, no.\u00a09643/03, \u00a7\u00a066, 21 June 2011; Gy\u00f6rgyp\u00e1l v.\u00a0Romania, no. 29540/08, \u00a7\u00a073, 26\u00a0March\u00a02013; and Constantin Tudor v.\u00a0Romania, no. 43543/09, \u00a7\u00a075, 18\u00a0June\u00a02013).",
