In answer to a question concerning medication in general, the applicant stated that before his admission to the institution, he had not taken any medication.

For this reason the applicant did not refuse the medication. Only on one occasion did he express the wish not to take a certain medicine and the doctor of the institution prescribed him another drug, which he had not taken before either.",

Regarding the latter, it held that the alleged shortcomings in the proceedings did not constitute irregular official conduct for which the State could be held responsible because the conduct had resulted in a decision. The former situation did not arise in the present case either, as there had been no final decision that was later quashed as illegal. Furthermore, the Ministry did not find that the applicant had suffered any damage. It considered that his own behaviour had been at the origin of the facts, because of his excessive drinking. It added that in any case the applicant\u2019s lawyer had no right to submit those claims to the Ministry, as the applicant had been deprived of his legal capacity and a guardian had been appointed to act on his behalf.",

The Constitutional Court has examined similar questions in the past ... for example in decision no. II. \u00daS 2508/09 ... where it found that Article 5 of the Convention did not require a review of the lawfulness of confinement ... once it was terminated and the internee was at liberty.

Accordingly, while the guarantees contained in paragraph 4 focus on a situation where the person concerned is still detained, paragraph 5 guarantees ... that when the lawful conditions for deprivation of liberty are not complied with, he or she is entitled to claim damages.",

The very form of the consent demonstrates the seriousness of such a legal act which entirely corresponds to the severity of the restriction of the internee\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms. In a situation where a person does not give his or her written consent to his or her placement in a health-care facility, it is entirely appropriate that a court, considering the case independently and impartially, should enter into the relationship between the health-care facility and the person concerned. It is to be stressed that the court acts as an [official body reviewing] the steps undertaken by the health-care facility. In other words, the substance of the procedure under Article 191a of the Code of Civil Procedure is to guarantee the rights of those persons who cannot exercise them [due] to their placement in the health-care facility. As soon as the person is released from the care of the health-care facility, his or her rights are no longer prejudiced and the court no longer has a role. However, this [situation] does not [have any impact] on the fact that the person placed in the health-care facility contrary to the law may claim damages within the framework of private-law proceedings [in which the court] retroactively examines the question of the lawfulness of the steps undertaken by the health-care facility. [This procedure differs from that] ... initiated under Article 191a of the Code of Civil Procedure. Although the applicant\u2019s request that a time-limit be set for commencement of review proceedings to examine the lawfulness of his involuntary admission to, and continued confinement in the health-care facility, was rejected, [his] fundamental rights could not be interfered with because he had sought to initiate proceedings for which the conditions were not satisfied. First, the applicant had been released from the health-care facility and, secondly, during his confinement his guardian had consented to the above-mentioned [procedural] steps.\u201d",

The applicant added that even if his plea of nullity had succeeded, it would not have resolved his situation as the court could only quash the decision of the Prague 4 District Court. The case would have remained before that court and the court would only have to ensure his representation in the proceedings. According to the applicant, the court could not have decided differently because under the domestic law, his detention had been lawful. Furthermore, given the finding of the Constitutional Court of 28\u00a0March 2012, the applicant doubted that that court would have examined his new constitutional appeal on the merits.

The applicant attempted to initiate proceedings to have his involuntary placement in the social care home reviewed, but Czech law did not provide for proceedings to challenge \u201cvoluntary\u201d placement.

Furthermore, the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 143).

Where the complaint is, as in the present case, about the deprivation of liberty of a fully incapacitated person, based on an agreement signed by his guardian whose competence has been put in doubt and where it is clear that the deprivation was carried out against the person\u2019s will, an adequate remedy is primarily one capable of immediately terminating the continued violation by ordering the person\u2019s release. The specific requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention concerning the judicial character of a necessary procedure, including guarantees of an independent and impartial review based on the adversarial nature of the procedure and the principle of equality of arms, are inherent in such a remedy. Moreover, retrospective compensatory relief could be supplementary to that remedy (see M.\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 2452/04, \u00a7 84, 19 April 2012).",

The Convention requirement for an act of deprivation of liberty to be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny is of fundamental importance in the context of the underlying purpose of Article\u00a05 of the Convention to provide safeguards against arbitrariness. In the case of detention on the grounds of mental illness, special procedural safeguards may be called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental illness, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 170, with further references).
