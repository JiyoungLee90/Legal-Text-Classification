However, he lodged appeals against all or most of the other numerous decisions prolonging his detention on remand over a period of 2 years and nearly 10 months. He also requested on several occasions that his detention be replaced by a more lenient preventive measure. The Court has already considered that those remedies, i.e. an appeal against a detention order and/or a request for release, whether submitted to the prosecutor or to the court, depending on the stage of the proceedings, and also an appeal against a decision to prolong detention on remand, serve the same purpose under Polish law. Their objective is to secure a review of the lawfulness of detention at any given time of the proceedings, both in their pre-trial and trial stage, and to obtain release if the circumstances of the case no longer justify continued detention (see Iwa\u0144czuk v. Poland (dec.), no. 25196/94, 9\u00a0November 2000 and Wolf v. , nos.\u00a015667/03 and 2929/04, \u00a7\u00a078, 16 January 2007). It follows from the Court's case-law that the applicant is not required to appeal against each and every decision prolonging his detention (see, a contrario, Bronk v.  (dec.), no. 30848/03, 11 September 2007). Furthermore, the Court considers that the applicant was not required to appeal against the refusals to release him in order to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In this respect, the Court recalls that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant the authorities could justifiably consider that such an initial risk was established. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

However, in that context the Court cannot but note that even though the bill of indictment was filed on 28 November 2003, the first hearing was held only on 14 June 2004 and the second hearing only five months later, on 3 November 2004. In this respect, the Court notes that the long intervals between the hearings were related to the administrative restrictions imposed on the trial court as to the number of detained defendants who, given limited police resources, could be brought to trial (see paragraphs 12 and 20 above). Although the trial court was not directly responsible for the resultant delays, the lack of a police escort to secure the applicant's presence at the trial can be attributed to the national authorities.
