The applicant was thereby prevented from receiving the money he had legitimately expected to receive. There has been therefore a causal link between the violations found and the applicant\u2019s claim for the pecuniary damage. At the time the judicial decisions in the applicant\u2019s favour were issued, the award was approximately equivalent to EUR 154,500 at the official exchange rate (see paragraph 17 above). Moreover, further pecuniary loss must have been occasioned on account of the period that elapsed from the time the judicial decisions had become enforceable until the Court\u2019s award (see Grinberg v.\u00a0Russia, no. 23472/03, \u00a7\u00a039, 21 July 2005). The applicant\u2019s assessment of that loss in the amount of EUR 6,100 does not appear excessive or unreasonable. In any event, the Government did not suggest a different method for calculation of interest. Accordingly, the Court awards the applicant EUR 160,600 in respect of the pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
