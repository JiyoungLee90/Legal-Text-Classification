The case originated in an application against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Licio Gelli (“the applicant”), on 14 July 1997. The application was registered on 11 September 1997 under file no. 37752/97. The applicant is represented by Mr Michele Gentiloni Silverj, a lawyer practising in Rome. The Italian Government are represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza.
The applicant complained that, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the criminal proceedings brought against him had not been heard within a reasonable time.
On 20 May 1998 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits. The Government submitted their observations on 4 September 1998, to which the applicant replied on 20 October 1998.
Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 § 2 thereof, the application was transferred to the Court.
In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Second Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included ex officio Mr B. Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 § 1 (a) of the Rules of Court), and Mr C. L. Rozakis, the President of the Section (Rule 26 § 1 (a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr M. Fischbach, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs V. Strážnická, Mr P. Lorenzen and Mrs M. Tsatsa-Nikolovska (Rule 26 § 1 (b)). Subsequently, Mr Fischbach replaced Mr Rozakis, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case, as President of the Chamber, and Mr A. Baka, substitute judge, replaced him as a member of the Chamber.
On 15 December 1998, the Chamber declared the application admissible.
At the Court’s request, the applicant and the Government submitted further information on 4 March and 5 March 1999 respectively.
