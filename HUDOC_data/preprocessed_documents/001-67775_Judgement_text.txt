The case originated in an application (no. 42703/98) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a national of  and , Mr Jovo Radovanovic (“the applicant”), on 9 July 1998.
In a judgment delivered on 22 April 2004 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held that the imposition of a residence prohibition of unlimited duration on the applicant was in breach of Article 8 of the Convention (Radovanovic v. Austria, no. 42703/98).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicant sought just satisfaction of non-pecuniary damage sustained from the imposition of the residence prohibition and reimbursement of costs and expenses.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant to submit, within three months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 42, and point 2 of the operative provisions).
The Government of Serbia and , having been informed of their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 61 § 2 of the Rules of Court), did not submit observations.
The Government and the applicant each filed observations on 22 September and 19 October 2004 respectively. They submitted concurringly that, by a decision of 16 August 2004, the Vienna Federal Police Office (Bundespolizeidirektion) had lifted the residence prohibition imposed on the applicant. The applicant submitted that he had subsequently made a request for an unlimited residence permit. To date, no decision has been taken on this request.
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
