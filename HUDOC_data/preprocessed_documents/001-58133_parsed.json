The applicant further pointed out that a revocation should comply with, inter alia, Chapter\u00a01, section\u00a05, of the 1987 Act which requires the authorities to take into consideration both private and public interests (see\nparagraph\u00a026 below).

If the Municipality had not completed the measure within a period of two years, the request should be decided without delay. It followed from this provision that a prolongation of the said period could not be made by means of revocation of the plan. Moreover, the Municipality had not been free to opt for both revocation and either amendment of the plan or adoption of a new plan. In the applicant\u2019s view, whilst the plan in question had been revoked with a view to adoption of a new plan, the measure fell to be considered as an amendment of the plan. Since the amendment had not been effected within the two-year time-limit, the Municipality had not been permitted both to amend and revoke the plan. Revocation of the plan was meaningless as Chapter\u00a05, section\u00a011, did not apply to a detailed development plan the completion of which had not been subjected to any time-limit. Contrary to what the Board and the Government had suggested, Chapter\u00a01, Section\u00a05, should apply in his case. In view of these considerations, the applicant requested that the Government\u2019s decision be quashed and that his application for a building permit be examined without further delay.",

Whilst the absence of a detailed development plan in a built-up area was in itself a sufficient ground for refusing the grant of a building permit (Chapter 5, section 1, of the 1987 Act), there was no time-limit or other requirement obliging the authorities to enact new plans.
