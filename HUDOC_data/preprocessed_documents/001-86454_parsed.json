They were told that this facility concerned parents, brothers and sisters, children and spouses. At the request of several inmates the warden apparently informally accepted to extend it to unmarried partners. At first the applicant, who before his incarceration had lived for about four years with Ms S.P. and had had a child with her just forty days before going to prison, was also able to benefit from the opportunity to call his partner on the telephone. However, in August 2001 the warden refused to allow him to avail himself of this facility. The applicant objected, but the warden replied that the law provided for a right to call spouses only and that if the applicant was so attached to his partner and their child, he could always marry her. In the beginning of 2002, following an intervention by the Child Protection Agency, which the applicant\u2019s lawyer had contacted about the matter, he was once again allowed to have telephone conversations with his partner.",

It does not seem that there exists any reported caselaw clarifying the exact purport of this provision and, in particular, how it interplayed with section 33(1)(c) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see, mutatis mutandis, Soini and Others v. , no. 36404/97, \u00a7\u00a7 55 in fine and 56, 17 January 2006). The Court further notes that in 2006 the Bulgarian Constitutional Court found that a provision whose wording was almost identical with that of section 33(1)(c) \u2013 the newly added section 132d(3) of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act \u2013 was contrary to Articles 30 \u00a7 5 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above). It is therefore open to doubt whether the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence, including that with his lawyer, was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d. However, the Court does not find it necessary to determine this point, as, for the reasons which follow, it considers that this measure was incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention in other respects (see, mutatis mutandis, Funke v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256A, p. 23, \u00a7 51; Cr\u00e9mieux v.\u00a0France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256B, p. 61, \u00a7 34; and Miailhe v.

This is borne out by the wording of section 37(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (see paragraph 19 above). It can thus be said that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of \u201cthe prevention of disorder or crime\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2.",

On this point, the Court observes that some measure of control over this correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 38, \u00a7 98; and Campbell, cited above, p.\u00a018, \u00a7 45). However, correspondence with lawyers, whether it concerns contemplated or pending proceedings or is of a general nature, is in principle privileged under Article 8 of the Convention and its routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client (see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 48). The prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner solely when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided, such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner. The reading of a prisoner\u2019s mail to and from a lawyer, on the other hand, should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature. What may be regarded as \u201creasonable cause\u201d will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication is being abused (see Campbell, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 48).",

It does not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners correspond. Nor does it, or the regulations for its application, lay down any rules \u2013 for instance, concerning timelimits \u2013 governing the implementation of this monitoring. Moreover, the authorities are not bound to give any reasons in a particular case (see, mutatis mutandis, Calogero Diana, cited above, p.\u00a01775, \u00a7 32; Domenichini v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996V, p. 1799, \u00a7 32; Petra, cited above, p. 2854, \u00a7 37; and Niedba\u0142a v. , no. 27915/95, \u00a7 81, 4 July 2000). Even allowing for a certain margin of appreciation in this domain, the Court finds that the monitoring of the entirety of the applicant\u2019s correspondence addressed to and coming from the outside world \u2013 including the letters to and from his lawyer \u2013 cannot be considered as corresponding to a pressing social need or proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Neither the competent domestic authorities, nor the Government have sought to explain why such allembracing monitoring was indispensable (see Jankauskas v. , no. 59304/00, \u00a7 21, 24 February 2005). On the contrary, the  voiced serious concerns in this regard (see paragraph 21 above).",

Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of one or more of such provisions, and to this extent it is autonomous, there can be no room for its application unless the facts of the case fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter (see, among many other authorities, Sahin v.

On this point, it first observes that while any detention which is lawful under Article 5 of the Convention entails by its nature a limitation on private and family life, it is an essential part of an inmate\u2019s right to respect for family life that the prison authorities assist him in maintaining contact with his close family (see Messina v.  (no. 2), no. 25498/94, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2000X; Kalashnikov v.\u00a0 (dec.), no. 47095/99, ECHR 2001XI (extracts); and Aliev v.\u00a0, no. 41220/98, \u00a7 187, 29 April 2003). The Court further notes that a couple who have lived together for many years constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d for the purposes of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and are entitled to its protection notwithstanding the fact that their relationship exists outside marriage (see Velikova v.  (dec.), no. 41488/98, ECHR 1999V (extracts)). Finally, the Court observes that telephone conversations, whether they be made from a person\u2019s home or from other premises, are covered by the notions of \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports 1997III, p. 1016, \u00a7 44). Seeing that the person with whom the applicant wished to converse by telephone, Ms S.P., had been his unmarried partner for a number of years and had had a child with him, the prohibition to contact her by telephone undoubtedly affected the enjoyment of his right to respect for his private and family life, and as such fell within the ambit of Article 8. It is also clear that this prohibition concerned the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his \u201ccorrespondence\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 1 of that Article. Article\u00a014 is therefore applicable.",

[GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 160, ECHR 2008...). The Court must therefore determine whether the applicant \u2013 who had an established long-term de facto relationship with Ms S.P. (see paragraph 16 above) \u2013 was in an analogous situation with married prisoners as regards the possibility to contact their partners by telephone.",

The Court is also mindful that marriage remains an institution which is widely accepted as conferring a particular status on those who enter it and, indeed, is singled out for special treatment under Article 12 of the Convention (ibid.). However, it fails to see any difference between the situations of inmates who wish to have telephone conversations with their spouses and inmates who wish to have such conversations with their unmarried partners with whom \u2013 like the applicant\u00a0\u2013 they have an established family life. It therefore concludes that their situations are substantially similar in this regard.",

No such justification has been advanced in the instant case, either by the competent domestic authorities or by the Government in the proceedings before the Court. The obtaining situation was the result of the wording of section 37a(2) of the Regulations for the application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act and its particularly strict application by the prison authorities vis-\u00e0-vis the applicant in late 2001 and early 2002 (see paragraphs 16 and 24 above).",
