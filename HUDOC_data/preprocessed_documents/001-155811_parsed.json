Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that special circumstances existed which absolved him or her from this requirement (see Kalashnikov v.

This argument therefore is of a purely speculative nature. The Court further notes that the essence of the applicant\u2019s complaint is that her appeal on points of law was not admitted by the Court of Cassation because of the procedural requirement that such appeals should be lodged by qualified advocates whose services she could not afford, given her difficult financial situation.

In the classic case of Airey v. Ireland (9 October 1979, Series A no. 32) the applicant was \u201cimprisoned\u201d in a marriage for as long as legal aid was not granted and access to a court for the purpose of petitioning for a decree of judicial separation was de facto illusory. In contrast with that matter of great personal weight, the Court accepted in A.\u00a0v. United Kingdom (no. 35373/97, \u00a7\u00a099, ECHR 2002X) that not granting legal aid in a defamation case did not amount to an illegitimate restriction of access to a court. Our Court is not in a position to decide in a case-by-case manner whether legal aid should be granted, but a domestic system should guarantee that serious requests are taken into consideration. In the Court\u2019s case-law it has been accepted that a lack of a prospect of success might be a reason for refusing legal aid. An interesting example is to be found in Ritchie and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom ((dec), 6788/12, \u00a7 45, 13 November 2014), where the Scottish Legal Aid Commission had not found it established that \u201ca privately funded person of modest means would reasonably be advised to pursue this matter further\u201d. States Parties to the Convention are certainly allowed to make legal aid in civil matters dependent not only on conditions like a reasonable prospect of success, but also on indications like the level of urgency and significance of the interests at stake, as well as the requirement of a proportional personal contribution with due regard to the individual\u2019s financial situation. The unsurmountable problem of the applicant in the present case was the lack of any serious possibility in the domestic system of obtaining even due consideration of her right to legal aid in order to obtain access to the Court of Cassation.",

As the European Commission of Human Rights pointed out, it is self-evident that a legal aid system can only operate effectively by establishing machinery to select which cases should be legally aided (see, for example, the Commission\u2019s decisions of 10 July 1980 in the case of X v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a08158/78, Decisions and Reports 21, p. 95, and of 10\u00a0January 1991 in the case of Garcia v.

However, that was clearly the position in the case at hand, since only the least well-off litigants, those who had to apply for legal aid, were subjected to a prior scrutiny of the merits of their ground of appeal to the Court of Cassation. Unless there was an \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d for it, such difference in treatment could amount to discrimination. They continued that no system may impair the essence of the right of a particular class of litigant to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, and the existence of safeguards, even substantive ones, against abuse of the system intended to afford protection from arbitrariness, would not suffice to compensate for any such impairment.",
