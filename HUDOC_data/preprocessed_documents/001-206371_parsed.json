In this regard, the Court is unable to follow the Government\u2019s argument that the parties to the domestic proceedings are responsible for the delay of at least four and a half years because they have not suggested the name of a prospective liquidator to the Commercial Court. In this context, the Court reiterates that section 114 of the Law of Ukraine on restoring a debtor\u2019s solvency or declaring insolvency provided that a commercial court might dismiss and appoint a liquidator of its own motion, and Article 28 \u00a7 4 of the Code on Bankruptcy Proceedings provides that a commercial court may dismiss a liquidator if he applies to withdraw from a case. The commercial court indeed accelerated the procedure for appointing a new liquidator in 2018, but with little success (see paragraphs 29-38 above). Having said that, the Court reiterates that it is for the State to organise its legal system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Zavodnik v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 53723/13, \u00a7 97, 21 May 2015, and De Blasi v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a01595/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, 5 October 2006).
