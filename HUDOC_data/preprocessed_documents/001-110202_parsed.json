Where a judgment is against the State, the defendant State authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed thereof and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for compliance (see Akashev, cited above, \u00a7 21). The complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure or of the State budgetary system cannot relieve the State of its obligation under the Convention to guarantee to everyone the right to have a binding and enforceable judicial decision enforced within a reasonable time (see Burdov\u00a0(no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 70).

It notes that the enforcement proceedings were not particularly complex given the nature of the award and that no significant delays can be attributed to the applicant. Indeed, once the judgment became final, the trial court forwarded the pertinent writ of enforcement to the authority it considered relevant at the time, namely the bailiff service. The fact that the enforcement proceedings at the material time were so complex that even the domestic court could not determine correctly which State body was the due recipient of the writ of enforcement does not relieve the State of its obligation to act in accordance with the principles cited above. In particular, once the authorities were in possession of the writ of enforcement, it was open to them to adopt a more practical approach and to forward the document to the responsible body. Consequently, despite the applicant\u2019s failure to submit the documents to the Ministry of Finance after their return by the bailiff service, the full responsibility for enforcement of the court judgment rests with the State.",
