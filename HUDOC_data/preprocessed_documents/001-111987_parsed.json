It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1\u00a0December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could only assign a new legal-aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success. If this were not the case, a court was not obliged to assign a new legal-aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal (III\u00a0KZ\u00a0139/99).

When notified of a legalaid lawyer\u2019s refusal to prepare a cassation appeal, it is entirely appropriate and consistent with the fairness requirement, that an appeal court indicate to an appellant what further procedural options are available to him or her (see Kulikowski v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7 70; Antonicelli v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7 45; Jan Zawadzki v. Poland, no. 648/02, \u00a7 16, 6\u00a0July 2010). However, in the instant case this requirement was not complied with, with the result that the applicant\u2019s right of access to the Supreme Court was not secured in a \u201cconcrete and effective manner\u201d.",
