At the same time, according to the court, the time-limit was to be calculated from the date when the Prosecutor General's Office found out or must have found out about the problem with the carriages. In the court's opinion, that date was 3 January 2004, the date of the Court of Accounts' decision (see paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the action was lodged within the three-year limit. As to the applicant's objection concerning the existence of a final judgment concerning the same dispute, the court found that objection ill-founded because the first set of proceedings had concerned the issue of compensation while the second concerned the issue of the annulment of the privatisation.

Since the Prosecutor's Office only sought the annulment of the sale of 199,875 shares, his new request could not be treated in a supplementary judgment. In any event, the issue of the new shares took place in 2002 and, therefore, the Prosecutor Office's action was time-barred. The approach taken by the court in respect of the time-limit in the main proceedings was inapplicable to the new request of the Prosecutor General's Office because the Court of Accounts did not refer to the problem of the issue of new shares in its judgment of 3 January 2004.

According to the court, it was impossible to make such a reinstatement without annulling the shares issued in 2002. Since the court failed to rule on that problem, it was necessary to treat it in a supplementary judgment. The court ordered the annulment of the new shares arguing that otherwise the Government would own only 30.59% of the quarry's stock, a situation contrary to the judgment of 12 July 2007, where it was ordered that the Government be reinstated in its right of ownership of 65.86% of the shares.

Having participated in the auction organised by the Government, the applicant company offered the best price and was allowed to purchase the stock put up for sale by the Government. Some four years later, the Government considered that due to the failure to reflect the train carriages in the price of the quarry's shares, the price paid by the applicant company had been too low. It appears clearly from the facts of the case that it was the Government which had failed to reflect the train carriages in the quarry's accounting documents back in 1996 and later put up the quarry for privatisation without making mention of the carriages in its accounting documents. Unjust enrichment proceedings were instituted against the applicant company and an additional amount of MDL 972,000 was indicated for the quarry's shares. It was thus not shown that the applicant company was responsible in any way for the alleged reduction in the price of shares during the privatisation process.",

This time the responsibility for the alleged reduction of the price was attributed to the applicant company, without any evidence being presented or reasons given therefor. Although the authorities must have been aware of the alleged grounds for annulling the contract from the outset, no explanation has been offered as to why six years were allowed to elapse before the annulment proceedings were commenced.",

However, the Government realised soon afterwards that the outcome of the proceedings was not sufficient to secure their control over the quarry because, in the meantime, the quarry had issued new shares and thus the stock regained by the Government no longer represented a controlling share in the quarry. In order to overcome the situation, the Government supplemented its initial claim before the courts with a request to annul the shares issued by the quarry in 2002. The Government's supplementary claim was accepted by the courts in its entirety despite the applicant company's contention that, inter alia, the problem of the annulment of the shares issued in 2002 was to be treated as a new court action. The courts also dismissed the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the price of the annulled shares and ordered the applicant company to accept instead used mining equipment which could serve no purpose for it and which therefore had been abandoned by the applicant company on the quarry's premises.",
