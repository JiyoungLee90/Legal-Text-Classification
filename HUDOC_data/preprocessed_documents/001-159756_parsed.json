On 22\u00a0October 2010 the applicant sent the completed application form to the Court, raising the same complaints in more detail. Given that the applicant submitted the completed application form without excessive delay, the Court confirms that the date of his first letter to the Court is the date of the introduction of the application (see, with similar reasoning, Kozlitin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a017092/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43, 14\u00a0November 2013).

However, in so far as the Government referred to the need for the resetting of the time-limit for appeal, the Court observes that such necessity was prompted by the domestic authorities\u2019 own failure to provide the applicant with a copy of the custody order of 22 March 2010 in time for him to comply with the timelimit for lodging an appeal (see paragraph 13 above). The Court is also mindful of the fact that it took the Garrison Court twelve days to reset the above time-limit (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above), and another thirteen days to submit the applicant\u2019s appeal to the Fleet Court for examination (see paragraph 16 above). Moreover, as regards the need for an adjournment of the hearing so as to ensure the applicant\u2019s participation, the Court observes that this was a result of the domestic authorities\u2019 failure to notify the applicant in advance about the examination of his appeal (see paragraph 17 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to show required diligence in dealing with the applicant\u2019s appeal and that the overall delay in those proceedings was wholly caused by those failings.",
