Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court was competent to ensure uniformity of the application of domestic law. In the case referred to by the applicant (see paragraph 17 above), the Supreme Court had rejected the appeal on points of law lodged by the employer as belated. Accordingly, that court had not had the opportunity to examine the merits of the case. There had been no long-lasting difference in the domestic jurisprudence in cases such as the applicant\u2019s. The disputed issue concerning the time when the Regulations entered into force appeared before the Supreme Court for the first time in the applicant\u2019s case.

The fact that the applicant\u2019s case was the sole case where the Supreme Court had adjudicated the particular issue in question indicated that the employer had agreed with the other decisions of the appellate courts, and had thus not challenged them by means of an appeal on points of law.
