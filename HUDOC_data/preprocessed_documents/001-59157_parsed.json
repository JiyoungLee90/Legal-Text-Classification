It is also visible from footpaths in the vicinity and particularly from one that runs along the back of the site. The group of three caravans within the fenced site is a most conspicuous and alien form of development in this exposed rural location and is in conflict with the character and appearance of its surroundings. An attempt has been made to screen the caravans on the hillside by planting evergreens but many have died.

The Government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up. ACERT research (see below) had showed that 24% of local authorities (96) had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision. It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and that detailed policies should be provided. Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the Government\u2019s objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation, applying for planning permission like everyone else.

In 1991, the last years in which the success of application rates was evaluated, it was ascertained that 90 per cent of applications for planning permission by Gypsies were denied. In contrast, 80 per cent of all planning applications were granted during the same period. It is to be noted that, as a category, Gypsy planning applications are relatively unique insofar as they typically request permission to park caravans in areas or sites which are subject to restriction by local planning authorities. As such, virtually all Gypsy planning applications are highly contentious. Nonetheless, the fact remains\nthat there is inadequate provision or availability of authorized halting sites (private or public), which the high rate of denial of planning permission only exacerbates. Moreover, there are indications that the situation has deteriorated since 1994. ... In face of these difficulties, the itinerant lifestyle which has typified the Gypsies is under threat.\u201d (pp. 113-114)",

The Government pointed out that local planning authorities were encouraged to adopt a sympathetic approach to any question of enforcement action under Circular 18/94 (see paragraphs 49-50 above) and that large numbers of caravans on unauthorised sites were tolerated (see the statistics cited at paragraph 55 above).

Because Planning Inspectors visit the site, hear the arguments on all sides and allow examination of witnesses, they are better situated than the Court to weigh the arguments. Hence, as the Court observed in Buckley (loc. cit. p. 1292, \u00a7 75 in fine), \u201cin so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation\u201d, although it remains open to the Court to conclude that there has been a manifest error of appreciation by the national authorities. In these circumstances, the procedural safeguards available to the individual applicant will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, it must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see the Buckley judgment, cited above, p. 1292-3, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77).",

As intimated in the Buckley judgment, the vulnerable position of gypsies as a minority means that some special consideration should be given to their needs and their different lifestyle both in the relevant regulatory planning framework and in arriving at the decisions in particular cases (loc. cit., pp. 1292-95, \u00a7\u00a7 76, 80, 84).

He identified the risk that planning permission could lead to the establishment of other sites with a very harmful effect to an attractive valley in a Special Landscape Area. Conversely, it was not unlikely that a less inappropriate place could be found by the applicant for placing his caravans. Thus, he concluded that the complete unsuitability of the site outweighed the applicant\u2019s needs.",

In this context, the cost of a site compared with the applicant\u2019s assets, and its location compared with the applicant\u2019s desires are clearly relevant. Since how much the applicant has by way of assets, what outgoings need to be met by him, what locational requirements are essential\nfor him and why they are essential are factors exclusively within the knowledge of the applicant, it is for the applicant to adduce evidence on these matters. He has not placed before the Court any information as to his financial situation, or as to the qualities a site must have before it will be locationally suitable for him, nor does the Court have any information as to the efforts he has made to find alternative sites. The Court is therefore not persuaded that there were no alternatives available to the applicant besides remaining in occupation on land without planning permission in a Special Landscape Area. As stated in the Buckley case, Article 8 does not necessarily go so far as to allow individuals\u2019 preferences as to their place of residence to override the general interest (judgment cited above, p. 1294, \u00a7\u00a081). If the applicant\u2019s problem arises through lack of money, then he is in the same unfortunate position as many others who are not able to afford to continue to reside on sites or in houses attractive to them.",

Further, the application to gypsies of general laws and policies failed to accommodate their particular needs arising from their tradition of living and\ntravelling in caravans.

While the applicant was subsequently offered places on two official sites, he has submitted that these were unfit for habitation. It appears that the Broomfield site, next to a rubbish tip, has since been closed down. The Vauxhall site, next to a sewage works and a steelworks operating 24 hours a day, has only recently been refurbished. The applicant\u2019s allegations that the level of noise was such as to interfere seriously with the sleep of site residents were substantiated by the fact that the Council has issued a Noise Abatement Notice against the steelworks.",
