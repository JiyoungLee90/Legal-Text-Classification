The Constitutional Court then stated that a case could be assigned to another chamber of the same court, in compliance with Article 262 of the CCP, only if there were important reasons for such an assignment. The Constitutional Court noted that the appellate court in that case had assigned a case to another chamber of the same first-instance court, because there had been a failure to respect its (the appellate court\u2019s) binding instructions. However, the Constitutional Court found that the appellate court had criticised the first-instance court\u2019s assessment of the evidence and had adopted its own conclusions regarding factual findings and the accused\u2019s guilt, conclusions which it (the appellate court) had then imposed on the court of first instance.

The Constitutional Court held that the reasons for applying Article 262 of the CCP must be important, clear and indisputable, and that the existence of those reasons must be unequivocally demonstrated. An appellate court doubting the impartiality of a chamber of a court of first instance as regards a case which it examined \u2013 doubt which the appellate court voiced after repeated annulments of decisions of the court of first instance \u2013 would certainly count as such a reason. However, if the appellate court reached the same conclusion without justifying it on the basis of the chamber\u2019s bias, and merely by finding that the court of first instance had disregarded its (the appellate court\u2019s) guidelines for assessing evidence, it could not be considered an absolutely exceptional procedure within the meaning of Article 262 of the CCP.",

In particular, the court stated that such a decision by an appellate court would be constitutional only if it was highly probable that the original judge in the case would not be able to resolve the case in a manner which the appellate court could uphold. The court referred to repeated failures to comply with the binding instructions of an appellate court, including in relation to factual findings being assessed differently. It reiterated that an appellate court might order a first-instance court to eliminate the discrepancies in factual findings or re-examine and obtain certain pieces of evidence, and that its instructions must be adequately concrete. If those requirements were fulfilled, the appellate court could not quash the first-instance court\u2019s decision only in order to push through its own assessment of the evidence and its own findings. The Constitutional Court summarised by stating that the application of Article\u00a0262 would demonstrate manifest arbitrariness if an appellate court did not give sufficient reasons for such a procedure, or if it relied on reasons which were evidently not relevant.",

It held that when an appellate court assessed evidence differently from a first-instance court, after quashing an impugned judgment, it could not decide the case without evidence being adduced. If, for example, an appellate court disagreed with how a specific witness statement had been assessed, it should hear the witness itself in order to have an adequate basis for assessing the statement differently and changing factual findings. This procedure reflects the principles of directness and immediacy under Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12 of the CCP. In a situation where a first-instance court had assessed the evidence and all the circumstances of a case diligently, in compliance with Article\u00a02\u00a0\u00a7\u00a06 of the CCP, an appellate court could not quash an impugned judgment on the basis that it would assess the same evidence differently. The appellate court could only point out to the first-instance court what other circumstances to take into account, but it should not bind the first-instance court as to what factual conclusions it should reach. For instance, when considering the credibility of a witness, the appellate court could hold that the first-instance court had erred by overrating negligible discrepancies in the description of a perpetrator, because forensic psychology showed that such discrepancies were common when witnesses were in a stressful situation. However, it should not order the first-instance court to consider the witness credible. This would be particularly inappropriate when the appellate court itself had not examined the witness, thereby unlawfully circumventing the first-instance court\u2019s task of assessing the credibility of the witness\u2019s testimony on the basis of a direct and immediate examination during the trial. Particular caution was required when a first-instance court acquitted an accused with regard to the principle of in dubio pro reo and clearly explained its doubts about the accused\u2019s guilt. Not having reasonable doubts about the accused\u2019s guilt on the basis of the case file \u2013 when the first-instance court had had such doubts after examining all the evidence with regard to the principle of immediacy \u2013 and therefore quashing the acquittal was allowed only when the doubts of the first-instance court were without merit.",

Concurrently, according to the long-standing case-law of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 49-55 above), established both before and after the adoption of the decisions of the Constitutional Court in the present case, Article 262 of the CCP is to be interpreted as enabling an appellate court to remit a case to another chamber or another first-instance court only if there are \u201cdistinct, evident and undeniably important reasons for that procedure and the existence of those reasons has been clearly proved\u201d.

However, the Court considers that this approach seems to be at odds with Article 263 \u00a7 7 of the CCP as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, in accordance with which the appellate court is bound by the assessment of the evidence carried out by the court of first instance (see paragraph 50 above). In this context, the Court\u00a0refers to the reasoning of the High Court\u2019s judgment by which the case was transferred to a different chamber of the Plze\u0148 Regional Court for a second time, and which went on to draw an alternative conclusion from the evidence previously examined by the court of first instance (see paragraphs 20-22 above), without the witness L.V. being heard by the High Court. The Court also refers to the judgment of the High Court by which the case was transferred to a different court of first instance, and which contains formulations that may be interpreted as suggesting that the first-instance court should reach different conclusions as to the credibility of the witness L.V., and that the appellate court would not accept any outcome other than the applicant\u2019s conviction (see paragraph 25 above). The Court observes that such conclusions sit uneasily with the Constitutional Court\u2019s long-standing case-law, which establishes, as summed up above (see paragraph 66 above), that an appellate court may not assess the credibility of a specific witness unless it hears him itself, as provided for in Article\u00a0263\u00a0\u00a7 7 of the CCP (see paragraph 47 above), and should not quash a judgment on acquittal unless the doubts of the first-instance court concerning the guilt of the accused are without any merit.

The Court has further accepted in other length-of-proceedings cases that monetary compensation can constitute adequate redress for excessively lengthy proceedings, and that the party concerned can then no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Chiarello, cited above, \u00a7 55, with further references).",
