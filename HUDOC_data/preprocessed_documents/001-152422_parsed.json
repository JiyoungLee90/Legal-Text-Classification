The trauma was caused by a transitory gunshot: the entry wound was located on the left side of the back of Mr Mihaylov\u2019s head and the exit wound on the right side of the forehead towards the temporal bone. The shot was fired from a distance close to point-blank range. The expert noted that, as the head could move in different directions, on the basis of the route of the bullet it was difficult to establish the dynamic position of the victim\u2019s body in relation to the gun at the moment of shooting.

The lorry belonged to Markan Ltd \u2013 it was left parked in the street with its signal lights on by GS, who worked as a supplier for Markan Ltd. The operator dispatched patrol officers Chief Sergeant SM and Chief Sergeant VS to the location in question. When the patrol vehicle approached the lorry on Tzar Boris III Street the three men who were around and inside the lorry attempted to escape and started running in the direction of the town centre. The patrol vehicle followed them along Tzar Boris III Street when two of the men ran towards the town centre and one ran towards Otez Paisii Street. Chief Sergeant SM went in pursuit of the two men running towards the town centre and Chief Sergeant VS followed the man who had gone in the direction of Otez Paisii Street; VS fired a warning shot in the air \u2013 using a \u2018stop\u2019 bullet. On Otez Paisii Street in proximity to Treger Caf\u00e9, and in front of building No. 5 Chief Sergeant VS caught up to the running man who while running had a mobile telephone in one of his hands and a pocket knife in the other. At this moment VS had already put his Makarov KT 23389 pistol into the holster on his hip so that he could run faster, and at the time there was a live bullet in the barrel of the pistol after the firing of the warning shot. VS was wearing a uniform, he had got off a police vehicle bearing insignia, he had shouted to the running man \u2018Stop! Police! Get down on the ground!\u2019 but the man had not stopped running. In front of the building on Otez Paisii Street BM stopped running, turned to face the police officer and swung at him with his hand which held a pocket knife. VS saw the blade in the street light and blocked the hand of the man. Without letting go of the knife, BM threw himself on VS, grabbed him around his waist while holding his arms, and attempted to take the gun out of VS\u2019s holster. VS took hold of BM\u2019s hand which was holding the gun, and then BM pushed VS onto the bonnet of an Opel with number plates CO 5486 KA which was parked nearby. As he was falling, V.S. managed to extricate himself from under B.M., while B.M. kept holding on to his gun with one of his hands, and holding the knife in the other. At the same time VS had both his hands on BM\u2019s hand with which he was trying to take the gun out of the holster. BM had managed to take out the gun while VS held his hand \u2013 as a shot was fired and the bullet hit the metal wall of the building of Treger Caf\u00e9. The direction of that shot was to the side and away from the place of the incident, which means that this shot was not fired as a warning shot. After the shooting, because of the fear for his life which he had experienced, VS was in a state of extreme stress and he was not able to recollect the events in detail. The struggle between the two was observed by three witnesses: GD, GK and EK who were standing in front of the building at Otez Paisii No. 5 and who did not interfere. Their testimonies confirm that BM had stopped running and had started to wrestle with VS. However, because of the stress, the dim light and the speed of the events the witnesses cannot recall details about the manner in which BM was shot and the position of the two men\u2019s bodies in relation to one another at the time of the shooting. From the appearance and the location of the gun wound on BM\u2019s head and the gunshot hole found in the bonnet of Opel CO 5486 KA, it is evident that after the first shot was fired, VS had managed to regain possession of the gun and shoot him in the head at close range. After the shooting VS was in a state of shock: he dropped the gun on the ground, he was moving erratically, he was bending down to BM who was lying on the ground, he took the knife from BM\u2019s hand and threw it onto the bonnet of Opel C 3034 \u041f\u0425. At this moment Chief Sergeant SM was in the town centre and he placed a call to VS\u2019s mobile; VS told him that trouble had occurred and SM called the operator to dispatch support. KB, the operator on duty, sent a patrol vehicle and an ambulance. BM was taken to the hospital in Samokov where in spite of the medical assistance he passed away from a traumatic head injury followed by shock and coma that led to irreversible heart and lung failure.",

In reaching his conclusion, the prosecutor found it established that, when running, Mr\u00a0Mihaylov had been holding a mobile telephone in one hand and a knife in the other. At some point he had stopped abruptly, had turned around and had swung at the officer with the knife. When the officer had tried to knock away the knife, Mr Mihaylov had wrestled with him, tried to reach the officer\u2019s handgun, and pushed him onto the bonnet of the car. A short struggle for the gun had followed and one shot had been fired accidentally. Following that, according to the prosecutor, the officer had managed to get hold of the gun and shoot Mr Mihaylov. As the victim had still been holding the knife, the police officer took it from his hands and threw it away. In the prosecutor\u2019s view Mr Mihaylov attacked the officer in order to avoid arrest and also to help his accomplices, who at that time were running away with a cassette player stolen from the lorry.",

Chief Sergeant S had acted in self-defence against a much younger man who had been holding a knife. Because of the weak light and the speed of the events, the circumstances of the shooting and the position of the bodies could not be established. Thirdly, once Chief Sergeant S identified himself as a police officer and fired a warning shot he was entitled under Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 42 below) to use force to arrest Mr Mihaylov, even if it had not been necessary to act in self-defence. The prosecutor also noted that Chief Sergeant S had never been disciplined but had been commended a number of times and that Mr Mihaylov had been known to the police and had been convicted five times. The fact that Mr Mihaylov held the knife in his left hand and that he must have used the same hand to grasp the gun of the officer, who was facing him, was not given attention.",

A further ballistics report dated 14 December 2007 found, in particular, that on the basis of photographs it had not been possible to establish the morphology, character and orientation of the bullet hole and thus the exact position of the bodies at the time of the shooting. Meanwhile, it appears that around this time the prosecutor in charge of the investigation stated that he disagreed with the court\u2019s instructions and requested to be allowed to withdraw from the case. It appears that this request was not granted, as he continued working on the case.",

The prosecutor noted, in support of his finding of self-defence, that an offender with a criminal record had attempted to attack a police officer, who had never been disciplined and who had received awards. The applicants sought judicial review, contending, inter alia, that the authorities had not bothered to carry out an effective investigation because of Mr Mihaylov\u2019s ethnicity and low social status. The Sofia Military Court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decree. Upon the appeal of the applicants, in a decision of 22 July 2008, the Military Court of Appeal set aside the lower court\u2019s decision. The Court of Appeal raised serious doubts in respect of the prosecutor\u2019s impartiality. It further noted the prosecutor\u2019s failure to establish who had fired the fatal shot and in what circumstances. The court also held that on the basis of the evidence collected, namely the eyewitnesses\u2019 testimony that the shooting had taken place on the car\u2019s bonnet and the conclusions of the medical-ballistics report about the channel of the wound, it was clear that at the moment of the lethal shooting Mr Mihaylov had been facing the bonnet of the car and the police officer had fired from behind. Thus the court found that immediately before the shooting the police officer had had full control over the victim, the use of force had not been necessary and there was sufficient evidence that the police officer had intentionally killed Mr Mihaylov. The court remitted the case, instructing the prosecutor to bring charges against the sergeant for murder as well as to discharge anybody who had demonstrated partiality from working on the case.",

However, two weeks later, in a decree of 15 December 2008, the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings against Chief Sergeant S, using almost identical reasoning to that in the decree of 9\u00a0January 2008, with some additional findings, some of which appeared contradictory. For example, at one point in the decree the prosecutor found that Mr Mihaylov had dropped the knife before he had reached for the sergeant\u2019s handgun, but subsequently he found that Mr Mihaylov had dropped the knife at the moment the fatal shot was fired. The prosecutor also referred to the police officer\u2019s fear of knives as justification for using force. Chief Sergeant S had claimed in his testimony of 12 September 2005 that he had developed a fear of knives after he was stabbed while making another arrest a year before the incident with Mr Mihaylov. No assessment of the police officer\u2019s psychological condition or his fitness to perform his duties at the material time was mentioned in the decree. In the report, the prosecutor advanced three different justifications for the use of force, namely, the justified use of force to make an arrest; self-defence; and the excessive use of force due to fear. No attempt was made to reconcile these three theories.",

He further held that the fight had taken place next to the car and not on its bonnet and that Mr Mihaylov had fallen on the bonnet after he had been shot. Following an appeal by the applicants, on 7 July 2009 the Sofia Military Court quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decree and again remitted the case for further investigation. Chief Sergeant S appealed against the decision. In his appeal he did not claim to have acted in self-defence but instead claimed that it had been an accidental killing, falling under Article 15 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor also challenged the decision. His appeal was rejected in a decision of the Military Court of Appeal on 22 July 2008. In a decree of 13 October 2009 the prosecutor discontinued the proceedings for the eighth time, stating that Mr Mihaylov had been holding a knife when he attacked the officer and that he had pushed the officer onto the bonnet of the car, dropping the knife and reaching for the handgun, and that after the shooting the officer had taken the knife and had thrown it away. The applicants sought judicial review. By a decision of 6 November 2009 the court granted the appeal and remitted the case, finding that the court\u2019s earlier instructions had not been complied with, that no additional investigation had been conducted, and that the prosecutor had based his conclusions on contradictory facts.",

As the domestic courts observed on a number of occasions, the forensic evidence indicated that Mr Mihaylov was shot from behind, in a position that gave the policeman full control over him. The relevance and significance of these findings was not altered by the fact that, in its final judgment, the Military Court of Appeal upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decree exonerating the policeman. The Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling lacked any analysis of its own concerning the necessity of the killing; it merely reproduced the partial reasoning of the prosecutor\u2019s office which had been declared inadequate and false a number of times previously by more critical and independent-thinking judges of the same court and of the lower court. Moreover, the Military Court of Appeal, in upholding the prosecutor\u2019s decision to exonerate the police officer, applied a legal test which was not in compliance with Article 2 of the Convention. Domestic law during the period in question did not require a test of absolute necessity to justify recourse to lethal force by the police. The Court had been critical of this same legal framework in a number of judgments, for example Karandja\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 69180/01, 7 October 2010 and the national authorities had themselves recognised that the law was in need of reform and had taken steps to amend it (see paragraph 41 above). The fact that the domestic courts on a number of occasions, even applying the more lenient national law standard as it then applied, found that the killing was unjustified made it all the more clearer that the use of force was in breach of the more rigorous requirements of Article 2.",

In the end, the investigation never answered the central question, how could Mr\u00a0Mihaylov have threatened the officer if he was not facing him at the time he was shot? It was the applicant\u2019s view that the prosecutor\u2019s office worked with the sole aim of protecting the policeman. The domestic court called this \u201ca parody of an investigation\u201d. The applicants alleged that one investigator was replaced because of bias but that the prosecutor continued to be in charge of the case even after he had explicitly stated that he would not heed the courts\u2019 instructions. Finally, it should be underlined that the investigators applied the deficient national legal standard referred to above. This automatically rendered the investigation inadequate for the purposes of Article 2.

It was also indisputable that the gun was taken out as a result of the fight between the two men but was not prepared in advance. The three security guard witnesses confirmed during their initial interrogation that after the fight and the gunshot, when Mr Mihaylov fell to the ground, a knife fell out of Chief Sergeant S\u2019s hand. This witness evidence was confirmed by the forensic evidence. In particular, the medical examination of Chief Sergeant S found that he had sustained grazes consistent with an attack by a blunt instrument.

He did not initially intend to use his gun but did so only when Mr Mihaylov forcibly resisted arrest. The police officer, who had been stabbed in the abdomen the year before, had been frightened and had felt a real and immediate danger for his life, given that Mr Mihaylov was armed with a knife and had been struggling for possession of the officer\u2019s gun. The officer\u2019s use of force was within the legal limits and was absolutely necessary within the meaning of Article\u00a02\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. In accordance with the legislation in force at the time of the events in question, the police officer was authorised to use his weapon in self-defence following an armed assault, as here (see\u00a0Article\u00a080 of the Ministry of Interior Act, set out in paragraph 41 above).",

Pursuant to the instructions issued by the Sofia Military Court in its ruling of 13 December 2004, the witnesses were interrogated again and a further complex forensic medical and ballistic expert report was commissioned. After it was concluded that the acts of the first investigator assigned to the investigation had resulted in the obstruction of the truth, he was removed from the case and mandatory written instructions were issued to a new investigator. The legal proceedings were held before an independent and impartial court and the fact that the Sofia Military Court repeatedly remitted the case for further investigation showed that the judiciary were committed to ensuring an effective investigation to establish the truth. As a result of this process, the alleged defects in the investigation were remedied and all the parties\u2019 requests were satisfied. The applicants were able to inspect and copy all documents in the case-file and to take an active part. The Government emphasised that the procedural obligation under Article 2 is one of means and not of result. The forensic examinations, having taken into account the large number of possible positions of the two men\u2019s bodies, were unable to come to any firm conclusion.

It is true that the acquittal of a police officer by a criminal court bound by the presumption of innocence does not absolve Bulgaria from its responsibility under the Convention (see Filipovi, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court does not consider that it would be appropriate in this case for it to attempt to make its own findings in respect of any substantive breach of Article 2. By all accounts, this was an unplanned and fast moving situation, with the police officer required to act in the heat of the moment (see, mutatis mutandis, Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus, 9 October 1997, \u00a7 192 , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI and Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050196/99, \u00a7\u00a0139, ECHR 2005II (extracts)).

In this instance, unfortunately there is no evidence available to the Court either to support or fully exclude the applicants\u2019 contention that Mr Mihaylov was killed through the use of force that was more than absolutely necessary. Moreover, the Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a factfinding tribunal where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. It does not therefore propose to take a stance on the findings of fact made by the national courts (ibid.).",

Bulgaria, no. 69180/01, 7 October 2010, it examined provisions identical to section 80 \u00a7 1 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997 (see paragraph 41 above), which allowed police officers to use firearms to effect an arrest, regardless of the seriousness of the offence which the person concerned was suspected of having committed or the danger which he or she represented. In each of those cases, the Court found that the legal provisions governing the use of firearms by the police in respect of individuals fleeing arrest were fundamentally insufficient to protect those concerned against unjustified and arbitrary encroachments on their right to life (see, for example, Karandja, cited above, \u00a7 59). The shooting in the present case took place against the same legislative background and this legislation was relied on consistently by the authorities throughout the proceedings.

The general principles governing the State\u2019s obligation to carry out an effective investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by, among others, agents of the State are well-settled in the Court\u2019s case-law. They have recently been set out in detail in paragraphs 298-306 of the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in Giuliani and Gaggio v.

On 27 July 2007, almost three years after Mr\u00a0Mihaylov was shot, the Sofia Military Court went so far as to describe the investigation as a \u201cparody\u201d, revealing an unwillingness to collect the relevant evidence and establish the truth (see paragraph 34 above). In its decision of 6 November 2009 the Military Court again found that the prosecutor had not ensured that all the investigatory steps ordered by the courts had been taken. The measures in question had still not been taken when the Military Court of Appeal reached its final decision (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a039 and 40 above).",

During the inspection of the scene in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the key item of physical evidence, namely the car bonnet which was dented and marked by the fatal bullet, was not preserved (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a011 above). This failure had implications for the effectiveness of the investigation since, without taking into account the bullet hole in the car, none of the forensic-ballistic reports commissioned were able to establish the position of the men at the time of the shooting (see\u00a0paragraphs\u00a026, 33 and 35 above). At no point was the surveillance camera which was pointing at the site of the killing examined, to determine whether or not useful video footage had been recorded (see paragraph 20 above). No record was preserved as to whether the folding knife found on the opposite side of the street was open or closed, and no attempt was made subsequently to determine whether this knife had belonged to Mr Mihaylov (see paragraph 14 above). The investigation failed to determine how many bullets were fired from Chief Sergeant S\u2019s gun (see paragraph 12 above). The simple procedure of returning for a daylight search of the scene was omitted, although this might have revealed further physical evidence, such as bullets or casings (see paragraph 11 above). As the Sofia Military Court found, the statements taken from the three security guard eye-witnesses and from Chief Sergeant S were formalistic and contained only vague and contradictory accounts of the sequence of events, with no real attempt to determine the truth as to what had happened (see paragraph 25 above). Finally, although Chief Sergeant S\u2019s account of his struggle with Mr\u00a0Mihaylov for possession of the knife and the gun was imprecise and the conclusions drawn by the prosecutors about the exact sequence of events were criticised by the domestic courts as unsupported by evidence, implausible and contradictory, no reconstruction of the fight and shooting was ever undertaken to establish whether his account was plausible.",

For an investigation into alleged unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events (see Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7 300). In this connection the Court notes that the official who was in charge of the investigation during the crucial initial period when the physical evidence had to be secured and the first witness statements taken, proved so unwilling to comply with the courts\u2019 directions that he was discharged, a year into the investigation (see paragraph 27 above). Towards the end of 2007 the prosecutor assigned to the case stated that he disagreed with the courts\u2019 instructions and wished to withdraw; nonetheless, he was allowed to continue working on the case (see paragraph 35 above). In its decision of 22 July 2008 the Military Court of Appeal raised serious doubts about this prosecutor\u2019s impartiality. Throughout, as noted above, the investigatory authorities failed to comply with the courts\u2019 instructions to take the measures designed to establish the circumstances. Moreover, the decrees issued by the prosecutors throughout the case strongly give the impression that the excellent service record of Chief Sergeant S was a key factor in persuading them that he could not have used excessive force (see\u00a0paragraphs 24 and 36 above).",

In particular, the investigator indicated in his report of 30 September 2004 that even if there had been no risk to Chief Sergeant S\u2019s life, he would have been authorised to use his gun to apprehend the suspect (see paragraph 21 above). Furthermore, as previously stated (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a058 above), the investigator did not fully investigate the alternative possibilities that Mr Mihaylov was killed through the use of excessive force in self-defence or as a result of intense fear on the part of the police officer, despite the fact that Chief Sergeant S stated in his witness statements that he had been very afraid, partly due to the fact that he had been stabbed on previous occasions when on duty which had left him particularly fearful of knives (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). This investigative failure left open legitimate doubts as to whether all relevant evidence was included in the file which formed the evidentiary basis of the national authorities\u2019 decisions. In addition, the Military Court of Appeal did not provide reasons in its decision to explain why at the end of the proceedings, in contrast with the earlier decisions of seven other courts and in the absence of any new evidence, it agreed with the views of the prosecution authorities in this regard. Finally, the investigation did not address the question, raised by Chief Sergeant S\u2019s testimony, whether his understandable fear of attack by knife following the earlier assaults on him had had any bearing on his conduct or left him unsuited for active duty and whether any steps had been taken to assess this before he was again sent out on patrol. This left it unclear whether Chief Sergeant S\u2019s own account of the incident and his state of mind at the time qualified his acts as self-defence, excessive use of force in self-defence or use of force due to fear, each of which carries different consequences under domestic law.",

Accordingly, the costs incurred in the course of those proceedings are in principle recoverable under Article 41. With regard to the hourly rate claimed, the Court notes that it is settled caselaw that when considering a claim for just satisfaction it is not bound by domestic scales or standards (see Dimitrov\u00a0and Others, cited above, \u00a7 190) and it does not find the rate claimed to be excessive when compared to claims in recent similar Bulgarian cases. However, it does find that the number of hours claimed for is excessive.
