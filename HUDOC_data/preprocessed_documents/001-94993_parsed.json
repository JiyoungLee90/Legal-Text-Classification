It was clear from the case file examined by the Supreme Court of Justice that the applicant company had become the owner of a part of the building which was disputed in the proceedings initiated by M. against I. and the Department. The court was obliged to involve the applicant company in the proceedings, given the clear consequences for its property right over the building. Moreover, the Supreme Court of Justice failed to deal with the contracts concluded by I. in respect of the building, contrary to its own jurisprudence in cases of annulment of the original title, as exemplified by the annulment of the privatisation and subsequent sale of the Soroca limestone mine (see paragraph 21 above).",

Accordingly, the applicant company had no right to intervene in the proceedings initiated by M. against I. and the Department and its participation was not necessary for the courts to be able to fully examine the case. The fact that the contract between I. and the applicant company was not registered with the relevant real estate authorities only confirmed the unlawfulness of the entire deal.

It considers that it is not necessary to determine this point, in light of the following. At the moment when the Supreme Court of Justice examined the case on 8 July 2004, two companies claimed to have a property right in respect of a part of the same building. One of them was M., the plaintiff, which had been found by the first-instance court not to have any valid claims to the building. The other was the applicant company, which obtained its right over a part of the building from I., the company which had won at first instance. The contract between I. and the applicant company was valid at the relevant time. It follows that the applicant company's claim, which had been based on the contract with I., was not prima facie devoid of a factual or legal basis. The domestic courts did not mention any other circumstance preventing them from examining the applicant company's claim. In such circumstances, the applicant company's claim could not be left unexamined or otherwise disregarded without a formal examination.",

The applicant company's initial claim was to obtain from I. damages for the delay in honouring its obligations under the contract, followed by an additional request to transfer into its property the relevant office space (see paragraph 11 above). By contrast, the second action was aimed at the recognition of the applicant company's property right over the office space already transferred to it by I.
