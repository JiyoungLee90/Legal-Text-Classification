The domestic courts at all instances accepted that the assets had indeed been transferred from the company\u2019s economic control to the district treasury. However, they found no evidence that the insolvency had been caused by the owner\u2019s actions. In particular, after the withdrawal of assets the company still had been able to meet the creditors\u2019 claims. The housing and objects of the engineering infrastructure on 30\u00a0January 2006 had been withdrawn \u201cin order to apply the housing policy\u201d and to \u201creduce the company\u2019s expenses for the maintenance of the infrastructure objects\u201d.

In order to determine the issue of State responsibility for the debts of unitary enterprises, the Court must examine whether and how the extensive powers of control provided for in the domestic law were actually exercised by the authorities in a given case (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0204-06).",

First, the company provided services of vital importance to the district population, such as heating and water supply, as well as maintenance of the municipal housing stock (see paragraph\u00a06 above). The property allocated for those purposes enjoyed special treatment under the domestic law, constituting \u201csocially important assets\u201d; the tariffs of the housing and communal services, as well as the heating and water supply services, were set by the district administration. The company\u2019s core activities constituted \u201cpublic duties performed under the control of the authorities\u201d (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0208-10; Lyatskaya v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0 33548/04, \u00a7\u00a014, 18\u00a0September 2008; and Yershova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a01387/04, \u00a7\u00a058, 8\u00a0April 2010). Second, the Court observes that the administration disposed of the debtor\u2019s assets as it saw fit, having withdrawn, in 2004-2006, the company\u2019s several assets, including various items of \u201chousing and engineering infrastructure\u201d, for further transfer to the municipal district treasury (see paragraphs\u00a07, 12-14 above). In the Court\u2019s view, these facts demonstrate that a strong degree of State control was actually exercised by the municipal authority over the company.",
