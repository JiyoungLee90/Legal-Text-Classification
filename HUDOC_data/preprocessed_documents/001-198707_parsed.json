A finding that a candidate has engaged in unfair or illegal campaigning could entail serious consequences for the candidate concerned, in that he or she could be disqualified from running for the election. As the Convention guarantees the effective exercise of individual electoral rights, the Court considers that, in order to prevent arbitrary disqualification of candidates, the relevant domestic procedures should contain sufficient safeguards protecting the candidates from abusive and unsubstantiated allegations of electoral misconduct, and that decisions on disqualification should be based on sound, relevant and sufficient proof of such misconduct (see Orujov, cited above, \u00a7 46).",

Subsequently, according to the ConEC, on 10 October 2010 it received complaints from Alat residents of alleged illegal campaigning by the applicant. The ConEC reacted to those complaints on the same day by questioning those individuals and various PEC chairmen. The ConEC\u2019s decision of 12 October 2010 to seek a court order in respect of an administrative offence was taken in the applicant\u2019s absence and without his knowledge, because he was only informed about it belatedly (see paragraph 31 above).

In view of the requirement that decisions on disqualification from election should be based on sound, relevant and sufficient proof of misconduct (see paragraph 70 above), the Court considers that J.A.\u2019s statement, in and of itself but especially when coupled with the unexamined dubious content of the posters in question and the applicant\u2019s repeated protests as to his association with J.A., was insufficient to establish the applicant\u2019s responsibility for the misconduct attributed to him.
