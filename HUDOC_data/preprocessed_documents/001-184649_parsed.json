Even considering the serious deficiencies identified by the experts in respect of the hospital (see paragraph 28 above), the Court notes that it has not been established, in accordance with the first criterion, that the actions of the health-care providers went beyond a mere error or medical negligence in that they, in breach of their professional obligations, denied the patient emergency medical treatment despite being fully aware that the person\u2019s life was at risk if that treatment was not given. In particular, the expert opinions as well as the court findings on the matter speak of medical negligence and errors (see paragraphs 28, 29, and 32 above) rather than the deprivation of emergency care as such. While some of the 29 doctors participating in G.B.\u2019s treatment lacked adequate qualifications, the case files demonstrate that the emergency surgery was performed by a surgeon whose qualifications were never questioned. As to the question of whether the surgery itself was timely, the opinion of the majority of experts supports a conclusion that the possible delay was a result of a mere medical error, while one of the experts even warned against making a categorical suggestion that the emergency surgery was belated (see paragraph\u00a028 above). Therefore the present situation is different from cases where patients were deprived of emergency medical treatment (contrast, Asiye Gen\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 24109/07, \u00a7 82, 27 January 2015).",
