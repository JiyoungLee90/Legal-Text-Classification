Concerning the question of where he should be placed, the authorities essentially stated that the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather had previously been approved as foster parents for the applicant\u2019s older son (see paragraph 5 above). However, the ability to cooperate was necessary for those wanting to be foster parents and there had been some conflict between the applicant\u2019s mother and the authorities. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather were considered to be relatively old (having been born in 1962 and 1955, respectively) to serve as foster parents to a small child, and the applicant\u2019s mother had recently been ill. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s mother had not made visiting the applicant\u2019s younger son her priority.

The City Court shared the expert\u2019s concerns. Moreover, it pointed out that the two children had different needs and challenges. Although the older brother, according to the information received, was happy in his foster home with the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather, X, despite his young age, had experienced two broken relationships \u2013 firstly with his biological mother and then with his emergency foster mother. He had now formed an attachment with his new foster mother after he had moved into his latest foster home in January 2013. There would be a risk of \u201ccontact injury\u201d (kontaktskade) \u2013 that is to say a serious impairment to his ability to form attachments \u2013 if he were to experience another broken relationship. From the foster mother\u2019s testimony it was clear that he was developing well in the foster home and that he was happy and thriving. The City Court moreover emphasised the challenges associated with having two small boys of pre-school age living with people of the age of the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather. In addition, there was the issue of the applicant\u2019s very different respective emotional relationships with the two boys, which also entailed special challenges, particularly if X were to be placed in foster care in the same home as that of his older brother. Overall, the City Court agreed with the County Social Welfare Board and the court-appointed expert that the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather should not be the foster parents of the applicant\u2019s younger son.",

It follows from these considerations that the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities for the regulation of the public care of children and the rights of parents whose children have been taken into care, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see, for example, Hokkanen v.

She had submitted that the main argument in favour of approving the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather as foster parents of X was the fact that the two sons would then grow up together (see paragraph 17 above). However, she had also found that this was outweighed by other concerns. The respective age of the applicant\u2019s mother and the stepfather was not a decisive factor, although the stepfather himself had stated that he was getting older, which could be seen as an expression of some doubt on his behalf. Nor had the issues regarding cooperation between the grandmother and the child welfare authorities that had been mentioned been of any importance (see paragraph 17 above).",

This would necessarily be a problem for both boys if they were to live in the same foster home. Furthermore, there were good reasons to believe that if X was placed with the applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather, that situation would typically represent an opportunity for contact between mother and child to constantly increase in scope, and thus be a disturbing factor for X in his development of a good attachment to his foster home. For the psychologist, this concern had been based not least on the fact that the applicant\u2019s mother had clearly expressed that she primarily wanted to be a mother to the applicant (see paragraph 17 above).",

The City Court agreed with the court-appointed psychologist concerns with respect to this option. In this context it pointed out, thirdly, that the two sons had different needs and challenges. X had experienced two broken relationships \u2013 first that with the applicant and then the one with the emergency foster home (see paragraphs 6 and 11 above). He had subsequently become attached to the current foster mother. There were risks involved in exposing him to yet another change of carer, while it had emerged from the foster mother\u2019s testimony that he was currently developing well in the foster home and that he was happy and thriving there (see paragraph 18 above).",

Given the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the domestic authorities, when finding that placement in an external foster home was in the best interests of the child, did not exceed the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent State, and that the reasons for that decision were relevant and sufficient (see paragraphs 47-57 above).",
