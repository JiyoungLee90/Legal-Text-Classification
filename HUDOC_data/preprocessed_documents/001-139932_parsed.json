Given the clinical development and progress of the illness, the applicant requires regular medical supervision, in particular by a neurologist, and complex treatment, comprising specific diagnostic procedures and medication.

The inadequacy of the response to the applicant\u2019s health-related complaints is demonstrated by the fact that for almost two years after his arrest his drug regimen was amended a great many times, with anticonvulsants or tranquillisers replacing one another, with no comprehensive examination of the applicant\u2019s current condition and without the use of modern diagnostic techniques to assess his health problems.",

A visit to a neurosurgeon was even more exceptional, given that the penal institutions in the Tambov Region did not employ such a specialist (see paragraph 12 above). It appears from the Government\u2019s submissions that the sole occasion when such a consultation took place was in 2011, when the Burdenko Institute was asked to study the applicant\u2019s medical record (see paragraph 50 above).",

Furthermore, it took the Russian authorities four years to subject him to the most essential test, an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is an important part of the diagnostic process for cases such as the applicant\u2019s and which should have guided his treatment through all those years (see paragraph 33 above). Without resorting to those diagnostic procedures and performing a thorough evaluation, the prison medical specialists juggled the applicant\u2019s medication in an attempt to respond to his increasing health-related complaints, with no clear understanding of whether a drug was effective and whether it should be discontinued or replaced. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s negative response to several trials of medication for a number of years called for a necessity to consider other means of treatment, including surgery. The Court also bears in mind that while in detention the applicant developed dependency on psychotropic drugs, which required treatment by a drug addiction specialist (see paragraphs 13, 14, 18 and 21-23 above). The Court is not competent to decide whether the frequent decisions to change the applicant\u2019s medication without gradual weaning off one drug and by increasing the dose of another drug could have triggered the addiction. It is not, however, prepared disregard this side effect of the applicant\u2019s treatment.",

The applicant\u2019s medical file showed that he had been admitted to the hospital on at least ten occasions. However, with the exception of a very few stays when the applicant was seen by a neurologist and was subjected to a specific diagnostic procedure, the treatment he received in the hospital did not differ significantly from the medical services he was afforded in the colony. The short-term admissions to the prison hospitals appear to demonstrate attempts by the prison authorities to at least temporarily prevent the applicant\u2019s health from deteriorating further. At the same time, they reveal the absence of a medical plan to manage the applicant\u2019s illness. The hospital treatment procedures remained focused on symptoms only, attempting merely to relieve the applicant of certain side effects of his condition without looking into the possibility of, at least, substantially improving his health.",

He considered it necessary to explore the possibility of surgical treatment (see paragraph 31 above). However, it was not until June 2010, following the applicant\u2019s letter to the Tambov Regional Health Department, that the option of surgery was discussed for the second time, with the authorities acknowledging that an operation was necessary but that it was not available in the penal institutions of the Tambov Region (see paragraph 41 above). At the same time, it appears that the high-tech surgery which had been discussed was unavailable not only in the Tambov Region, but also in the Gaaza hospital; these were the major prison medical facilities in the Russian Federation (see paragraph 43 above). Another attempt to provide the applicant with surgical treatment was made almost a year later, when the Tambov Regional Health Department sent his medical record to the Burdenko Institute (see paragraph 50 above). The Court does acknowledge the Government\u2019s argument that after studying that record a doctor from the Institute concluded that surgery was not needed. It finds it striking that the decision whether surgery, an essential medical procedure, was an option was only taken on the basis of the medical file, and in particular with regard to the outdated results of the diagnostic procedures, a year-old MRI scan (see paragraph 39 above) or a six-month-old EEG record (see paragraph 44 above), even though the progress of the applicant\u2019s illness was undeniable. The Court observes that while considering the option of surgery the doctor did not perform a comprehensive pre-surgical examination of the applicant, including a physical and neurological assessment, extended EEG-video monitoring, or other tests. There is no evidence that the decision to refuse permission for surgery was taken following a multidisciplinary assessment with the involvement of several medical specialists, such as an epileptologist, a neurosurgeon, a neuroradiologist or a neuropsychologist. In any case, without disregarding the opinion given by the Burdenko Institute doctor on the surgery option, the Court notes that that opinion remained the only serious attempt by the Russian authorities to understand the etiology and nature of the applicant\u2019s brain malfunction and to explore various options for treatment to control or even to improve his condition.",

In particular, the Court notes that neither of the recommendations made by the neurologist in March 2012 was fully complied with by the prison authorities. The applicant remains under the monitoring of prison paramedics in the correctional colony, he does not receive the full drug regimen prescribed by the neurologist, he has not had the diagnostic procedures recommended by that specialist, and he has not been seen by doctors, in particular a neurosurgeon or an angiosurgeon, whose opinions were considered essential to an assessment of the need for surgery (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above).",
