This is a cause of concern, especially since the applicants complained of particularly serious violations, including a denial of access to the Court of Cassation, the unlawfulness of that court\u2019s composition and, lastly, a breach of the principle of equality of arms (see paragraph 55 of the judgment). The fact of ignoring these grievances seems particularly problematic in that the Court itself had communicated no fewer than four questions on these specific points to the parties in 2009. A decade later, the majority finds these same issues to be secondary and no longer deserving of any examination. In my humble opinion, the Convention does not allow for a subjective sifting of the rights and freedoms recognised therein. The parties to the dispute deserve an objective examination (admittedly, more or less in-depth) of all the complaints raised by them. The legitimacy of a court lies essentially in the confidence that it inspires in the public. To sum up, I consider that the time has come for the Grand Chamber to take a decisive stand on this restrictive approach.",
