This right includes the right to compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and the restoration of labour, pension, housing and other rights. The damage must be compensated for in full, irrespective of the fault of the investigator, prosecutor or court (paragraph\u00a01). Paragraph 2 confers the \u201cright to rehabilitation\u201d on defendants who have been acquitted, against whom charges have been dropped, in respect of whom proceedings have been discontinued or whose convictions have been quashed in their entirety or in part. However, no right to compensation arises where the prosecution is terminated on \u201cnon-rehabilitative\u201d grounds, such as in the case of an amnesty or where the prosecution has become time-barred (Article 133 paragraph 4). Paragraph\u00a03 provides that \u201cany individual who has been unlawfully subjected to preventive measures in criminal proceedings shall have the right to rehabilitation\u201d. In a judgment acquitting an individual a court has to mention explicitly that he has the right to \u201crehabilitation\u201d (Article\u00a0134). A claim for compensation of pecuniary damage is to be lodged with the same authority which issued the decision to acquit or the decision to terminate the criminal prosecution (Article 135 \u00a7 2), whereas any claims for monetary compensation of non-pecuniary damage are to be lodged with civil courts and examined under the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Article\u00a0136 \u00a7 2).",

It has difficulty accepting as effective the remedy whose availability depends on the establishment of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The mere fact that a domestic court recognises, according to national law, the right of an individual to receive compensation after an acquittal or discontinuation of the proceedings is not tantamount to acknowledging that the pre-trial detention was effected in breach of the Convention. In the \u201crehabilitation\u201d proceedings, the Russian authorities need not examine, and still less acknowledge, at least in substance, that the applicant\u2019s detention was formally defective or that it was based on insufficient reasons or exceeded a reasonable time (see Sherstobitov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 16266/03, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101, 10 June 2010, and Trepashkin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 36898/03, \u00a7 69, 19\u00a0July 2007). The award of compensation is subject to fulfilment of specific conditions not required under Article 5 \u00a7 3, namely the applicant\u2019s acquittal or discontinuation of the proceedings (see Tomasi v. France, 27\u00a0August 1992, \u00a7 79, Series A no.\u00a0241A). The only ground for awarding the applicant compensation is the termination of the criminal proceedings against him rather than any alleged procedural irregularity in the pre-trial detention. This ground for compensation does not correspond to the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 and the alleged violation cannot therefore be redressed in these proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Ha\u0111i v.\u00a0Croatia, no. 42998/08, \u00a7 20, 1\u00a0July 2010).",

Any eventual award that can be made in the \u201crehabilitation\u201d proceedings does not amount to a finding that the detention did not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 of the Convention.

As the Court has found above, the \u201crehabilitation\u201d proceedings under the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure are not concerned with the allegedly excessive nature of the pre-trial detention and cannot lead to the acknowledgement of the alleged violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. It would therefore be unreasonable to require the applicant to institute such proceedings which are not capable of bringing about an acknowledgement of the breach of the Convention and are thus unable to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged violation.",
