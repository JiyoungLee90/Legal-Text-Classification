Belgium judgment of 23 November 1983, Series A no. 70, p. 15, para. 29 in fine, and the H. v.

For the former, advertising was the only possible means of reaching potential clients, whereas the positions held by the latter afforded them greater scope for making themselves known. Furthermore, the ban did not apply to the big legal consulting firms active on an international scale or to insurance companies which also offered legal assistance.

The Court does not have any reason to doubt that the Bar rules complained of were designed to protect the interests of the public while ensuring respect for members of the Bar. In this connection, the special nature of the profession practised by members of the Bar must be considered; in their capacity as officers of the court they benefit from an exclusive right of audience and immunity from legal process in respect of their oral presentation of cases in court, but their conduct must be discreet, honest and dignified. The restrictions on advertising were traditionally justified by reference to these special features. In the case of the decision in issue, there is nothing to show that the Bar Council\u2019s intention at the time did not correspond to the acknowledged aim of the legislation. Furthermore, the factors alluded to by Mr Casado Coca relate primarily to the way in which the legislation in question was applied and are therefore relevant to assessing the need for the disciplinary measure.",

Such a margin of appreciation is particularly essential in the complex and fluctuating area of unfair competition (ibid.). The same applies to advertising. In the instant case, the Court\u2019s task is therefore confined to ascertaining whether the measures taken at national level are justifiable in principle and proportionate (see, inter alia, ibid. and the Barthold judgment previously cited, Series A no. 90, p. 25, para. 55).",

Any such restrictions must, however, be closely scrutinised by the Court, which must weigh the requirements of those particular features against the advertising in question; to this end, the Court must look at the impugned penalty in the light of the case as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, the markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann judgment previously cited, Series A no. 165, p. 20, para. 34).",

The Court notes that those rules allowed advertising in certain cases - namely when a practice was being set up or when there was a change in its membership, address or telephone number - and under certain conditions (see paragraph 25 above).

Moreover, in most of the States parties to the Convention, including Spain, there has for some time been a tendency to relax the rules as a result of the changes in their respective societies and in particular the growing role of the media in them. The Government cited the examples of the Code of Conduct for Lawyers in the European Community (Strasbourg, 28 October 1988) and the conclusions of the Conference of the European Bars (Cracow, 24 May 1991); while upholding the principle of banning advertising, these documents authorise members of the Bar to express their views to the media, to make themselves known and to take part in public debate. In accordance with these guidelines, the new rules on advertising issued by the Council of the Catalonia Bars (4 July 1991) allow the publication of circulars or articles, including in the press (see paragraph 28 above). More recently, the Government have begun to study the draft of the new Statute of the Spanish Bar (see paragraph 23 above), which permits somewhat greater freedom in this sphere.",
