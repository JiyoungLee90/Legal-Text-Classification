It consists in detaining the recalcitrant debtor in a short-stay prison, where he is not obliged to work. It is not an alternative to payment, as the person against whom the order is made remains liable to pay the sum due (Article 762 CCP \u2013 see paragraph 20 below), but it may not be imposed a second time for the same debt. Its scope has gradually been whittled away since the nineteenth century, when it was seen as a real means of punishment available to creditors, who could apply to have insolvent civil debtors committed to prison. It was permanently abolished in civil and commercial proceedings by the Law of 22 July 1867, surviving in respect of debts to the Treasury only (Article 749 CCP \u2013 see paragraph 20 below), and the rules governing its enforcement have become more lenient (exempting insolvent individuals from imprisonment in default was the most important feature of a reform introduced on 30 December 1985 by Law no.\u00a085-1407, Article 752 CCP \u2013 see paragraph 20 below).",

It is a means of enforcement automatically attached to any pecuniary order made by a criminal court and satisfies the requirements of both Article 5 [\u00a7 1] (b) of the Convention ... and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4.\u201d After the judgment in the case of Jamil v.
