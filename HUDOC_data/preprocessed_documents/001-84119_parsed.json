In determining whether an offence qualifies as \u201ccriminal\u201d, three criteria are to be applied: the legal classification of the offence in domestic law, the nature of the offence and the degree of severity of the possible penalty (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 34-35, \u00a7 82; O\u0308ztu\u0308rk v.Germany, judgment of 21\u00a0February 1984, Series A no. 73, p. 18, \u00a7 50; and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7 82, ECHR 2003X). The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative: for Article 6 to apply by virtue of the words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, it suffices that the offence in question should by its nature be \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or should have made the person concerned liable to a sanction which, by its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere (see Janosevic, cited above, \u00a7 67). The minor degree of the penalty, in taxation proceedings or otherwise, is not decisive in removing an offence, otherwise criminal by nature, from the scope of Article 6 (see Jussila, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035, where the Court found Article 6 to be applicable even when the surcharge imposed amounted to only 10 per cent of the tax due).",

According to the Court's case-law, the right of access to court was not absolute and could be subject to limitations. Referring to the case of Kreuz\u00a0v. Poland (no.\u00a028249/95, \u00a7\u00a060, ECHR 2001VI), they further claimed that the requirement to pay fees to civil courts in connection with claims they are asked to determine could not be regarded as a restriction on the right of access to a court that was incompatible per se with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, unless this requirement impaired the very essence of this right. This, however, was not so in the applicant company's case, since the law provided for other concessions related to payment of court fees \u2013 as opposed to full exemption prohibited under the above Article 70 \u00a7 3 \u2013 which ensured the effective implementation of the right of access to court of commercial entities. In particular, under Article 21 of the Law on State Fees, commercial entities could apply for and benefit from, inter alia, a reduction of the State fee, a reduction of the rate of the State fee, and a deferral of payment of the State fee. In the applicant company's case, the latter possibility proved to be effective in ensuring the applicant company's access to court, which is demonstrated by the decisions of the Commercial Court of Appeal of 31\u00a0August 2001 and the Commercial Court of 18 January 2002 granting the applicant company's reasoned requests for deferral. On 3 February 2003 the applicant company submitted a request for deferral, together with a cassation appeal, which was similarly granted by the Court of Cassation, notably by the latter's decision of 14 February 2003 fixing the date of the hearing. In sum, the limitation contained in Article 70 \u00a7 3 of the CCP did not impair the very essence of the right of access to court, taking into account the existence of other concessions connected with the payment of court fees.",

The applicant company, however, failed to submit any request to the Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation nevertheless granted the applicant company's request of 3 February 2003 to adjourn the case, allowing the applicant company to pay the court fee by 24\u00a0February 2003 and warning it that, if it failed to do so, the cassation appeal would be returned. The applicant company, however, failed to respond to this warning in any way and did not pay the deferred court fee. Therefore, the decision of the Court of Cassation to return the applicant company's cassation appeal was not arbitrary. Moreover, the applicant company failed to submit any evidence either to the Court of Cassation or to the  substantiating its insufficient financial means. The requirement to submit such evidence is a legitimate and reasonable condition for anybody who wants to benefit from concessions related to payment of court fees. Similarly, the prohibition contained in the above Article 70 \u00a7 3 was based on the logic that a commercial entity, which is a legal person created for the purpose of making profit, should, unless it had been declared insolvent, have sufficient means to pay a court fee, which in the present case amounted only to AMD 10,000 (approx. EUR 18.7 at the material time). Thus, taking into account that the applicant company had failed to substantiate its insufficient financial means, the amount of court fee was not unreasonable and did not make it impossible for the applicant company to pay it.",

Firstly, the Court of Cassation had never granted its request for deferral of payment of the court fee of 3 February 2003, failing to take any decision whatsoever on this request. Secondly, the Government had made contradictory submissions, on the one hand claiming that the applicant company had not submitted any request for deferral of payment of the court fee, while on the other hand claiming that the applicant company's request for deferral of 3 February 2003 had been granted by the Court of Cassation. Furthermore, the Government's claim that the applicant company, in its request for deferral of 3 February 2003, did not substantiate its financial situation in any way, was also untrue. This request clearly stated that the company's assets had been frozen by the decision of the Commercial Court of 24 December 2001. Thus, on the one hand the courts had imposed an injunction on the use of the company's assets, making it impossible to pay the court fee, while on the other hand they had required the company to pay this court fee. Thirdly, the letter of the Court of Cassation of 14 February 2003 could not be regarded as a legal document. Nor was the applicant company required to respond to the warning contained in that letter, because there was no such procedure prescribed by the CCP whereby the Court of Cassation was authorised to make warnings in letters. Finally, the applicant claimed that it was not true that the amount of the court fee due was only AMD 10,000. According to Article 9 \u00a7 9 of the Law on State Fees, the court fee for cassation appeals amounted to three per cent of the claim value, which in the applicant company's case made AMD 113,918 (approx. EUR 180 at the material time). In support of this argument, the applicant company relied on the decision of the Commercial Court of 5 November 2001, in which the amount of the court fee was calculated at AMD 189,864.05.",

Even if a legal person which was experiencing financial difficulties was granted a deferral of payment of the court fee, it would still find itself in a difficult financial situation in the future. In sum, the applicant company claimed that the non-examination of its cassation appeal violated its right of access to court guaranteed by Article\u00a06.",

By saying \u201cthe applicant company failed to submit any request to the Court of Cassation\u201d they meant that the applicant company had not made any other such requests following the one of 3 February 2003. Thirdly, as regards the injunction placed on the applicant company's assets, the assets in question had been frozen only in the amount corresponding to the applicant company's tax obligations. Fourthly, as regards the amount of the court fee, the applicant company's assertion that it amounted to AMD 189,864.05 was ill-founded. The claims brought by the applicant company before the Court of Cassation were of a non-pecuniary nature and the court fee, in accordance with Article 9 \u00a7 9 of the Law on State Fees, amounted only to AMD 20,000 (approx. EUR 31). Thus, the applicant company's claim that even the deferral of payment of a court fee could put it into a difficult financial situation was unreasonable. The Government added that their initial submission that the court fee amounted to AMD 10,000 was a misprint. Finally, it was not clear how the applicant company, which was allegedly in a difficult financial situation, was able to pay more than AMD\u00a01,000,000 for legal and other services.",
