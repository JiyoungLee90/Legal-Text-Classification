The court invited the applicant to pay the GEL 5,000 fee within fourteen days. When it failed to do so, the Supreme Court, in a final decision of 15\u00a0March 2004, declared the cassation claim inadmissible.

The auditor's report of 15 March 2005 confirmed the applicant's insolvency and the resulting cessation of its activities in the sphere of football. The report stated that, due to the inability to pay the participation fee, the applicant had been excluded from the national football championship since 2002. Among other outstanding debts, the report noted arrears of interest on a loan which the applicant had obtained in order to pay the court fee of GEL 5,000 for the proceedings before the Regional Court (paragraph\u00a024 above).",

This could anyway have easily been deduced from the documents concerning its dispute with Dinamo FC, which materials were in the case file. The arrears received from Dinamo FC had been spent on settling an insignificant part of its debts and could not be taken as an indication of its financial capacity. If the Supreme Court had been dissatisfied with the evidence of the applicant's insolvency, it should have noted so in its warning decision of 30 January 2004, and invited the applicant to submit the missing documents.

Having regard to the material in its possession, the Court notes that the fees imposed in the present case could not be said to have served either to protect the legitimate interests of the other party against irrecoverable legal costs or to protect the legal system against an unmeritorious appeal, considerations which might, according to its case-law, justify restrictions on the right of access to a court (cf.\u00a0Tolstoy Miloslavsky v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 13\u00a0July 1995, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0316-B, pp.\u00a080-81, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061 et seq.).
