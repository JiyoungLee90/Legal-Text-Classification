According to Mr\u00a0Harakchiev, the cell was quite small, especially bearing in mind that the furniture alone occupied 4.50 square metres, and was lit at night by a 60watt incandescent light bulb that was constantly on. According to the Government, the cell was not undersized. It measured\u00a04.30 by 1.81 metres and was 3.95 metres high, with a total floor space of 7.78 square metres. It was furnished with a metal locker, a double metal bunk bed, two stools and a small table, all of which were attached to the floor for security reasons. It had a window, facing south, that measured\u00a01.76 by 1.25 metres. Artificial lighting in the cell consisted of two 36-watt luminescent light bulbs.

The boilers were fired for nine hours a day, but the water that they heated circulated in the heating installation permanently. According to Mr Harakchiev, the radiator in his cell was hot for only thirty minutes each day and the poor state of repair of the cell window and the metal door were factors contributing to the low temperature in the cell in winter.

According to the Government, the common areas of the prison were not merely cleaned with bleach. They were cleaned daily with detergents, and at least twice a year subjected to pest and rat control, as evident from fourteen invoices for such services carried out during the last four years. Mr Harakchiev replied that those invoices did not prove that the detergents had indeed been used as alleged by the Government. He also submitted that his cell was constantly infested with cockroaches and mice, and that all his complaints to the prison administration in that respect had gone unheeded. He submitted further that, since the window of his cell was not covered with a net, insects came into the cell all the time, drawn by the smell of excrement and the constant lighting at night, and bit him.",

The lack of running water prevented him from washing his hands or the bucket after relieving himself. The Government pointed out that the toilet and bathroom in the high-security unit were accessible to inmates three times a day, and also whenever they asked the guards. It could not therefore be said that Mr Harakchiev was forced to use the bucket to relieve himself; that was his own choice. In fact he had more than ten buckets in his cell, in which he stored clothes, laundry and other items. Mr\u00a0Harakchiev replied that, apart from the three daily visits to the toilet, between 5.30 a.m. and 8 p.m. the guards never opened his cell to let him visit the toilet.

In that context, the Government drew attention to the fact that as a result of the many claims that he had brought against the prison authorities, until mid2009 Mr Harakchiev had spent 97 days outside Stara Zagora Prison, and between 1 January 2010 and 18 May 2012 had spent 255 days, or 54% of the time, outside the prison.",

Medicines were normally provided by the prison medical centre, or could be obtained from outside the prison. The only medicine that Mr Harakchiev had had to obtain himself, because the centre had not had any in stock, had been Rivotril (clonazepam), at a unit cost of 7.31 Bulgarian levs (BGN). Mr Harakchiev replied, without giving further details, that he routinely had to purchase medicines himself. He also submitted that his dental care had consisted merely in extracting teeth; in spite of the obvious need to provide him with dental prostheses, the prison authorities had failed to take any action in that respect. The Government replied that dental prostheses did not form part of the standard medical cover for any health-insured person in Bulgaria, and could not be obtained free of charge.",

He was not allowed to go to the prison canteen or library. His cell was adequate in size for one prisoner, but too small for two, and did not have a toilet or running water. As result, outside toilet times, Mr Harakchiev had to use a bucket. In winter the cell was too cold owing to inadequate heating, and in summer full of insects as a result of the lack of a window net. The cell was infested with cockroaches, moles and even rats, and there was no indication that the prison administration had disinfested it regularly. When the cell was locked, the only way to call the guards was to bang continuously on the metal door; the guards did not always respond, especially at night. Mr Harakchiev did not have adequate materials with which to clean his cell, and evidence of the provision of cleaning products was inconclusive. It was undisputed that the prison administration had not provided him with work; that had indeed been very difficult in view of the limitations imposed by his prison regime. Social work with all life prisoners had been very restricted, consisting essentially of meetings whenever a problem occurred. Relations between Mr\u00a0Harakchiev and the prison social worker assigned to deal with him were difficult, and their meetings rare.

It awarded Mr Harakchiev BGN 400 (EUR\u00a0204.52). The court found that Mr Harakchiev\u2019s cell did not have ventilation and was damp, and that the cell window was not equipped with an insectproof net. In winter the cell was cold owing to the lack of adequate heating, and in summer too hot. The court went on to note that the cell did not have a toilet or running water, and that access to the communal toilets was very restrictive, with no real possibility to use them outside the three brief daily visits. It also observed that, in spite of the efforts of the prison authorities, the prison was infested with cockroaches and rats; that the authorities were not providing Mr Harakchiev with adequate cleaning products; and that the furniture in the cell was old and worn. It was true that work had been carried out in the cell in 2001 and then in 2005-06, but that had only consisted in repainting it.",

The court explained that the presidential power of clemency under that provision was the modern-day equivalent of the royal prerogative of mercy, and was based on the principle of humanity. For that reason, it could not be tied to specific grounds, but was to be exercised by the President \u2013 or, by delegation, by the Vice-President \u2013 on the basis of the specific circumstances of each case. It could be exercised from the time when the sentence became final, and could consist in full or partial commutation of the sentence or its replacement with a less severe one. It did not impinge on the independence of the judiciary because it did not relieve a person of criminal liability but merely exempted that person from serving the sentence imposed by the criminal courts. It was permissible to lay down the manner of exercise of that power in a statute, but it was not permissible for Parliament to define or circumscribe the grounds on which it could be exercised or seek to influence the reasons for its exercise. Nor was it permissible to limit the types of penalties in respect of which the power could be exercised, or to exclude a given class of convicted offender from its scope.",

It followed that the Constitution required that in the exercise of that power the President had to take into account equity, humanity, compassion, mercy, and the health and family situation of the convicted offender. In cases where exercise of the power of clemency concerned not the entire sentence but only part of it, it was very important to take account of any positive changes in the convicted offender\u2019s personality. The President was not under a duty to give reasons: in as much as it was impermissible for the legislature to circumscribe his or her power of clemency in any way, it was equally impermissible to require him or her to give reasons. Indeed, if reasons were given for clemency decrees they could bind the President or the Vice-President to grant future clemency requests if they concerned identical circumstances, and lead convicted offenders to believe that they were entitled to clemency because they satisfied the conditions set out in previous clemency decrees.",

However, the President was in a position to set out the manner in which he or she would exercise the power of clemency and the general criteria that would guide him or her in that respect.

Shortly after that, on 11 April 2012, the Constitutional Court declared that decision unconstitutional as ultra vires and in breach of the principle of the separation of powers (see paragraph\u00a076 above). In response, on 16 May 2012, Parliament decided to set up an ad hoc committee mandated to conduct an inquiry into, inter alia, how officials from various executive departments had carried out their duties in connection with that matter. In its report, published on 1\u00a0November 2012, the committee observed, inter alia, that the former VicePresident, to whom the President had delegated the power of clemency, had been advised by a special commission. The practice of that commission had been to obtain from the respective prison governor, medical doctor and psychologist information, including psychological assessments, about the prisoners who had applied for clemency (see also paragraphs 85-88 above). However, it was impossible to say whether all the information in the prisoners\u2019 personal files had been fully reflected in the data provided to that commission. It was also important to note that the presidential administration which had taken over in January 2012 had vastly increased the level of transparency of the clemency system (see also paragraphs 90-107 below). The committee went on to note that there were no statutory criteria governing the assessment of the conduct or the psychological profile of a convicted offender who applied for presidential clemency. As a result, the provision of information on those points was entirely within the discretion of the competent officials. It was therefore necessary to legislate on that point, and to introduce a statutory requirement for the publication of presidential clemency decrees. The practice of the incumbent presidential administration of publishing reports was entirely appropriate, but could not bind future presidential administrations.",

In 2012 he had requested that his sentence be commuted to life imprisonment, citing his repentance and good behaviour and the inhumanity of his sentence. The Commission had noted that he had already spent twentytwo years in prison, eighteen of which had been in solitary confinement, under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d applicable to life prisoners (see paragraphs 115-16, 118 and 121 below). The Commission had researched his case for six months and had found a special circumstance \u2013 sustainable positive changes in his personality \u2013 which made it intolerable for him to continue to serve a sentence of whole life imprisonment. That development had been unequivocally established on the basis of the available documents, the reports of the experts who had worked with the prisoner throughout his incarceration, a special expert psychologist\u2019s report obtained by the Commission, and an assessment, based on a variety of methods, of the risk of his reoffending. All of those showed that the prisoner was very different from other life prisoners and prisoners serving long terms of imprisonment. He had renounced his criminal way of life and instead spent his time behaving compassionately towards other prisoners and reflecting on his crimes. The prisoner\u2019s profile showed that the correctional process had been successful, which was rare even for persons convicted of similar offences and sentenced to much shorter terms of imprisonment than the period of time that he had already served. Those factors placed him outside the scope of application of Article\u00a038 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code of 1968 (see paragraph 60 above).",

Prisoners placed under the \u201cenhanced regime\u201d could, by order of the prison governor, be permanently kept in locked cells if, by reason of the seriousness of their offence or the length of their sentence, they could be regarded as dangerous, or if they manifestly and systematically failed to respect internal order or had a negative influence on other inmates (regulation 56 \u00a7 1).",

Time spent in pre-trial detention did not count towards that period (regulation 167 \u00a7 2). The decision to place a life prisoner under a lighter regime was to be taken by a special commission comprising prison staff and various other officials (section\u00a017(1) and (5)1); by contrast, the decision to place any prisoner under a harsher regime was to be taken by the regional court, on a proposal by that commission (section 17(5)2). All proposals in that respect were to be based on an assessment of the risk that the prisoner presented to himself or herself, other inmates and prison staff (section 17a). Under section 58, the commission\u2019s decisions could be set aside by the Minister of Justice. Once placed under the \u201cstrict regime\u201d, a life prisoner could, if considered not to pose a risk to himself or herself, other inmates or prison staff, be detained with the general prison population, by decision of the same commission (section\u00a0127b(4), added in June 2002).",

The purpose of these standards is to \u201clay down an effective model for the treatment of life prisoners that guarantees concrete support for their physical and mental preservation and ensures that society and prison staff are protected\u201d. They set out, among other things, minimum requirements for the material conditions in which those prisoners are to be kept, the applicable security arrangements, and the manner in which life prisoners are to be treated. They call on the prison authorities to ensure, where possible and within the constraints flowing from the applicable security arrangements, that life prisoners are provided with suitable work, education (including, if possible, distance learning), social development, tutelage, programmes for the maintenance of their physical and mental health, and medical care. The standards state, inter\u00a0alia, that all life prisoners are to be enrolled in adaptation programmes oriented towards enabling them to accept their situation, creating a sense of perspective, encouraging self-help, maintaining social contact, stimulating their participation in various activities, and neutralising any depressive and psychosomatic symptoms. The standards also state that life prisoners should have individual sentence plans and periodical assessments, as well as the possibility to discuss issues relating to the execution of their sentence with the prison administration. According to the standards, life prisoners should have access to cultural and sporting activities, the prison library, periodicals, television and radio, religious services and group activities.

In this regard, the CPT\u2019s delegation was pleased to learn of plans to progressively integrate life-sentenced prisoners into mainstream prison regimes. Pursuant to the recent amendments to the [Execution of Punishments Act] (cf. [section] 127b), the commission set up at each prison for the purpose of making decisions on prisoners\u2019 regime can decide, on the basis of individual risk assessment, to transfer life-sentenced prisoners to ordinary units with the right to participate in work, education, sport and other activities.",

In the CPT\u2019s opinion, the regime for life-sentenced prisoners should be fundamentally reviewed. Small-group isolation for extended periods is more likely to de-socialise than re-socialise people. There should instead be a structured programme of constructive and preferably out-of-cell activities; educators and psychologists should be proactive in working with life-sentenced prisoners to encourage them to take part in that programme and attempt to engage them safely with other prisoners for at least a part of each day.",

In Stara Zagora Prison, two life prisoners had shared a cell, but all the others had been in single cells as well. Save for Plovdiv Prison and some other prisons that did not include Stara Zagora Prison, the units housing life prisoners were in a very poor state of repair: the floors and walls were dirty, and the furniture, invariably attached to the floor, was very old. Some units had double bunk beds, which were seldom used, however. Life prisoners took their meals in their cells. Sunlight in the units earmarked for them was often insufficient. Windows typically measured 1 by 0.6-0.8 metres and were situated about 2 metres from the floor, which prevented the inmates from looking out of them. The window frames in the life prisoners\u2019 unit of Plovdiv Prison \u2013 but not in that of Stara Zagora Prison \u2013 were new. Artificial lighting was never turned off, so as to make it possible for guards visually to inspect the cells at all times. Some inmates complained that that made it hard for them to go to sleep, especially if the lights were luminescent. No life prisoners\u2019 unit had a ventilation system, and fresh air only came through the windows when they were open, which was a problem in winter because even on the coldest days heating was only turned on for one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. Life prisoners had to wash their clothes during their visits to the toilet, and dry them in their cells. In-cell toilets had been built in several prisons, but not in Plovdiv or Stara Zagora Prisons. Access to the common toilets was possible for thirty minutes in the morning, at lunch and in the evening. During that time, life prisoners also had to wash their buckets and eating utensils. The rest of the time, if they needed to go to the toilet, they had to call the guards. Since most prisons did not have a signalling system, prisoners had to bang on the doors of their cells or shout. That often caused conflicts with the guards, and prisoners therefore often preferred to relieve themselves in buckets in their cells. In all prisons except Pleven Prison, life prisoners remained permanently locked in their cells. In Plovdiv Prison, the one-hour daily walk had been extended by thirty minutes, and in Stara Zagora Prison by twenty minutes. In most prisons, life prisoners took their daily walks in separate yards. Those yards were quite small and in some prisons, such as Plovdiv Prison, did not allow a proper workout.",

Since most of those prisoners had lived in the same cells for a number of years, they had tried to arrange them in such a way as to resemble, as far as possible, home interiors. Plovdiv Prison and Stara Zagora Prison did not have clubs in their high-security units. Only a few life prisoners had been given the opportunity to engage in meaningful activities. Caring for them was very hard because of the lack of prospects of release. Nevertheless, in some prisons the teams working with life prisoners had made serious attempts to support them psychologically and give them a sense of perspective and the impetus to keep up their social contact, take part in activities, and counter any depressive or psychosomatic symptoms. In some prisons, however, the treatment of life prisoners fell short of the requirements of the \u201cNational standards for the treatment of life prisoners\u201d (see paragraph 135 above), and some of the prisoners concerned had complained that no individual work was being carried out with them and that no cultural, informational or sporting activities were being organised for them.",

His attitude towards the prison authorities and other inmates was hostile, and he had been subjected to numerous disciplinary punishments. Mr Harakchiev was also a serial litigator, having brought about seventy cases against the prison authorities. Some of those \u2013 concerning for instance the lack of truffles in the daily menu or the prohibition on bringing bulk tobacco into prison \u2013 had been clearly frivolous. Although Mr Harakchiev\u2019s regime did not permit communal activities, in November 2006 he had been allowed to take part in a yoga course. He could also interact with prison officers. For instance, in 2009 he had had a series of meetings with the prison psychologist, but had then chosen to abandon individual consultations.

The very fact that, unlike Mr Harakchiev\u2019s regime, Mr\u00a0Tolumov\u2019s prison regime had been changed in view of the positive developments in his personality showed that the authorities took a case-by-case approach and that a life prisoner\u2019s regime depended entirely on his own conduct. Each prisoner\u2019s annual assessment was prepared by specially qualified inspectors. As a rule, only the most experienced inspectors worked with life prisoners, and they always consulted a psychologist before drawing up an assessment of the prisoner\u2019s dangerousness.

The fact that in Mr Harakchiev\u2019s case the effects of that regime were to some extent, especially in 2010-12, mitigated by his numerous transfers to other prisons in connection with his participation in hearings in cases brought by him against the authorities (see paragraph 20 in fine above) cannot be regarded as decisive in that respect. It should be noted in that connection that under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d \u2013 applied to Mr Harakchiev at that time \u2013 life prisoners have to be kept isolated from other inmates during prison transfers as well (see paragraph 125 above).",

It is true that the applicants in the present case were not subjected to complete isolation and that an inmate\u2019s segregation from the prison community does not in itself amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. However, it cannot be overlooked that in the present case both applicants were kept under such an impoverished regime for extended periods of time \u2013 twelve and fourteen years respectively. In such circumstances, isolation should be justified by particular security reasons obtaining throughout the duration of this measure. It can hardly be accepted that this was automatically necessary solely on account of the applicants\u2019 sentences to whole life and life imprisonment respectively as an inherent part of the relevant punishment for at least the initial five years of the sentence. The automatic segregation of life prisoners from the rest of the prison community and from each other, in particular where no comprehensive activities outside the cell or stimulus inside the cell are available, may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Savi\u010ds, cited above, \u00a7 139). Moreover, it runs counter to two instruments to which the Court attaches considerable importance despite their non-binding character (see, mutatis mutandis, Rivi\u00e8re v.\u00a0France, no. 33834/03, \u00a7 72, 11 July 2006, and Dybeku v. Albania, no.\u00a041153/06, \u00a7 48, 18 December 2007): Rule 25.2 of the 2006 European Prison Rules, which says that the prison regime should allow \u201call prisoners to spend as many hours a day outside their cells as are necessary for an adequate level of human and social interaction\u201d (see paragraph 159 above), and point 7 of Recommendation 2003(23) on the management by prison administrations of life sentence and other long-term prisoners, which says that \u201c[c]onsideration should be given to not segregating life sentence and other long-term prisoners on the sole ground of their sentence\u201d (see paragraph 162 above). In that connection, it should also be noted that in its reports on its visits to Bulgaria, the CPT has repeatedly emphasised that life prisoners should not be regarded, solely on the basis of their sentence, as more dangerous than other prisoners, and that the assessment of the risk that they pose needs to be made on a case-by-case basis (see paragraphs 167-171 above). In that context, reference also needs to be made to the CPT\u2019s eleventh general report, which said that there was \u201cno justification for indiscriminately applying restrictions to all prisoners subject to a specific type of sentence, without giving due consideration to the individual risk they may (or may not) present\u201d (see paragraph 165 above), and to its twenty-first general report, which made the same point as the abovementioned reports on the CPT\u2019s visits to Bulgaria (see paragraph 166 above).",

The Court has already had occasion to find, albeit in the context of Article\u00a010 of the Convention, that it is impermissible to impose a disciplinary punishment on a prisoner for complaining of the conditions of his detention (see Marin Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 13801/07, \u00a7\u00a7 45-51, 24 July 2012).

It should also be noted in this connection that apparently the exercise yards for life prisoners are separate and quite small, and that the yard in Plovdiv Prison does not allow a proper work out (see paragraph 176 in fine above, and compare with the case cited in Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 152). In this connection, it appears that the prison authorities were to ensure such occupation to the extent possible \u201cwithin the constraints flowing from the applicable security arrangements\u201d (see paragraph 135 above). However, the Government have not referred to any participation of the two applicants in reasonable activities or correctional courses, with the exception of a week\u2019s yoga course intended to overcome stress in the case of Mr Harakchiev, have not sought to invoke convincing security reasons requiring the applicants\u2019 isolation, and have not said why it was not possible to revise the regime of prisoners in the applicants\u2019 situation so as to provide them with adequate possibilities for human contact and sensible occupation in practice (compare and contrast Iorgov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23 and 65).

The Government did not dispute that the applicants\u2019 cells are not equipped with such facilities or running water. The Court can therefore hardly accept that it was the applicants\u2019 choice to use buckets to relieve their sanitary needs outside the three daily visits to the toilet, and that the need to resort to the use of buckets could be obviated by calling on the guards to open their cells at any time. The impracticability of that possibility is amply demonstrated by the explanations given in the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee report of April 2010, which said that prisoners\u2019 calling on the guards often gave rise to conflicts and thus drove the prisoners to prefer to use buckets in their cells for their sanitary needs (see paragraph 176 above). It appears that in Mr Harakchiev\u2019s case the guards never opened his cell to let him visit the toilet outside the three regular daily visits (see paragraphs 17 in fine and 35 above). The use of buckets in the absence of toilet facilities in the cells was, and still is, widespread in prisons in Bulgaria, has been well documented by the CPT (see the report cited in paragraph 171 above in relation specifically to the unit housing life prisoners in Plovdiv Prison, and the report cited in paragraph\u00a0173 above), has been acknowledged as a problem by the Government (see paragraph 172 above), and has been consistently criticised by this Court since 2005 (see Kehayov v.

In any event, no issue arose under Article 13 of the Convention as the applicants\u2019 claims were not \u201carguable\u201d for the purposes of that provision. The Government went on to say that the possibility to challenge omissions of the authorities under Articles 256 and 257 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 was an effective remedy in respect of poor material conditions of detention. The Execution of Punishments and Pre-Trial Detention Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations clearly set out the minimum conditions that the prison authorities had to provide to inmates, and any failure to do so was therefore actionable under those Articles.

They went on to say that the possibility of bringing proceedings under Articles 256 and 257 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006 was not an effective remedy either, for several reasons. First, some aspects of the conditions of their detention flowed directly from the prison regime under which they were placed, and were therefore not actionable under those Articles. In this regard they referred to the Court judgment in Sabev (cited above, \u00a7 85). Secondly, neither the 2009 Act nor its implementing regulations laid down clear rules on the treatment of life prisoners. Thirdly, it was unclear which authority would be the proper defendant, and there did not exist an appropriate mechanism for enforcing a mandatory injunction against a public authority. The administrative courts considered that authorities that were second-tier beneficiaries of budget funds \u2013 and the likely defendant to a claim under Articles 256 and 257 was likely to be just such an authority \u2013 could not be fined for failure to comply with an injunction. Moreover, any such injunction would be of limited duration and would not be able to provide the applicants with lasting redress. Lastly, the only two examples cited by the Government were judgments given by first-instance administrative courts. Accordingly, there was no established case-law in that domain.",

In the case of another life prisoner, in Lovech Prison, whose cell had been refurbished and equipped with toilet facilities and who had failed to provide any information about the contemporaneous conditions of his detention, the Court proceeded on the basis that he could be regarded as having been placed in Article 3-compliant conditions. Therefore, such a claim could likewise be regarded as an effective remedy in his case (see Sabev, cited above, \u00a7 84).",

Moreover, regard should be had to the fact that the second of those cases has still not been finally decided. Therefore, that remedy, while theoretically capable of providing redress to the applicants, does not appear, for the time being, to be capable of doing so in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Mandi\u0107 and Jovi\u0107 v.

A ruling that that was not sufficient would not do justice to the work of the Clemency Commission attached to the Vice-President and would engender legal turmoil not only in Bulgaria but also in other member States. Whole life imprisonment, introduced in 1998 as a result of the abolition of the death penalty, was a very important component of the punitive system of Bulgarian criminal law. It was a penalty that was imposed very rarely and reserved for the most serious offences. There were at present fifty-seven persons in Bulgaria serving a whole life sentence and 106 persons serving a life sentence.",

It was very significant in that connection that on 21 January 2013 the VicePresident had, in exercising that power, commuted a whole life sentence to a life sentence. The reasons underlying the decision to do so had been set out in the report of the Clemency Commission, which had moreover noted that the decision would demonstrate to all other persons sentenced to whole life imprisonment that they could improve their situation. The presidential power of clemency had been in place at the time when whole life imprisonment had been introduced as a penalty and had always been exercised in a way that gave those concerned hope that they could obtain a reduction of their sentence. That was evident from the reasons given for refusals to pardon persons serving a whole life sentence, which essentially relied on two arguments: lack of progress in the process of rehabilitation, or an insignificant portion of the sentence hitherto served. The procedure for examining requests for clemency was and always had been laid down in presidential decrees, such as the decree of 23 February 2012, which had the force of law. The latest version of the applicable rules had been intended to optimise the procedure and render it more transparent, and to formalise the standards that had already emerged in practice. The main emphasis had been on increasing the research and analytical capabilities of the Clemency Commission and harmonising the way in which it examined each request for clemency. That procedure could produce the same effect as judicial procedures for the commutation of sentence. The President and the Vice-President were not bound by any criteria and could exercise the power of clemency at any time and in respect of any person.",

Under the 1968 Criminal Code, whole life imprisonment was reserved for cases in which the aims of punishment could not be attained by means of a lesser penalty. It followed that it was intended for persons who could never be rehabilitated, whereas it was clear that the sentencing court was not in a position to say whether a prisoner would remain unreformed for twenty or thirty years.",

As a result, a life prisoner did not know what he or she had to do to stand a chance of obtaining clemency. The manner in which that power had been exercised until 23 February 2012 was also very unclear: there was no information on how many prisoners had sought clemency and on what grounds, on how many requests had been upheld and for what reasons, or on who had been the experts advising the Vice-President and in accordance with what rules they had carried out their duties. In support of that assertion, the applicants produced four letters sent between 2006 and 2011 by the presidential administration to persons serving a whole life sentence who had applied for clemency: all of them merely said that the request had been duly examined and turned down. Between 2002 and 2009 sixteen persons serving such a sentence had applied for clemency; all of their requests had been turned down. There had been no cases of clemency in respect of such persons before 2002 either.",

They were just internal instructions governing the work of the Clemency Commission, not the exercise of the powers of the President and the VicePresident. Moreover, those rules had not even been published in the State Gazette, and it was not clear whether the President was entitled under the Constitution and the law to make abstract rules. It was still the case that as a matter of law the President and the Vice-President were free to decide, without having to base their decision on any criteria, whether or not to grant clemency. The decision on that point did not have to be reasoned, and was not open to legal challenge. In 2012, only three out of one hundred requests for clemency had been granted, whereas the number of life sentences remained high. Therefore, the clemency procedure was not a proper means of seeking commutation of a life sentence. The fact that the current Vice-President had, on the basis of her personal view that whole life sentences should be abolished, pardoned one person serving such a sentence did not give any real hope. While worthy of admiration, that position was personal to the VicePresident, was deeply unpopular, and would remain valid only as long as she held office.

Those highly restrictive conditions made it almost impossible to find suitable work for life prisoners. That was borne out by the information set out in the April 2010 report of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee.

Unlike the limited powers of the Secretary of State for Justice in the United Kingdom, the presidential power of clemency in Bulgaria was not fettered in any way. The President could commute any sentence, and that power was actually exercised. The procedure was sufficiently flexible, enabling prisoners to apply for a pardon without any time-limits and on any grounds. Any request for a pardon was subjected to a comprehensive assessment bearing upon the question whether incarceration continued to be justified on legitimate penological grounds. The monthly reports of the Clemency Commission attached to the Vice-President showed that it analysed those points in detail. In the one case in which it had recommended the commutation of a life prisoner\u2019s sentence, that Commission had had regard to exactly those factors. The possibility of seeking presidential clemency was available from the beginning of a life prisoner\u2019s sentence, widely known and frequently used.",

In any event, States had a margin of appreciation in deciding on the way in which life sentences were to be reviewed. The fact that the presidential power of clemency was fully discretionary did not detract from its effectiveness. That had been demonstrated by its exercise in relation to a prisoner serving a whole life sentence at the beginning of 2013. Contrary to Mr Harakchiev\u2019s allegation, that had not been solely due to the personal views of the current Vice-President. The decision to commute that life prisoner\u2019s sentence had set a trend. As was evident from the Clemency Commission\u2019s report, it had been taken on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of all relevant factors. The trend was also evident from the draft Criminal Code, which envisaged the abolition of whole life imprisonment. However, the enactment of a complex piece of legislation such as a criminal code required time. Meanwhile, the possibility of seeking presidential clemency was a sufficiently effective means at the disposal of persons sentenced to whole life imprisonment.",

The Grand Chamber was at the same time at pains to emphasise that a life sentence did not become \u201cirreducible\u201d by the mere fact that in practice it could be served in full, and that it was enough for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention that such a sentence be de jure and de facto reducible (ibid., \u00a7 98 in fine).",

It was true that there were certain shortcomings in the procedure: there were no published criteria indicating how the President exercised his or her discretion, no obligation to disclose to a prisoner the opinion of the Attorney-General on his or her application, no requirement for the President to give reasons and no such practice, and no possibility of judicial review. It was also true that the prospect of release for life prisoners was limited, since any adjustment of a life sentence fell within the President\u2019s discretion. However, there were a number of concrete examples in which the President had exercised that discretion and ordered the release of life prisoners.

The Grand Chamber reviewed in detail the relevant considerations flowing from the Court\u2019s case-law and from recent comparative and international-law trends in respect of life sentences (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 104-18). On that basis, it held that a life sentence could remain compatible with Article 3 of the Convention only if there was both a prospect of release and a possibility of review (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 109-10), because a prisoner could not be detained unless there were legitimate penological grounds for incarceration. Those grounds included punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. The Grand Chamber noted in particular that the balance between those justifications for incarceration was not necessarily static and could shift in the course of the sentence. What could be the primary justification for incarceration at the start of a sentence could cease to be so after a lengthy period into the service of that sentence. Therefore, it was only by carrying out a review of the justification for continued detention at an appropriate point in the sentence that those factors or shifts could be properly evaluated. If a prisoner was incarcerated without any prospect of release and without the possibility of having his life sentence reviewed, there was the risk that he could never atone for his offence: whatever he did in prison, however exceptional his progress towards rehabilitation, his punishment remained fixed and unreviewable (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 111-12). The Grand Chamber therefore held that it would be incompatible with human dignity \u2013 which lay at the very essence of the Convention system \u2013 forcefully to deprive a person of his freedom without striving towards his rehabilitation and providing him with the chance to someday regain that freedom (ibid., \u00a7 113). It went on to note that there was now clear support in European and international law for the principle that all prisoners, including those serving life sentences, be offered the possibility of rehabilitation and the prospect of release if that rehabilitation was achieved (ibid., \u00a7 114). While punishment remained one of the aims of imprisonment, the emphasis in European penal policy, as expressed in Rules 6, 102.1 and 103.8 of the European Prison Rules, Resolution 76(2) and Recommendations Rec(2003)23 and Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers, statements by the CPT, and the practice of a number of Contracting States, and in international law, as expressed, inter\u00a0alia, in Article 10 \u00a7 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the General Comment on that Article, was now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, even in the case of life prisoners (ibid.,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 115-18).",

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 of the Convention on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration (ibid., \u00a7 122).",

In the event of a commutation of his sentence, even if it were only replaced with a life sentence, as happened in the case of another life prisoner in January 2013 (see paragraphs 99-101 above), it will be open to Mr Harakchiev to seek judicial commutation and then perhaps even release on licence.",

Bulgaria] (no. 2) ([no. 36295/02], \u00a7\u00a7 48-60[, 2 September 2010]), decided after Kafkaris (cited above) but before Vinter and Others (cited above), a Chamber of the Fifth Section of the Court reviewed those constitutional and legislative arrangements and their application up to 2009. It noted that, even though between 2002 and 2009 the presidential power of clemency had been exercised in the cases of 477 prisoners, no one serving a whole life sentence had yet been granted such clemency. The Chamber nonetheless concluded that, as matters stood, it could not be said that Mr Iorgov, who had been sentenced to whole life imprisonment, had been deprived of all hope of being released from prison one day. Even though, by November 2009, no life prisoner had been granted presidential clemency, that was not enough to show that whole life imprisonment in Bulgaria was irreducible de facto. That penalty had been introduced into Bulgarian law fairly recently, in December 1998, following the formal abolition of the death penalty. That meant that it was unlikely that a large number of persons serving such a sentence, including Mr Iorgov, had spent a sufficiently lengthy period of time in prison to qualify for presidential clemency. There was nothing to suggest that if Mr Iorgov applied in due course for such clemency his application would not be properly considered by reference to a wide range of criteria. He could not therefore be regarded as having no hope of release, and there had therefore been no breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Iorgov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 52-60).",

That assumption underpinned the rulings of the domestic courts and the majority of the Chamber in Vinter and Others, who were essentially of the view that an irreducible life sentence did not entail a breach of Article 3 of the Convention unless and until the time came when the life prisoner\u2019s further incarceration would no longer be justified (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, 56, 87 and 91).

Since before October 2006 there were no instances in which the President or the VicePresident had exercised the power of clemency in relation to a prisoner serving a whole life sentence (see paragraph 87 above), and since there did not exist an authoritative contemporaneous interpretation of the law relating to presidential clemency, it is difficult to say whether that Article was capable of being construed \u2013 alone or in conjunction with Article\u00a098, point 11, of the 1991 Constitution \u2013 to mean that that penalty came within the ambit of the presidential power of clemency even though it was not specifically mentioned in the text of the Article. That uncertainty transpires from statements made by members of parliament in the course of the debate accompanying the introduction of whole life imprisonment (see paragraphs 63 and 64 above), the very fact that the legislature subsequently found it necessary to clarify the point by way of a statutory amendment, and also from the fact that in 2012 a group of members of parliament sought a binding interpretation of Article\u00a098, point 11, of the 1991 Constitution by the Constitutional Court, in particular on the point whether the presidential power of clemency embraced all types of criminal penalties (see paragraph 76 above). In those circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that it was clear at the time when Mr Harakchiev\u2019s sentence became final that it was de jure reducible.",

That court went on to say that, while the President or the Vice-President could not be required to give reasons in individual cases, they were expected to make known the general criteria guiding them in the exercise of the power of clemency. Lastly, the court held that a clemency decree was open to legal challenge before it, albeit subject to some restrictive conditions, in particular relating to standing (see paragraphs\u00a07683 above).

Under the previous presidential administration, which was in office for two terms, the first between 22\u00a0January 2002 and 22 January 2007 and the second between 22 January 2007 and 22 January 2012, the way in which the presidential power of clemency was being exercised was quite opaque, with no policy statements made publicly available and no reasons whatsoever provided for individual clemency decisions (see paragraph 87 above). Indeed, the Court cannot overlook the fact that during their debate in 1998 members of parliament sought reassurance that the President\u2019s discretion would not be exercised with regard to persons sentenced to whole life imprisonment, and that in 2012 Parliament found it necessary to set up an ad hoc committee to conduct an inquiry into the matter (see paragraph 89 above). Nor were there any concrete examples showing that persons in Mr Harakchiev\u2019s situation could hope to benefit from the exercise of that power (contrast Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 103). It is true that the lack of such examples could be explained by the fact that the penalty of whole life imprisonment had been introduced into Bulgarian law not long before that, in December 1998, and that it was therefore unlikely that a large number of persons serving such a sentence had spent a sufficiently long period of time in prison by then to qualify for clemency (see Iorgov\u00a0(no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 56-57). However, the combination of a complete lack of formal or even informal safeguards surrounding the exercise of the presidential power of clemency, coupled with the absence of any examples tending to suggest that a person serving a whole life sentence would be able to obtain an adjustment of that sentence and under what circumstances, leads the Court to conclude that between November 2004 and the beginning of 2012 Mr Harakchiev\u2019s sentence could not be regarded as de facto reducible. It necessarily follows from paragraph 122 of the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others (cited in paragraph 246(d) above) that in this type of case the breach of Article 3 of the Convention consists of depriving the prisoner, for any period of time, of any hope of release, however tenuous that hope may be.",

It should also be noted in that connection that in Vinter and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0122) the Grand Chamber held that a \u201clife prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions\u201d (see paragraph 246(d) above).",

For that chance to be genuine and tangible, the authorities must also give life prisoners a real opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. Indeed, the Court has already had occasion to note that in recent years there has been a trend towards placing more emphasis on rehabilitation, which constitutes the idea of resocialisation through the fostering of personal responsibility (see Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2007-V, and Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-18). That appears fully consonant with the first aim of criminal punishment, as set out in Article 36 of the Bulgarian Criminal Code (see paragraph 53 above), as well as with Article 10 \u00a7 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in force with respect to Bulgaria since 1970, which provides that the essential aim of the treatment of prisoners is their reformation and social rehabilitation (see paragraphs\u00a0157-58 above). It is also inherent in several instruments to which, as already mentioned, the Court attaches considerable importance despite their non-binding character (see, mutatis mutandis, Rivi\u00e8re [v. France, no. 33834/03], \u00a7 72[, 11 July 2006], and Dybeku [v. Albania, no.\u00a041153/06], \u00a7 48[, 18 December 2007]): Rules 6, 33.3, 102.1 and 107.1 of the 2006 European Prison Rules; points 6 and 11 of Resolution 76(2) of the Committee of Ministers; and paragraphs 2 in fine, 5 and 33 of Recommendation Rec(2003)23 on the management by prison administrations of life sentence and other long-term prisoners. All of these instruments emphasise that efforts need to be made by the prison authorities to promote the reintegration and rehabilitation of all prisoners, including those serving life sentences (see paragraphs 159, 161 and 162 above).",

In the present case, in spite of some variations in his prison regime, in practice Mr\u00a0Harakchiev remained in permanently locked cells and isolated from the rest of the prison community, with very limited possibilities to engage in social contact or work, throughout the entire period of his incarceration (see paragraphs 12, 23, 32 and 177 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the deleterious effects of that impoverished regime, coupled with the unsatisfactory material conditions in which Mr Harakchiev was kept, must have seriously damaged his chances of reforming himself and thus entertaining a real hope that he might one day achieve and demonstrate his progress and obtain a reduction of his sentence. To that should be added the lack of consistent periodical assessment of his progress towards rehabilitation. It is true that Mr Harakchiev was the subject of annual psychological assessments (see paragraph 48 above). However, it is noteworthy that the \u201cNational standards for the treatment of life prisoners\u201d, issued in 2007, appear to be geared towards helping life prisoners adapt to their sentence rather than working towards their rehabilitation (see paragraph 135 above). Nor do those standards make it clear whether any positive changes in life prisoners should be the result of their own efforts or of a proactive approach on the part of the prison authorities, as recommended by the CPT (see paragraph 165 above).",

On that basis, the Court accepted that there had been an interference with a pre-trial detainee\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence even though he had not produced any evidence that his letters had been opened and inspected by the prison authorities (see Bochev v. Bulgaria, no. 73481/01, \u00a7\u00a094, 13 November 2008). However, the Court went on to say that there was no basis on which to assume that such interference had continued to exist after the amendment in 2006 of regulation 178(2) of the implementing regulations of the 1969 Act providing that inmates\u2019 letters had to be sealed and opened in the presence of a prison officer in such a way as to allow that officer to ensure that they did not contain money or other prohibited objects (ibid., \u00a7 94 in fine; see also paragraph 155 above).",

It is primarily for the State concerned to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the means to be used in its domestic legal order to discharge that obligation. However, with a view to helping the respondent State to fulfil it, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see, as a recent authority, Stanev v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7\u00a7 254-55, ECHR 2012).",

It discloses a systemic problem that has already given rise to similar applications (see Chervenkov [v. Bulgaria, no. 45358/04], \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 69-70[, 27 November 2012], and Sabev [v. Bulgaria, no. 27887/06], \u00a7\u00a7 72 and 9899[, 28 May 2013]), and may give rise to more such applications. The nature of the breach suggests that to execute this judgment properly, the respondent State would be required to reform, preferably by means of legislation, the legal framework governing the prison regime applicable to persons sentenced to life imprisonment with or without parole. That reform, invariably recommended by the CPT since 1999 (see paragraphs 167-171 and 173 above), should entail (a) removing the automatic application of the highly restrictive prison regime currently applicable to all life prisoners for an initial period of at least five years, and (b) putting in place provisions envisaging that a special security regime can only be imposed \u2013 and maintained \u2013 on the basis of an individual risk assessment of each life prisoner, and applied for no longer than strictly necessary.",
