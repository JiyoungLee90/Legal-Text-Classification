They looted those floors and set the canteen in the Presidential Palace alight. During the night, several fires broke out in the Parliament building, some of them breaking out after full control over the building was recovered by the authorities at around 11 p.m.",

The situation was considered so serious by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture as to conclude, after having reviewed \u201ca remarkably large number of credible and consistent allegations of police ill-treatment in the context of the post-election events in April 2009\u201d that \u201crather than isolated incidents, there were patterns of alleged ill-treatment\u201d (see points 10 and 15 in the CPT report for 2009, paragraph 34 above). Similar conclusions were reached by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe (\u201clarge-scale violations of the fundamental right to be free of ill-treatment\u201d, see paragraph 33 above) and the parliamentary inquiry commission tasked with the elucidation of the causes and consequences of the events following the general elections held on 5 April 2009 in Moldova (\u201cmost people were detained by the police arbitrarily...; the police committed ill-treatment and acts of torture against individuals held in detention\u201d, see paragraph 35 above).",

In this respect, it notes that when bringing the applicant to the police station the arresting officers and the officers who took responsibility for his detention thereafter did not note any injuries on the applicant\u2019s body. It follows that he entered detention in good health on 7 April 2009 (8 April according to the Government). Moreover, according to the medical record submitted by the Government, on 8 April 2009 the applicant was seen by a prison doctor, who had not noted any signs of ill-treatment (see paragraph 15 above). However, after a week of detention another prison doctor found injuries on the applicant\u2019s face (see paragraph 20 above).",

Moreover, a number of reports by various international and national bodies confirmed the virtual absence of any complaints concerning ill-treatment at prison no. 13, while the great majority of such complaints concerned ill-treatment at police stations and at the GPD\u2019s premises (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). Indeed, the applicant never complained of any violence in prison no. 13. The Court concludes that the materials of the case form a strong presumption, insufficiently rebutted by the Government, that the applicant suffered his injuries either at Botanica police station or at the GPD\u2019s premises between 8 and 10\u00a0April 2009.

The Government did not provide any evidence that the applicant had been offered assistance for his injuries prior to his complaint on 14 April 2009). While the above circumstances may raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court considers that in the present case these are additional elements contributing to the anguish which the applicant must have suffered as a result of his illtreatment and the other circumstances of his arrest.",

The Court refers to the state of insecurity described by many victims during the period of 712 April 2009, where they saw many other people openly ill-treated and humiliated and where they feared further ill-treatment if they complained to a prosecutor or a judge. Moreover, the refusal to let the applicant contact his parents and hire a lawyer of his own will, coupled with the allegedly passive role of the legal-aid lawyer \u2013 who did not react to clear signs of ill-treatment on the applicant\u2019s face \u2013 did not strengthen the applicant\u2019s resolve to complain. The court also refers to the concerns expressed in respect of the independence and quality of work of legal-aid lawyers during the relevant events (see point 28 in the CPT report cited at paragraph 34 above, as well as paragraph 37 above), the summary manner in which judges, including judge M. D., examined cases inside police stations, as well as the lack of resolute action against ill-treatment by investigating judges and prosecutors during the events of April 2009 (see paragraph 35 above). All of these are not only cause for serious concern, but also confirm the sentiments of fear and helplessness which the applicant must have felt during his detention. These feelings were shared by a majority of the alleged victims. As the CPT observed in point 10 of its report, \u201cmost cases of alleged police ill-treatment in the context of the April events had emerged only after the persons concerned had been transferred to an establishment under the Ministry of Justice or released\u201d. When he felt safe enough, after his transfer and after seeing a lawyer he could trust, he made his complaint, which the Court finds perfectly understandable in the circumstances.",

It would appear that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to open a criminal investigation was at least partly based on the results of such verification made by that Ministry. This is even stranger in the light of the fact that the declared aim of entrusting the investigation of the cases concerning alleged ill-treatment to military prosecutors had been precisely to ensure the absence of any links between those in charge of the investigations and the police (see paragraph\u00a033 above). Moreover, the military prosecutors declared that they had also focused on senior police officers within that Ministry (see point 66 in the CPT report cited in paragraph 34 above), which makes an inquiry by that institution incompatible with the requirement of independence of the investigator from those under investigation. Therefore, the investigation into the applicant\u2019s complaint was compromised to a certain extent.",
