The injuries suffered by the applicant were classed under domestic law as intermediate bodily harm (see paragraph 6 above), and the limitation period for prosecuting such an offence is ten years (see paragraph\u00a024 above). As the remaining attackers have not been identified, no act of criminal prosecution has ever been carried out against them by the prosecution authorities capable of interrupting the running of that period. It therefore appears that the limitation period in respect of the unidentified attackers expired in June 2012, the attack against the applicant dating back to June 2002. Even though, as noted, the Court has not been informed of any decision of the prosecution authorities to formally discontinue the criminal proceedings on the grounds of extinctive prescription, they are obliged to do so (see paragraph 25 above).

Moreover, even though the applicant and the other victims had seen their attackers, no attempt was made to organise, for instance, an identity parade. As to the subsequent stages of the procedure, the Court finds particularly important the Oryahovo District Court\u2019s findings in its decision of 4\u00a0March 2006, based in part on an admission in that respect by the prosecution authorities, that the investigator in charge of the case had not ensured that the necessary had been done to find the unidentified attackers (see paragraph\u00a016 above).

In particular, the Government have not shown that the police did anything to verify the information on the unidentified attackers given by the applicant and his son when they were interviewed in June 2006 (see paragraph 17 above).",

As concerns civil redress, the Court does not accept the Government\u2019s argument (see paragraph 31 above) that the applicant should have brought a separate claim for damages in the civil courts. The Court observes that the applicant has already chosen to bring his claim in the context of the criminal proceedings against K.K. and T.K. and cannot be blamed for this choice (contrast, for instance, Dimitar Shopov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 17253/07, \u00a7 58, 16 April 2013, where the applicant had not brought a civil claim in the framework of the criminal proceedings).
