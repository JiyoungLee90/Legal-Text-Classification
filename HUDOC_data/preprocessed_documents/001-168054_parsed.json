The Government have presented no arguments or evidence to enable the Court to reach a different conclusion in the cases at hand. In the light of the Government\u2019s acknowledgement in respect of the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 7 above), thus confirming its \u201carguable\u201d nature, the Court concludes that the complaint under Article\u00a013 is admissible.
