It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the Court and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. The rule also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see Sabri G\u00fcne\u015f v.

Thus, where no effective remedy is available to an applicant, the time-limit expires six months after the date of the acts or measures complained of. If an applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only subsequently becomes (or should have become) aware of the circumstances which render that remedy ineffective, it might be appropriate to calculate the six-month period from the date on which the applicant became (or ought to have become) aware of those circumstances. The pursuit of remedies which do not satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 will not be considered by the Court for the purposes of establishing the date of the \u201cfinal decision\u201d or calculating the starting point for the running of the six-month rule. It follows that if an applicant has recourse to a remedy which is doomed to failure from the outset, the decision on that appeal cannot be taken into account for the calculation of the six-month period (see Jeronovi\u010ds v. Latvia [GC], no.\u00a044898/10, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2016, and the cases cited therein).",

By contrast, the authorities were not obliged by any legally binding time frame to give their final decisions before the planned date of the public event. The Court therefore concluded that the judicial remedy available to the organisers of public events, which was of a post-hoc character, could not provide adequate redress in respect of the alleged violations of Article 11 of the Convention. It consequently found a violation of Article 13 owing to the absence of an effective domestic remedy. In the case of Lashmankin and Others v. Russia (nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0356-60, 7 February 2017) the Court confirmed this approach. It also upheld the additional argument put forward by the applicants challenging the effectiveness of that remedy and found it to be ineffective because the scope of the judicial review was limited to examining the lawfulness of the restriction, and did not include any assessment of its \u201cnecessity\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d.",

Moreover, in some cases the authorities had suggested changing the venue of the events. In doing so, local authorities had protected the interests of minors, which could have been breached by the \u201cpromotion of homosexuality in public places\u201d.

They therefore considered that the impugned measures had been lawful and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of rights and freedoms of minors, their parents and others, and had not entailed a violation of Article 11 or Article 14 (in conjunction with Article 11).

Subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v.\u00a0Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 249, ECHR 2000 VIII). In exercising their choice of general and individual measures, the respondent State is required to provide the Committee of Ministers with detailed, uptodate information on developments in the process of executing the judgment that is binding on them (see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT), cited\u00a0above, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 87, citing Rule 6 of the Committee of Ministers\u2019 Rules for the supervision of the execution of judgments and of the terms of friendly settlements). Given the variety of means to achieve this aim and the nature of the issues involved, the Committee of Ministers is better placed than the Court to assess the specific measures to be taken (see Kudeshkina v.

The Court emphasises that the prevailing situation has given rise and continues to give rise to violations similar to those in the present case and in Alekseyev in respect of every person who is willing to organise an LGBT public event. It has declined to award just satisfaction for nonpecuniary damage in respect of such violations (see \u00a7 27 above). The Court therefore considers that there are no exceptional circumstances which would justify making any awards for costs and expenses in follow-up cases of this type (see, mutatis mutandis, Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2010 (extracts)).

Russia (nos. 4916/07 and 2 others, 21 October 2010). At the same time the Court found the same package of violations without providing any substantial reasoning (the ban on holding public assemblies did not correspond to a pressing social need and was not necessary in a democratic society; the applicants had suffered unjustified discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation). It is obvious that all the participants, including the Court, were not flexible enough to find a compromise. The Court emphasised that the nature of the violations and the extent of the recurring problem required sustained and long-term efforts in the adoption of general measures in order to address the issues under Articles 11 and 14 of the Convention (see paragraph 28 of the judgment). However, it is difficult to devise any measures if the problem is not identified. First of all, in the leading case of Alekseyev, cited above, the Court disregarded the security and safety concerns\u00a0put forward by the Government in connection with Gay Pride parades. Later, as demonstrated in the case of Identoba and Others v. Georgia, no. 73235/12, 12 May 2015, it became clear that those concerns were real and needed to be addressed by the Court. In the case of Bayev and Others v. Russia (nos. 67667/09 and 2\u00a0others, 20 June 2017), the Court did not consider the fundamental rights and freedoms of parents and their children affected by the public debate on sexual orientation. Those deficiencies in the case-law created the impression that the promotion of homosexual relationships, especially to minors, could be considered an issue for public debate (see the applicants\u2019 submissions in paragraph 18 of the judgment).",

The legal recognition of such partnerships could be the startingpoint for protecting all the other needs usually arising in relation to any family members.

Firstly, after the Court\u2019s judgment in Alekseyev eight years ago, the respondent State and the domestic courts were already under an obligation to remedy the violations suffered by the applicants and to swiftly change their practice in order to avoid future violations. They have, however, consistently failed to do so, as evidenced by the subsequent Bayev judgment and the present case. The process of implementation, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, is still pending and the Committee has not yet adopted any final resolution concluding that the Russian Government has fulfilled its obligations under Article 46 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Thus the refusal of the Court to award non-pecuniary damages is even more paradoxical given that the impugned practice and legal provisions remain in force, and that the effects of the harm already sustained by the applicants have therefore not been mitigated (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayev and others v. Russia, no.\u00a067667/09 and two others, \u00a7 98). Secondly, the Court made no reference to Article 46 of the Convention in Alekseyev and Bayev, nor did it decide in those two cases to apply the so-called \u201cpilot-judgment procedure\u201d concerning repetitive cases stemming from the same uncorrected practice incompatible with the Convention. Thirdly, the applicant has suffered immaterial damages that a change in practice will not appropriately remedy, as explained in paragraphs 9 and 10 of this opinion.",

In my opinion, we cannot justifiably reduce the amount of compensation \u2013 or refuse compensation altogether \u2013 for the individual violations of the applicants\u2019 rights on the basis that they occurred on multiple occasions. There is no reason why it should be more affordable for States to violate an individual\u2019s rights in bulk.",

The majority\u2019s approach devalues the gravity of the individual violations suffered by the applicants, and seems to negate the seriousness of the fact that the authorities still do not fulfil their obligations under the Convention. The Court ought to beware applicants being punished for the fact that the State has yet to correct its repeated violations of their rights.",

In the proposal at hand, the Court, having addressed the first function, refrains from discharging the second. In doing so, the Court fails to bear in mind that just satisfaction goes beyond mere compensation and also holds a broader function, which is both preventive and instructive. The award of just satisfaction, besides reinstating the victim in his fundamental right, serves as a concrete warning to governments. It is a financial incentive for the State found to be in violation to change its practice and avoid future violations. Given the state of implementation of the two judgments cited above (Alekseyev v. Russia; and Bayev and others v. Russia), such financial incentive could have proven to be beneficial in the case at hand.",
