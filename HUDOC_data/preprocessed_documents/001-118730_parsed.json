The reason on both occasions was the inability of the first-instance court to duly establish the facts despite clear orders from the appeal court and errors in the application of the law as established by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 23 and 27). The Court acknowledges that the domestic courts were in the best position to judge whether the case ought to be referred back to the lower courts under the relevant provision of domestic law (Bock v. Germany, judgment of 29 March 1989, Series A no. 150, \u00a7\u00a043). Nonetheless, as it has already stressed in previous cases (see, for example, De\u017eelak v. Slovenia, no. 1438/02, \u00a7 25, 6 April 2006), since the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts, as indeed appears to have happened in the applicant\u2019s case, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system. That deficiency is attributable to the authorities, not the applicant (see Wierciszewska v.\u00a0Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003, and Matica v.
