Therefore, at the time of the audit in March\u00a01998 Mr\u00a0Bruck did not actually have a valid employment contract and the payouts, although not considered as arbitrary and tolerated, had taken place without any legal basis. Mr Bruck had not contested the amount of the sums mentioned in relation to his salary and expenses for business trips.

The fact that Mr Bruck had wrongly calculated royalties had been proven by the audit report of Mr\u00a0Dollh\u00e4ubl and Mr Kittl. The statement that Mr Bruck had used financial tricks was therefore also true. Mr Bruck had in fact once exceeded the credit line of the company and had acknowledged that Mr Kittl had not been paid his fee. His argument that Mr Kittl had not been commissioned by Techno-Z FH was questionable and, in any event, did not exclude the possibility that another motive for the refusal to pay Mr Kittl had been revenge, which, moreover, appeared obvious in view of the consequences of his report. Mr Kittl had actually requested the opening of bankruptcy proceedings against Techno-Z FH. It was true that Mr Bruck\u2019s idea of providing every household in  with free internet access would have allowed children to access pornographic sites.

The report by that firm, commissioned by Mr Bruck, found that the accounting system and management of public finances corresponded to the average standard of a private institution and remarked critically that the company had not adapted its organisation structure to the rise of its business turnover fast enough.

The Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in this respect, but this goes hand in hand with a European supervision which is more or less extensive depending on the circumstances. In reviewing under Article\u00a010 the decisions taken by the national authorities pursuant to their margin of appreciation, the Court must determine, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the interference at issue was \u201cproportionate\u201d to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons adduced by them to justify the interference are \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d (see Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8\u00a0June\u00a01986, Series A no. 103, p.\u00a025, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a039-40; and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), judgment of 26\u00a0November 1991, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0217, p.\u00a028-29, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050).",

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Lingens, cited above, p. 28, \u00a7 46, and Oberschlick\u00a0v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A, no. 204, p. 27, \u00a7\u00a063).\u00a0However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment may be excessive where it has no factual basis to support it (see Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, \u00a7 43, 27 February 2001, with further references).",

A commercial director was appointed to improve the book-keeping, serious shortcomings had in fact been discovered by two auditors and one of them did in fact threaten to file a bankruptcy claim against Mr Bruck.",

Bearing in mind that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest, the Court finds that the domestic court overstepped the narrow margin of appreciation accorded to Member States, and that the interference was disproportionate to the aim pursued and was thus not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. There has, therefore, been a violation of Article\u00a010 of the Convention.",
