By the time of the suspension the proceedings had thus lasted five years, two months and eighteen days at three levels of jurisdiction. The Court notes that the proceedings in the applicant's case have never been formally terminated but have been suspended for what seems to be an indefinite period of time, given that the reason for their suspension was the applicant's lack of fitness to stand trial due to his complete and permanent blindness and deafness. Although the hypothetical possibility of resuming the proceedings exists, there seems to be no intention at present to continue them (see and compare Antoine v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62960/00, ECHR 2003-VII). On two occasions, in February 2008 and January 2009, the proceedings were reopened for a total period of sixteen days, but on both occasions the reopening was aimed at confirming the grounds for suspension, namely, the unfitness of the applicant to participate in any further proceedings. Therefore, for the purposes of the Convention, the criminal proceedings against the applicant lasted about five years and three months.",

This was exactly what happened in the instant case (see paragraphs 11 and 22 above).
