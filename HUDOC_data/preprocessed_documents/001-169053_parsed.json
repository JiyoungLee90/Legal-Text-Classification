In doing so, it must bear in mind that it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies (see Salduz v.

It observes, however, that the indictment was of limited effect in assisting an understanding of the verdict to be reached by the jury, since it was filed before the trial hearing, which forms the crucial part of proceedings in the Assize Court (see Taxquet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095; and Agnelet, cited above, \u00a7 65). Furthermore, as to the findings of fact set out in the indictment and their value in assisting an understanding of the verdict, the Court cannot speculate as to whether such findings influenced the deliberations and the decision ultimately reached by the jury (see, in particular, Agnelet, cited above; Voica, cited above, \u00a7 49; and Legillon, cited above, \u00a7 61). The provisions of Article 6 require in particular an understanding not of the reasons that prompted the judicial investigating bodies to send the case for trial in the Assize Court, but rather of the reasons that persuaded the members of the jury, after the trial hearing at which they had been present, to reach their decision on the issue of guilt.",

Such an examination in the present case may reveal a number of factors that should have dispelled any doubts on the applicant\u2019s part as to the jurors\u2019 conviction regarding her criminal responsibility at the time of the events. The Court observes that from its preliminary stage, the investigation focused on the applicant\u2019s personal history, character and psychological state at the time of the killings, as is shown by the indictment, a substantial part of which was devoted to these matters. Moreover, not only was there an adversarial trial, with the defendant and her counsel present, but above all, the emergence of new evidence, namely the letters disclosed by the applicant\u2019s personal psychiatrist, led the president to order a further psychiatric assessment (see paragraph\u00a031 above). The psychiatric experts thereupon changed their opinion and came back to present their new findings (see paragraphs 32 and\u00a033 above). It is clear that while the trial hearing always forms the crucial part of proceedings in the Assize Court, in the present case the question of the applicant\u2019s criminal responsibility was indeed a central focus of the hearing.",

Thus, while noting the applicant\u2019s psychological problems and the possible factors causing her to act as she did, the Assize Court explicitly mentioned both her resolve to commit the murders and the cold-blooded manner in which she had carried them out (see paragraph 36 above); this was a logical conclusion in view of the jury\u2019s answers to the questions. The Court of Cassation, moreover, did not interpret the sentencing judgment in any other way, since it held that consideration of the applicant\u2019s cold-blooded manner and her determination to carry out her crimes had constituted the Assize Court\u2019s reason for finding that she had been criminally responsible at the time of the events (see paragraph 39 above).",

It further notes that although the professional judges formally drafted the judgment in question, they were able to obtain the observations of the twelve members of the jury, who in fact sat alongside them in deliberating on the sentence and whose names appear in the judgment.

However, the Court reiterates that both the admissibility of evidence and its assessment are primarily a matter for regulation by national law and that as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court\u2019s duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, its function is not to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Schenk v.\u00a0Switzerland, 12 July 1998, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 140; Bernard v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0April 1998, \u00a7\u00a037, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II; and Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2), no.\u00a022251/08, ECHR 2015). Besides the fact that the experts themselves played down the impact of their findings by stating that their answers reflected their personal conviction while acknowledging that \u201c[t]hey are only ever an informed opinion, and not an absolute scientific truth\u201d (see paragraph 32 above), the Court has already found that statements made by psychiatric experts at an Assize Court trial form only one part of the evidence submitted to the jury (see Bernard, cited above, \u00a7 40). Accordingly, the fact that the jury did not indicate the reasons that prompted it to adopt a view at variance with the psychiatric experts\u2019 final report in favour of the applicant was not capable of preventing her from understanding, as noted above, the decision to find her criminally responsible.",

This serves to confirm that while the trial hearing undeniably forms the crucial part of criminal proceedings, in the present case the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt and criminal responsibility was a central focus of the trial. Accordingly, the about-turn performed by the same experts during the trial, following the discovery of new evidence, in finding that the applicant had not been criminally responsible at the time of the events (and, consequently, the unanimous view shared by all the experts on this point) was indisputably a fundamental aspect of the trial.",

In any event, the sentencing process was not an occasion to deal with the \u2013 separate \u2013 issue of guilt and criminal responsibility.
