The District Court noted that it was the investigator\u2019s right and not obligation to arrest a person, and that he had the right to do so also after the necessary investigative steps had been performed and the relevant circumstances clarified, provided that there were grounds set forth in Article 106 of the CCP for taking such a decision. It was further established by the District Court, on the basis of the police station logbook, that the applicant had arrived at the police premises at 3\u00a0p.m. on 31 March 2010 to give a statement; that he had deliberately left the police premises; and that on 7.30 p.m. had again been taken to the police station with a view to obtaining the \u201cexplanations\u201d. It thus concluded that starting from 3.30 p.m. his freedom of movement had not been limited in any way, and that he had been effectively deprived of his liberty at 12.25\u00a0a.m. on 1 April 2010 by the investigator\u2019s decision.

Furthermore, despite the seriousness of the injuries caused to the applicant, he was not provided with immediate medical assistance. In these circumstances his physical pain associated with the above injury must have been exacerbated by feelings of helplessness, acute stress and anxiety.

However, it does not perceive any legal basis for delaying such formalisation \u2013 in the present circumstances in the chosen form of detention on the basis of an investigator\u2019s decision \u2013 after the applicant had been deprived of his liberty for the second time on 31 March 2010. No arguments have been advanced or evidence provided by the Government in this connection. It is also worth noting that between 7.30 p.m. on 31 March 2010 and 12.25 a.m. on 1 April 2010 the applicant was interviewed by the police about his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and was subjected to torture in order to force him to confess to that offence (see paragraph 79 above).",
