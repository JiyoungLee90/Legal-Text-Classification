The removal of M.N. from the scene of the crime and his being placed amongst the nearby greenery had been aimed at facilitating the access of the ambulance. The police officers had called the emergency services and D.I. had informed the police control centre, as suggested by the medical staff, that the cause of death could not be established (\u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u0440\u0442), but that it was possible that M.N. had been a drug addict. Given the circumstances, the prosecutor established that there was no evidence that the accused officers had taken any actions with the intention of obstructing the investigation or preventing the identity of the perpetrator from being discovered, or that they had concealed any evidence. On the contrary, they had taken all necessary measures to facilitate the determination of the perpetrator\u2019s identity. The incident had been reported to the local police station and the police control centre.

The charges brought against Z.J., P.K., V.B. and D.I. had concerned an alleged abuse of office, failure to report a crime or an offender, and assisting an offender after the commission of a crime. Those charges had concerned alleged actions or omissions on the part of the defendants, which had not affected the investigation into M.N.\u2019s death. The offences with which those defendants had been charged had not been decisive for the identification and punishment of I.S., whom the courts had found responsible for M.N.\u2019s death. Lastly, the Government sought that the Court did not take the additional evidence submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 26 above) into consideration since it was neither submitted to any domestic authority nor have its authenticity and veracity been verified.",

That Article imposed a duty on the State to carry out an effective investigation into allegations of abuse of power by the police \u2013 particularly if there was reasonable suspicion of accomplice liability, as in the present case. There had been serious shortcomings in the investigation, which had affected the determination of the circumstances that had led to M.N.\u2019s killing and the role of Z.J., P.K., V.B. and D.I. The effect of those shortcomings on the effectiveness of the investigation could have been established only in adversarial judicial proceedings. Therefore, the charges brought against those persons were to be considered as falling within the ambit of the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention. This was so since the procedural obligation concerned not only the direct perpetrator of the crime (I.S.), but also the other four persons who had allegedly acted as accomplices by helping I.S. avoid criminal liability and obstructing the investigation.",

On 7 June 2011 I.S. reported to a police station and an identification parade was held. The investigating judge remanded I.S. in custody. On 8 June 2011 the public prosecutor requested that an investigation be opened into the incident. On 15 June 2011 the Ministry dismissed I.S. from his employment. In October 2011 the public prosecutor indicted I.S. On 16 January 2012 the trial court convicted I.S. of murder and sentenced him to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment, having determined that I.S. had inflicted on M.N. numerous severe bodily injuries, which had resulted in his death.

In this regard, the Court emphasises that the applicant\u2019s allegations concerned actions or omissions on the part of the four persons concerned after I.S. had already killed M.N. No allegation was made, either to the domestic authorities or the Court, that any other person (including the four persons concerned) had been involved, in any capacity, in the killing of the applicant\u2019s son. For those reasons, the present case is distinct from the Enukidze and Girgvliani case, which concerned the failure of the authorities to investigate credible allegations of complicity between the direct perpetrators and high-ranking police officials regarding the killing of the applicants\u2019 son (see Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, no. 25091/07, 26\u00a0April 2011). Although the Court emphasises the importance of the adequate investigation of any crime, it considers that the investigation into the allegations brought against Z.J., P.K., V.B. and D.I. did not have a material bearing to the detriment of the effectiveness of the investigation into the death of the applicant\u2019s son for the purpose of Article 2 of the Convention. Similar considerations apply to the additional evidence submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 26 above), the use of which was contested by the Government (see paragraph 45 above).
