Moreover, the Government observed that no standard of \u201creal hope\u201d had been set by the Court\u2019s case-law, according to which only a hope, but not the certainty, of obtaining release was required.

They referred to Kafkaris (cited above), arguing that it was the question as to whether a life prisoner can be said to have any prospect of release that had to be ascertained in determining whether a life sentence could be regarded as irreducible.",

Each of those requests was duly and individually considered, taking into account a great variety of factors which were likely to affect the decision. In determining whether the applicant\u2019s life sentence was reducible, it was not the level of probability of the favourable outcome of the pardon proceedings but rather the availability of such proceedings (being always necessarily of a discretionary nature) that was decisive: in particular, whether there was any authority having the power to reduce the applicant\u2019s life sentence when penological grounds no longer justify his detention and whether he could apply to the authority for a decision. They submitted that these conditions were met in the present case and therefore the applicant\u2019s life sentence was reducible.",

In this regard, they submitted that the applicant had so far served less than ten years of his sentence, which was much less than the statutory minimum period to be served of a life sentence before becoming eligible for parole. Offences such as those committed by the applicant, if they did not attract a life sentence, would normally entail a substantial sentence of imprisonment, perhaps of several decades, in any legal system. Therefore, any defendant who was convicted of such an offence must expect to serve a significant number of years in prison before he could realistically have any hope of release. Accordingly, in the Government\u2019s opinion, the irreducibility of a life sentence imposed after due consideration of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, as in the present case, would raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention only when it is shown that the applicant\u2019s continued imprisonment can no longer be justified on any legitimate penological grounds (such as punishment, deterrence, public protection or rehabilitation), which was not the case in the applicant\u2019s situation.",

In this regard, they disputed the conclusion of the T\u00f6rk\u00f6ly case which suggested that requests for pardon were duly and individually considered.

No issue arises under Article 3 if a life sentence is de iure and de facto reducible (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a098). In this respect, the Court would emphasise that no Article 3 issue could arise if, for instance, a life prisoner had the right under domestic law to be considered for release but this was refused on the ground that he or she continued to pose a danger to society. This is because States have a duty under the Convention to take measures for the protection of the public from violent crime and the Convention does not prohibit States from subjecting a person convicted of a serious crime to an indeterminate sentence allowing for the offender\u2019s continued detention where necessary for the protection of the public (see, mutatis mutandis, T. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 97; and \nV. v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 98, both cited above). Indeed, preventing a criminal from re-offending is one of the \u201cessential functions\u201d of a prison sentence (see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a037703/97, \u00a7 72, ECHR\u00a02002\u2011VIII; Maiorano and Others v.

This is particularly so for those convicted of murder or other serious offences against the person. The mere fact that such prisoners may already have served a long period of imprisonment does not weaken the State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the public; States may fulfil that obligation by continuing to detain such life sentenced prisoners for as long as they remain dangerous (see, for instance, Maiorano and Others, cited above).",

Where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3 (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 98). Article 3 must be interpreted as requiring reducibility of the sentence, in the sense of a review which allows the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (see Vinter, cited above, \u00a7 119).",

This would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A\u00a0whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration (see Vinter, cited above, \u00a7 122).",

The applicant has been convicted of many serious offences, including three homicides, robberies, infringements of personal liberty and assaults causing grievous bodily harm. In these circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate to make an award for non-pecuniary damage. In my view, the Court\u2019s finding constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for the violation of the reasonable-time requirement, too.",
