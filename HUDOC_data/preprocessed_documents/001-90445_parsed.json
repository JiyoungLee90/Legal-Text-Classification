In this connection the Court notes that the judgment of 2 October 1997, as upheld on 4 April 2000, expressly ordered the Ministry of Interior to deliver the vehicle to the applicant in good working order (see paragraph 7 above). Although the appointed court expert established on 19 November 2004 that the vehicle had been repaired (see paragraph 13 above), this finding was refuted on 23 May 2006 when it was established that the vehicle still had some defects which had been present on 19 November 2004 as well (see paragraph 15 above).

The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s refusal to take delivery of the vehicle prior to 14 September 2006 cannot be held against him. It follows that the State continued to hold the applicant\u2019s vehicle until that date and that the period of delay from April 2000 until September 2006 was due to the failure of the State to secure that the applicant\u2019s vehicle was returned to him in good working order.",
