Accordingly, the Government proposed to deal with each of those periods separately, as, according to the Government, the Court has previously done, taking into account the type and stage of the proceedings, and/or the responsible authority. In that regard they referred to the Court's approach in the earlier cases Estrikh v. Latvia, no. 73819/01, \u00a7\u00a7 121-127, 18 January 2007; and Svipsta, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-90.

Even though in certain situations the Court has previously derogated from this principle (see the explanation in Svipsta, cited above, \u00a7 117, and the jurisprudence cited there), the Court sees no reason to do so in the present case.

As to the Government's allegation that the applicant had not complained about the decisions authorising his pre-trial detention in their entirety, but had merely singled out certain of those decisions, the Court notes that in his original application the applicant did in fact lodge general complaints, which concerned the nature of the domestic decisions generally, along with specific grievances about particular decisions.
