The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s main allegation pertaining to the method and manner of the strip-searches relates to the presence of other persons during those searches. In this respect, the Court notes that the Administrative District Court in the second round of proceedings called and questioned numerous witnesses who could attest to or rebut the applicant\u2019s allegations. A conclusion was drawn that the applicant had been subject to strip-searches in the presence of one inmate and at least one additional escorting officer on three occasions (on 9\u00a0December 2009, 8 and 11 June 2010). The remaining two searches (on 22\u00a0February and 8 June 2011), however, had not been carried out in the presence of other persons. Lastly, the Administrative District Court dismissed as unfounded the remaining allegations made by the applicant (the presence of female officers, being exposed to the court\u2019s staff and passers-by, unsanitary touching of his food). All these findings were subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 11-15 above). The Court cannot discern, and the applicant has not put forward, any convincing argument allowing it to disregard the findings of the domestic courts (see, for example, mutatis mutandis Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7\u00a0180, ECHR 2011 (extracts) as concerns the Court\u2019s reliance on the findings of domestic courts).",

Nor is there any cogent reason to disregard the domestic court\u2019s finding that there was no substance to the applicant\u2019s allegation that his food had been touched in an unsanitary manner. Lastly, it has not been alleged that the escorting officers derided or verbally abused the applicant during the searches. These elements allow the Court to distinguish the present case from other cases, where it has found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Vala\u0161inas v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 44558/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0117-118, ECHR 2001VIII, and Iwa\u0144czuk v.\u00a0Poland, no. 25196/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a058-60, 15 November 2001).",
