As in Sarban, the domestic courts limited themselves to paraphrasing the reasons for detention provided for by the Code of Criminal Procedure, without explaining how they applied in the applicant's case. The only exception was that they referred to the applicant's Romanian passport, which could have enabled him to abscond abroad, and his lack of a permanent job. However, the courts did not react in any way to the applicant's argument that both his Romanian and Moldovan passports could have been seized by the authorities if they had decided that this was necessary to prevent his absconding and that alternative preventive measures existed, some of which (for example, house arrest) provided virtually the same guarantees against absconding as pre-trial detention (see paragraph 17 above). Neither were any other factors in favour of the applicant's release examined, such as his appearance before the investigator at the latter's first request (see paragraph 7 above), despite an express requirement to do so under Article 176 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 26 above) and the applicant's reference to several prima facie relevant reasons against detention (see paragraph 12 above; see also Ambruszkiewicz\u00a0v. , no.\u00a038797/03, \u00a7\u00a033, 4 May 2006).
