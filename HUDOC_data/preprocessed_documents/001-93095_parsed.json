It is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law, and in particular, rules of a procedural nature, and the Court will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Toshev v. , no.\u00a056308/00, \u00a7\u00a058, 10 August 2006). The words \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 do not merely refer back to domestic law; they also relate to the quality of this law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a046295/99, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2002IV). Quality in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible and precise, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see, among others, Dougoz v. Greece, no.\u00a040907/98, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2001-II).",

In such a framework, several non-consecutive periods of detention within one set of criminal proceedings can be classified as \u201cpending investigation\u201d or \u201cpending trial\u201d, for instance when the trial judge returns the case to the prosecutor (see paragraph 58 above).

The remand judge did, however, refer to Article 237 of the CCrP, which required that after receipt of the case file from the judge the prosecutor should comply with his or her instructions within five days. This was not done in the present case. In the meantime, from 13 February to 29 May 2006 the applicant\u2019s case was neither with the trial judge nor with the prosecuting authority.

The case against him was particularly complex and was linked to more than thirty criminal files, including emerging episodes of criminal activity on the part of an organised group or a criminal gang. The decision to join various episodes was justified with a view to avoiding possible duplication of the proceedings. In total, the applicant and his co-accused were charged in relation to more than fifty episodes of criminal activities between 2002 and 2005 relating mainly to drug trafficking. The case file at the time of being studied by the accused was voluminous (4,500 pages). No less than one hundred persons were questioned as witnesses, including those residing or detained outside the Tomsk Region. Thirty complex forensic reports had been commissioned in the course of the proceedings. Moreover, there was a risk that the applicant would flee investigation and justice in view of the gravity of the charges against him for offences punishable with long custodial sentences. The courts had also taken into account that the applicant had no permanent place of residence in Tomsk or elsewhere in Russia; that he had German nationality; and that his place of residence and that of his relatives and friends, as well as his sources of income, were all located in . The courts had also had regard to the applicant\u2019s personality, in particular his involvement in drug trafficking and smuggling, and to the fact that he had set up and supervised the supply of drugs from Germany to  and was an active member of a criminal gang in the Tomsk Region. If at large, he could have put pressure on the co-accused or witnesses both before and during the trial. His previous criminal record (dealing in firearms) and his predisposition to criminal activity supported the argument that he could continue his criminal activities, if released. The courts had examined the arguments of the defence and had given reasoned decisions dismissing them. Less stringent preventive measures could not be applied in the absence of any permanent place of residence. Neither would financial sureties, whatever their value, be sufficient for securing the applicant\u2019s presence at the trial. Lastly, the authorities had displayed particular diligence in the conduct of the proceedings, while the applicant and his counsel had protracted the proceedings.",

However, the Court has repeatedly held that, although the gravity of the charges or the severity of the sentence faced is relevant in the assessment of the risk of an accused absconding, reoffending or obstructing justice, it cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. , no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080 and 81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

However, after the evidence has been collected, that ground becomes less justified.\u00a0In particular, as regards the risk of pressure being put on witnesses, the Court reiterates that for the domestic courts to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist during the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention, it did not suffice merely to refer to an abstract risk unsupported by any evidence. They should have analysed other pertinent factors, such as the advancement of the investigation or judicial proceedings, the applicant\u2019s personality, his behaviour before and after the arrest and any other specific indications justifying the fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by carrying out acts aimed at falsification or destruction of evidence or manipulation of witnesses (see W. v.

It thus appears that the domestic authorities had sufficient time to take statements from witnesses in a manner which could have excluded any doubt as to their veracity and would have eliminated the necessity to continue the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty on that ground (see, for similar reasoning, Solovyev v. Russia, no. 2708/02, \u00a7 115, 24 May 2007). Moreover, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in September 2007 (see paragraph 33 above). Thus, it may be assumed that the witnesses testifying in relation to the charges against the applicant had been examined by that date. However, no explanation was given as to why the alleged risk persisted. The Court observes that the national courts did not specify why such risk existed in relation to the applicant and did not exist in relation to the other detained or non-detained co-accused. Only two of four defendants, including the applicant and Z, were kept in detention throughout the investigation and pending the trial.

However, the danger of an accused absconding does not result just because it is possible or easy for him to cross the frontier: there must be a whole set of circumstances, such as, particularly, the lack of well-established ties in the country, which give reason to suppose that the consequences and hazards of flight will seem to him to be a lesser evil than continued imprisonment (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller\u00a0v. Austria, judgment of 10\u00a0November 1969, \u00a7\u00a015, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a09). It was not disputed that the applicant\u2019s German passport had expired and was not renewed. The applicant, who was also a Russian national, could only cross the Russian border with his Russian travel passport (see Lind, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a053 and 81). It appears that after his arrest the applicant had been divested of his documents, including his passport. In any event, the domestic authorities did not explain why the withdrawal of his Russian travel passport did not mitigate the risk of his absconding abroad.",

Estonia, no.\u00a055939/00, \u00a7\u00a064, 15\u00a0February 2005). As already stated, the risk of flight should be assessed with reference to various factors, especially those relating to the character of the person involved, his morals, his home, his occupation, his assets, his family ties and all kinds of links with the country in which he is being prosecuted (see Neumeister v. Austria, 27\u00a0June 1968, \u00a7\u00a010, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a08). Such risk necessarily decreases as the time spent in detention passes by for the probability that the length of detention on remand will be deducted from (or will count towards) the period of imprisonment which the person concerned may expect if convicted, is likely to make the prospect seem less awesome to him and reduce his temptation to flee (ibid.; see also paragraph 61 above).",

The reasons given for keeping the applicant in detention were that the circumstances previously referred to for justifying his detention still obtained, the fact that the defendants were studying the case file or that it was then impracticable to complete the trial within the relevant period (see paragraphs 20, 22 - 24 above). As regards the first point, the Court refers to its above analysis of the pre-trial remand orders. As to the second point, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant or his counsel studied the case file at the time could not justify the continued detention. Neither is the matter of when the trial will occur a relevant reason for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3: its second limb does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial (see McKay, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041).

In this connection, the Court considers that the remand orders contain no assessment of whether the danger that the applicant would avoid appearing at the trial by absconding was so substantial and persistent that it was necessary to dismiss as quite ineffective the taking of guarantees which under Article 5 \u00a7 3 may condition a grant of provisional release in order to reduce the risks which it entails.

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, if the detention is confirmed by a court it must be considered to be lawful and not arbitrary, even where an appeal is available (ibid.). Subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention (loc.\u00a0cit.). Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees.",

The drug trafficking charges concerned criminal activities within two regions and two types of drugs. The investigation was rendered difficult by the fact that certain witnesses were living in another region; the whereabouts of some of them were difficult to establish and they retracted their earlier statements. The case was returned to the prosecutor on three occasions. The applicant and his counsel delayed the proceedings, in particular when they studied the case for the second time between June and September 2006, and lodged unsubstantiated applications at the trial. Hearings were scheduled every month.",
