Such a natural family relationship is not terminated by reason of the fact that the parents separate or divorce, as a result of which the child ceases to live with one of its parents (see C\u0131l\u0131z v. the Netherlands, no. 29192/95, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2000VIII and the cases cited therein). Likewise, the Court considers that family life within the meaning of the same provision also exists between the second applicant Arma\u011fan and his sister Damla, with whom he lived in the same house until the divorce of his parents in 2000 (see, inter alia, Olsson\u00a0v.\u00a0Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 81, Series A no. 130).
