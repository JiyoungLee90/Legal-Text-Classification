That court\u2019s construction of the provisions of the new legislation was neither arbitrary nor ill-founded.

It stated, in particular, that the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of transitional provision no. 2, though justified on the facts, should not be considered the only construction possible. It also explained that the term \u201cinterposici\u00f3n\u201d used in transitional provision no. 2 referred to the entering of an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court and not the giving of notice of appeal to the Audiencia provincial. Consequently, the system prior to the amendment introduced by Law no. 10/92 applied to giving notice of appeal and the new system to entering an appeal. The Constitutional Court also referred to its settled case-law to the effect that the Constitution did not afford parties to proceedings any guarantee that the appeals system established by law would not be modified, so long as the parties\u2019 right to a \u201cfair hearing\u201d was not infringed and decisions declaring appeals inadmissible were not unjustified or ill-founded. Lastly, it pointed out with regard to transitional provisions that, in accordance with Article\u00a0117.3 of the Constitution, it was for the ordinary courts alone to determine the applicable rule. In conclusion, the Constitutional Court dismissed the amparo appeal.",

That provision also amended the Code of Civil Procedure but, unlike Law no. 10/92, provided: \u201cAfter the proceedings to which they refer have ended, appeals to the Supreme Court which have been entered (interpuestos) shall be conducted in accordance with the amendments made by this Law.\u201d In that case the appellants had given notice of appeal in accordance with the provisions of legislation previously in force and had then entered the appeal in accordance with the provisions of the new legislation, the substantive requirements of which were, however, no different from those of the earlier legislation. The Constitutional Court held that while the word \u201cinterponer\u201d appeared to refer to the formal entering of the appeal, the reference to the ending of the proceedings suggested, however, that the legislature\u2019s intention had not been to alter the rules applicable to appeals of which notice had been given but which had yet to be entered. The Constitutional Court held that the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that transitional provision could not be regarded as unfounded, still less as unreasonable, and that the decision as to which legislation governed the entering of the appeal \u2013 in that case the legislation previously in force \u2013 had not been deficient constitutionally.
