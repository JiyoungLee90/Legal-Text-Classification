The notion of determination of a civil right has an autonomous meaning according to the case-law. The fact that the Civil Code does not contain any provisions applicable to the matter is thus immaterial. In our view, the right to choose one's own residence is incontestably a civil right within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.",
