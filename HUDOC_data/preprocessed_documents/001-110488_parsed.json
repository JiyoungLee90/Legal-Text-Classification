In particular, the applicant produced a medical certificate delivered on 10\u00a0November 2005, a day after the incident. Admittedly, this certificate was not issued by a forensic expert and did not provide a detailed forensic description of the injuries or attempt to determine their cause using forensic methods. Nevertheless, it certified that the applicant had contusions of the left leg and left upper arm. Moreover, the day after, the applicant promptly lodged a criminal complaint which required the authorities to seek a proper forensic examination which would confirm the fact of the injuries. However, the official forensic examination was ordered and carried out in a very belated manner, twenty-one days after the alleged incident. Prompt forensic examination is crucial as signs of injury may often disappear rather quickly and certain injuries may heal within weeks or even a few days. It is for this reason that the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s arguments based on the belated forensic report of 1 December 2005, which concluded that it was impossible to determine whether the applicant had been injured on 9 November 2005 (see also paragraphs 58-59 below). In view of the above, the Court considers that the certificate of 10 November 2005, despite certain shortcomings, constitutes more reliable medical evidence than the forensic report of 1 December 2005 and that, for the purposes of the present complaint, its content is sufficient to conclude that the applicant suffered injuries to the left leg and left upper arm.",

In particular, on the tape recording C.M. himself admitted to other journalists that he had hit the applicant. The submitted photos also confirmed C.M.\u2019s presence at the place of the incident with a truncheon in his hand. In these circumstances, the Court does not see any contradiction or inconsistency in the applicant\u2019s submission that the injuries described in the medical certificate of 10\u00a0November 2005 were inflicted by the police on 9 November 2005. The concordant evidence produced before the Court is sufficient to establish at least a presumption of the fact that a policeman hit the applicant with a truncheon during the demonstration. In the Court\u2019s opinion, neither the Government in their submissions, nor the domestic authorities in their respective decisions, provided a convincing rebuttal of this presumption.",

It is undisputed that the applicant did not use violence against the police or pose a threat to them. Moreover, despite the Government\u2019s arguments to the contrary, it has not been convincingly established at the outcome of the criminal inquiry and other domestic proceedings that, by using the metal construction as a viewpoint, the applicant was actually creating serious danger for the people in the square and that the police had actually given him a warning in this respect and a reasonable opportunity to comply with it, prior to resorting to the use of force. In this connection, the Court also takes into account the applicant\u2019s submissions that the same metal construction had been used by journalists in the same manner and for the same purpose before. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the Government have not shown convincingly that the recourse to physical force against the applicant had been made strictly necessary by his own conduct.
