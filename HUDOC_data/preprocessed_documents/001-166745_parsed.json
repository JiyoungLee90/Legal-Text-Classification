Still, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide \u2013 to the greatest possible extent \u2013 some evidence in support of their complaints. The Court has considered as evidence in such situations, for example, written statements by fellow inmates or photographs provided by applicants in support of their allegations (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a032362/02, \u00a7 45, 20 May 2010, with further references, and Gavula v. Ukraine, no.\u00a052652/07, \u00a7 73, 16\u00a0May 2013). After the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce the relevant documents (see Korneykova and Korneykov v. Ukraine, no. 56660/12, \u00a7\u00a0133, 24 March 2016). A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see\u00a0Gubin v. Russia, no.\u00a08217/04, \u00a7 56, 17\u00a0June 2010, and Khudoyorov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7\u00a0113, ECHR 2005X (extracts)).",

At the same time, the Court takes note of the evidence submitted by the applicant (the statements of his cellmates and photographs), which shows that at least some of the cells in which he was detained lacked space, were poorly lit and had inadequate sanitary arrangements (see paragraph\u00a065 above). Accordingly, it was for the Government to refute his allegations.

At the same time, regard being had to the length of the applicant\u2019s detention, the Court considers that the competent authorities should also have expressly adduced other reasons justifying holding him in custody during the entire period at issue (see Kobernik v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a045947/06, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, 25 July 2013). However, the seriousness of the charges remained the only ground relied on by the authorities in justification of the applicant\u2019s continued detention. The\u00a0Court also takes note of the absence of any reasoning at all for keeping that very restrictive measure against the applicant in the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling of 11 May 2006, by which the first-instance court\u2019s judgment was quashed (see paragraph\u00a042 above). Moreover, its later, similar ruling, of 8 April 2008, did not even mention the issue of preventive measures, while the applicant remained in detention thereafter (see paragraph\u00a044 above).",
