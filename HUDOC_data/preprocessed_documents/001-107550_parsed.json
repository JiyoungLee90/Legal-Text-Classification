The Court further notes that in the applicant\u2019s first communication, signed on 30 October 2007 and handed to the prison authorities on the following day, the applicant set out the facts of the case and his complaints in a rather detailed manner, his submissions comprising eleven pages of handwritten text. Although the applicant did not mention in that letter the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions referred to by the Government, he explicitly invoked his right to appeal against the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment and in substance complained that in his case his lawyers and a judge of the Court of Appeal had deprived him of that right.

A lawyer, even if officially appointed, cannot be considered to be an organ of the State. Given the independence of the legal profession from the State, the conduct of the case is essentially a matter between the defendant and his or her counsel, whether counsel be appointed under a legal-aid scheme or be privately financed, and, as such, cannot, other than in special circumstances, incur the State\u2019s liability under the Convention. The competent national authorities are required under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) to intervene only if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention in some other way (see Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, \u00a7 65, Series A no.\u00a0168; Daud v.

It will depend on the circumstances of the case whether the relevant authorities should take action (see Daud, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42) and whether, taking the proceedings as a whole, the legal representation may be regarded as \u201cpractical and effective\u201d (see Kulikowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a057; Sia\u0142kowska, cited above, \u00a7 100; Rutkowski v.

However, where such courts do exist, the guarantees of Article 6 must be complied with (see Delcourt v. , 17\u00a0January 1970, \u00a7 25, Series A no. 11). The manner in which this provision applies to courts of appeal or of cassation depends on the special features of the proceedings concerned and account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and the court of cassation\u2019s role in them. Given the special nature of the court of cassation\u2019s role, which is limited to reviewing whether the law has been correctly applied, the Court is able to accept that the procedure followed in such courts may be more formal (see Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos.\u00a032911/96, 35237/97 and 34595/97, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2002VII; Khalfaoui v.\u00a0France, no. 34791/97, \u00a7 37, ECHR 1999IX; Kulikowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059; and Sia\u0142kowska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104). Nevertheless, the Court has in several cases found that a particularly strict construction of procedural rules by the supreme or constitutional courts deprived applicants of their right of access to a court (see, among others, B\u011ble\u0161 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 69; Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7 55, ECHR\u00a02002IX; Efstathiou and Others v.

The supposition that the new lawyer was aware of the applicant\u2019s wish to appeal to the Supreme Court is supported by the original lawyer\u2019s statements to the Court of Honour of the Bar Association, in which he asserted that having received the telephone call from the applicant he had informed the new lawyer of the applicant\u2019s intention to appeal.

In the absence of such legislation or court practice, the Court does not consider that the applicant was required to try these remedies before lodging an application with it. Similarly, in the recent case of Metsaveer v. Estonia, which concerned civil proceedings, the Court noted that the Government had not referred to any case-law where after proceedings before the Court of Honour of the Bar Association the time-limit for filing an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court had been restored. In that context, and in the absence of any specific legal provisions which would have secured a person in receipt of legal aid access to the Supreme Court in the case of an omission by the legal-aid lawyer, the Court was not convinced of the effectiveness of the remedies proposed by the Government (see Metsaveer v. Estonia (dec.), no. 16343/07, 14 June 2011).",

It further notes that the parties\u2019 opinions differ as to the relevance of such a request. According to the applicant, a request for the reopening of proceedings could not replace an appeal in cassation because the legal grounds for reopening a case were much more limited and only on exceptional occasions had the Supreme Court dealt with the merits of such requests. In contrast, the Government referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law according to which it did not refuse to review a case on the merits if the person concerned had no other means of protecting his or her fundamental rights.",

It follows from the text of the law, as well as from the Supreme Court\u2019s practice, that a request for the reopening of a case is not meant to be an alternative to cassation proceedings, and the former appears to be limited to rather exceptional circumstances. While it is true that the Supreme Court has stated that it does not decline to accept petitions in circumstances where an applicant has no other effective procedure for the protection of his or her rights (see paragraphs  to  above), the fact remains that such cases are exceptional and cannot be considered part of the ordinary criminal proceedings. Moreover, the Court reiterates that according to its established case-law Article 6 does not apply to proceedings for the reopening of criminal proceedings (see, for example, X v. Austria, no. 7761/77, Commission decision of 8 May 1978, Decisions and Reports 14, p. 173; and, more recently, Trgo v. Croatia, no.\u00a035298/04, \u00a7\u00a070, 11 June 2009, and Vojta v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 25126/06, 8\u00a0February 2011), nor is it a remedy to be exhausted for the purposes of Article 35 of the Convention. The Court also takes note of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in case no. 3-1-2-3-09 where it was found that the existence of two divergent sets of operative provisions of a judgment were not grounds for the reopening of the proceedings, the originally delivered operative provisions being decisive (see paragraphs  and  above). Therefore, the Court cannot accept that filing a request for the reopening of the proceedings meant that the applicant was ensured effective access to the Supreme Court.",
