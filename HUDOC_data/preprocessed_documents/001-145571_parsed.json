Turkey, no.\u00a027872/03, \u00a7\u00a058, 13 October 2009). Instead, the applicant successfully applied to the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office urging him to lodge the request for the protection of legality (see paragraphs 39 and 50 above). She finally lodged her application to the Court after she had received the Supreme Court\u2019s negative decision of 8\u00a0February 2008 concerning the Prosecutor\u2019s request for the protection of legality. In this latter connection, the Court notes that the request for the protection of legality was admittedly of a discretionary character, and normally such a remedy is not considered to be effective (see Lepoji\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no.\u00a013909/05, \u00a7 54, 6 November 2007) and could not restart the running of the six-month limit (see, for example, Kucherenko v.\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0(dec.), no. 41974/98, 4 May 1999).

The applicant\u2019s complaint to the prosecutor, raising the substance of her complaint before this Court, was in fact successful: indeed, the Chief Public Prosecutor, as the most senior prosecutor, criticised in particularly strong terms the previous decisions of the domestic judicial bodies as wrong and arbitrary (see paragraph 40 above). It was thus perfectly reasonable for the applicant to await the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the prosecutor\u2019s request for the protection of legality, particularly in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s powers had that request been accepted (see paragraph 50 above). In that respect, it cannot be said that the applicant deliberately tried to defer the time-limit set in Article 35 \u00a7 1 by making use of inappropriate procedures which could offer her no effective redress for the complaint in issue under the Convention (compare and contrast Fernie v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a014881/04, 5 January 2006).",

While an official investigation and/or a criminal trial must be regarded as furnishing the strongest safeguards to provide protection under Article 2 in cases of intentional taking of life (see Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, \u00a7 165, ECHR 2011; McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a028883/95, \u00a7\u00a0134, ECHR 2001III; and Menson v. the United Kingdom\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a047916/99, ECHR 2003V), where the allegations raise issues of negligence, the procedural obligation may come into play upon the institution of proceedings by the deceased\u2019s relatives and a civil, administrative or even disciplinary remedy may be sufficient (see \u0160ilih, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0156 and the cases referred to therein; Calvelli and Ciglio v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a032967/96, \u00a7 51, ECHR\u00a02002I; and Powell v.\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a045305/99, 4 May 2000). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial (see Makaratzis v.\u00a0Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004XI).",

Namely, the 2004 report stated that Mr Dejan Petrovi\u0107 could have \u201csqueezed through\u201d the window and concluded that his injuries had been caused only by jumping out of the window and falling onto a hard surface, without providing any clarification on the feasibility of its final conclusion (see paragraph 29 above). In any event, the later report issued in 2006 confirmed that the injuries could have been caused by a fall from the second floor, but highlighted that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it was practically impossible for Mr Dejan Petrovi\u0107 to have broken through the window and jumped out of the police premises on his own; he could only have fallen through an open window (see paragraph 34 above).",

Having regard to the three contradictory forensic reports (the autopsy report being the third), none of the judicial bodies tried to summon the forensic experts or seek clarification of the remaining forensic inconsistencies, despite the obvious crucial importance of obtaining an answer to the question of whether it was possible for Mr\u00a0Dejan Petrovi\u0107 to have jumped out of the window. The District Court disregarded a significant inconsistency in the official version of the incident and the findings of both forensic reports by finding them consistent (see paragraph 37 above). The Supreme Court upheld this decision on appeal as clear, conclusive and convincing, selecting and referring only to the forensic findings of the 2004 report (see paragraph 38 above). Lastly, the Supreme Court, while deciding on the request for the protection of legality, appears to have accepted the police officers\u2019 version of the events to such an extent that it was prepared to omit to take into account any relevant element which did not corroborate it, as well as the highest prosecutor\u2019s criticism of the work of his inferiors (see paragraphs 40-41 above).
