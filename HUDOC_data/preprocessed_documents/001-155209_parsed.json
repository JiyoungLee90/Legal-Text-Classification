Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 35). The Court observes that the authorities disregarded two judicial decisions that were binding on them and persisted in enforcing their initial decision of 26 May 2007, which stated that the payment process could not be suspended in the event of an appeal by the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Georgoulis and Others v. Greece, no. 38752/04, \u00a7 25, 21 June 2007). By requiring the immediate payment of the sum of EUR 109,527, increased to EUR 112,155.69 with interest, the tax authorities imposed a disproportionate burden on the applicant.",
