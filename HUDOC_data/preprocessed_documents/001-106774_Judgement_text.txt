The case originated in an application (no. 23987/05) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Teresa Kowalczyk (“the applicant”), on 8 March 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr K. Dobrowolski, a lawyer practising in Zdunska Wola. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 25 March 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Zduńska Wola.
The applicant was made redundant and was dismissed by her employer, a State-owned company, in January 2001, together with a number of other persons.
By a decision of 4 January 2001, the  granted her a pre-retirement benefit in an amount equivalent to 120 per cent of a basic unemployment benefit as applicable at that time. Other persons made redundant at the same time received identical benefits.
Before the applicant had been made redundant, a number of meetings were organised by the local labour administration in Zduńska Wola to address the situation of the employees who had been dismissed, all of whom had worked in the same factory. There has been uncertainty at that time as to how the legal provisions of the 1994 Employment and Combating Unemployment Act (ustawa o zatrudnieniu i przeciwdziałaniu bezrobociu) concerning the determination of the amount of the pre-retirement benefit for persons living in municipalities with structural unemployment should be interpreted. The applicant maintains that she and other dismissed persons were repeatedly told by various officials that in their situation it was useless to appeal to the administrative courts regarding the amount of the benefit. Subsequently, six of the applicant’s former co-workers appealed, but the applicant did not. In August and September 2002 the  quashed decisions awarding 120 per cent to those employees and remitted the cases.
Shortly afterwards, on 21 October 2002, the Supreme Administrative Court sitting as a full bench of seven judges and having regard to serious difficulties arising in connection with the determination of the amounts of pre-retirement benefit due to persons dismissed within the framework of large-scale redundancies in municipalities affected by structural unemployment, issued a resolution aimed at clarifying these difficulties and resolving the jurisprudential conflicts. The court held that the dismissed persons were entitled to 160 per cent of the basic benefit only when they had been made redundant by the same employer in the context of redundancies exceeding 100 persons; not when the number of dismissed persons exceeded 100 in a given municipality as a whole, as the competent authorities had tended to interpret this provision previously.
Subsequently, decisions were given by the local administration that the six appellants were entitled to 160 per cent of the basic unemployment benefit.
On 3 June 2003 the applicant requested the competent municipal authority to amend the decision given in her case on 4 January 2001 (see paragraph 6 above). She complained that she had obtained much lower unemployment benefit than her colleagues who had been dismissed from the same factory and who had been in an identical factual and legal situation.
On 25 June 2003 the Zduńska Wola Starosta refused to amend the contested decision. It held that in the light of the 2002 resolution of the  the relevant provisions gave the applicant a right to obtain only 120 per cent of the basic benefit. The secondinstance authority upheld this decision. The applicant appealed to the Łódź . She reiterated her complaint that she had been denied a pre-retirement benefit in the amount obtained by her colleagues who had been in an identical legal and factual situation.
The Łódź , in its judgment of 7 July 2004, dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding that the impugned decision of the appellate authority was in compliance with the applicable laws. It referred to the Supreme Administrative Court’s resolution given in October 2002. It held that under that resolution it had become clear that a higher pre-retirement benefit was available only to persons who had lost their employment as a result of dismissals of over one hundred persons by one employer during a period of three months preceding the party’s dismissal; not when the number of persons dismissed by all employers in a given municipality throughout the same period had exceeded one hundred.
On 27 July 2004 the applicant requested legal aid for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal with the . On 24 August 2004 the court granted her request. On 17 September 2004 the Regional Bar assigned an advocate to the applicant’s case. On 29 September the applicant gave him a power of attorney.
The judgment with its written grounds was served on the applicant on 14 September 2004. It was on that date that the thirty-day time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal with the  started to run.
By a letter of 6 October 2004 the assigned lawyer informed the applicant that he had found no grounds on which a cassation appeal could be filed in her case and he refused to prepare such an appeal.
The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Administrative Court against judgments of the Regional Administrative Courts are stated in the Court’s judgment in the case of Subicka v. Poland, no. 29342/06, §§ 1221, 14 September 2010.
In particular, in its decision no. II FZ 651/07 of 18 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the time-limit by a legally-aided applicant could be admitted for examination.
When legal aid has been granted and the time-limit for the submission of a cassation appeal has already expired, it is open to the legally-aided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time under sections 86 and 87 of the Law on the Procedure before Administrative Courts (e.g. NSA FZ 754/04 of 31 January 2005 and NSA, I OZ 160/08 of 14 March 2008). In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within seven days from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party, which date is considered as the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist (e.g. the Białystok Regional Administrative Court, II SAB Bk 27/07 of 10 April 2008), or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file (e.g. the Poznań Regional Administrative Court, IV SA/Po 865/06 of 13 November 2007).
In a number of its recent decisions the  acknowledged the difficulties which legally-aided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first-instance administrative courts. It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough. It analysed relevant case-law of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which the beginning of the time-limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results. It held that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme and by privately hired lawyers. The court held that the time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal-aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal-aid system illusory. In any event, the cassation appeal had to be lodged within thirty days from the day on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal-aid lawyer (I FZ 569/06 of 8 December 2006; I FZ 667/06 of 15 January 2007; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2007; II FZ 177/08 of 25 June 2008; II OZ 513/08 of 27 May 2008; I OZ 376/08 of 13 June 2008; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009; II OZ 1093/09 of 9 December 2009; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009).
