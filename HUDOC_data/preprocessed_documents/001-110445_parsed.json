Switzerland (15 June 1992, Series A no. 238), the Government argued that the Convention does not preclude the use of statements by witnesses who have only been interviewed by investigating authorities and whose appearance before a trial court cannot be obtained. The Government further turned to the assessment of the circumstances in the present case. In particular, they stated that the applicant was responsible for the investigating authorities\u2019 inability to set up confrontation interviews with the witnesses, as he had absconded and left . The applicant had asked for an opportunity to question the prosecution witnesses only after the criminal case against him had been opened in the . The Government stressed that the Russian authorities had taken every reasonable step to obtain attendance by the witnesses. They had sent requests for legal assistance to Uzbek officials, asking for the witnesses to be summoned. However, the witnesses had been unable to attend, for family or health reasons. The whereabouts of one witness had been unknown. Given the fact that it had taken the Russian officials almost six months to settle the issue of the witnesses\u2019 attendance, the Government considered it logical that the Ivanovo Regional Court had accepted a request from the prosecution for reading out of the pre-trial statements, despite the applicant\u2019s and his lawyer\u2019s objections.

On this point, the Court reiterates its constant caselaw that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial, including the right to examine or have examined witnesses testifying against him (see Hermi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2006XII, with further references, and, more recently, Vozhigov v. Russia, no. 5953/02, \u00a7 57, 26 April 2007). However, a waiver must not run counter to any important public interest, must be established in an unequivocal manner and requires minimum guarantees commensurate to the waiver\u2019s importance (see Blake v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 68890/01, \u00a7 127, 26 September 2006).",

It is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument that if the applicant had stayed in  he could have had an opportunity to take part in confrontation interviews with the prosecution witnesses, and there could accordingly have been no issue as regards the witnesses\u2019 absence from the trial. Firstly, the Court reiterates that the very fact of the participation of an accused person in confrontation interviews with witnesses during the pretrial stage cannot of itself strip him or her of the right to have those witnesses examined in court (see Melnikov v. Russia, no. 23610/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07981, 14 January 2010). Should it be otherwise, prosecution authorities would be left with virtually unlimited powers and would replace courts in their truth-finding function, with the fundamental requirement for a fair trial having little reality or worth. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, there can be no question of waiver by the mere fact that an individual could have avoided, by acting diligently, the situation that led to the impairment of his rights. The conclusion is more salient in a case of a person without sufficient knowledge of his prosecution and of the charges against him and without the benefit of legal advice to be cautioned on the course of his actions, including on the possibility of his conduct being interpreted as an implied waiver of his fair trial rights. The Court reiterates that the applicant was only notified in person of the criminal proceedings against him upon his arrest in  in November 2003. It thus could not be inferred merely from his status as a fugitive from justice, which was founded on a presumption with an insufficient factual basis, that he had waived his right to a fair trial (see Sejdovic v.  [GC], no. 56581/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a099-101, ECHR\u00a02006II).",

Before an accused can be said to have implicitly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Talat Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 32432/96, 27\u00a0March 2007, \u00a7\u00a059, and Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30900/02, 9 September 2003). It is not to be ruled out that, after initially being advised of his rights, an accused may himself validly renounce them and agree to proceed with the trial without, for instance, being afforded an opportunity to examine witnesses against him. The Court, however, considers that the right to confront witnesses, being a fundamental right among those which constitute the notion of fair trial, is an example of the rights which require the special protection of the knowing and intelligent waiver standard. The Court is not satisfied that sufficient safeguards were in place in the present case for it to be considered that the applicant had decided to relinquish his right. There is no reason to conclude that the applicant should have been fully aware that by leaving Uzbekistan he was abandoning his right to confront witnesses, or, for that matter, that he understood the nature of that right and could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Bonev v. , no.\u00a060018/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 8\u00a0June 2006, with further references, and Bocos-Cuesta v. the , no. 54789/00, \u00a7 66, 10 November 2005).",

France, 20\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7 43, Series A no. 261-C, and A.M. v. Italy, no.\u00a037019/97, \u00a7 25, ECHR 1999-IX).

The Court, however, notes that the  did not have information explaining the reason for the absence of five of the eleven witnesses from the prosecution list. In fact, the trial court was not even aware whether the witnesses had been summoned (see paragraphs 20 and 23 above). It also appears that it never received a response from the Uzbek authorities regarding Mr A.\u2019s attendance. The , nevertheless, proceeded with the reading out of the depositions by those five witnesses and Mr A., having noted that attempts to obtain their presence had already taken six months (see paragraph 23 above). While the Court is not unmindful of the domestic courts\u2019 obligation to secure the proper conduct of the trial and avoid undue delays in the criminal proceedings, it does not consider that a stay in the proceedings for the purpose of obtaining witnesses\u2019 testimony or at least clarifying the issue of their appearance at the trial, in which the applicant stood accused of a very serious offence and was risking a lengthy prison term, would have constituted an insuperable obstacle to the expediency of the proceedings at hand (see Vladimir\u00a0Romanov v. , no. 41461/02, \u00a7 104, 24 July 2008, with further references, and, most recently, Krivoshapkin v. , no.\u00a042224/02, \u00a7 60, 27\u00a0January 2011). The authorities chose to eschew that stay. As a result, those witnesses never appeared to testify before a court in the presence of the applicant.",

Regard being had to the circumstances of the case, the Court has serious doubts that the decision to accept the explanations and to excuse the witnesses could indeed be accepted as warranted. It considers that the Regional Court\u2019s review of the reasons for the witnesses\u2019 absence was not convincing. Whilst such reasons as inability to bear the costs of travel to , poor health or a difficult family situation are relevant, the trial court did not go into the specific circumstances of the situation of each witness, and failed to examine whether any alternative means of securing their depositions in person would have been possible and sufficient. It also does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that under the relevant provisions of the Russian law witnesses were afforded a right to claim reimbursement of costs and expenses, including those of travel, incurred as a result of their participation in criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 35 and 37 above). The Court reiterates that paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the State to take positive steps, in particular to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him. Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States must exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2001-VIII). The Court is concerned with the Regional Court\u2019s failure to look beyond the ordinary means of securing the right of the defence to cross-examine witnesses, for instance by setting up a meeting between the applicant\u2019s lawyer and witnesses in Uzbekistan (see paragraph 34 above and, mutatis mutandis, Mirilashvili v.\u00a0Russia, no. 6293/04, \u00a7 223, 11\u00a0December 2008) or using modern means of audio-visual communication to afford the defence an opportunity to put questions to the witnesses. Furthermore, while the Court understands the difficulties encountered by the authorities in terms of resources, it does not consider that reimbursing travel costs and expenses to the key witnesses for them to appear before the trial court would have constituted an insuperable obstacle (see Krivoshapkin, cited above, \u00a7 60, with further references). Having regard to the above considerations, the Court finds that the decision to excuse witnesses from appearing was not sufficiently convincing, and that the authorities failed to take reasonable measures to secure their attendance at the trial.",

The Court finds it of relevance that the applicant was never provided with an opportunity to follow up the manner in which the witnesses had been questioned by the investigator or to test the credibility of his accusers and the reliability of their statements during a face-to-face confrontation. Furthermore, as the witnesses\u2019 statements to the investigator were not recorded on video, neither the applicant nor the jury was able to observe their demeanour under questioning and thus form their own impression of their reliability (see, a\u00a0contrario, Accardi and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 30598/02, ECHR\u00a02005II). The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts undertook a careful examination of the witnesses\u2019 statements, took into account the fact that they had not changed their account of events, and gave the applicant an opportunity to contest them at the trial, but this can scarcely be regarded as a proper substitute for a personal observation of the leading witnesses giving oral evidence (see Vladimir Romanov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0105).",
