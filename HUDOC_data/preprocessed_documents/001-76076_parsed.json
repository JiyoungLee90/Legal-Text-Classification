In this respect the Government submitted a copy of a judgment by the Vilnius Regional Court of 7 June 2005 whereby a former suspect had been awarded damages under this provision for the excessive length of criminal proceedings which had been instituted on 11 May 2001 and discontinued on 1 March 2004.

Poland, no. 15212/03, \u00a7\u00a7 31-43, 1 March 2005; also see, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 140-149). However, the measure indicated by the Government - a claim for damages under Article 6.272 of the Civil Code - does not satisfy the test of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d for the following reasons. Firstly, the remedy suggested is based on a provision of the Civil Code which became effective on 1 July 2001, while the first established example of the relevant domestic case-law in this respect dates from June 2005. There is no indication that such a remedy was available to the applicant, at least in theory, at the initial stage of the impugned criminal proceedings, which were instituted in 1999. Nor has it been proved that Article 6.272 of the new Civil Code can be applied retroactively to delays which occurred prior to its entry into effect (see, by contrast, the Charzynski decision cited above, \u00a7 37). Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the applicant can use such a remedy in relation to proceedings which are still pending, given the relevance of the statutory time bar in establishing a posteriori the excessive length of proceedings in the case cited by the Government. Therefore, this part of the application cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In particular, the Court observes that the detention was imposed as the applicant had failed to appear at a trial hearing, but the order was lifted when the applicant\u2019s absence was found by the appeal court to have been justified as a result of his illness. It has not been alleged that the first instance lacked jurisdiction, or indeed that it acted in bad faith or arbitrarily.
