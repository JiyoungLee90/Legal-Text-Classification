(no. 2), no. 12316/04, \u00a7 26, 18 October 2007; and Vokoun v. the Czech Republic, no. 20728/05, \u00a7 26, 3 July 2008).",

It is for the parties to the case to judge whether or not a\u00a0document calls for their comments (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7 29; Milatov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7 65; and Gaspari v. Slovenia, no. 21055/03, \u00a7 52, 21\u00a0July 2009).\u00a0What is particularly at stake here is litigants' confidence in the workings of justice, which is based on the knowledge that they have had the opportunity to express their views on every document in the file (see Nider\u00f6st-Huber, cited above, \u00a7 29; and Asnar, cited above, \u00a7 25). Accordingly, the Court has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 even where the unseen observations were favourable to the applicant (G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2002V). However, the Court has in the past found that the non-communication of written observations or documents in the proceedings and the impossibility for the applicant to comment on them did not constitute a violation of the right to a\u00a0fair hearing. In its reasoning, the Court explained that, in the particular cases in question, granting to the applicant such rights and opportunities would have had no effect on the outcome of the proceedings as the legal approach adopted was not open to discussion (see, for example, Stepinska v. , no. 1814/02, \u00a7 18, 15\u00a0June 2004; Sale v.

However, the observations in question constituted the plaintiffs' views on the applicants' appeal and thus manifestly aimed to influence the decision of the Supreme Court by calling for the appeal to be dismissed. The applicants clearly had an interest in receiving a copy of the written observations of the plaintiffs and, if appropriate, seeking to make comments on those observations.",

Stepinska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10 and 18; and Sale, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 17 to 19). Accordingly it cannot be said that the plaintiffs' observations on the merits of the appeal could have no impact on the outcome of the litigation. The Court further considers irrelevant the fact that, in the Government's submission, no new matters were raised in the plaintiffs' observations to the Supreme Court. The requirement that parties to court proceedings have the opportunity to have knowledge of, and to\u00a0comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed in their case applies to appeal proceedings as well as to proceedings at first instance, notwithstanding the fact that the appeal may raise no new arguments. Finally, the Court does not consider that there is any reason to distinguish between cases where the non-communicated observations are submitted by a State authority and those where they are submitted by a private individual. As noted above, the importance of the requirement that observations be communicated to all parties to the proceedings lies in the need to ensure that parties have confidence in the workings of justice and that they have not been denied the opportunity to comment on matters which may have influenced the judgment of the court. The onus was on the Supreme Court to afford the applicants an opportunity to comment on the written observations prior to its decision.",
