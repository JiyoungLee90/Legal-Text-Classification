In particular, the issue is whether the investigating and prosecuting authorities directed enough effort towards identifying who had committed the rape, or whether they failed to follow an obvious line of inquiry resulting from the DNA evidence in the case.",

Predictably, though, none of the new steps taken by the investigator had led to any fresh leads about the identity of the alleged rapist. It remained the case that the evidence available \u2013 including the statements of Mr X\u2019s partner and friend and those of the police officers who had worked on the case \u2013 did not implicate Mr X and indeed even confirmed his alibi. There was still not enough evidence to implicate Mr Z either, for the same reasons as those given in the earlier decision to suspend the investigation (see paragraph 37 above), or to charge anyone else. It was thus still appropriate to suspend the investigation pursuant to Article 244 \u00a7 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 60 below), and instruct the police to keep up their efforts to identify the assailant.",

The Court has consistently held that when examining a complaint it can take into account facts \u2013 such as the second suspension decision in the present case \u2013 which have occurred after the lodging of the application but are directly related to those covered by it (see St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v.

It is true that the suspension did not formally discontinue the investigation, and that the police could still continue with their inquiries about the identity of the alleged rapist even after the suspension (see paragraph 61 above).

Despite their sustained efforts, the authorities had been unable to positively identify the assailant. The person the applicant had identified following a parade, Mr X, had had an alibi, and her assertions in relation to him could not be considered fully credible. The authorities had also sought to establish whether the person whose DNA had been found on the applicant\u2019s briefs, Mr Z, could be the assailant, but had been unable to find any other evidence to that effect, and both the applicant and Mr Z had denied that possibility. The DNA evidence alone was insufficient to reach the conclusion that Mr Z had been the assailant. For all those reasons, the prosecuting authorities had opted to suspend the investigation rather than bring charges. After that decision had been overruled, the investigating authorities had fully complied with the instructions given by the court, and the prosecutor\u2019s second suspension decision had been upheld.

They also promptly obtained physical evidence from the applicant: clothes and swabs (see paragraphs 6 in fine and 10 above). The applicant was then rapidly given a medical examination, which corroborated her assertions that she had been attacked and had suffered non-consensual vaginal penetration (see paragraph 8 above). The next morning she was formally interviewed and gave a description of the alleged assailant, which enabled the police to identify a potential suspect \u2013 Mr X \u2013 and organise an identity parade with his participation four days later (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). Five days later the investigator in charge of the case obtained a psychiatric and psychological report on the applicant\u2019s competence as a witness (see paragraph 12 above).",

It is also true that when the applicant was, over a year later, presented with a photograph album containing a picture of Mr Z, she did not identify him as her assailant (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above). But at that stage the investigator already had expert evidence throwing doubt on the reliability of the applicant\u2019s identification of her assailant (see paragraphs\u00a012 and 24 above). The investigator also appeared to doubt the applicant\u2019s ability to have properly made out the physical features of her assailant (see paragraphs 12, 17 and 23 in fine above); this assessment was shared by the prosecutor (see paragraph 34 above).

The prosecutor, in his decision to instead suspend the investigation, while analysing in considerable detail the evidence in relation to the person identified by the applicant during the parade, Mr X, paid scant attention to the available evidence concerning Mr\u00a0Z. He was content to record that the applicant had not named him as the assailant, that he himself had also denied this, and that there was no evidence to that effect apart from the DNA evidence (see paragraph 37 above). It is particularly striking that the prosecutor analysed in depth the applicant\u2019s unreliability as a witness in relation to Mr X (see paragraph 34 above), while at the same time taking her statements with respect to Mr Z at face value, even though there were doubts about the applicant\u2019s ability to have properly made out the physical features of her assailant, and despite the DNA evidence \u2013 which, as a rule, has very high probative value. It is also notable that the prosecutor did not try to analyse whether Mr Z\u2019s statement, which likewise ran against the DNA evidence, was credible and instead chose to believe it fully, without explaining why.

But the obligation to investigate effectively is not limited to responding to assertions and specific requests by the alleged victim. Indeed, the Court has held, albeit in somewhat different contexts, that such a requirement is inherent in the authorities\u2019 procedural obligations and does not depend on the initiative of a complainant to take responsibility for the conduct of investigatory procedures (see Bouyid v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2015; C.N. v. the United Kingdom, no. 4239/08, \u00a7 69, 13 November 2012; and L.E. v.

It should also be emphasised in this connection that it is not for the Court, which cannot act as a domestic criminal court or a court of appeal from the national courts, to express a view on whether or not Mr Z had any role in the alleged assault on the applicant, make any findings about the evidence in that regard, or give a ruling on any points of criminal liability, those all being matters for the competent domestic authorities. In particular, nothing in the present analysis should be taken to imply that Mr Z is guilty of the alleged assault. The Court\u2019s task is limited to examining the effectiveness of the investigation, and it finds that the authorities\u2019 failure to make a serious attempt to clear up the above-mentioned discrepancies, which \u2013 in view of the DNA evidence \u2013 were central to the case, was not simply an isolated error but a significant shortcoming which undermined the adequacy of the investigation.",
