The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), 26 October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85). The Court finds that this principle also applies in the present case, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government must secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the judgment of 14 December 1995, namely the employment of the applicant with the Financial Control Office and to pay him damages, in the conditions provided by that judgment.",

In general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention (see Shofman v.\u00a0Russia, no. 74826/01, \u00a7 53, 24 November 2005, with further references). By finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case, the Court has established the Government's obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant's individual situation, that is, to ensure compliance with the applicant's enforceable claim under the judgment of 14\u00a0December 1995 (compare with Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2005-...). Whether this involves employing the applicant in the job provided by that judgment or in an equivalent job or, if this is not possible, granting him reasonable compensation for non-enforcement, or a combination of these and other measures, is a decision that falls to the respondent State (see Tarverdiyev v. Azerbaijan, no. 33343/03, \u00a7 66, 26 July 2007, and Ursan v. , no. 35852/04, \u00a7 46, 6 April 2010). The Court, however, emphasises that any measures adopted must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 202, ECHR 2004-II, with further references).",

Moreover, the applicant has received salary as ordered by the judgment of 9 November 1992. In any event, the question of whether the applicant would have been able to obtain the amounts alleged in respect of pecuniary damage, had the national authorities properly enforced the judgments in his favour, is a matter of speculation in the circumstances of the case (see Sacaleanu, \u00a7 72, and Strungariu, \u00a7 54, cited above).
