The case-file material indicates that, even though he was not formally a suspect until the next day, 23 July, by the end of the police interviews on 22 July, the authorities apparently already had sufficient grounds to suspect him of the attack on the victim (see, in particular, the relevant elements in the trial court\u2019s judgment at paragraph 18 (iii) and (v) above). The police nevertheless proceeded to interview him without advising him of his right to consult a lawyer. The Court is conscious of the fact that the applicant\u2019s statement made on that occasion played no role in his conviction and, despite the fact that it was made at an early stage of the proceedings, it does not appear that it provided the authorities with the narrative of what happened or framed the process of evidence gathering (see Artur Parkhomenko v. Ukraine, no. 40464/05, \u00a7 87, 16 February 2017, and contrast Ibrahim, cited above, \u00a7 309). Moreover, the applicant never retracted that initial account (compare Bandaletov v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a023180/06, \u00a7 67, 31 October 2013), but maintained it throughout the proceedings (compare Zherdev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a034015/07, \u00a7\u00a0167, 27 April 2017). Be that as it may, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine in detail the impact of that statement, taken separately, on the overall fairness of the proceedings. It is sufficient for the Court to observe that that limitation of the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance at the early stage of the proceedings should be seen in combination with the limitation of the same right at the stage of appeal. In neither instance did the domestic authorities indicate any reasons for those limitations.",
