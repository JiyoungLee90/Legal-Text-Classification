The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference be laid down in the substantive law itself, and the requirements of \u201clawfulness\u201d can be met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of substantive law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89 and 93-94; Association Ekin v.

In essence, that provision does no more than reproduce the provisions of Article 83 of the Code of Execution of Sentences and section 34 of the Pre-trial Detention Act, but does not elaborate on them. It does not set out any specific rules governing the conditions in which the impugned measure may be applied and revoked, the duration or the procedures for review. It is also noteworthy in this connection that the Supreme Court of Russia, at two levels of jurisdiction, stated that the executive order under examination established general rules aimed at ensuring the observance of the regime in pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions, but did not establish any particular procedure for the use of CCTV cameras (see paragraphs 49 and 54 above).",

It is relevant that the technical specifications approved by the Ministry of Justice provide for the technical possibility of keeping the recordings from a CCTV system for a period of thirty days (see paragraph 40 above). The Court recalls that the domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data are efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (see S. and Marper v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, \u00a7\u00a0103, ECHR\u00a02008).",

In that case, the contested measure had been applied in respect of a detainee held under an individual detention regime, charged with the murder of a wellknown politician. It had been based on detailed domestic regulations, which, in particular, had provided an exhaustive list of grounds for the application of such a measure and established an applicable procedure. In accordance with those regulations, the applicant\u2019s placement under permanent video surveillance had been ordered by individualised and reasoned decisions of a competent official, corroborated with necessary medical documents attesting to the state of the applicant\u2019s mental health and assessing the presence of suicidal tendencies in his behaviour. Furthermore, each decision ordering the applicant\u2019s placement under permanent video surveillance had been limited to two weeks at a time, with the result that there had been a regular review of the measure (see Van der Graaf (dec.), cited above).",

Indeed, there does not appear to exist any basis in national law for the adoption of such individualised decisions, the Supreme Court of Russia noting in its decision of 12 March 2014 that the existing legal framework \u201c[did] not provide for the adoption of any [individualised] decision [authorising] the use of technical means of control and supervision\u201d (see paragraph 48 above).",

Whilst vesting in the administrations of pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions the right to use video surveillance, it does not define with sufficient clarity the scope of those powers and the manner of their exercise so as to afford an individual adequate protection against arbitrariness. In fact, as interpreted by the domestic courts, the national legal framework vests in the administrations of pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions an unrestricted power to place every individual in pre-trial or post-conviction detention under permanent \u2013 that is day and night \u2013 video surveillance, unconditionally, in any area of the institution, including cells, for an indefinite period of time, with no periodic reviews.

As regards the impugned measure in the present case, the relevant court decisions reveal that the national courts, including those of the highest level \u2013 the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court of Russia \u2013 generally considered permanent video surveillance to be a necessary element of convicts\u2019 punishment in the form of imprisonment as well as part of the mechanism which ensured the personal safety of detainees and staff of the relevant institutions, performance by detainees of their duties and obligations and observance of the regime of detention (see paragraphs 28, 43, 48 and 53 above).

The framework at issue gave unrestricted power to administrators of pre-trial detention centres and penal institutions \u201cto place every individual in pre-trial or post-conviction detention under permanent \u2013 that is day and night \u2013 video surveillance, unconditionally, in any area of the institution, including cells, for an indefinite period of time, with no periodic reviews\u201d (paragraph 97). No judicial or other safeguards against abuse were provided for in the law. In addition, the Court found a violation of Article 13 on the ground that there was no effective remedy at the domestic level to enable those affected to contest video surveillance on considerations related to the right to respect for private life (paragraph\u00a0110). We agree with these conclusions. However, to our surprise, no award has been made for non-pecuniary damage by way of just satisfaction. That, in my view, is a grave error.",

Switzerland, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 73-77, 105, ECHR 2016; Valentino Acatrinei v.

It is true that these cases concerned surveillance outside the prison system. Yet, as the Court itself mentions in paragraph 81 of the instant judgment, it is a well-established principle \u201cthat prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty, where lawfully imposed detention expressly falls within the scope of Article 5 of the Convention (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. , \u00a7 69, ECHR\u00a02005-IX).\u201d In other words, an individual in detention \u201cdoes not forfeit his or her Convention rights merely because of his or her status as a detainee, including the rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, so that restrictions on those rights must be justified in each case (Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a7 106 and 116-17, ECHR 2015, and the authorities cited therein).\u201d Thus, the right to respect for the private life of such applicants should not be treated any differently from that of those outside the prison system.",

Article\u00a041 reads: \u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party\u201d (emphasis added). Thus Article 41 imposes two conditions for an award of just satisfaction. First, a violation of the Convention must be found, which in the instant case is undisputed; and second, it must be impossible for the applicants to receive full redress in the national system. This second condition is also met in the case at hand, as the Court found Russia to have breached Article 13 of the Convention for not providing any effective remedy for the Article 8 violation. Therefore, we cannot but agree with Judge Bonello\u2019s conclusion in his dissenting opinion in Nikolova:",
