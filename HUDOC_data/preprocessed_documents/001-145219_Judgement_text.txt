.  The case originated in six separate applications against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”).
.  The applicants were all Serbian nationals. Additional personal details, the dates of introduction of their complaints before the Court, and information regarding their legal counsel, respectively, are set out in the Annex to this judgment.
.  The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Mr S. Carić, and subsequently by their current Agent, Ms Vanja Rodić.
.  The applicants complained, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, about the length of the enforcement proceedings in question, simultaneously maintaining that a constitutional appeal would not have been an effective domestic remedy in the specific circumstances of their cases.
.  On 6 May 2013 the applications were communicated to the Government. On 1 February 2014 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was thus assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).
.  The facts, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
.  All applicants were employed by Rudnik bakra Majdanpek, a copper mining company based in Majdanpek (“the debtor”).
.  Between 2001 and 2005 they all instituted separate civil suits against the debtor, seeking pecuniary redress on various grounds.
.  On 10 June 2002 the Majdanpek Municipal Court ruled in favour of the first applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him:
(a)  the salary arrears due between 31 May 1998 and 20 July 2001, plus statutory interest;
(b)  the pension, disability, health and other insurance contributions due for the same period; and
(c)  his legal costs.
.  On 2 October 2002 the judgment became final.
.  Having only received payment of the amounts referred to under (b) above, on 17 December 2002 the first applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment before the Majdanpek Municipal Court.
.  On 10 January 2003 the court accepted the first applicant’s request and issued an enforcement order. On 21 January 2004 the same court issued an additional order to the same effect.
.  On 18 January 2006 the enforcement proceedings were stayed.
.  In May 2011, following their resumption, the first applicant was paid the full amounts awarded in his favour.
.  On 25 April 2002 the Majdanpek Municipal Court ruled in favour of the second applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him:
(a)  the salary arrears due between 1 November 1999 and 1 August 2000, plus statutory interest;
(b)  the pension, disability, health and other insurance contributions due for the same period; and
(c)  his legal costs.
.  On 19 June 2002 the judgment became final.
.  Having only received payment of the amounts referred to under (b) above, on 17 December 2002 the second applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment before the Majdanpek Municipal Court.
.  On 10 January 2003 the court accepted the second applicant’s request and issued an enforcement order.
.  On 18 January 2006 the enforcement proceedings were stayed.
.  In July 2011, following their resumption, the second applicant was paid the full amounts awarded in his favour.
.  On 8 February 2001 and 7 February 2002, the latter following a brief reopening of the proceedings, the Majdanpek Municipal Court ruled in favour of the third applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him the salary arrears due between 1 April 1998 and 28 February 2000, plus statutory interest, as well as his legal costs.
.  By 12 April 2002 these judgments became final.
.  On unspecified dates, the third applicant filed separate requests for the enforcement of the above judgments before the Majdanpek Municipal Court.

.  On 23 October 2001 the Majdanpek Municipal Court ruled in favour of the fourth applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him the salary arrears due between 1 December 1998 and 31 December 1999, plus statutory interest, as well as his legal costs.
.  By 22 November 2001 this judgment became final.
.  On 27 February 2002 the fourth applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment before the Majdanpek Municipal Court.
.  On the same date the court accepted the fourth applicant’s request and issued the enforcement order.
.  On 20 February 2006 the enforcement proceedings were stayed.

.  In June 2011, following their resumption, the fifth applicant was paid the full amounts awarded in his favour.
.  On 7 December 2005 the Majdanpek Municipal Court ruled in favour of the sixth applicant and ordered the debtor to pay him compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered due to a labour-related injury, plus statutory interest, and his legal costs.
.  By 31 March 2006 this judgment became final.
.  On 1 June 2006 the sixth applicant filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment before the Majdanpek Municipal Court.
.  On 14 June 2006 the court accepted the sixth applicant’s request and issued the enforcement order.
.  On 30 August 2006 the enforcement proceedings were stayed.
.  In May 2011, following their resumption, the sixth applicant was paid the full amounts awarded in his favour.
.  None of the applicants ever filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court, seeking compensation for any non-pecuniary damages suffered due to the length of the enforcement proceedings in question.
As of April 2014, the debtor appeared to be a company predominantly comprised of State or socially owned capital and was still in the process of being restructured.
.  Article 18 provides, inter alia, that “[h]uman ... rights guaranteed by the Constitution shall be implemented directly”. Provisions regarding “human ... rights shall be interpreted ... pursuant to valid international standards ... as well as the practice of international institutions which supervise their implementation.”
.  Article 32 § 1 provides, inter alia, for a right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the civil context.
.  Article 170 provides that a “constitutional appeal may be lodged against individual decisions or actions of State bodies or organisations exercising delegated public powers which violate or deny human or minority rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, if other legal remedies for their protection have already been exhausted or have not been prescribed.”
.  The Constitution entered into force on 8 November 2006.
.  The relevant provisions of this Act read as follows:
Article 82 § 2
“A constitutional appeal may be lodged even if all available remedies have not been exhausted in the event of a breach of an appellant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time.”
Article 84 § 1
“A constitutional appeal may be lodged within thirty days of receipt of the individual decision or the date of commission of the actions ... [in question] ...”
.  The Constitutional Court has routinely awarded compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered to appellants whose right to a hearing within a reasonable time had been breached, including in cases where the impugned civil proceedings had been brought before the entry into force of the 2006 Constitution but continued thereafter (see paragraph 51 above). It also took into account the length of the impugned proceedings prior to as well as after this date (see, among many other decisions, Už. nos. 391/08, 143/09, 1387/09, 5466/10, 1063/12, 5660/12 of 9 April 2009, 17 March 2010, 17 February 2011, 20 December 2012, 30 May 2012 and 7 February 2013, respectively).
.  In a number of other cases, not involving complaints about length of proceedings, the Constitutional Court rejected as incompatible ratione temporis appeals regarding judgments/decision rendered before the entry into force of the 2006 Constitution (see, for example, Už. nos. 136/07, 127/08 and 190/07 of 15 May 2008, 12 June 2008 and 15 May 2008, respectively, as well as Už. nos. 157/07, 72/07 and 218/07 of 12 June 2008).
.  In its Opinion the Supreme Court of Cassation held that enforcement proceedings concerning the payment of all work-related pecuniary claims, which have been established by final court judgments, may not be stayed even where the debtor is being restructured as part of the privatisation process. In this respect it referred to, inter alia, Article 18 of the Constitution and the Court’s own earlier case-law on related issues (see paragraph 48 above; see also R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, 15 January 2008; Crnišanin and Others v. Serbia, nos. 35835/05, 43548/05, 43569/05 and 36986/06, 13 January 2009; and Vlahović v. Serbia, no. 42619/04, 16 December 2008).
