It further reiterates that, where it finds that there has been a violation of the Convention, the Court may award the applicant the costs and expenses incurred before the national courts for the prevention or redress of the violation (see, among other authorities, Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, judgment of 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66, p. 14, \u00a7\u00a036; and Hertel v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 August 1998, Reports 1998VI,, p.\u00a02334, \u00a7 63).
