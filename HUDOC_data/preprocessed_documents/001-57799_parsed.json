Spain judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, p. 31, para. 68). More specifically, Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses, in the \"autonomous\" sense given to that word in the Convention system (see, as the most recent authority, the Asch v. Austria judgment of 26 April 1991, Series A no. 203, p. 10, para. 25); it \"does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused\u2019s behalf: its essential aim, as is indicated by the words \u2018under the same conditions\u2019, is a full \u2018equality of arms\u2019 in the matter\" (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, para. 91, and the above-mentioned Bricmont v. Belgium judgment, Series A no. 158, p. 31, para. 89). The Brussels Court of Appeal did not hear any witness, whether for the prosecution or for the defence, before giving judgment.",
