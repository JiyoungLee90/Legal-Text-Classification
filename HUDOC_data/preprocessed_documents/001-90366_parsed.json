Furthermore, Mr A.D. reported the circumstances under which he had been taken away by armed men in the APCs (see paragraph 52 above) and several residents of the village of Pervomayskaya claimed to have seen APCs on the streets on the night of Ruslan Kasumov\u2019s abduction (see paragraph 64 above). The investigating authorities had information concerning a registration number of one of the APCs but took no steps to question Ms Tamara Kh., although it is clear from the Government\u2019s submissions that her identity had been established (see paragraph 81 above). The Court notes that, although neither Mr A.D. nor the villagers saw Ruslan Kasumov being placed inside an APC, it is highly plausible to assume that the armed men who apprehended the missing man and the armed men travelling in the APCs and the Ural vehicles were the same persons.",

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim\u2019s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition, effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances or otherwise unlawful, and afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a024746/94, \u00a7\u00a7 105-09, ECHR 2001III (extracts), and Douglas-Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a056413/00, 8\u00a0January 2002).",

The Court is not in a position to establish whether the applicants visited any law enforcement authorities on 3 February 2003 in the absence of any material evidence for that or to the contrary, but it does not deem it necessary to go into such details for the following reason. The Government provided no explanation whatsoever for the fact that the district prosecutor\u2019s office had opened the investigation in case no. 42050 more than a month after 14 February 2003. The Court reiterates in this respect that the mere knowledge of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances on the part of the authorities gives rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident (see, mutatis mutandis, Ergi v. Turkey, 28 July 1998, \u00a7\u00a082, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998IV; and Ya\u015fa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, \u00a7\u00a0100, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that the investigating authorities should be held responsible for the delay in commencing the investigation between 14 February and 17\u00a0March 2003. In the Court\u2019s view this delay was in itself liable to affect the investigation of the kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in a timely fashion.",

Moreover, as can be seen from the letter by the UGA prosecutor\u2019s office, by 14 February 2004 the investigation had not taken measures to establish which State agency owned the APC (see paragraph 26 above). It is obvious that these investigative steps should have been taken as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).",

The Court does not see which obstacles the investigators might have faced trying to find that witness. First, it was sufficiently clear from the first applicant\u2019s submissions made on 21 June 2004 that she knew the woman\u2019s address, given that she described \u201cTamara\u201d as her neighbour (see paragraph 56 above). Secondly, according to the Government, the last name of \u201cTamara\u201d was known to the investigators (see paragraph 81 above). In such circumstances the Court considers that the investigation failed to take a simple and self-evident measure in questioning a witness who could have provided essential information on the crime.",

Moreover, the Government mentioned the possibility for the applicants to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the investigating authorities in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Court observes that the applicants, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged actions or omissions of investigating authorities before a court. Furthermore, given that the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined, it is highly doubtful that the remedy relied on would have had any prospects of success. Accordingly, the Court finds that the criminal law remedies relied on by the Government were ineffective in the circumstances and rejects their objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
