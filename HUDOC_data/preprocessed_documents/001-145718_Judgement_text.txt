The case originated in an application (no. 8167/07) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Nigerian national, Mr Longinus Amuruba (“the applicant”), on 7 February 2007.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his pre-trial detention lasted an unreasonably long time.
On 23 November 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Tiszalök.
On 11 November 2002 the applicant was arrested in  on charges of drug trafficking. On 12 November 2002 his pre-trial detention was ordered. On 2 May 2003 he was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. While he was serving this sentence in a Spanish prison, he was granted a leave, from which he did not return. Subsequently, he absconded.
.  It appears that simultaneously another investigation was in progress on the side of the Hungarian authorities who suspected that the applicant and his Hungarian common-law wife were involved in a drug trafficking network operating between Spain, Hungary and South America. In this context, a European arrest warrant was issued by the Hungarian Miskolc District Court. Acting upon this warrant, the Spanish police arrested the applicant on 8 August 2005. The applicant was then obliged to serve the remainder of his Spanish sentence.
.  For the purposes of the ongoing Hungarian investigation, on 3 April 2006 the applicant was temporarily extradited for six months to Hungary where his pre-trial detention was ordered. After the expiry of the temporary extradition, on 29 September 2006 he was transferred back to  in order to complete his sentence. After serving the remainder of the sentence, on 20 November 2006 he was definitively extradited to .
.  On 21 November 2006 his pre-trial detention was ordered by the Miskolc District Court. His detention was subsequently prolonged at the statutory intervals (on 14 December 2006, 8 March 2007, 13 September 2007 and 22 April 2008) on the grounds that there was a risk of absconding and repetition of crime. The applicant’s respective appeals were dismissed on 27 December 2006 and 11 June 2008.
.  On 4 June 2009 the applicant requested the termination of his pretrial detention or its replacement by a less stringent measure on the ground that the duration of his pre-trial detention had exceeded the statutory limit of three years. The  rejected this argument. It held that the period of the applicant’s first pre-trial detention in 2006 during his temporary extradition to  had been credited against his Spanish sentence, and that therefore the period in question was to be counted only from the day after his definitive extradition on 20 November 2006. The court also held that the circumstances invariably justified the continued detention. The Debrecen Court of Appeal upheld this decision on 16 July 2009.
.  On 12 June 2009 the applicant was convicted of aggravated drug trafficking by the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment, a ten-year ban from Hungary and confiscation of assets in the amount of 5 million Hungarian forints (HUF).
.  On 9 June 2010 the Debrecen Court of Appeal quashed this judgment on procedural and substantive grounds and remitted the case. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was reordered on the ground that there was a risk of absconding and repetition of offences. The applicant again requested the termination of the detention or its replacement by a less stringent measure. On 5 August 2010 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision with regard to the continuation of the detention. The Supreme Court held that the applicant, an inveterate drug-dealer, might re-offend or abscond in the face of the impending severe sanction.
.  On 4 October 2010 the Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s pre-trial detention for fear of absconding and repetition of crime. The measure was prolonged on 1 June 2011.
.  On 25 January 2012 the applicant was sentenced to seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment, confiscation of property in the value of HUF 5 million and a five-year ban from Hungarian territory.
.  On 11 July 2012 the Court of Appeal increased the sentence to nine years and six months and the ban to ten years.
.  The applicant submits that on 3 December 2012 he was ill-treated by staff of Miskolc Prison. However, he has not submitted any evidence to support this allegation.
