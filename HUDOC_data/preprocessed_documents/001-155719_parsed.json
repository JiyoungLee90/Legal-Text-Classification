                                                "content": "40.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to examine the case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence (see, mutatis mutandis, Ivanovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no.\u00a021261/02, 29 September 2005, which concerned the jurisdiction of the appellate court). In this context the Court notes that the Supreme Court only exercised its statutory powers when it relied on and upheld the facts established by the trial court. It however decided the parties\u2019 appeals at a session held in the presence of the public prosecutor only. The date of this session was communicated to the public prosecutor under section 361 (1) of the Act (see paragraph 17 above). The public prosecutor attended the session and submitted an oral statement requesting that the applicant\u2019s appeal be dismissed and that the prosecutor\u2019s appeal be accepted. The Supreme Court addressed this statement in its decision. The applicant was not present, and thus had no opportunity to reply to those representations. In this connection the Court notes that the applicant did not exercise his right under section 362\u00a0(1) of the Act (see, a contrario, Nasteska \u00a7 17, cited above). As a result, he was not informed of the Supreme Court\u2019s session. However, that court did not request his attendance although it had such jurisdiction under sections 362 (1) and 381(2) of the Act (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above), and although a factual issue, namely, the degree of the applicant\u2019s intention, was being considered by it. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s failure to request notification should not be held against him, given the statutory inequality that the Act created by providing only the public prosecutor with a right to be apprised of the appellate court\u2019s session automatically, while restricting that right for the accused to a specific request by him or her to attend. The Government did not provide any reasonable explanation for this procedural inequality flowing from the Act. The Court sees no reason why such preferential treatment is offered to the public prosecutor, which acts as a party to the proceedings and is accordingly the applicant\u2019s adversary (see Atanasov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 22745/06, \u00a7 32, 17\u00a0February 2011). Moreover, given that the factual issue of the applicant\u2019s intention was under close scrutiny by the Supreme Court, there was an even stronger need to summon the applicant and give him the opportunity to be present at that court\u2019s session on an equal footing with the public prosecutor (see, mutatis mutandis, Zahirovi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 58590/11, \u00a7\u00a7 62-63, 25\u00a0April 2013).",
