These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar.

Consequently, the Court\u2019s task is not to substitute itself for the competent national authorities in determining the most appropriate policy for regulating matters of artificial procreation, in respect mainly of procedures to be followed or authorities to be involved and to what extent, especially since the use of IVF treatment gave rise then and continues to give rise today to sensitive moral and ethical issues against a background of fast-moving medical and scientific developments. It is why in such a context the Court considered that the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the respondent State is a wide one (see S.H. and Others v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7 97). The State\u2019s margin in principle extends both to its decision to intervene in the area and, once it has intervened, to the detailed rules it lays down in order to achieve a balance between the competing public and private interests (see Evans, cited above, \u00a7\u00a082).",
