I personally believe strongly in the autonomy of the judiciary and I feel that without respect for the autonomy of the person whose task it is to decide, it would be impossible to have dispassionate and fair judgments. Autonomy, however, cannot be turned into an absolute discretionary power because that would be bordering on or tantamount to arbitrariness.

I also understand that the judiciary is burdened with work and with problems, that the staffing is insufficient and the workload huge \u2013 and for that reason it is true that protests [esposti] do not help to get the work done more easily, and that more collaboration and dialogue would be better than protests.

However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent to which politicians do and should therefore be treated on an equal footing with the latter when it comes to criticism of their actions. Civil servants must enjoy public confidence in conditions free of undue perturbation if they are to be successful in performing their tasks. It may therefore prove necessary to protect them from offensive and abusive verbal attacks in the course of their duties (see Janowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a033, and Nikula, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

The two rights merit, in principle, equal respect (see Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s (ICI PARIS) v. France, no. 12268/03, \u00a7 41, 23 July 2009; Timciuc v.

Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should, in principle, be the same in both cases. If the striking of a balance by the domestic courts is consistent with the criteria established by the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.

To that end one must take account of the type of readership or audience for which the remarks are intended, and in particular the number and profession of the addressees. We observe that the domestic courts did not take these factors into consideration, even though they were crucial for the examination of the case. We also regret that the majority paid no heed to these questions.",

The general public were not informed of the content of the allegations disseminated to those judges. In that context, there are three major points to be highlighted. Firstly, the various professional groups are often bound together by a corporatist spirit and solidarity, thus affecting the way they perceive criticisms against their members. Secondly, judges are naturally very wary about remarks that are not supported by convincing evidence. Thirdly, judges are used to receiving complaints \u2013 sometimes very aggressive ones \u2013 from individuals who are unhappy with judicial decisions, or indeed from their lawyers. In most cases such complaints have no concrete impact on the image of the judge thus criticised. These various factors related to the specificity of the readership considerably lessen the consequences of the applicant\u2019s remarks. It is questionable whether his letter had a real impact on the image of the judge concerned among that judge\u2019s colleagues.",

In addition, the domestic courts awarded the complainant judge 15,000 euros in damages, which is a significant sum. In our view, having regard to the nature of the remarks made and the specificity of the very limited readership, the sanction applied, seen in the whole context, is manifestly disproportionate in the circumstances of the case.",

In this perspective, the interference in question was supposed to contribute to protecting the authority of the justice system in Italy.
