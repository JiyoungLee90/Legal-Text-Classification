The Constitutional Court found, on 13 October 1999, a violation of the applicant\u2019s constitutional right to a hearing without undue delay. The Constitutional Court itself admitted that in similar cases the law then in force did not empower it to provide redress to persons whose constitutional rights were violated. In the second set of proceedings brought by the applicant the Constitutional Court found no undue delays in the proceedings in the subsequent period, that is between 13\u00a0October 1999 and 28 June 2000.

In these proceedings the applicant cannot, therefore obtain full redress in respect of the alleged violation of his right under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention of which he complains before the Court.
