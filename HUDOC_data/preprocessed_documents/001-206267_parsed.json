The Government also centred their arguments on Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01. The Court for its part sees no need to examine any part of the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of its own motion, as the application does not concern the right of an accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him or her, but rather the scope of the general right to a \u201cfair hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1. Thus, the Court considers that the complaint may suitably be dealt with under that provision (see J\u00fal\u00edus \u00de\u00f3r Sigur\u00fe\u00f3rsson v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 38797/17, \u00a7 31, 16 July 2019).",

The Court reiterates that while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any specific rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way evidence should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national legislation and the domestic courts (see, among other authorities, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, 21 January 1999, Kashlev v. Estonia, no. 22574/08, \u00a7 40, 26 April 2016, and Lazu v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 46182/08, \u00a7 34, 5 July 2016). It is not the function of the Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair the Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant. These matters, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, are the province of the domestic courts. It is not appropriate for the Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant\u2019s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts. The Court\u2019s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and that in a given case they were compatible with the Convention, while also taking into account the specific circumstances, the nature and the complexity of the case (Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, \u00a7 149, 18 December 2018).",

Moreover, the Court\u2019s case-law on this matter, when seen as a whole and in its context, draws a distinction between situations in which an appeal court which reversed an acquittal without itself hearing the oral evidence on which the acquittal was based not only had jurisdiction to examine points of fact as well as points of law but actually proceeded to a fresh evaluation of the facts, and situations in which the appeal court only disagreed with the lower court on the interpretation of the law and/or its application to the established facts, even if it also had jurisdiction in respect of the facts. For example, in the case of Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 10\u00a0March 2008, the Court considered that the appeal court had not simply given a different legal interpretation or another application of the law to facts already established at first instance, but had carried out a fresh evaluation of facts beyond purely legal considerations (see also Sp\u00eenu v. Romania, no. 32030/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05559, 29\u00a0April 2008, Andreescu v. Romania, no. 19452/02, \u00a7\u00a7 65-70, 8 June 2010, Almenara Alvarez v Spain, no. 16096/08, 25 October 2011). Similarly, in Marcos Barrios v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a017122/07, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 21\u00a0September 2010, the Court held that the appeal court had expressed itself on a question of fact, namely the credibility of a witness, thus modifying the facts established at first instance and taking a fresh position on facts which were decisive for the determination of the applicant\u2019s guilt (see also Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez v. Spain, no. 15256/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03334, 16 November 2010).",

Spain, no. 30643/04, 16 December 2008, the Court found that there had not been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the ground that the aspects which the appeal court had been called on to analyse in order to convict the applicant had had a predominantly legal character, and its judgment had expressly stated that it was not for it to carry out a fresh evaluation of the evidence; rather, it had only made a different legal interpretation from that of the lower court (contrast Sigur\u00fe\u00f3r Arnarsson [v. Iceland, no. 44671/98], \u00a7 34 [15 July 2003], and Mihaiu v.\u00a0Romania, no. 43512/02, \u00a7 38, 4 November 2008, in which the Court emphasised the predominantly factual nature of the issues). A similar conclusion was reached in Keskinen and Veljekset Keskinen Oy v. Finland, no.\u00a034721/09, 5\u00a0June 2012. However, as explained by the Court in Suurip\u00e4\u00e4 v. Finland (no. 43151/02, \u00a7 44, 12 January 2010), one must at this point take into account that \u201cthe facts and the legal interpretation can be intertwined to an extent that it is difficult to separate the two from each other.\u201d",
