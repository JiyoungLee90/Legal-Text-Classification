It will be recalled that in the case of Chrysostomos and Papachrysostomou, the Commission found that a number of demonstrators had resisted arrest, that the police forces had broken their resistance and that in that context there was a high risk that the demonstrators would be treated roughly, and even suffer injuries, in the course of the arrest operation (see the Commission's report, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-115). The Court does not see any reason to depart from these findings and will take due account of the state of heightened tension at the time the acts complained of took place.",

Even though issued in March 2000, which is more than ten years after the events of 19\u00a0July 1989, this certificate reconstructs the history of the treatment administered to the applicant at  after the demonstration. It states that she had suffered an open wound about 9 cm long on the upper third of her tibia and that this injury was likely to have been caused by a sharp object. Stitches were applied and she had had to use crutches for one month. In 2000 the patient still had a scar and had lost feeling in the area of the wound.",

There is nothing to show that the applicant, who was not arrested, had offered resistance to the police in the execution of their duties to the extent that it had been necessary to inflict a wound with a sharp object.

In this respect, the Court recalls that in the case of Foka v. Turkey (no.\u00a028940/95, \u00a7\u00a7 82-84, 24\u00a0June 2008) it held that the \u201cTRNC\u201d was exercising de facto authority over northern Cyprus and that the responsibility of Turkey for the acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d was inconsistent with the applicant's view that the measures adopted by it should always be regarded as lacking a \u201clawful\u201d basis in terms of the Convention. The Court therefore concluded that when, as in the Foka case, an act of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities was in compliance with laws in force within the territory of northern , it should in principle be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention.

The Court sees no reason to depart from these findings, which were based on the UN Secretary General's report, on a video film and on photographs submitted by the respondent Government before the Commission.

In the Court's view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the \u201cTRNC\u201d borders by some of the demonstrators (see Protopapa, cited above, \u00a7 110).",
