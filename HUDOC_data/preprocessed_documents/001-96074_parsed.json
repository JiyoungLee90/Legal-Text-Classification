The grounds given by the domestic courts could be reconciled with the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of the individuals targeted in the cartoon and texts. In this connection, the Court observes that Article 10 of the Convention does not secure freedom of expression without any limitation. In the present case, it is thus necessary to ascertain only whether the sanction imposed on the applicants, namely their dismissal, was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and, accordingly, whether it was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

The Court takes the view in this connection that members of a trade union are entitled, and indeed have a duty, to present their demands to their employer for the purpose of improving the situation of staff in the company. Whilst their ideas, proposals and actions may be favourably received, they may also offend, shock or disturb. If a trade union did not have the possibility of freely expressing its ideas in this context, it would become meaningless and pointless. The Court reiterates, however, that the freedom of debate is undoubtedly not absolute in nature. In this connection, the freedom of expression enshrined in paragraph 1 of Article 10 encompasses duties and responsibilities. A Contracting State may make it subject to certain \u201crestrictions\u201d or \u201cpenalties\u201d, but it is for the Court to give the final ruling on their compatibility with the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 (see, mutatis mutandis, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, \u00a7 59 (c), Series A no.\u00a0216). The Court observes that, in the present case, the applicants expressed themselves through cartoons and articles that were published in their trade-union news bulletin and displayed on the notice board provided by the employer. The cartoon at issue showed a caricature of the human resources manager, G., sitting behind a desk under which a person on all fours could be seen from behind, together with A. and B., who were watching the scene while waiting to take their turn to satisfy the manager. It contained sufficiently explicit speech bubbles. As to the two articles of which extracts have been reproduced (see paragraph 8, above), the Court takes the view that their content did not fall within the context of any public debate on matters of general interest, but related to issues that specifically concerned company P. That finding is confirmed by the gravity and general nature of the criticisms levelled by the applicants and by the tone chosen for that purpose.",

Having regard to the special importance of freedom of association and freedom of expression, which are closely linked in this instance, the Court should examine the severity of the disciplinary sanction imposed in the light of the case as a whole. The proportionality principle demands that a balance be struck between the requirements of purposes listed in Article 11 \u00a7 2 and those of the free expression of opinions by persons, such as the applicants, acting in a representative capacity. The pursuit of a just balance must not result in trade union representatives being discouraged, for fear of disciplinary sanctions, from making clear their opinions on contentious matters arising between employers and employees. The freedom to participate in an assembly or an association (including the right to form and join trade unions) is of such importance that it cannot be restricted in any way so long as the person concerned does not commit any reprehensible act on such occasion. The \u201cact\u201d in question in this case, crude as it was, cannot, in my view, be regarded as being so reprehensible as to warrant the ultimate disciplinary sanction, namely, summary and permanent dismissal.
