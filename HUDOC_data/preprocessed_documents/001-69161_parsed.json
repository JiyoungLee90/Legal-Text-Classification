They argued that the applicant and her husband had attempted to obtain double compensation for the same damage relying on two different, mutually exclusive, legal grounds: in civil proceedings relying on section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act, and in administrative proceedings relying on the Reconstruction Act. The applicant has realised her right to damages for the destroyed family house in the administrative proceedings (which were instituted by her husband, but also on her behalf). It follows that her civil claim was actually decided in these proceedings. Consequently, she must be taken to have access to a court in respect of her claim.",
