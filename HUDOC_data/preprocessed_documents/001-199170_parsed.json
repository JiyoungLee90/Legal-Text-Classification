Moreover, the Customs Office found that the fact that the applicant\u2019s permanent residence had been registered in Berdyansk also confirmed that when crossing the border he was a resident of Ukraine. Based on the above and referring to the provisions of, inter alia, the Law of Ukraine \u201cOn import (dispatch) into Ukraine, the customs clearance and taxation of personal belongings, goods and vehicles imported (dispatched) by individuals into the customs territory of Ukraine\u201d (see paragraph 31 below) and the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine no. 231 of 31\u00a0March 1995 on the approval of the procedure for the issue of a passport of a citizen of Ukraine and travel documents of a child, their temporary suspension and seizure (see paragraph\u00a033 below), the Customs Office concluded that when crossing the border the applicant was a resident of Ukraine.

In a court hearing the applicant explained that he had been working in Spain and it had been the first time he had entered Ukraine using his car. When entering Ukraine he had presented all relevant documents to a customs officer and was not evading the customs control. The court, however, found that when crossing the border the applicant had declared in the customs declaration that he resided permanently in Spain. He also indicated that he had been temporarily bringing his car with him. On the same day he had taken an obligation to remove the car from the customs territory of Ukraine by 30 June 2008. The court held that according to the information received from a local department of the Ministry of Interior of Ukraine (see paragraph 17 above) at the time of the bordercrossing his place of residence had been registered in the city of Berdyansk. The court further cited the findings of the report on the internal investigation (see paragraph 15 above), according to which customs officer, T. had been disciplined for not correctly applying the customs regulations in the applicant\u2019s case. Based on the above considerations the court concluded that the applicant, being a resident of Ukraine, had entered untrue information into the customs declaration and, as a result of abuse of office by the officers of the customs authorities, he had evaded payments of customs duties.",

Referring to the provisions of the law on \u201cNatural Persons\u2019 Income Tax\u201d (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below) the applicant insisted that he had been a resident of Spain and the absence of the \u201cpermanent residence\u201d stamp in his passport had not been a criterion for establishing his place of residence. While imposing the confiscation measure, the first-instance court had failed to take into account his character, the degree of his guilt, his financial situation, the nature of the offence, its mitigation and aggravating factors. The applicant finally noted that the court had failed to provide any reasoning in support of its decision not to fine him but to confiscate his car.

The court noted that since the sanction of confiscation could be applied at any time, the proceedings against the applicant for a breach of Article 351 of the Customs Code could not be terminated as time-barred. The court further established that the customs duties evaded by the applicant amounted to UAH 56,393.40 (at the material time around EUR 4,994). The applicant\u2019s behaviour, according to the appeal court, attested that when declaring his place of residence during the border-crossing the applicant ought to have been aware of the unlawfulness of his actions. In particular, in the court hearing the applicant could not provide a persuasive answer as to why he had considered that Spain had been his permanent residence. Moreover, the applicant had refused to reply to the court\u2019s questions concerning his place of residence registered in the city of Berdyansk.

However, the Government provided neither a copy of this letter, nor any proof that this letter had been officially published and accessible to the applicant before he had submitted his customs declaration. In view of the absence of proof of its official publication and given that it was addressed to another State authority, the Court concludes that this letter had been an internal document and had not been available to the applicant before he submitted his customs declaration. From the analysis of other statutory provisions referred to by the domestic authorities in this case, it is not clear that, for the purpose of customs formalities, the absence of the \u201cpermanent residence\u201d stamp in the passport and the place of residence registered in Ukraine were decisive elements to conclude that a person had residency in Ukraine.",

The authorities acknowledged that insufficient training and an inappropriate attitude towards the performance of his duties were the reasons for such an incorrect application of the customs regulations (see paragraph 16 above). In view of the aforementioned, and considering the uncertainty of the domestic law as to the question of establishment of the applicant\u2019s place of residence (see paragraph 51 above), the Court considers that it is questionable that the applicant was deliberately seeking to circumvent the customs regulations when declaring his place of residence (see Sadocha, cited above, \u00a7 30).",

However, the authorities did not address the applicant\u2019s detailed arguments on appeal as to the proportionality of the interference when imposing the confiscation measure (see paragraph 19 above). Accordingly, the Court finds that the scope of the review carried out by the domestic courts was too narrow to satisfy the requirement of seeking the \u201cfair balance\u201d inherent in the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Sadocha, cited above, \u00a7 33 and Gyrlyan, cited above, \u00a7 30).",

In particular, it provided that the prohibited actions shall be the reason for imposing a fine, the confiscation of goods, including the confiscation of vehicles. However, given that the time-limits for the imposition of penalties other than confiscation had expired at the time of the consideration of the applicant\u2019s case, in the light of Articles 322 and 328 of the Customs Code the domestic courts could apply the confiscation measure only. In the Court\u2019s view, narrowing a choice of a sanction to a confiscation measure without setting any time-limits destroys the very essence of the requisite fair balance between the requirements of the general interest and the protection of an individual\u2019s right to property (see, mutatis mutandis, Gyrlyan, cited above, \u00a7 31 in which the domestic legislation prevented the courts from considering a more lenient sanction than a fine equivalent to at least the undeclared amount or confiscation of the undeclared cash).",
