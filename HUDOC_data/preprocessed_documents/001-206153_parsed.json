He had arrived in Switzerland in 2008 at the age of 34. He had spent most of his life, and in particular his formative years, in the Gambia and in Mali and was well acquainted with the mores and traditions there. His statements in respect of his family were contradictory but, in any event, he had a family network on which he could rely on return. It was not credible that his family had disowned him, given that his sister had allegedly obtained the documents for the registration of his partnership for him. It appeared that the second applicant was also supporting the first applicant\u2019s family financially. Since the Gambian documents had been issued in 2012 and contained a scanned signature, it was probable that the first applicant had been in Gambia himself at the time and that the authorities had seen no reason to take action against him. He was poorly integrated in Switzerland, despite having been there for almost ten years, and only recently participated in a German course at beginners\u2019 level. He had closer social, cultural and family ties to his country of origin than to Switzerland, where his ties were limited to his partner, the second applicant. It was thus reasonable for the first applicant to return to his country of origin.",

He was dependent on medical treatment in the medium and long term. In view of his state of health it was not possible for him to enjoy his relationship with the first applicant in the Gambia. However, the applicants could maintain their relationship through visits and the use of modern electronic communication. Moreover, the first applicant might be allowed to reside in Switzerland at a later stage, provided his conduct abroad was without reproach. In so far as the second applicant required care and support, his sons and grandchildren could provide it; the first applicant\u2019s permanent presence was not mandatory to that end. The applicants had so far been able to enjoy their registered partnership only occasionally, as the first applicant had served time in prison. In view of the second applicant\u2019s financial means, it was possible for the first applicant to travel to Switzerland regularly, even if he had to obtain a visa each time. Having regard to the criminal offences committed by the first applicant, the applicants could not have expected to live together in Switzerland at the time they registered their partnership. Balancing the competing interests, the Federal Supreme Court found that the public interest in excluding the first applicant from Switzerland outweighed the applicants\u2019 interest in being able permanently to enjoy their relationship in Switzerland.",

The new President had declared that homosexuality was not an issue for him, and the media reported that he considered it a personal matter.

It reproduced that judgment\u2019s key considerations and observed that that court reached the same conclusion in the proceedings concerning the third asylum application (see paragraph 13 above). Having regard to the transition in the Gambia and to the contradictions in the first applicant\u2019s account as established by the Federal Administrative Court in the asylum proceedings, the Federal Supreme Court concluded that he had not shown substantial grounds for believing that he faced a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if he were removed to the Gambia. Since the second applicant lived in Switzerland and the first applicant could enjoy his relationship with him through visits to Switzerland, presumably no homosexual acts capable of drawing the attention of the population or of the authorities to the first applicant would occur in the Gambia.",

The question is not, could the applicant, by being discreet, live in that country without attracting adverse consequences. It is important to note that even if applicants may so far have managed to avoid harm through concealment, their circumstances may change over time and secrecy may not be an option for the entirety of their lifetime. The risk of discovery may also not necessarily be confined to their own conduct. There is almost always the possibility of discovery against the person\u2019s will, for example, by accident, rumours or growing suspicion. It is also important to recognize that even if LGBTI individuals conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity they may still be at risk of exposure and related harm for not following expected social norms (for example, getting married and having children ...).

For many years homosexual acts had been criminalised in the Gambia, with sanctions of up to fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment. In 2014, legislation was amended to provide for life imprisonment in case of aggravated acts. Under the previous President Jammeh, the authorities targeted (suspected) LGBTI persons, and the longstanding campaign of hatred and persecution promoted discrimination and violence against homosexuals. The situation of homosexuals had not improved significantly following the change of government in late 2016, early 2017. The new President Barrow no longer stirred up hatred against homosexuals, but had not displayed any interest in becoming active in the positive sense of protecting homosexuals. The laws criminalising homosexual acts remained in force and could be applied any time. He was thus at risk of ill-treatment at the hands of the authorities.",

The Swiss authorities essentially based their conclusion that he did not face a real risk of ill-treatment on the consideration that his sexual orientation was not known in the Gambia and that he could avoid ill-treatment by suppressing and hiding his sexual orientation.

Switzerland (dec.), no. 21417/17, \u00a7 24, 19 December 2017).

The parties disagree as to whether the Gambian authorities would be able and willing to provide effective protection to the first applicant against ill-treatment emanating from nonState actors, with the third-party interveners concurring with the applicant. The United Kingdom Home Office documents indicate that the Gambian authorities were generally unwilling to provide protection to LGBTI persons and that it would be unreasonable to expect an LGBTI person to seek protection from the authorities given the continued criminalisation of same-sex sexual acts in the Gambia (see paragraph 39 above, at 2.5).

They argued that it was not possible for the second applicant to relocate to the Gambia, as he required continuous medical treatment for cancer; rather, in these circumstances, the support given to him by the first applicant was crucial. In order to avoid persecution in the Gambia, the first applicant would be required to maintain contact in a covert manner; yet, he could not be required to deny their relationship.

He had to have the right to visit his grave, to maintain the contacts he made through him, including his sisters, and to move in familiar, shared surroundings. He had lived in Switzerland for twelve years and integrated well into society, and now had a perfect command of the German language. He was financially independent thanks to the security provided by his late partner, including an apartment and pension benefits, but would nonetheless like to work. His conviction by the Lucerne Criminal Court was based on an offence committed in 2011, prior to his relationship with his late partner; he had behaved correctly in recent years. In the Gambia he could not count on family support, notably his sister may not help him out of fear of being attacked herself. The situation of homosexuals in the Gambia had to be taken into account. He would have to keep his relationship with the late second applicant secret, and would be unable to enter into a new relationship. Balancing the competing interests, which the domestic authorities had not done in a sufficiently thorough manner, led to the conclusion that he had to be allowed to stay in Switzerland.",

Given his financial situation and the fact that he owned an apartment, it would be easily possible for the first applicant to travel to Switzerland to visit the late second applicant\u2019s grave and to maintain contact with family and friends; he could also maintain such contact via modern means of communication. Similarly, he could easily resettle in the Gambia. The living conditions which the first applicant would face in the Gambia as a homosexual had already been taken into account in the Article 3 assessment and were, in the Government\u2019s submission, compatible with that provision; these conditions could not in themselves constitute a bar to his removal under Article 8. There was considerable public interest in removing the first applicant in view of his criminal conviction and behaviour. The domestic courts had thoroughly balanced the competing interests.",
