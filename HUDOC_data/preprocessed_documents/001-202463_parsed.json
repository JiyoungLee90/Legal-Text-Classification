In the present case, such fundamental error resulted from the arbitrary opinions of the lower courts which undermined legal certainty based on valid decisions adopted in the 1940\u2019s. Since an ordinary appeal on points of law was not admissible here, the excess could not be remedied and legal certainty restored but by an extraordinary intervention of the Supreme Court; this was confirmed by the Constitutional Court.",

The questions to be resolved in these proceedings related to the 1945 regulation on confiscation, to the validity of the confiscation decision and to the effects on the ownership of Act no.\u00a0180/1995 on the renewal of registration. In the Court\u2019s view, these are ordinary legal questions which fall within common judicial activity. Although the Supreme Court found that the lower courts had erred when considering that the confiscation had not been effective and that the applicant\u2019s predecessor\u2019s ownership rights had been recognised by the State during the renewal of registration, the Court is not convinced that it constituted an \u201cerror of fundamental importance to the judicial system\u201d (see Sutyazhnik v. Russia, no. 8269/02, \u00a7 38, 23 July 2009) or any other defect or miscarriage of justice justifying an interference with the final and binding judgment in the present case.",

The State, as a plaintiff in the subsequent proceedings for determination of ownership, had a particular interest in their outcome since it wanted to reverse that administrative decision on the basis of which the applicant\u2019s ancestors had been registered as owners in its place. In these proceedings, the fairness of which was not called into question, the State could submit any arguments or evidence to protect its rights, including the points raised later by the Prosecutor General. In such conditions, the Court considers that the extraordinary appeal may rather be seen as a further appeal or, in other words, an appeal in disguise in terms of the Court\u2019s case-law (see, for example, Ryabykh v.
