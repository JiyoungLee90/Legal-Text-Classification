Moreover, the 1998 and 1999 annual reports of Byggettan allegedly showed that the inspection fees greatly exceeded the costs of the work and that the surplus was used for general union activities. Consequently, the corresponding deductions from the applicants\u2019 wages were tantamount to forced union membership or, at least, involved an unacceptable compulsion to join the Union or another trade union. The conduct thus violated their negative freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention as well as under domestic law. Furthermore, since the applicants did not share the political values of the Union, the levy on their wages also violated their rights under Article 10 of the Convention.",

The system of monitoring fees did not involve a compulsion to join a trade union. Moreover, the applicants had not expressed any ideological reasons for their unwillingness to contribute to the monitoring work. The Union claimed that, contrary to the Industries\u2019 allegation, the 1998 and 1999 annual reports of Byggettan showed that the proceeds of that work had not contributed to general union activities but that, in fact, the monitoring had been run at a loss. Furthermore, the inspection work was strictly separated, economically and otherwise, from the other activities of Byggettan. Finally, arguing that the positive aspect of the freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention was stronger than its negative counterpart, the Union claimed that a ban on the levying of monitoring fees on unorganised workers\u2019 wages would violate the positive rights of its members, as this could induce members to leave the Union in order to avoid paying the fees.",

It referred to several of its previous judgments concerning various types of measurement and monitoring fees. In a case from 1977 (AD 1977 nr 222), the court had found that the monitoring of time-based wages was wholly different from the measuring of piecework, as no special action had to be taken to establish the amount and type of work performed. Instead, the inspection of time-based wages rather aimed at securing the observance of the collective labour agreement and also served as a basis for the statistics used by the Union in wage negotiations with the employers. Consequently, the monitoring benefited the general union activities and the fees contributed financially to those activities. The court had therefore concluded that the levying of fees on the wages of members of the Syndicalist Union for monitoring work carried out by another trade union involved a violation of those worker\u2019s positive freedom of association, as they would have to resign from their own organisation in order to avoid contributing to both organisations.",

It referred to the European Court\u2019s case-law and drew the conclusion that only the core of the negative freedom of association was protected under Article 11 of the Convention, meaning that a person must have been subjected to a certain measure of force or at least strong pressure to join an organisation in order to give rise to a violation of Article 11.",

The situation would have been different if the applicants would to some extent have been associated with the Union\u2019s ideology as a result of the monitoring fee deductions. However, the fee in issue was deducted in accordance with their employer\u2019s obligations under the collective labour agreement, and it was, accordingly, difficult to see a link with the Union\u2019s ideology. In this connection, the court also referred to the evidence given before it by Mr Evaldsson and Mr Hodell. While it questioned whether the grounds for their position in the case could have a bearing on their negative freedom of association, the court nevertheless found that there was no indication that they opposed the deduction of the fees because they took exception to union activities in general or to the ideology of the Union.",

While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid, the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question. As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement, it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union. However, most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non-member workers.

In the statement of accounts for 1999, a reimbursement of SEK 6.360 million was recorded for the inspection work. As this reimbursement in effect reduced the costs, the amount has to be deducted from the recorded profit of SEK 5 million in order to arrive at the real financial result of the inspection work. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, the pension payments should be recorded as a cost, whereas the pension fund reimbursement should not be considered as revenue.

They have stated that, throughout the years, the branches of the Building Workers\u2019 Union have made contributions to the pension fund, whose accumulated assets are used to honour the Union\u2019s pension commitments towards its retired personnel. Thus, when making pension payments, the Union branches are not the actual payer but are making the payments on behalf of the pension fund, presumably because the fund does not have an administrative division of its own to handle such payments. Accordingly, the applicants claim that, when determining the actual annual result of the inspection work, the pension transactions should only be taken into account to the extent that the fund reimbursements differ from the pension payments. In 1999, the reimbursement received by Byggettan exceeded the pension payments by as little as SEK 14,000. The financial result of that year should thus be reduced by only that amount and the recorded profit of SEK 5 million consequently remains virtually unchanged.",

The projected revenue from the inspection work was SEK 29 million. It thus appears that the costs of the monitoring work accounted for about one-third of the inspection costs. However, as can be seen from the above-mentioned figures presented in the annual report for 1998 (see paragraph 33 above), the monitoring fees\u2019 share of the inspection revenue came to more than two-thirds (SEK 19.8 million out of a recorded total of SEK 28.8 million).

The Union\u2019s and the Government\u2019s claim, that the actual results were negative as amounts corresponding to the pension fund reimbursements had to be added to the costs for each year, was repudiated by the applicants; only the difference between reimbursements and actual pension payments affected the results, which thus remained positive. The applicants also questioned the allocation of costs made by Byggettan and other branches of the Union; despite the fact that only a small number of employees were involved in monitoring and measuring work \u2013 the majority of staff being occupied with branch activities \u2013 more than 90% of the pension payments and about half of the wage costs were allocated to the monitoring and measuring work.

They also pointed out that the results forecasted in the budgets were far better than the results recorded in the annual reports and that these \u201cnegative budget deviations\u201d, i.e. miscalculations, continued year after year.

In support of that contention they submitted, inter alia, the following. In general, the assessment of proportionality had to be made in the light of the importance attributed in  to the system of collective bargaining. The collective agreements had an important normative effect and protected workers\u2019 interests in a general sense. In the construction business, employees who were not members of the Union also benefited from the latter\u2019s negotiations with the Industries concerning, for instance, wage levels, although they did not contribute financially to this part of the Union\u2019s activities, which was financed by means of membership fees. As wage monitoring ensured that the collective agreement was adhered to by the employers, it fulfilled an important function in the interests of construction workers generally. There was no difference in treatment between Union members and other workers; Byggettan would also inform non-unionised workers and contact their employers in case any discrepancies were found. In this respect, the Government referred the statement by Mr Bromander, according to which, in 1999, wages had been adjusted upwards for 250 non-unionised workers as a result of the monitoring work (paragraph 26 above). The Government asserted that, if non-unionised workers were exempt from contributing to the wage monitoring system, it would appear to be at the expense of the Union\u2019s members, who would presumably have to contribute more to help cover the costs of the monitoring work.",

The wage monitoring system had a preventive impact in the sense that employers, being aware of the fact that deviations from the Construction Agreement would probably not go unnoticed, presumably would take more care in respecting the wage levels specified by the agreement. Due to the short duration of their employment periods and their resultant difficulties in being informed of the applicable collective agreement, this effect was particularly vital for construction workers. Furthermore, Byggettan was only entitled to compensation if monitoring work had actually been carried out and only the actual costs of monitoring were to be covered by the fees. According to the treasurer at Byggettan, during the relevant year 1999, the overall costs for wage monitoring had exceeded the total amount which had been deducted from the wages of workers employed by an employer bound by the Construction Agreement. This indicated that the applicants had not contributed to Byggettan\u2019s branch activities by means of the deductions made to their wages. Further, in the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicants had provided no direct evidence to establish that any such contribution had occurred. Moreover, according to the Union, its business activities, including wage monitoring, were strictly separated, financially, from the branch activities. Thus, the monitoring fees provided financial support only to the monitoring work, which aimed to verify compliance with the collective agreement\u2019s provisions on wages. The fees should therefore be viewed as payment for a service which \u2013 as a consequence of the legal framework governing the labour market in Sweden \u2013 was provided by the Union rather than the State. The Government further pointed out that the amounts deducted from the applicants\u2019 wages were relatively limited.",

However, according to the information provided to the Government by the Union, the majority of local branches showed neither significant profits nor losses from their monitoring work. As regards the documents made available to the Court, the Union\u2019s position was that the profits from the monitoring and measuring activities of Byggettan, as shown in its annual reports for the years 1997-2000, did not reflect the real results, as money from the Union\u2019s pension fund had been used to cover part of the costs. Instead, when the effects of these pension fund reimbursements had been taken into account, the monitoring and measuring activities of Byggettan showed a loss in the first three years and a profit for the year 2000 of only SEK 2.1 million, rather than the profit of SEK 8.5 million recorded in the annual report. Furthermore, the chart compiled by the Union for the years 2001-2005 showed that, whether or not pension fund reimbursements were taken into account, the accumulated result of the monitoring and measuring activities of all the Union branches was a negative one. In this connection, the Government asserted that a fair examination required that not only the situation of one local branch was taken into account. The Government maintained, however, that they were entirely depending on information provided by the Union and were not in a position to assess whether the Union\u2019s analysis of the matter was economically correct.",

Instead, they could accept an hourly rate of SEK 1,800, including VAT. They also found the sum concerning the expert opinion to be excessive, considering no more than half that sum to be appropriate.

Hence there was no violation of their negative freedom of association, which under domestic law is exclusively based on the Convention. Referring to the European Court\u2019s case-law, the Labour Court considered that only the core of the negative freedom of association was protected under Article 11, meaning that a person must have been subjected to a certain measure of force or at least strong pressure to join an organisation in order to give rise to a violation of that Article (see paragraph 15 of the judgment). Assuming that the Court\u2019s case-law on the negative freedom of association can be interpreted in this way, it might be fair to describe it as somewhat undeveloped and conservative to date. Perhaps this case was not the appropriate one for developing the case-law further to include other situations than those where actual force or strong pressure had been exercised.",

Having regard to the financial information made available concerning the Union\u2019s monitoring work, I find that the applicants\u2019 suspicions in this respect were justified. Using the same reasoning as the national court, I find that the complaint falls within the ambit of Article 11 and, contrary to the national court, that there was a violation, since the Government failed in their positive obligation to protect the interests of the applicants (see paragraph 63 of the judgment). Taking this approach it would not have been necessary to examine the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which in my opinion would have been a more satisfactory line of reasoning, especially in view of the relatively small sum levied, in all about 160 euros per applicant.",
