Although it emphasised the importance of information about an individual\u2019s movable and immovable property, monetary funds and income, which could be demonstrated by, inter alia, certificates from the Real Estate Registry, banks, State social insurance funds or the Centre of Registers (see paragraph 21 above), the applicant did provide such information to the Supreme Court (see paragraphs\u00a018 and 23 above) and the latter did not question the veracity of any of the documents submitted by the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Malahov v. Moldova, no. 32268/02, \u00a7 31, 7 June 2007). The Supreme Court did not explain why it considered the information he had provided to be inadequate or what other information was missing, and neither did it find that the applicant\u2019s financial situation had improved since he had been granted an exemption from the payment of the court fees by the lower court (see, mutatis mutandis, Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit v.
