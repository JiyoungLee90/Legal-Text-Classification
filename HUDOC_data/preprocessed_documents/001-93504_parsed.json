Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities, accordingly, enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see, mutatis mutandis, Velikovi and Others v.

Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant\u2019s right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, \u00a7\u00a078, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, Series\u00a0A no. 332, \u00a7 38, and Former King of Greece and Others, cited above, \u00a7 89).

Two further conditions had to be fulfilled: that this decision become final and that the person concerned enter the flat.

While it is true that according to the Supreme Court\u2019s practice, relied on by the applicant (see \u00a7\u00a027 above), in a situation where a holder of a specially protected tenancy could not enter a flat because it had already been occupied by a third person without a valid legal basis the former does acquire the specially protected tenancy and is entitled to purchase the flat in issue, in the present case there are some additional elements which dispense the Court from further examining that question. The Court notes in this respect that the decision of 6 December 1990, allocating the flat to the applicant (see \u00a7 10 above) was later on declared null and void by the Split Municipal Court on 30 April 2007, a judgment which was upheld by the Split County Court on 6\u00a0February 2008, and thus became final. That decision has consequences on the applicant\u2019s initial title in respect of the flat in question as it finally established that the decision granting the applicant specially protected tenancy had been null and void with the effect that it could not have produced any valid legal effects. Therefore, the complaint that this decision had not been enforced must yield in the face of the subsequently established nullity of this decision ab initio.",
