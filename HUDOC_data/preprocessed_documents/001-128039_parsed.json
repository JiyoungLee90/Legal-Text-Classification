In the article the applicant argued that the new Disciplinary Statute restricted a serviceman\u2019s defence rights when he was the subject of disciplinary proceedings. In particular, the Statute was vague on servicemen\u2019s right to acquaint themselves with the substance of any internal investigation report against them. The applicant also claimed that during disciplinary proceedings a serviceman had only a limited opportunity to have recourse to legal representation, which in his view was particularly harmful, since few servicemen had the proper legal knowledge to defend themselves in person. The article further stated that the applicant, discontented with the new Statute, had conveyed his observations and suggestions to the President of the Republic, asking the latter to veto the Statute. According to Presidential office sources, the President took account of the applicant\u2019s proposals but decided to promulgate the Statute anyway. The Chairman of the Committee of National Security of the Seimas commented that the Committee had received numerous suggestions in connection with the text of the Statute, all of which had been given serious consideration before the Statute was adopted.",

The applicant also claimed that he had been discriminated against because he had defended another serviceman (see paragraph 15 above) and because of his views as expressed in the publication in Kauno Diena, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention. The applicant asserted that there were hundreds of soldiers in the Lithuanian army who did not have speciality codes allowing them to serve until 55 years of age. However, they continued to serve in the army until the expiry of their military service contracts, even though they had already reached retirement age. The applicant thus requested the court, on the basis of Article 57 \u00a7 4 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings (see paragraph 44 below), to oblige army officials to produce certain documents regarding his dismissal and regarding the situation of four servicemen, R.L., V.S., J.\u0160. and M.I., who to his knowledge had continued to serve in the military in the same Grand Duke Vaidotas battalion despite the fact that they had reached retirement age. He noted that those documents were in the custody of the battalion commander and he could not obtain them on his own. Lastly, the applicant acknowledged that in 2005 the Minister of Defence had changed the military specialist codes and he had been transferred to other duties, those of legal specialist. All officers with lawyer\u2019s duties were given the code of legal specialist, but the applicant, a non-commissioned officer, had not been given a legal specialist code.

In the applicant\u2019s case, as a non-commissioned officer, the age of discharge for him was 50. The court also emphasised that that legal norm was imperative, and applied to contracts which were still valid, and not to those which had already expired (teis\u0117s norma skirta reglamentuoti teisinius santykius d\u0117l galiojan\u010dios, o ne pasibaigusios karo tarnybos sutarties nutraukimo). This interpretation also followed from Article 31 \u00a7 4 of LMS, which provided that a contract could be annulled ahead of time in cases provided for in Article 38 of that Law. Moreover, the possibility of the applicant\u2019s military service contract being rescinded had also been mentioned in the contract itself (see paragraph 7 above). Taking into account the imperative nature of Article 38 \u00a7 1 (7), it was the army command\u2019s duty, and not a right, to rescind a contract once the conditions mentioned in that provision had been met. Furthermore, Article 46 of LMS provided only discretion for and not an obligation on the Minister of Defence to extend a serviceman\u2019s military service.",

Given that the essence of his case concerned allegedly unlawful dismissal from military service on a discriminatory basis, to fully present his case the applicant had asked both courts to order his battalion\u2019s commanding officers to provide evidence, which he was not able to obtain on his own, concerning four\u00a0soldiers who had served in the same military unit. If reaching a particular age was an absolute ground for dismissal from military service, those four servicemen should already have been dismissed on the same basis, that is, their age, moreover this should have happened much earlier than when the applicant was dismissed. However, the courts simply ignored the request, without even giving reasons for refusal.

The Government thus took the view that the nature of the responsibilities of those serving in the armed forces of the State involved a special bond of trust and loyalty and exercise of public power. The State therefore enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation regarding discharge from the military and extension of military service contracts. It followed that disputes between the State and its military personnel concerning the application of the provisions of the domestic law on discharge from professional military service should not be regarded as \u201ccivil\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, and thus should fall outside the Court\u2019s competence ratione materiae.",

They noted that it was for the domestic courts to assess the evidence before them, as well as the relevance of given items of evidence, and that Article 6 of the Convention \u201cdoes not lay down any rule on the admissibility of evidence as such\u201d (they referred to Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain, 6\u00a0December 1988, \u00a7 68, Series A no. 146, and Galstyan v. Armenia, no.\u00a026986/03, \u00a7 77, 15 November 2007). That being so, even though the Lithuanian courts had the authority to compel items of evidence to be produced in court under Article 57 \u00a7 4 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings, those courts were primarily entitled to decide on the relevance of certain evidence in the context of the applicant\u2019s case. Similarly, under Article 57 \u00a7 6 of that Law, no evidence had any value set in advance. The Government considered that having objectively and scrupulously examined the applicant\u2019s case in the light of the relevant legal provisions, the domestic courts had found that the prerequisite conditions necessary to discharge a serviceman because of age, established in Articles 38 \u00a7 1 (7) and 45 \u00a7 4 (2) of LMS had been met. Once the administrative courts had established the lawfulness of the legal grounds for the applicant\u2019s discharge, other circumstances, including those related to the military service of four other military officers relied on by the applicant, were no longer relevant to the examination of his case. Lastly, the Government maintained that the servicemen and servicewomen the applicant had described in his request as not discharged despite their age, actually served within the system of national defence in compliance with the provisions of domestic law, including the provisions establishing the allowed age (see paragraphs 36-40 above).",

It reiterates however that in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant\u2019s status as a civil servant, or in this case as a professional soldier, to exclude the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.

Nevertheless, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s dispute concerned his dismissal from professional military service. Nor was the matter of his dispute the extension of his contract. In fact, he had claimed the right, \u201ccivil\u201d in its nature, to continue professional military service until the expiry of the contract he already had. The dispute was genuine and serious and the result of the proceedings was directly decisive for the right in question.

On this point the Court observes that one of the elements of a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is the right to adversarial proceedings; each party must in principle have the opportunity to make known any evidence needed for his claims to succeed (see Mantovanelli v. France, 18\u00a0March 1997, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997II). Moreover, the requirement of \u201cequality of arms\u201d implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case \u2013 including his evidence \u2013 under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see, for instance, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, 27 October 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 274; Helle v. Finland, 19 December 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII). The Court has also held that the effect of Article 6 \u00a7 1 is, inter alia, to place the \u201ctribunal\u201d under a duty to conduct a proper examination of the submissions, arguments and evidence adduced by the parties, without prejudice to its assessment of whether they are relevant to its decision (see Kraska v. Switzerland, 19\u00a0April 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 254B, and Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands, 19 April 1994, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 288).",

Furthermore, while Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law. Nevertheless, the question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair (see Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7 77).",

He submitted that at least four other servicemen in his military unit had been allowed to continue serving after reaching the age of discharge but before the expiry of their contracts. For the applicant, given that an allegation of discrimination was at the heart of his complaint, a comparison between his situation and that of those four other servicemen was indispensable for him to be able to present his grievance (see paragraph\u00a019 above). The applicant reiterated that request on appeal, arguing that the lower court\u2019s refusal to order his military commander to provide evidence related to the service history of those four servicemen had deprived him of the opportunity to show that he was the only soldier to whom the law had been applied so rigorously (see paragraph 25 above).",

The Government have acknowledged that once those courts had established as lawful the applicant\u2019s discharge from professional military service on that ground, other circumstances, including those related to the alleged discrimination and those other four servicemen, were not relevant to the examination of the applicant\u2019s case. The Court cannot subscribe to this view. Whilst being careful not to substitute its own assessment of the facts and evidence for that of the domestic courts, the Court nevertheless considers that the discrimination aspect of the applicant\u2019s complaint should have been addressed by the administrative courts. Although those courts were not bound in law to order the applicant\u2019s commanding officer to produce the evidence he requested and which the applicant was unable to obtain himself, and notwithstanding whether the military service history of those four servicemen would have proved the applicant\u2019s point, that evidence was likely to have a preponderant influence on the assessment of the applicant\u2019s complaint by those courts (see Mantovanelli, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). The Court strikes a note of caution in observing that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument (see Van de Hurk, cited above, \u00a7 61). However, given that the applicant had given full details of which specific evidence he wished to obtain and why it was directly relevant to his complaint and to his wish to influence the courts\u2019 decision, and considering that at that stage of the proceedings it was not yet clear whether that evidence was necessary in order to determine the applicant\u2019s discrimination claim, the Court finds that the administrative courts\u2019 failure to assist the applicant in obtaining evidence and to give it consideration, or at least to provide reasons why this was not necessary, denied the applicant essential means to argue his case. In disputes concerning civil rights, such as the present one, such a limited review cannot be considered to be an effective judicial review under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, K.M.C. v. , no. 19554/11, \u00a7 35, 10\u00a0July\u00a02012, and the case-law cited therein).",

His opinion on the statutory penalties the army imposed on soldiers often did not correspond to that of others at the Ministry of Defence. The applicant stated that he had made many proposals with the aim of improving, inter alia, servicemen\u2019s procedural rights when the new Army Disciplinary Statute was being drafted. As his superiors and the State President had failed to take his proposals into account, the applicant had contacted the Kauno Diena daily and expressed his ideas to the press.

Even though that inquiry had later been discontinued by the authorities\u2019 acknowledgement that the applicant had not violated military discipline, the appeal to Kauno Diena and to the State President had had direct consequences for the applicant. He was dismissed from professional military service before the expiry of his contract. Most importantly, in order to avoid accusations of interference with freedom of expression, the authorities at the Ministry of Defence chose to dismiss him not on the ground that he had appealed to the media, but formally, on the basis of Article 38 \u00a7 1 (7) of LMS, thus leaving no official trace of injustice. If that provision had been applied to others in the same manner, several hundred soldiers would have been dismissed from service, however none of them except the applicant had suffered the same consequences. The example of four soldiers (R.L., V.S., J.\u0160. and M.I.) he relied on during the administrative court proceedings confirmed that there were more soldiers who should have been dismissed from the army, but that this was not done.

They noted that the majority of cases examined by the Court under Article 10 of the Convention had involved either final criminal convictions or civil decisions against a person. In the instant case, however, the internal inquiry into the applicant\u2019s actions regarding the publication, although opened on the very same day as that of the publication, 1\u00a0March\u00a02006, was discontinued on 22 March 2006 on the ground that the acts committed by him did not constitute a disciplinary violation of the Statute of Military Discipline because he had acted within the bounds of his right to impart information, in accordance with Article 21 \u00a7 3 of LMS. A mere internal inquiry into the applicant\u2019s actions, which in itself did not create any consequences for the applicant, therefore could not be considered as constituting an interference with the right to freedom of expression. Even if the Court assumed that the mere opening of an internal inquiry could be seen as interference, the Government considered that it was authorised by, inter alia, Article 36 of LMS which establishes certain restrictions associated with military service, including public expression of disagreement with policies being implemented by the Government of a democratically elected State. The opening of the internal inquiry into the applicant\u2019s acts pursued a legitimate aim \u201cin the interests of national security\u201d and \u201cfor the prevention of disorder\u201d.

The Government also pointed out that in the domestic proceedings concerning his discharge the applicant had raised his allegation of discrimination only very briefly, while in essence disputing the interpretation and application of Article 38 \u00a7\u00a01 (7) of LMS.

On this point the Government referred to the domestic law and facts relating to the service history of those four officers (see paragraphs 36-40 above). In this connection the Government also saw it as relevant to provide the Court with two examples which in their view were analogous to the applicant\u2019s case, where the servicemen were discharged from professional military service on the ground of their age, despite the fact that they still had valid military service contracts (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above).

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb; such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d. Freedom of expression, as enshrined in Article 10, is subject to a number of exceptions, which, however, must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 323, with further references).",

It applies to military personnel as it does to all other persons within the jurisdiction of the Contracting States. Nevertheless, as the Court has previously indicated, it must be open to the State to impose restrictions on freedom of expression where there is a real threat to military discipline, as the proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent servicemen from undermining it. It is not, however, open to the national authorities to rely on such rules for the purpose of frustrating the expression of opinions, even if these are directed against the army as an institution (see Grigoriades, cited above, \u00a7 45; see also Vereinigung demokratischer Soldaten \u00d6sterreichs and Gubi v. Austria, 19 December 1994, \u00a7 36, Series\u00a0A no. 302).",

The Court therefore considers that, as far as it concerns that inquiry in itself, in view of its outcome the applicant cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention. However, it will nevertheless take that investigation into account when examining the main issue in the present case, namely whether the applicant\u2019s military service was terminated solely as a result of the legal necessity to discharge him because of his age, as the Government claimed, or whether, as the applicant argued, he was dismissed because of his opinions.",

In previous cases the Court has indeed found that disciplinary sanction for public remarks (see E.S. v. Germany, cited above), or even prosecution and conviction of the soldier (see Grigoriades, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48) had been a clear indication of an interference with the right to impart ideas, at variance with Article 10\u00a0of the Convention. However, in the instant case such tangible indications are absent. Unlike the facts in Ivanova (\u00a7\u00a084), no new requirements for the applicant\u2019s post, which he did not meet, had been introduced after the publication in Kauno Diena. None of the applicant\u2019s superiors in the army had made public statements to the effect that he should be discharged from the military because of his opinions (see, in contrast and mutatis mutandis, Kosiek v. Germany, 28 August 1986, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 105). It is also noteworthy that the obligation to terminate contracts when the retirement age is reached had been confirmed by the Supreme Administrative Court in its earlier rulings of 2003 and 2004 (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above), which preceded the applicant\u2019s case by some three years and thus illustrate the established practice of the domestic courts.",

He considered that those four soldiers had been in a similar situation to that of himself, but had been treated differently. On this point the Court reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention affords protection against different treatment, without an objective and reasonable justification, of persons in similar situations (see Hoffmann v. Austria, 23\u00a0June 1993, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 255C, and Vojnity v. , no.\u00a029617/07, \u00a7 29, 12 February 2013). However, having given due consideration to the facts (paragraphs 36-40 above), it is the Court\u2019s opinion that such an assertion is not substantiated. The professional military service histories of those four servicemen show that each of them was entitled to serve until the expiry of their contracts, despite the fact that they had reached retirement age, because, unlike the applicant, they had military specialist codes. Conversely, as the applicant himself acknowledged during the court proceedings, at the time of his discharge from the army he had no such status (see paragraphs 19 and 26 above).",
