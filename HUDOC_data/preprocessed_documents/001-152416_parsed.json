Section 4 of the SMRDA provides that compensation is due for all damage which is the direct and proximate result of the unlawful act or omission.

Yet, in a number of other cases the courts rejected such claims, finding that the responsibility of the authorities could not be engaged.

Indeed, the Court has held that proceedings for damages could, in principle, be considered an effective remedy in cases of non-enforcement of final administrative court decisions (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 99; Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 65; Stoyanov and Tabakov, cited above, \u00a7 102). However, in cases where the authorities were expected to take specific action to comply with a final court judgment and not simply pay compensation, the Court has repeatedly dismissed an objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies based on the possibility to bring a tort action against the State (see Hadzhigeorgievi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a041064/05, \u00a7 50, 16 July 2013; Mutishev and Others v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a018967/03, \u00a7 104, 3 December 2009, with further references; Lyubomir Popov v.

Bulgaria, nos. 19130/04, 17694/05 and 27777/06, 25 September 2012). The reason for it was that a compensatory remedy in the form of a claim for damages could not provide adequate redress in a situation where the authorities were called upon to take specific, i.e. non-substitutable measures, as was the case for example where they had to accelerate and complete the process of restitution of agricultural land. The Government have not put forward arguments capable of convincing the Court to depart from the approach adopted in the above cases.",

The Court notes that, in any event, she could have only attempted that remedy as of 1 March 2007 which was more than two and a half years after the judgments in her favour had entered into force. The Court considers that the utility of the information for the purposes of the applicant\u2019s request would have been greatly diminished due to the passage of time. It recalls in this connection that news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication for indeterminate periods, or its dissemination as in the instant case, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian, cited above, \u00a7 60). The Court has held that these principles also apply to the publication of books in general or written texts other than the periodical press (see, in the case of an association applicant complaining about a ban on its publication, Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, \u00a7 57, ECHR\u00a02001VIII).

Therefore, the information was directly related to her work as a member and representative of the association which was active in the field of animal defence. Consequently, the applicant was involved in the legitimate gathering of information of public interest for the purpose of contributing to public debate. According to the applicant, the three final judgments in her favour remained entirely unenforced. As the Government did not provide information capable of demonstrating the opposite, the Court sees no reason to find otherwise. Therefore, by not providing the information which the applicant had sought, the mayor interfered in the preparatory stage of the process of informing the public by creating an administrative obstacle (see, similarly, T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g a Szabads\u00e1gjogok\u00e9rt, cited above, \u00a7 28).

Romania, no.\u00a025329/03, \u00a7 58, 10 May 2012, where it found that the authorities bore no direct responsibility for the restriction of the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression. The reason was that in Fr\u0103sil\u0103 and Cioc\u00eerlan, cited above, a private company, as opposed to a public authority, had prevented the applicants from gaining access to a newsroom which had been ordered in a final judgment in the applicants\u2019 favour. As a result, the Court examined the responsibility of the State as a positive obligation to protect the exercise of the Article 10 rights of the applicants, two journalists, from interference by others. In the present case it was a public authority, the mayor of Vidin, who failed to act in order to implement the final judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour (see paragraph 21 above) despite being bound to do so in law. Consequently, the mayor\u2019s failure to act in accordance with the final judgments constitutes a direct interference with the applicant\u2019s right to receive and ultimately to impart information as enshrined in Article 10 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g a Szabads\u00e1gjogok\u00e9rt, cited above, \u00a7 28; \u00d6sterreichische, cited above, \u00a7 36; Kenedi, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

The Court also notes that on this point the Supreme Administrative Court had held that, as the law did not provide time-limits within which the administrative body had to comply with final judgments, the decision as to when the judgment should be enforced was entirely in the hands of the administrative body concerned (see paragraph 25 above). The Court further observes that, similarly to the situation in T\u00e1rsas\u00e1g a Szabads\u00e1gjogok\u00e9rt, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036, the information in the present case was in the mayor\u2019s exclusive possession and readily available.",

Notwithstanding this, the national judicial practice had accepted that the law itself provided no clear time-frame for enforcement and the question was left to the good will of the administrative body responsible for the implementation of the judgment (see paragraph 25 above). The Court finds that such a lack of clear time-frame for enforcement created unpredictability as to the likely time of enforcement, which, in the event, never materialised. Therefore, the applicable domestic legislation lacked the requisite foreseeability capable of meeting the Court\u2019s test under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

It is worth recalling the relevant passages from the Guerra judgment:",

Thus, it cites the dictum from the Observer and Guardian judgment (\u00a7 59) to the effect that the public has a right to receive information of general interest, without however specifying that the context of this dictum was an averred negative interference with press freedom. It then refers to a number of recent \u2013 largely chamber \u2013 judgments so as to derive from Article 10 a right to receive information on the part of the media and also non-governmental organisations, as an attribute of their vital role as democratic society\u2019s \u201cwatchdogs\u201d in debates on matters of public concern. The gathering or seeking of information by the media and non-governmental organisations is seen as a \u201cpreparatory stage\u201d of the process of informing the public, so that obstruction by a public authority in allowing the media and nongovernmental organisations access to information of public concern constitutes a direct interference with their \u201cright to receive and ultimately to impart information as enshrined in Article 10\u201d. The paragraphs in the two Grand Chamber judgments cited (Gillberg v. Sweden [GC], no. 41723/06, \u00a7\u00a093, 3 April 2012; and Animal Defenders International v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, \u00a7103, 22 April 2013) provide no reasoned authority whatsoever for overturning the unambiguous case-law as stated in, for example, Guerra so as to read into Article 10 a right of access to information, even be it for democratic society\u2019s \u201cpublic watchdogs\u201d. Furthermore, given that Article 10 has been held to embody no right of access to publicly-held personal or private information about oneself, one\u2019s own health, one\u2019s own living conditions, and correspondingly no positive obligation of disclosure on the part of the public information-holder (as in Leander, Gaskin, Guerra and Roche), it is difficult to understand how the judgment nonetheless manages to uncover in Article 10 such a right for the present applicant on the basis of her much weaker and wholly general interest as a \u201cpublic watchdog\u201d.",

It is indeed so that domestic Bulgarian law (the Access to Public Information Act 2000) grants every Bulgarian citizen \u2013 and not only \u201cpublic watchdogs\u201d in the form of the media and non-governmental organisations, it should be noted \u2013 a right of access to public information, unless a lex specialis provides for a special procedure for seeking, receiving and disseminating such information (see paragraph 22 of the judgment).

Likewise, the fact, on which the judgment also seems to place reliance (see paragraph 40 of the judgment), that the respondent Government do not dispute the applicability of Article\u00a010 in the present case \u2013 a concession doubtless prompted by the content of the domestic law \u2013 in no way constitutes a legal ground capable of reversing existing case-law, so as to lead to an interpretational change affecting all the other Contracting States.",

The domestic law did provide for a right of access to information of the kind sought by the applicant and the national courts upheld her claim in the particular circumstances (see paragraphs 9, 13, 17 and 22 of the judgment). The applicant is not complaining to this Court either about the content of the domestic law on access to information or about the manner in which that law was applied in her case by the national courts. Rather, her grievance is that the domestic legal order did not adequately ensure compliance by the mayor of Vidin with the national courts\u2019 judgments directing him to supply her with the requisite information. This is one of the classic aspects of the \u201cright to a court\u201d as safeguarded by Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely the entitlement to proper execution of a judgment delivered at the close of judicial proceedings (see, for example, Hornsby v.

To my mind, separate opinions are not the appropriate place to indulge in lengthy jurisprudential analyses on issues not examined in the main judgment. This being so, I limit myself to the following general observations. The applicable domestic law may well be classified as public law, the party against whom the applicant was asserting her claim was indeed a public official and the direct subject-matter of the litigation concerned the performance by the public official of his public duties, but this is not decisive for the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its civil head. The applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not depend on the status of the parties to the litigation or on the character of the legislation governing the determination of the dispute; what matters is the character of the right at issue, its substantive content and its effects, as well, in some instances, as the incidence of the proceedings for \u201cprivate rights and obligations\u201d (see, for example, K\u00f6nig v. Germany, 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90; and Baraona v. Portugal, 8 July 1987, Series A no. 122, \u00a7\u00a7 42-44). Frequently, where a right of access to information is recognised under domestic law, the person exercising the right will be seeking disclosure of information of direct relevance for his or her private sphere of existence (personal data, personal history, health, education, home, living conditions and so on \u2013 see the kind of information at issue in Leander, Gaskin, Guerra and Roche). Information of public concern being sought by journalists and non-governmental organisations goes to the performance of their professional or associative duties. In my opinion, (a) leaving aside litigation relating to areas held by the Court\u2019s case-law to be outside the \u201ccivil\u201d scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (such as tax matters or election disputes), the private, personal or professional colouring of a right of access to information will generally be sufficient to bring it within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1; and (b) such a sufficient colouring is present on the facts of the present case. In so far as a right of access to information is recognised under domestic law (and without going into the question of whether and, if so, to what extent the Convention embodies any such right in Article 10), treating the domestically recognised right as \u201ccivil\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 by virtue of its private, personal or professional colouring does not entail, I believe, an over-expansionist interpretation of Article 6 \u00a7 1, extending the Convention into fields alien to those contemplated by its drafters.",

It would also impinge on K\u2019s and E\u2019s rights under Article 10, as granted by the Administrative Court of Appeal, to receive information in the form of access to the public documents concerned, and on their rights under Article 6 to have the final judgments of the Administrative Court of Appeal implemented (see, mutatis mutandis, Loiseau v.

The wording of the Convention seems clear. Article 10, paragraph 1, sentence 1 and 2, of the Convention states: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.\u201d The verbs \u201creceive\u201d in English and \u201crecevoir\u201d in French imply that another person is willingly giving something.

The development of technology and especially the Internet has led to a completely different situation today. The quantity of available information and the way it circulates in society have changed substantially. The press has lost its quasi-monopoly on imparting information and access to public debate has been democratised. The role of the press has evolved and its influence has declined considerably. It is no exaggeration to say that today we, the citizens of European States, are all journalists. We (at least many of us) directly access different sources of information, collect or request information from public authorities, impart information to other persons and publicly comment on matters of public interest. We directly participate in public debate through various channels, mainly through the Internet. We are all social watchdogs who oversee the action of the public authorities. Democratic society is - inter alia - a community of social watchdogs. The old distinction between journalists and other citizens is now obsolete.
