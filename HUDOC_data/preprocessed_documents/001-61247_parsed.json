In that connection, the Government drew attention to the recommendations set out in the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) following its visit to  between 27 February and 3 March 1999. In its report, the CPT emphasised that forensic medical examination of detainees by a doctor was a significant safeguard against sexual violence. Accordingly, the CPT had urged the national authorities to take the necessary measures, including the preparation of forensic medical reports, with a view to protecting detainees against sexual violence. Thus, the domestic law and practice had been reformed, inter alia, by the entry into force on 1 October 1998 of regulations on arrest, detention and questioning, and by the adoption of new formal procedures to be followed for forensic medical examinations, including those carried out in respect of allegations of sexual violence.
