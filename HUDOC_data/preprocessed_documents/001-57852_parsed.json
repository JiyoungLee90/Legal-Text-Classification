Certainly the primary purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) as far as criminal matters are concerned is to ensure a fair trial by a \"tribunal\" competent to determine \"any criminal charge\", but it does not follow that the Article (art. 6) has no application to pre-trial proceedings. The \"reasonable time\" mentioned in paragraph 1 (art. 6-1), for instance, begins to run from the moment a \"charge\" comes into being, within the autonomous, substantive meaning to be given to that term (see, for example, the Wemhoff v. Germany judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, pp. 26-27, para. 19, and the Messina v. Italy judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-H, p. 103, para. 25); the Court has occasionally even found that a reasonable time has been exceeded in a case that ended with a discharge (see the Maj v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 196-D, p. 43, paras. 13-15) or at the investigation stage (see the Viezzer v.
