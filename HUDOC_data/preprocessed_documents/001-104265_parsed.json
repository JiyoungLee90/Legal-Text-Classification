It added that, while it was true that freedom to express opinions was not absolute, it could not be subject to prior restraints but only to punitive measures. There should at the very least have been an opportunity to express the opinion, as the actual wording of Article 19 of the Constitution indicated (\u201cwhen this freedom is used\u201d).

He nevertheless pointed out that such freedom was not absolute and could be limited by general restrictions prescribed by law, provided that the imperative requirements of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention were satisfied. However, the wording of that Article made it impossible in his view to prohibit the dissemination of information on the basis of prior scrutiny, as such a measure would impair the very essence of freedom of expression.

It considered that in such cases, the court should ascertain whether the restriction of freedom of expression that might result from the application of section 19(1) of the Act of 25 February 2003 was necessary in the specific circumstances, whether it met a pressing social need and whether it was proportionate to the aim pursued by that provision. In accordance with section 19(1) of the Act in question, restrictions could therefore not be imposed on the right of citizens to express their opinions, even in the polemical tone that could typify public debate on social phenomena, and even where such opinions offended, shocked or disturbed the State or any sector of the population.",

The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied\u201d (see, in particular, Vernillo v.

Beyond the sphere of criminal law, the audio-visual media differed from the print media in terms of their nature and effects. The mere existence of a licensing system, linked to the very nature of the audio-visual media, in itself excluded such media from the scope of Article 25 of the Constitution, which did not allow any form of censorship, a concept that indisputably encompassed licensing.

The extremely severe penalties referred to in the above-mentioned case were not applicable to the audio-visual media, whose freedom of expression was governed exclusively by Article 19 of the Constitution, a provision that did not prohibit censorship in such absolute terms as Article 25 did. That being so, Article 19 allowed a preventive system to operate with regard to freedom of expression, subject to certain fundamental conditions. In order to assess the level of acceptability of a preventive measure in a democratic State, a clear distinction had to be made between arbitrary intervention on the part of the executive and a situation where the courts were called upon to intervene at the request of a party in the context of a dispute between two private individuals, with a limit on the duration of any prior restraints.",

Its case-law concerning preventive and restrictive measures affecting the exercise of freedom of expression had been well established since the judgment of 9 December 1981 (see paragraph 39 above) and had been applied on many subsequent occasions. In addition, the Belgian Parliament had had occasion to enact a number of measures entailing general bans on expression, for example through Articles 383 and 378 bis of the Criminal Code. A reading of Article\u00a0144 of the Constitution and Article 18, second paragraph, Article 19, second paragraph, and Articles 584 and 1039 of the Judicial Code, taken together, suggested that preventive measures affecting the exercise of freedom of expression could be taken by the urgent-applications judge on an interim basis, in the event of an emergency, to prevent the infringement of a civil right protected by the Constitution and the Convention, after the judge had weighed up the interests at stake, such measures being limited to cases involving flagrant violations of the rights of others. Lastly, the Court of Cassation had taken the view that only the provisions of the Judicial Code and Article 144 of the Constitution counted as the \u201claw\u201d forming the basis for the interference in issue, and not Article 8 of the Convention, which could serve solely as the legitimate aim that could be pursued by an interference with freedom of expression but not as the law on which the interference was based.",

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. While certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity; and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

A law may still satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. This is particularly true in relation to persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation. On this account they can be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, for example, Cantoni v.\u00a0France, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 35, Reports 1996-V, and Chauvy and Others v.

However, the distinction made by the Belgian Court of Cassation on the basis of the medium by which information is conveyed \u2013 that is, the application of different Articles of the Constitution for the print and audio-visual media \u2013 does not appear decisive in the instant case. It does not ensure protection through a strict legal framework for the prior restrictions permitted by the Convention on the dissemination of information, ideas and opinions, especially as the domestic courts have not settled the question of the meaning of the notion of \u201ccensorship\u201d as prohibited by Article 25 of the Constitution. In this connection, the Court notes that not only are there discrepancies in the approaches taken by urgent-applications judges in such matters in Belgium; there are also divergences in the case-law of the supreme courts (see paragraph 110 above). It would add that if prior restraints are required in the media sphere, they must form part of a legal framework ensuring both tight control over the scope of any bans and effective judicial review to prevent potential abuses (see Association Ekin, cited above, \u00a7 58).",
