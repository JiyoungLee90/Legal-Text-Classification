The applicant received a number of visits from his parents before his conviction entered into force (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above). He did not allege that he had requested more visits or visits of longer duration during that period. The applicant provided no details at all as regards family visits during the period after his conviction had entered into force on 5\u00a0August 2005. On a general level, he failed to demonstrate that the restrictions on family visits imposed by the law had adversely affected his ability to have meetings with his close relatives as often as he had wished (see, mutatis mutandis, Zinchenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no. 63763/11, \u00a7\u00a7 100-01, 13\u00a0March 2014; by contrast, Shalimov v.

In those circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine in abstracto whether the domestic regulations limiting the number of family visits, as applicable in the applicant\u2019s case, satisfied the requirements of Article 8 of the Convection (see Yaroshovets and Others, cited above, \u00a7 175).
