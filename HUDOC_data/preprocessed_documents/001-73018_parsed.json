At the material time the applicant could not challenge the institution or reinstitution of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 34 above), whereas the higher prosecution authorities had an unlimited power to revoke the investigator\u2019s acquittal and to order further inquiries into the case, thus depriving the claim for compensation of any prospect of success (see paragraph 26 above; Panteleyenko v.

The Court recalls that the duty to administer justice expeditiously is incumbent on the relevant authorities (Mitchell and Holloway v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 44808/98, \u00a7 56, 17 December 2002). It observes that the trial court had at its disposal effective mechanisms to ensure witnesses\u2019 attendance (paragraph 31 above).

Nor did the trial court\u2019s compulsory summonses of 4 March 1999 seem to have any effect.",
