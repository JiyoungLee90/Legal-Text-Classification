For some reason, the investigators had failed to explain why Beslan Tsoroyev had come out of the house with his hands up and only after he had gone back inside for additional documents had he allegedly decided to open fire on the officers. The applicant stressed that the unlawful refusal to initiate a fully-fledged criminal investigation had deprived him of his victim status, which he would have had if a criminal case had been opened.

There had been no traces of gunshot wounds on his body, all of the wounds he had received had been to his head, which disproved the officers\u2019 version that there had been an exchange of gunfire. Assuming that Beslan Tsoroyev had opened fire on the officers as alleged, given that none of them had been injured, bullet casings would have been found in the room and there would have been damage to the walls or other objects in it. However, it had not been established that there had been any damage to any of the items in the room or the walls, and no bullets other than the ones which had killed the applicant\u2019s son had been collected from the crime scene. Furthermore, the investigators had failed to take gunshot residue swabs from Beslan Tsoroyev\u2019s hands, and the officers\u2019 allegation that he had opened fire on them using the AK machine gun was implausible, as this would be physically impossible if a person was holding the gun in one hand. Owing to the lack of support, such a position would allow for just one shot. Therefore, the alleged exchange of gunfire had been staged and the machine gun had been placed next to Beslan Tsoroyev\u2019s body after his execution.",

The forensic report failed to examine whether the machine gun which had allegedly belonged to Beslan Tsoroyev and had allegedly been used to shoot at the officers had actually had his fingerprints on it. It appears that such an examination, along with an examination of Beslan Tsoroyev\u2019s hands for gunshot residue (see paragraph 15 above), would have been crucial, with a view to verifying the officers\u2019 denials that they had planted the machine gun next to his body (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above). Those basic expert examinations were not carried out or commissioned at a later stage, despite the fact that Beslan Tsoroyev\u2019s body had been examined at the scene (see paragraph 15 above). Furthermore, the investigators failed to examine the casings which had been collected in order to determine: which bullets had caused Mr Tsoroyev\u2019s death (see paragraphs 16 above) and from whose firearm they had come; which ones had come from the AK machine gun found next to him; and which one had hit the protective shield of one of the officers. They had also failed to establish whether it would have been at all possible for Beslan Tsoroyev to fire at least ten shots from the machine gun using only one hand, in front of the FSB officers, and only hit the protective shield and not the officers themselves or the furniture or walls (see paragraph 26 above). Lastly, it is noteworthy that the investigators did not question either the other participants involved in the special operation carried out at the applicant\u2019s house on 7 December 2009 or the applicant\u2019s neighbours, who could have provided relevant information (see paragraph\u00a020 above).",
