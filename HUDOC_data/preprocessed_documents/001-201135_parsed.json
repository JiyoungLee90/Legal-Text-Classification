The compensation included differences in natural gas and electricity prices, increasing pensions, giving tax breaks and preferential credits to agricultural companies in the region, and allocating diesel fuel for agricultural activities.

The Court also found in subsequent cases concerning the Transdniestrian region that up until July 2010 the \u201cMRT\u201d had only been able to continue to exist and to resist Moldovan and international efforts to resolve the conflict and bring democracy and the rule of law to the region because of Russian military, economic and political support (see Ivan\u0163oc and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a011620; Catan and Others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012122; and Mozer, \u00a7\u00a7 108 and 110, all cited above).
