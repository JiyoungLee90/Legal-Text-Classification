The text of the exclusion order showed that it had been adopted on purely formal grounds, without any analysis of her way of life, matrimonial status or family situation. The authorities had asserted that she posed a threat to public health but had not explained what the basis for that assertion was. The applicant pointed out that the Consumer Protection Authority had received the documents relating to her diagnosis on 24 February 2012 and issued the exclusion order on 9\u00a0June 2012, without taking into consideration that she had contracted a marriage in the meantime, on 16 March 2012. She had never been convicted of any offence, she was married to a Russian national, her son had acquired Russian nationality by birth and her daughter went to a Russian school. The interference with her right to respect for her family life had not pursued any legitimate aim, had not been justified by any public need and had been disproportionate to the objective pursued by the law. Finally, the applicant emphasised that she had been born in the Soviet Union prior to the declaration of Ukraine\u2019s independence and should enjoy at least the same level of protection as long-term immigrants (she referred to point 8 of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1504 (2001) and to Balogun v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a060286/09, \u00a7 45, 10 April 2012).",

It had not been shown that she and her husband would not be able to continue their family life in Ukraine or that she would not receive appropriate treatment there (here the Government referred to N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a026565/05, ECHR 2008). The Government maintained that the exclusion order had been issued in full compliance with domestic legal requirements and had been sent to the applicant by registered mail. The decision had been based on medical evidence which the hospital had provided to the CPA and which had been issued in connection with the applicant\u2019s infectious disease. The CPA had not examined the applicant\u2019s family situation because at the time it had received the medical documents her marriage to a Russian national had not been yet celebrated, and also because Russian law, in accordance with established social and cultural traditions, only extended its protection to civil marriages. The applicant had not produced documents to show she had been registered with the local Aids prevention centre. Lastly, the Government invited the Court to distinguish the present case from De\u00a0Souza Ribeiro v. France ([GC], no. 22689/07, ECHR 2012), in which the applicant had not had an opportunity to have the lawfulness of a removal order examined before being deported. In contrast, in the present case the applicant\u2019s husband had been able to exercise all the procedural rights he had under Russian law in the judicial proceedings he had instituted before the domestic courts. The Government cited, by way of example, a number of judgments in which Russian courts had found for claimants in similar circumstances.",

Where immigration is concerned, Article 8 cannot be considered as imposing a general obligation on a State to respect the choice of married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion on its territory (see G\u00fcl v.\u00a0Switzerland, 19 February 1996, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions\u00a01996I).

The first of these requirements, namely that any interference be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, in order to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7\u00a0247, ECHR 2015, and Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000-XI).

It is important to note that those failings were not accounted for by the case being of any particular urgency or by any other objective of public importance. Rather, they resulted from strict adherence to the regulatory framework set out in the Guidance issued by the CPA (see paragraphs 26-30 above). The Guidance establishes that a decision pronouncing a foreign national\u2019s presence undesirable is issued ex parte, on the basis of a purely internal assessment by the central office of the CPA on a proposal from the regional CPA. It makes no provision for any form of involvement of the individual concerned or any communication with him or her during the decision-making process.",

The Court does not find this explanation persuasive. On the facts, it observes that the applicant was married on 16\u00a0March 2012 and that the exclusion order was issued on 9\u00a0June 2012, that is, almost three months later. The domestic authorities thus had ample time to obtain information about the applicant\u2019s marriage, had they considered it relevant. That they did not obtain it is attributable not so much to a lack of diligence on their part as to the shortcomings of the existing legal framework for issuing decisions pronouncing the presence of HIV-positive non-nationals undesirable. As the Court has previously found, the relevant provisions of Russian law, including section 11(2) of the HIV Prevention Act, are of an imperative nature, leaving no room for an individualised assessment of the facts of a particular case (see Kiyutin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02700/10, \u00a7 72, ECHR\u00a02011). The CPA\u2019s Guidance does not contain any obligation to hear the individual concerned or take account of the specific circumstances of his or her case. The only element that the regional CPA needs to verify is the medical evidence of the person\u2019s being infected with a communicable disease (see paragraph 27 above). Admittedly, the Guidance mentions that the Epidemiological and Legal Departments of the central CPA must identify any grounds capable of justifying the authority\u2019s refraining from issuing an exclusion order and ensure that the order is compatible with Russian constitutional law and human rights obligations (see paragraph 28 above). However, it is unclear how any such grounds or incompatibility issues could be identified in practice, given that the material submitted for analysis by the central CPA is confined to a person\u2019s medical diagnosis and the previously prepared text of a decision.",

The CPA did not refer to any elements relevant to her case, which included an established family life with a Russian national; the best interests of her first child, who was enrolled in a Russian school; the advanced stage of her pregnancy and her current state of health; and the absence of any indication of blameworthy behaviour. The Court emphasises that a decision based on a predetermined classification of an entire group of vulnerable individuals \u2013 people living with HIV in the instant case \u2013 as a threat to public health solely because of their condition, without assessment of their individual situations, cannot be considered compatible with Convention requirements (see Kiyutin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a073, and Alajos Kiss v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 38832/06, \u00a7 44, 20 May 2010).",

They referred to a list of correspondence which had supposedly been taken to the post office for dispatch on 19\u00a0June 2012 (see paragraph 11 above). However, their assertion is not borne out by the evidence in the case file. The distinguishing feature of registered correspondence, as opposed to ordinary mail, is traceability of receipt: it has a tracking number and the recipient must sign for it. The CPA\u2019s Guidance also provided that a notification should be made in a traceable manner, whether by hand delivery or with acknowledgement of receipt (see paragraph 29 above). Had the notification indeed been sent by registered mail as the Government\u2019s document seemed to suggest, the domestic authorities should have been in possession of an acknowledgement-of-receipt card bearing the applicant\u2019s signature. That document was not submitted to the Court. It lends therefore credence to the applicant\u2019s assertion that she had not been notified about the exclusion order. It also appears irregular that the dispatch of the decision of 9 June 2012, which required the applicant to leave Russia by 22 June, was delayed by more than ten days, until 19\u00a0June, meaning that it was allegedly sent to her just three days before the expiry of the time-limit. Because of the failure to serve the order, the applicant only discovered the existence of the exclusion order barring her return to Russia after one year, as she was returning home from Ukraine with the children. As a result, she was forced to stay in Ukraine with her daughter, while her eight-month-old son remained in the care of her husband in Russia.",

Its text was identical to the text of the sample notification annexed to the CPA\u2019s Guidance (see paragraph 30 above). It went no further than informing the recipient of the applicable procedural provisions of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act and directing her to leave Russia or face deportation. A copy of the CPA\u2019s decision was not enclosed with the notification and the Guidance made no provision for it to be communicated to the individual concerned. The Court considers that the non-communication of the factual and legal reasons for adopting the exclusion order denied the applicant adequate protection against arbitrary interference with her right to respect for family life. The lack of reasoning must also have undermined the applicant\u2019s ability to exercise her right to bring legal proceedings in an effective manner because she could not mount a defence against unknown charges.",

Bulgaria, no. 41416/08, \u00a7\u00a0102, 26 July 2011). The Krasnodar Regional Court described that threat as a \u201creal\u201d one, without elaborating why it was so. Both of the applicant\u2019s applications for a cassation review, addressed first to the Regional Court and later to the Supreme Court, were dismissed without addressing the detailed legal arguments relating to the established case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Convention or factual elements militating against the disruption of her family life. The Russian courts did not attempt to perform any balancing exercise conforming with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law under Article\u00a08 of the Convention (compare Gablishvili, cited above, \u00a7 56, and Liu (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 89).
