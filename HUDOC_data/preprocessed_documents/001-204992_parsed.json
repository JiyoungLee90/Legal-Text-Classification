The good-governance principle should not, as a general rule, prevent the authorities from correcting occasional mistakes, even those resulting from their own negligence. However, the need to correct an old \u201cwrong\u201d should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority\u2019s action in good faith (see Beinarovi\u010d and Others v.

The reason for the quashing of the final decision in the applicant\u2019s favour was the need to fulfil the aim of the insolvency proceedings, that is, to satisfy the creditors\u2019 claims to the greatest extent possible and hence to protect their property rights. The domestic authorities carried out a balancing exercise between the applicant\u2019s right to remuneration and the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions of the creditors. In the proceedings that followed the quashing of the final decision, the applicant\u2019s claim for remuneration for the work carried out, which had never been contested per se, was still granted, although in a much lower amount, calculated in accordance with the applicable domestic law. The applicant, a lawyer appointed as the insolvency administrator, was aware or at least ought to have been aware of the relevant legal framework. In addition, the domestic courts explained the manner in which they had interpreted the law and provided the applicant with sufficient answers to his arguments and objections. From a procedural point of view, those proceedings do not seem to have been arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. Taking all of the above into account, the Court is of the opinion that the applicant was not made to bear an individual and excessive burden, all the more so since he did not assert that the obligation to pay back the difference between the amounts several years later had represented such a burden to him (see, mutatis mutandis, Industrial Financial Consortium Investment Metallurgical Union, cited above, \u00a7 199).",
