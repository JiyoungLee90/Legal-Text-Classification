Lithuania, nos.\u00a055480/00 and 59330/00, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2004VIII). Article 8 of the Convention protects the right to personal development (see K.A. and A.D. v.\u00a0Belgium, nos. 42758/98 and 45558/99, \u00a7\u00a083, 17 February 2005), whether in terms of personality (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002-VI) or of personal autonomy, which is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the Article 8 guarantees (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2002-III). The Court acknowledges that everyone has the right to live privately, away from unwanted attention (see Smirnova v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a046133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 95, ECHR 2003IX (extracts)). It also considers that it would be too restrictive to limit the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d to an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual may live his or her own personal life as he or she chooses, thus excluding entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 251B). Article 8 thus guarantees a right to \u201cprivate life\u201d in the broad sense, including the right to lead a \u201cprivate social life\u201d, that is, the possibility for the individual to develop his or her social identity. In that respect, the right in question enshrines the possibility of approaching others in order to establish and develop relationships with them (see Bigaeva v. Greece, no.\u00a026713/05, \u00a7 22, 28 May 2009, and \u00d6zp\u0131nar v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a020999/04, \u00a7 45 in fine, 19 October 2010).",

Restrictions on an individual\u2019s professional life may fall within Article 8 where they have repercussions on the manner in which he or she constructs his or her social identity by developing relationships with others. It should be noted in this connection that it is in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant, if not the greatest, opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz, cited above, \u00a7 29).",

And indeed, the Court has already held that, in the context of correspondence by means of telephone calls, no such qualification is to be made. In a number of cases relating to correspondence with a lawyer, it has not even envisaged the possibility that Article 8 might be inapplicable on the ground that the correspondence was of a professional nature (see Niemietz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a032, with further references). Furthermore, it has held that telephone conversations are covered by the notions of \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 (see Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7\u00a0173, ECHR 2015). In principle, this is also true where telephone calls are made from or received on business premises (see Halford, cited above, \u00a7 44, and Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000II).

In order to ascertain whether the notions of \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d are applicable, the Court has on several occasions examined whether individuals had a reasonable expectation that their privacy would be respected and protected (ibid.; and as regards \u201cprivate life\u201d, see also K\u00f6pke v. Germany (dec.), no. 420/07, 5\u00a0October 2010).

In addition, the employer had sent all employees an information notice dated 26 June 2007 reminding them that personal use of company resources was prohibited and explaining that an employee had been dismissed for breaching this rule (see paragraph 15 above). The applicant acquainted himself with the notice and signed a copy of it on an unspecified date between 3 and 13 July 2007 (see paragraph 16 above). The Court notes lastly that on 13 July 2007 the applicant was twice summoned by his employer to provide explanations as to his personal use of the internet (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). Initially, after being shown the charts indicating his internet activity and that of his colleagues, he argued that his use of his Yahoo Messenger account had been purely work-related (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above).

With regard to the possibility of monitoring, it notes that the County Court simply observed that \u201cthe employees\u2019 attention had been drawn to the fact that, shortly before the applicant\u2019s disciplinary sanction, another employee had been dismissed\u201d (see paragraph 28 above) and that the Court of Appeal found that the applicant had been warned that he should not use company resources for personal purposes (see paragraph 30 above). Accordingly, the domestic courts omitted to determine whether the applicant had been notified in advance of the possibility that the employer might introduce monitoring measures, and of the scope and nature of such measures. The Court considers that to qualify as prior notice, the warning from the employer must be given before the monitoring activities are initiated, especially where they also entail accessing the contents of employees\u2019 communications. International and European standards point in this direction, requiring the data subject to be informed before any monitoring activities are carried out (see paragraphs 38 and 43\u00a0above; see also, for a comparative-law perspective, paragraph 53 above).",

As it has considerable latitude to determine in which cases such an award should be made to the applicants, the Court sometimes concludes that the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction and that no monetary award is required (see, among many other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria, no. 31195/96, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-II; Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, ECHR 2013 (extracts); and Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, ECHR 2016). In order to arrive at that conclusion, the Court will have regard to all the facts of the case, including the nature of the violations found and any special circumstances pertaining to the context of the case (see, for example, Vinter and Others, cited above, and the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Spielmann, Saj\u00f3, Karaka\u015f and Pinto de Albuquerque in the case of Murray, cited above). Where this is warranted by the circumstances of the case, as in McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (27 September 1995, \u00a7 219, Series A no.\u00a0324), in which the Court declined to make any award in respect of nonpecuniary damage in view of the fact that the three terrorist suspects who had been killed had been intending to plant a bomb in Gibraltar, or by the nature of the violation found, as in the case of Tarakhel v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 29217/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts)), the Court rules that the finding of a violation in itself affords sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage.

This conclusion is underlined by the fact that there is no European consensus on this matter and only six out of thirty-four surveyed Council of Europe member States have explicitly regulated the issue of the workplace privacy (see paragraphs 52 and 118 of the judgment). Secondly, the \u201cmeasures\u201d adopted by the State under Article 8 should in principle take the form of an adequate \u201clegal framework\u201d affording protection to the victim.

We further observe that the applicant had been informed of the internal regulations, since he had acquainted himself with them and signed a copy of them on 20 December 2006 (see paragraph 14 of the judgment). The domestic courts interpreted the provisions of that instrument as implying that it was possible that measures might be taken to monitor communications, an eventuality that was likely to reduce significantly the likelihood of any reasonable expectation on the applicant\u2019s part that the privacy of his correspondence would be respected (contrast Halford v. the United Kingdom, 25 June 1997, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, and Copland, cited above, \u00a7 42).

While the domestic courts attached greater weight to the employer\u2019s right to ensure the smooth running of the company and to supervise how employees performed their tasks in the context of their employment relationship than to the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life and correspondence, we consider that it is not unreasonable for an employer to wish to check that its employees are carrying out their professional duties when making use in the workplace and during working hours of the equipment which it has made available to them. The Court of Appeal found that the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s communications was the only way for the employer to achieve this legitimate aim, prompting it to conclude that a fair balance had been struck between the need to protect the applicant\u2019s private life and the employer\u2019s right to supervise the operation of its business (see paragraph 30 of the judgment).",

The domestic authorities attached significant weight in their analysis to the applicant\u2019s attitude in the disciplinary proceedings, during which he had denied using his employer\u2019s resources for personal purposes and had maintained that he had used them solely for work-related purposes, which was incorrect (see paragraphs 28 and 30 of the judgment). They were plainly entitled to do so. This was confirmed when the applicant asserted before this Court that, despite the fact that he knew that private use of his work computer was prohibited, it would only have been an awareness of monitoring by the employer which would have led him not to engage in private use of the employer\u2019s computer; he did not deny that he was informed about the monitoring, but could not remember when he had received the information notice alerting him to the monitoring.",
