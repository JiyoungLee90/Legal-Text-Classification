H.A. had then ordered her to return the appraisal report, which she had refused to do, stating that she would write down her objections, sign the document and then return it to him. When she had been about to leave, H.A. had immediately closed and locked the door to his office and had started to approach her, shouting that she was a thief and had stolen a document from his office. Using physical violence and personal insults, he had tried to take the papers from her. After she had called for help, A.K. had entered the office and instead of diffusing the situation had also insulted her and ordered her to hand him the documents. The two of them had grabbed her hands, causing her serious pain, and forcibly taken away the papers. As a result of the stress and pain she had fainted for a short period of time, after which she had been told that she could leave as there was nothing else to discuss.

In particular, she had submitted that first H.A. had grabbed her hands using force, harassed her and locked her in his office so that she could not leave. Thereafter A.K. had come in and also assaulted her. The applicant complained that the conclusion in the investigator\u2019s decision, according to which H.A. and A.K. had caused her injuries by negligence, could not be substantiated and pursued the purpose of exonerating public officials from responsibility. She further complained that, as a result of deliberate violence on the part of H.A. and A.K., she had experienced severe emotional suffering as a woman since her superior had debased her and caused her serious bodily harm without good reason, right in the workplace. In addition, the applicant stated that the incident had taken place in the workplace and naturally all the witnesses questioned by the investigator were the subordinates of H.A. and A.K.

However, in the present case, no investigation was ever launched, nor was any internal investigation conducted within the Ministry. During the inquiry, the domestic authorities did not make any serious attempts to find out what had happened. No steps were taken, for example, to take evidence from the applicant\u2019s colleagues under oath in order to avoid any possible problems created by the fact that they were subordinates of the alleged perpetrators. It was not established how the applicant\u2019s injuries were inflicted, in which circumstances and whether they were related to the impugned incident. Furthermore, no efforts were made to clarify certain contradictions in H.A.\u2019s statements (see paragraphs 12 and 18 above) or to investigate whether his statements were accurate. Nor were any steps taken by the head of staff of the Ministry (see paragraph 8 above) or other administrative authorities prior to 14 January 2012 when the applicant reported the matter to the police.",
