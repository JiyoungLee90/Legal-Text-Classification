The Instruction on the Procedure for Providing Financial Assistance for Reconstruction had been adopted in 2006 and published in the Official Gazette of Bosnia and  (no. 48/06 of 26 June 2006). Funds with the same purpose had also been established in the Entities and in the Cantons. Public announcements calling for applications for financial assistance to reconstruct housing are published yearly.

The Government maintained that the applicant had failed to seek funding for the reconstruction of his pre-war flat through the fund. They further submitted that in giving the judgment of 25 March 2005 the Municipal Court had evidently misapplied the relevant civil law and had determined that the local authority had an obligation to provide the applicant with a replacement flat solely on the basis of their decision to confirm his occupancy right (see paragraph 7 above).",

It does not in itself guarantee any particular content for \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d in the substantive law of the Contracting States (see, inter alia, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 81, Series A no. 98; Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1990, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 172; Z\u00a0and Others v. the  [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7 87, ECHR\u00a02001V; and Ahtinen v. , no. 48907/99, \u00a7 38, 23 September 2008). The Court may not create through the interpretation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 a substantive right which has no legal basis in the State concerned (see Roche v. the  [GC], no. 32555/96, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2005X, and Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, \u00a7 65, Series A no. 294B). Article 6 \u00a7 1 will, however, apply to disputes of a \u201cgenuine and serious nature\u201d concerning the actual existence of a right, as well as to the scope or manner in which it is exercised (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23 October 1985, \u00a7 32, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a097). \u00a0In assessing whether there is a civil \u201cright\u201d, the Court\u2019s starting-point must be the provisions of the relevant domestic law and their interpretation by the domestic courts (Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 327A). It is necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and to concentrate on the realities of the situation (see Van\u00a0Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 24\u00a0June 1982, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 50, and Roche v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 121). Furthermore, the Court has only limited power to deal with alleged errors of fact or law committed by the national courts, to which it falls in the first place to interpret and apply the domestic law (see, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.  [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999I; Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, \u00a7 59, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998II; and Kopeck\u00fd v.

However, that right would be illusory if a \u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to the courts and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. , 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997-II, and Immobiliare Saffi v.

Romania [GC], no.\u00a028342/95, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 1999VII, and Jeli\u010di\u0107 v. , no. 41183/02, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2006XII).
