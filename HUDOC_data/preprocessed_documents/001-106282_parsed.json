Delivering judgment, the Immigration Judge indicated that the various factors to which this Court\u2019s case-law refers had been taken into account. He noted that the applicant was 20 years old and had spent almost fourteen years, including his youth and formative years, in . He further observed that the applicant had resided for six years and seven months in the , a period which included two years and four months spent on remand or serving his sentence. He also considered the strength of the applicant\u2019s connections to the United Kingdom, observing that he was close to his mother (now a British citizen), sisters and uncle, all of whom resided in the , that he attended a church and that he was studying at university. The judge further had regard to the applicant\u2019s personal history, including his rape conviction and the grant of Indefinite Leave to Remain in July 2003. He took account of the applicant\u2019s domestic circumstances and his permanent residence with his mother and previous good character. He examined the nature of the offence for which the applicant was convicted, including the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks (see paragraph 8 above) and the absence of any reference to deportation, and accepted that the applicant was at low risk of re-offending. He considered the likely period before the applicant would be able to apply for re-entry, which he assessed at eight years, observing that by that time the applicant was unlikely to have any ground for applying for entry clearance. Finally, he considered compassionate circumstances and the public interest. In respect of the latter, the judge noted that the presumption was in favour of deportation, that the applicant was 20 and in good health, that he had a grandfather with a home in Nigeria and probably had more relatives in  than he had admitted and that family visits would be possible. He concluded (at paragraph 130):",

In Boujlifa v.

In Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 62, the Court recalled, in the case of an applicant who had reached the age of majority by the time the exclusion order became final but was living with his parents, that it had accepted in a number of cases that the relationship between young adults who had not founded a family of their own and their parents or other close family members also constituted \u201cfamily life\u201d.",

However, it is not necessary to decide the question given that, as Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8. Thus, regardless of the existence or otherwise of a \u201cfamily life\u201d, the expulsion of a settled migrant constitutes an interference with his right to respect for private life. While the Court has previously referred to the need to decide in the circumstances of the particular case before it whether it is appropriate to focus on \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than \u201cprivate life\u201d, it observes that in practice the factors to be examined in order to assess the proportionality of the deportation measure are the same regardless of whether family or private life is engaged (\u00dcner, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60).",

However, it appears that the aims asserted by the Government in these cases were not disputed by the applicants. Further, the Court notes that in \u00dcner, prior to commission of the offence in respect of which deportation was ordered, the applicant had committed other less serious, although still violent, offences and had not produced any evidence to support his statement that his risk of reoffending was low (see \u00a7 24 of the judgment).

However, the State\u2019s margin of appreciation in this regard goes hand in hand with European supervision and the Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8 (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 76).",

The sentence imposed \u2013 four years in a Young Offenders\u2019 Institution \u2013 demonstrates the gravity of the offence. However, the fact that the applicant was a minor at the time the offence was committed is a relevant consideration in assessing the proportionality of a deportation (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 72). In this regard, the Court recalls that where offences committed by a minor underlie an exclusion order, regard must be had to the best interests of the child. In particular, the obligation to take the best interests of the child into account includes an obligation to facilitate his reintegration, an aim that the Court has previously held will not be achieved by severing family or social ties through expulsion (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83).",

Further, following his conviction, he spent some two years in detention, during which time he was served with a deportation order. While the applicant was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain during this period, the Court is persuaded by the Government\u2019s submissions that leave was granted in ignorance of the applicant\u2019s conviction and, as a result, considers that no significance can be attached to the fact that Indefinite Leave to Remain was granted following the conviction (compare and contrast Omojudi, cited above, \u00a7 42).

At the time of his release from detention in August 2004, his risk of reoffending was assessed to be low (see paragraph 11 above), an assessment subsequently reiterated by his probation officer in 2005 and accepted by the AIT in 2007 (see paragraphs 15 and 20 above).

The Court reiterates that the factors to be taken into consideration in cases involving deportation following a criminal offence are partially designed to evaluate the extent to which the applicant can be expected to cause disorder or to engage in criminal activities (see paragraph 57 above). In particular, the fact that a significant period of good conduct has elapsed following the commission of the offence necessarily has an impact on the assessment of the risk which the applicant poses to society (see Boultif, cited above, \u00a7 51; Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 90; and A.W.

The Court recalls that according to its established case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, the existence of a risk faced by an applicant in the country to which he is to be expelled is assessed by reference to the facts which were known or ought to have been known at the time of the expulsion; in cases where the applicant has not yet been deported, the risk is assessed at the time of the proceedings before the Court (see Saadi v.  [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 133, ECHR 2008...). The Court sees no reason to take a different approach to the assessment of the proportionality of a deportation under Article 8 of the Convention and points out in this regard that its task is to assess the compatibility with the Convention of the applicant\u2019s actual expulsion and not of the final expulsion order (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 93). Any other approach would render the protection of the Convention theoretical and illusory by allowing Contracting States to expel applicants months, even years, after a final order had been made notwithstanding the fact that such expulsion would be disproportionate having regard to subsequent developments. The Government have not explained whether further remedies within the domestic legal system are now available to allow the applicant to challenge his deportation a second time, nor have they suggested that the Court is precluded from examining developments on the basis that the applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies. In the circumstances, it is appropriate for the Court itself to assess the effect of this additional lapse of time on the proportionality of the applicant\u2019s deportation.",

The Court has further referred to the importance, in cases where the deportation offence was committed by the applicant when he was a minor, of facilitating his reintegration into society (see paragraph 60 above). Thus while the fact that the applicant was a minor when he committed the offence does not preclude his deportation given the seriousness of the offence in question, the latter consideration must be carefully weighed against the applicant\u2019s exemplary conduct and, as the evidence before the Court demonstrates, commendable efforts to rehabilitate himself and to reintegrate into society over a period of seven years. In such circumstances, the Government are required to provide further support for their contention that the applicant can reasonably be expected to cause disorder or to engage in criminal activities such as to render his deportation necessary in a democratic society.
