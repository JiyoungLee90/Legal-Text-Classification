In the context of prisoners, the Court has already emphasised in previous cases that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect them. It is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered in custody, which obligation is particularly stringent where that individual dies (see, for example, Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 91, and Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7 99, ECHR 2000-VII).",

The positive obligations require States to make regulations compelling hospitals, whether private or public, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients' lives.

Furthermore, where a hospital is a public institution, the acts and omissions of its medical staff are capable of engaging the responsibility of the respondent State under the Convention (see Glass v. the , no. 61827/00, \u00a7\u00a071, ECHR 2004II).",

However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained. Disciplinary measures may also be envisaged (see Vo, cited above, \u00a7 90; Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, \u00a7 51; Lazzarini and Ghiacci v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no.\u00a053749/00, 7 November 2002; and Mastromatteo v.

The crucial element for its assessment of that period is the absence of any indication of a medical examination by a gastroenterologist after Mr Tarariyev's return to the colony and until the grave deterioration of his condition twenty days later. As noted above, the colony officials were fully aware of Mr Tarariyev's medical history of stomach ulcer and this was mentioned in the duplicate medical record (see paragraph 53 above). Lacking current and reliable information on his state of health \u2013 as his original medical record had either been left behind at the Krasnodar detention centre or mislaid at the colony \u2013, the colony authorities did not arrange for his examination by a specialist, confining their observations to the mention that he was not infected with tuberculosis, considered himself healthy and made no complaints. The Court considers, however, that in case of a prisoner returning from hospital with a known history of medical ailments, the authorities are under an obligation to ensure appropriate follow-up care independent of the initiative being taken by the prisoner (see the CPT's General Report on the standards of health care in prisons, cited in paragraph 67 above). Although the applicant's allegation that her son had to rely on plants for self-treatment cannot be verified, his medical record contains no evidence that he received any follow-up care until his ulcer became perforated on 20\u00a0August 2002. Accordingly, the Court finds that at the Khadyzhensk colony Mr Tarariyev was not adequately examined and did not receive medical care appropriate to his state of health.",

The prosecutor's decision of 21 June 2003 \u2013 concerning the staff of the prison hospital \u2013 mentioned that Mr Tarariyev's state of health had deteriorated as a consequence of the conditions of his transfer in a prison van (see paragraph 45 above), but no attempts appear to have been made to identify those responsible for such conditions of transfer. The issue of responsibility for having discharged a seriously ill patient without appropriate medical documentation was not examined and that flagrant omission did not form part of the charges brought against the head of the surgery department Mr\u00a0Da. Finally, the prosecutors did not consider why the prison hospital had had no capacity for blood transfusion and whether there had been a causal link between the absence of haemostatic medicines and Mr Tarariyev's death, notwithstanding the information contained in the death certificate and the surgeon's testimony to that effect.",

At the second questioning she was asked to provide a detailed description of these officers and to indicate whether she could identify them. Assessing the contents of the questioning records as a whole, the Court forms the view that the interviewers attempted to obtain information which could be used for investigation of the treatment applied to Mr Tarariyev and for identification of those responsible. The Court further notes that Ms T. was not forced to give evidence to the prosecutor. It appears that the language used by the prosecutor did not contain any expressions, references or insinuations of a threatening or dissuasive nature (see, by contrast, Petra v.
