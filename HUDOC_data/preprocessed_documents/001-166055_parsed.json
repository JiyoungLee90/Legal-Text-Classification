The court also expressed doubts as to the public interest of the measure. This was in line with the findings of the European Court of Human Rights in similar circumstances, in the cases of Ghigo v. Malta (no. 31122/05, 26\u00a0September 2006) and Fleri Soler and Camilleri v. Malta (no. 35349/05, ECHR 2006X).

They considered that this redress (which amounted to around EUR 700 per year for twenty years) was sufficient, since the requisition had been lawful and had pursued a legitimate aim. Indeed, it was also not far from awards made by the Court in similar circumstances. When including non-pecuniary damage, such awards had amounted to, for example, EUR 1,168 and EUR\u00a01,400 respectively, in Edwards v. Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a017647/04, \u00a7\u00a022, 24, and 37, 17 July 2008), and Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a031122/05, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 21 and 32, 17 July 2008). Moreover, since the property had been requisitioned in order to provide social accommodation, according to the Court the compensation awarded could be less than the market value of the property. The Government relied on the case of Staykov v. Bulgaria (no. 49438/99, \u00a7 90, 12 October 2006), where the Court had accepted that the domestic courts which awarded compensation had acknowledged the relevant violations even though their reasoning could have been more precise. In the Government\u2019s view, in the present case there was no place for restitutio in integrum. This was even more so since after 2011 the applicants were no longer receiving only EUR\u00a035 per annum, but had started to receive EUR 185 per annum, and had then received EUR 193 as from 2011 and EUR 197 from 2014, in line with the amendments made to the law.",

The applicants noted that a government scheme, which allowed owners to lease their property to the Government for social needs, attracted a monthly rent of EUR 300. Using that scheme as a yardstick, the applicants submitted that their compensation should have amounted to around EUR\u00a0100,800. Moreover, they emphasised that the amendments introduced in 2010 did not suffice to allow for the necessary reparation, since even an annual rent of EUR 185 was ridiculously low for such a property, and therefore also did not conform with Article 1 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention.

The legislator leaves the choice of timing to the applicant. Moreover, in circumstances such as those of the present case, the violation complained of is a continuing one.

The latter sum has continued to increase by a few euros every three years thereafter (for example, EUR 193 in 2011 and EUR 197 in 2014). The Court regrets that no annual rental valuations were submitted to this Court. Nevertheless, from the information available in the public domain, it appears evident that a small house with a sale value of around EUR 153,000 would, in this decade, fetch on the open market substantially more than a rental value of around EUR\u00a016 a month. The Court considers that even bearing in mind that legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value, such a low amount of compensation cannot be considered justifiable.",
