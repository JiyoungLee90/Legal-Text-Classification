As a basis for the calculation of his pension (in respect of his average remuneration over the final five years of his working life), the INPS employed a theoretical remuneration (\u201cretribuzione teorica\u201d) instead of the actual remuneration (\u201cretribuzione effettiva\u201d). The former resulted in a readjustment on the basis of the existing ratio between the social security contributions paid in, respectively, Switzerland (8%) and in Italy (32.7%), which meant that the calculation had as its basis a notional salary which, according to the applicant, led him to receive a pension equal to one fourth of the pension he should have received.",
