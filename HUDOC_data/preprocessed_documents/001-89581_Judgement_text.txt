The case originated in an application (no. 23667/06) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Finnish national, Mr Rafael Johannes Ahlskog (“the applicant”), on 6 June 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr P. Impola, a lawyer practising in . The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr A. Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
On 20 December 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Kokkola.
On 4 September 1996 the applicant gave a directly enforceable guarantee to cover the debt of a limited liability company. The debt fell due on 31 March 1999 and was not paid.
On 30 June 1999 the creditor bank initiated civil proceedings in the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) requesting the company and the applicant, along with other persons, to pay the debt.
On 8 February 2000 the District Court asked the defendants to indicate clearly in writing whether or not they contested the claim, at the risk of a default judgment. The applicant and the company filed their statements of reply on 15 and 20 March 2000 respectively but failed to indicate clearly their position.
On 21 March 2000 the District Court gave a default judgment in which it ordered the applicant and the company to pay the debt. The judgment was served on 9 May 2000.
On 12 May 2000 the applicant lodged an appeal against the default judgment with the District Court requesting that the judgment be quashed and the claims of the creditor bank be rejected.
On 15 June 2000 the District Court ordered a stay of execution of the judgment.
The District Court proceedings comprised three different sets of civil proceedings which were joined on 7 May 2003. These were the applicant’s claim for refund of benefit by unjust enrichment, the appeal against the default judgment and an action for damages, which was subsequently withdrawn.
On 6 February 2004 the court, after having held oral hearings in October and December 2003, quashed the default judgment and rejected the creditor bank’s claims as far as the applicant was concerned.
In March 2004 all parties to the case appealed to the  (hovioikeus, hovrätten). The applicant’s appeal only concerned costs and expenses. The  held an oral hearing in February 2006. On 4 April 2006 it upheld the District Court’s judgment as far as the applicant was concerned.
The applicant did not apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) as he was no longer in need of legal protection. Consequently, the  judgment became final on 6 June 2006.
