There was no evidence that Mr Sh. had been armed, let alone that he had fired at the teenagers. It followed from the witness statements that he had not offered any resistance to the police officers who had arrived at the scene and that the police officers had not attempted to stop him from leaving. After he had locked himself in his flat he could no longer disturb public order, so Mr T.'s and the other police officers' attempts to enter his flat through the door or the balcony and arrest him had been unlawful and unjustified.

Mr\u00a0Sh. had been found in his underwear, which showed that he had been resting when Mr T. had tried to access his balcony. Mr T.'s statement that Mr Sh. had hit him with a pestle was open to doubt as the pestle had been found in the bedroom rather than on the balcony. Moreover, the expert examination had revealed that the blood on the pestle had been Mr Sh.'s. Accordingly, Mr Sh.'s actions had not constituted any administrative or criminal offence.

It analysed the collected evidence and concluded that the use of lethal force against Mr Sh. had not been justified by the circumstances. It found that after receiving the report that Mr Sh. had fired a shot at the teenagers Mr T. should have verified that information by questioning eyewitnesses to the incident and inspecting the area in search of a cartridge case. He had failed to search the area, however. The eyewitnesses had affirmed that Mr Sh. did not have any weapon and no weapon had subsequently been found in his flat. In those circumstances, Mr\u00a0T. could not have had a reasonable suspicion that Mr\u00a0Sh. had committed criminal or administrative offences. Moreover, after he had locked himself in his flat he could no longer present any danger to the public. There had therefore been no reason to arrest him. In any event, before proceeding with the arrest, Mr T. should have contacted his superior to ask for detailed instructions. He had not done so. Finally, Mr T. had had no legal grounds for using his weapon against Mr Sh. Although Mr Sh. had indeed showed resistance, he had acted lawfully to protect his legitimate interests, namely, the privacy of his home and his liberty. By attempting to enter Mr Sh.'s flat through the balcony and by shooting him, Mr T. had abused his office, had trespassed on Mr Sh.'s home and had committed murder. He had committed criminal offences punishable by Articles 286 \u00a7 3, 139 \u00a7 3 and 105 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor also examined the origin of the bruises and abrasions on Mr\u00a0Sh.'s face and body. Referring to the expert opinion, he concluded that some of the injuries had been the result of Mr Sh.'s falling on the floor after being shot, while the remaining ones had been inadvertently caused when he had been carried to the bedroom by Mr T. and another police officer.",

Although the gun had never been found, the court surmised that Mr\u00a0Sh. could have thrown it away after he had left the scene. As the prosecution had not searched the surroundings, such a possibility could not be excluded. The court gave the accused the benefit of the doubt and assumed that Mr Sh. had been armed.

In those circumstances, his decision to arrest Mr\u00a0Sh. immediately had been reasonable and justified. As Mr Sh. had refused to let Mr T. in, the applicant had refused to give the key to the police officers and it had been impossible to force the door open, Mr T. had taken a correct and lawful decision to climb up onto the balcony. That decision had been approved by the duty officer of the Vostochniy District of Byisk and the duty officer at Byisk police station.",

In accordance with the rules governing the conduct of policemen, Mr T. had fired a warning shot. Given that Mr Sh. had attempted to push him down again, Mr T. had fired at him. The court found that Mr T.'s life had been in peril and that he had acted in reasonable self-defence and in compliance with the Police Act. The court finally noted that an internal inquiry by the Interior Department of the Altayskiy Region had concluded that Mr T. had been sober.

Mr Sh. had moreover behaved aggressively towards the police officers and brandished a shovel at them. Mr T. had therefore had a duty to arrest him. However, Mr Sh. had resisted arrest by escaping to his flat, locking himself inside and refusing to abide by the lawful orders of the police officers requiring that he let them in. In those circumstances, the only means of effecting Mr Sh.'s lawful arrest had been to enter his flat through the balcony. Mr Sh. had attempted to throw Mr T. off the balcony, thereby putting Mr T.'s life in danger and compelling him to defend himself. Mr T. had acted in accordance with the rules governing the use of weapons by the police as, before shooting at Mr\u00a0Sh., he had shouted a warning and fired a warning shot in the air. He had therefore done everything in his power to arrest Mr Sh. without using force or weapons against him, but the use of lethal force had been made necessary by Mr\u00a0Sh.'s aggressive and un-cooperative behaviour.",

The prosecutor had commissioned six expert opinions, which had been made by independent experts. He had also questioned twenty witnesses. Although the investigation had been discontinued on several occasions, it had subsequently been resumed, which, in the Government's opinion, showed that the domestic authorities had been intent on correcting possible shortcomings in the investigation and bringing those responsible to justice. Indeed, Mr T. had been charged and committed for trial. The fact that he had eventually been acquitted had not made the investigation and the judicial proceedings ineffective.

Suddenly he found himself confronted by Mr Sh., who emerged onto the balcony brandishing a gun-like object in an attempt to push him down. Mr Sh. ignored a warning shot and an order to lay aside his weapon and surrender. In defiance of the warning, he made a further attempt to pitch Mr T. down the ladder. It was at that moment that Mr T., evidently concerned for his own life, fired at him. Detached from the events in issue, the Court cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of an officer who was required to react in the heat of the moment to avert an honestly perceived danger to his life or the lives of others (see Giuliani and Gaggio v. , no. 23458/02, \u00a7 224, 25\u00a0August 2009, and Andronicou and Constantinou, cited above, \u00a7 192).

The Court is persuaded that at the time when the police officers proceeded to arrest Mr Sh. they honestly believed, in the light of the information they had received from the teenagers and their own observation of Mr Sh.'s demeanour, that he was armed with a gun and was being aggressive. It reiterates in this regard that\u00a0the use of force by agents of the State in pursuit of one of the aims delineated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention may be justified under this provision where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time even if it subsequently turns out to be mistaken.

The circumstances no longer required the taking of immediate or spontaneous decisions. Indeed, Mr Sh. remained quietly in his flat for several hours. There was no risk of his escaping as his door was guarded by the police. Nor was it ever claimed that there was a danger that he might start shooting through the window at the crowd gathered in front of his block of flats.

When analysing the planning and control of the arrest operation, the Court took into account that the police had at all times been unwilling to take precipitate action. They had cordoned off the area around the house to prevent the applicant's brother from escaping and to avert any threat to the lives of the neighbouring population. The siege of the house had lasted two days and the Court was satisfied that the domestic authorities had continuously tried to defuse the situation without recourse to lethal force or to tactics which might provoke a violent response from the applicant's brother. They had incessantly attempted to break the deadlock by persuasion and dialogue and employed a trained negotiator and a psychologist to convince the applicant's brother to surrender. Most importantly, all actions undertaken by the police had been carefully considered and approved in advance by experienced senior officers and there was at all times a chain of command (see Huohvanainen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 99-108; and, for similar reasoning, Bubbins, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 141-51).",

Even the crucial decision to climb up onto Mr Sh.'s balcony, which, by provoking a violent response from Mr Sh., proved to be fatal for him, was not reviewed or approved by experienced senior officers. The Court concludes that the absence of a clear chain of command was a factor which by its very nature must have increased the risk of imprudent and erratic actions and, consequently, the risk to Mr Sh.'s life (see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis, cited above, \u00a7 68)",

Nor did they consider deploying a quick reaction team trained and equipped to deal with emergencies, or inviting a trained negotiator who might have been more successful than inexperienced police officers in bringing the matter to a peaceful close.",
