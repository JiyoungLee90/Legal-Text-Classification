Russia (nos. 30672/03 et seq., \u00a7\u00a7 43-45, 3 May 2007) concerning non-enforcement and subsequent quashing of the court judgments in the applicants' favour, the Court recognised the right of the relatives of the deceased applicant to pursue the application. The rights at stake in the present two cases are very similar to those at the heart of the Sobelin and others case. However, unlike in the aforementioned precedent, in the two cases at hand the Government objected to transferability of the rights at stake. The Court accordingly considers it necessary to examine this issue in more detail.",

The Court has previously noted that the question whether such claims were transferable to the persons seeking to pursue an application was an important criterion, but could not be the only one (see, mutatis mutandis, OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a014902/04, \u00a7\u00a0441, 29 January 2009). In fact, cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension and persons close to an applicant may have a legitimate interest in seeing that justice is done even after the applicant's death (ibid). There is nothing in the cases at hand to justify a departure from this approach. The Court accordingly finds that Mr V.N. Zakharov and Mrs\u00a0T.N.\u00a0Melnikova have standing to pursue the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in place of their late relatives.",

In fact, the Court has previously accepted that the late applicants' close relatives could maintain applications with complaints concerning various aspects of Article 6 of the Convention (see Malhous v. the  [GC], no. 33071/96, \u00a7 1, 12 July 2001, with further references; Andreyeva v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a076737/01, 16\u00a0October 2003; Shiryayeva v. , no. 21417/04, \u00a7\u00a08, 13 July 2006, concerning the non-enforcement of the domestic judgment; see also Horv\u00e1thov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no.\u00a074456/01, \u00a7 26, 17\u00a0May 2005, in the context of the length of proceedings). However, the Court attaches particular weight to the specific aspect of the \u201cright to a court\u201d at stake in the present two cases, namely the alleged impairment of the principle of legal certainty as a result of the annulment of the domestic judgments in the applicants' favour by way of the supervisory review proceedings. The quashing in the instant cases had occurred before the applicants had passed away. The crux of the grievance under Article 6 was, in fact, frustration of the applicants' reliance on the binding judicial decision. The Court reiterates that quashing of a final judgment is an instantaneous act and does not create a continuing situation (see, mutatis mutandis, Sardin v. Russia (dec.), no. 69582/01, ECHR\u00a02004II). In these circumstances, the Court may admittedly have difficulties in finding that the applicant's relatives were affected by the quashing and accepts that the legal certainty complaint under Article 6 in the context of the supervisory-review proceedings, if raised separately, might not be automatically considered transferable (compare, mutatis mutandis, Stankevich, cited above; Gorodnichev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a032275/03, 15\u00a0November 2007; Bi\u00e7 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 22; and Georgia Makri and Others v. Greece (dec.), no. 5977/03, 24 March 2005).",

It recalls that the principles insisting that a final judicial decision must not be called into question and should be enforced represent two aspects of the same general concept, namely the \u201cright to a court\u201d (see, for instance, Sobelin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 67). The Court has been prepared to recognise the standing of a relative as regards the non-enforcement complaints (see, among others, Shiryayeva, cited above). Furthermore, the supervisory-review complaints under Article 6 and Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 are closely interrelated, and it has already accepted the relatives' standing as regards the complaint under the latter provision of the Convention. In view of the above, the Court does not consider it necessary to draw a distinction between two aspects of the supervisory-review complaint for the purposes of determination of the standing issue. It finds that Mr V.N. Zakharov and Mrs\u00a0T.N. Melnikova have standing to pursue their late relatives' complaints under Article 6.",

Russia, no. 14502/04, \u00a7 27, 2 November 2006). The Government did not point to any exceptional circumstances that would have prevented the military commissariat from making use of an ordinary appeal in good time (see, in identical context, Zvezdin v. , no. 25448/06, \u00a7\u00a7 30-32, 14 June 2007, and Murtazin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27-29). Furthermore, it appears that in several cases the regional commissariat had timeously appealed against the judgments, but then revoked the grounds of appeal. Moreover, the Court notes that the military commissariat had failed to apply for an extension of the time-limit for lodging of the ordinary appeal against the judgments, but chose to make use of the extraordinary remedy, such as the supervisory review.",

No justification for that had been advanced by the Government. It is true that the domestic courts granted the extension of the respective time-limit on the ground that the respondent commissariat had not been timeously informed of the proceedings against it. Being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for instance, Novikov v. Russia, no.\u00a035989/02, \u00a7 38, June 2009, and Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, \u00a7\u00a0135 et seq., ECHR 2007-XIII (extracts)). The Court notes, in particular, the Government's observation that in September-October 2004 thirty-three applicants had submitted the writs of execution directly to the respondent authority, and the latter had received them. It also notes, and it is uncontested between the parties, that the authority attempted to appeal against several first instance judgments, but then revoked the respective applications without referring to a specific reason. In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the respondent authority was genuinely unaware of the proceedings before the first instance court (see, by contrast, Podrugina and Yedinov v.
