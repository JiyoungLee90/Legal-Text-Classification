The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see the Aksoy v.\u00a0Turkey judgment of 18\u00a0December\u00a01996, Reports\u00a01996-VI, pp. 2275-76, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-52, and the Akdivar and Others judgment cited above, p. 1210, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06567).",

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited above, p. 1211, \u00a7 69, and the Aksoy judgment cited above, p. 2276, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).",

In the instant case, the public prosecutor took no steps to identify who was present when Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan was apprehended or when his injuries were incurred. None of the documents provided by the gendarmes enabled such persons to be identified. The identity of the perpetrators or possible witnesses was therefore unknown to the applicant. Furthermore, the public prosecutor had taken no steps to find any evidence confirming or contradicting the account given by the gendarmes as to the allegedly accidental nature of the injuries.

His father had died. The Court concluded on the facts of that case that the United Kingdom authorities had not failed in any positive obligation under Article 2 to provide protection of their right to life within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 2. In the Ya\u015fa case (judgment cited above, pp. 2436-41, \u00a7\u00a7 92-108), the applicant was shot in the street by an unknown gunman, receiving eight bullet wounds but surviving. The Court, finding that the authorities had not failed to protect the applicant's life, held nonetheless that they had failed to comply with the procedural obligation under Article 2 to conduct an effective investigation into the attack. In L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-III, pp. 1403-04, \u00a7\u00a7 36-41), where the applicant, who suffered from leukaemia, was the daughter of a soldier who had been on Christmas Island during the United Kingdom's nuclear tests, the Court noted that it was not suggested that the State had intentionally sought to deprive her of her life but examined under Article 2 whether the State had done all that could have been required of it to prevent the applicant's life from being avoidably put at risk. It found that the State had not failed in this regard.",

It is correct that the criminal responsibility of those concerned in the use of force is not in issue in the proceedings under the Convention (see the McCann and Others judgment cited above, p. 51, \u00a7 173). Nonetheless, the degree and type of force used and the unequivocal intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the State agents' actions in inflicting injury short of death must be regarded as incompatible with the object and purpose of Article 2 of the Convention. In almost all cases where a person is assaulted or ill-treated by the police or soldiers, their complaints will fall to be examined rather under Article 3 of the Convention. ",

Furthermore, although the victim of an alleged breach of this provision may be in a vulnerable position, the practical exigencies of the situation will often differ from cases of use of lethal force or suspicious deaths. The Court considers that the requirement under Article 13 of the Convention that a person with an arguable claim of a violation of Article 3 be provided with an effective remedy will generally provide both redress to the applicant and the necessary procedural safeguards against abuses by State officials. The Court's case-law establishes that the notion of effective remedy in this context includes the duty to carry out a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for any ill-treatment and permitting effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure (see the Aksoy judgment cited above, p.\u00a02287, \u00a7\u00a098). Whether it is appropriate or necessary to find a procedural breach of Article 3 will therefore depend on the circumstances of the particular case. ",

There were, however, a number of features about these documents which should have alerted the prosecutor to the need to investigate further, besides the mere fact that such serious injuries were caused on apprehension by the security forces. These included the lapse of time between the moment Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan had sustained his injuries and his admission to Mardin State Hospital, and the appearance of Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan's signature on the incident report whereas his statement of 27\u00a0December 1992 bore a thumbprint and the explanation that he could not sign. It was also apparent that the incident report gave an unreliable account. It stated that \u0130brahim Karahan had failed to stop at the gendarmes' warning. However, the public prosecutor did not bring this charge against him as well as Abd\u00fcllatif \u0130lhan as \u015eeref \u00c7akmak had orally informed him that in fact \u0130brahim Karahan had not tried to run away. A further significant inconsistency was disclosed by the incident report's failure to mention that \u0130brahim Karahan had been injured on apprehension. \u015eeref \u00c7akmak's written referral to hospital stated that \u0130brahim Karahan had also fallen and hurt himself when being apprehended, as had his written report to the public prosecutor of 27\u00a0December 1992.
