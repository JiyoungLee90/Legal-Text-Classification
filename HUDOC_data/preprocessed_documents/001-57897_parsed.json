As the Court has consistently held, freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of everyone.

Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \"democratic society\" (see, particularly, the Handyside v. the  judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, para. 49).",

Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 33). We also accept that, whether or not any material can be generally considered a work of art, those who make it available to the public are not for that reason exempt from their attendant \"duties and responsibilities\"; the scope and nature of these depend on the situation and on the means used (see the M\u00fcller and Others judgment referred to above, p. 22, para. 34).",
