It follows that this provision does not oblige the court or the police authorities to present the persons identifying [objects as potential evidence] with similar objects at each instance but [this requirement applies] only where possible.

Since he received no reply, the applicant brought a civil action against the State in the Prelog Municipal Court, seeking the above amounts in connection with his unlawful detention. He also complained that since 2 March 2004 he had been detained in inadequate, small and overcrowded cells and only allowed to spend fifteen to twenty minutes a day in the fresh air, and also that he had been detained with smokers, minors and convicts between 14 July and 26 September 2004. He further complained of inadequate conditions in the prison hospital and Lepoglava State Prison, as well as inadequate medical care. In this connection he alleged that he had not been provided with eye glasses and that an examination of his head had been carried out late, while an examination of his spine had not been carried out at all, and that he had not been provided with the requisite psychiatric treatment although he suffered from PTSD. He also alleged that he had been strapped to his bed and forced to spend long periods confined in the same room with smokers, all of which resulted in immense physical and mental suffering. The applicant complained in addition that he had had no opportunity to consult the case file during the criminal proceedings against him. He sought HRK 469,500 under all the above heads.",

Indeed, where an applicant has a choice of remedies and their comparative effectiveness is not obvious, the Court interprets the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the applicant's favour (see Budayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 15339/02, 21166/02, 20058/02, 11673/02 and 15343/02, \u00a7\u00a0110, ECHR 2008-... (extracts), and the cases cited therein). Once the applicant has used such a remedy, he or she cannot also be required to have tried others that were also available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 12\u00a0April 2007 and the cases cited therein).",

Although the purpose of such treatment is a factor to be taken into account, in particular whether it was intended to humiliate or debase the victim, the absence of any such purpose does not inevitably lead to a finding that there has been no violation of Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a074).",

In this connection the Court observes that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) has set 4 sq. m per prisoner as an appropriate, desirable guideline for a detention cell (see, for example, the CPT Report on its visit to Latvia in 2002 \u2013 CPT/Inf (2005) 8, \u00a7\u00a065). This approach has been confirmed by the Court's case-law. The Court notes that in the Peers case a cell of 7 sq. m for two inmates was noted as a relevant aspect in finding a violation of Article 3, albeit that in that case the space factor was coupled with an established lack of ventilation and lighting (see Peers v.\u00a0Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7\u00a7 70\u201372, ECHR 2001-III). In the Kalashnikov case the applicant had been confined to a space measuring less than 2 sq. m. In that case the Court held that such a degree of overcrowding raised in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Kalashnikov v. Russia, no.\u00a047095/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096\u201397, ECHR 2002-VI). The Court reached a similar conclusion in the Labzov case, where the applicant was afforded less than 1 sq. m of personal space during his 35-day period of detention (see Labzov\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a062208/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-49, 16 June 2005), and in the Mayzit case, where the applicant was afforded less than 2 sq. m during nine months of his detention (see Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, \u00a7\u00a040, 20\u00a0January 2005).",

Furthermore, under Article 498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicant has the right to compensation for the period he was kept in detention after the statutory time-limit had expired. The applicant is entitled to bring a civil action against the State in that respect. Under section 186(a) of the Civil Procedure Act, he is firstly required to submit a request for a settlement with the competent State Attorney's Office. In the Court's view, a civil action against the State provided for under domestic law is a remedy to be exhausted since is specifically designed to allow persons who have been unlawfully detained to obtain redress from the State.

Although the applicant was allowed unrestricted telephone communication with his new counsel, it appears that there was no such contact at least until 14 February 2005, when the applicant complained to the presiding judge that he had not been able to contact counsel because there had been no answer to his calls to the number given to the applicant as that of counsel. The applicant further requested permission for a visit to the prison from his counsel, but there was no answer to this request. However, it is true that the hearing scheduled for 17 February 2005 was adjourned at counsel's oral request in order to enable him to prepare the applicant's defence. There is no evidence that counsel actually visited the applicant at all. In the Court's view, bearing in mind that the applicant was in pre-trial detention, it would have been expected of the relevant authorities to keep a record of the appointed counsel's visits to the applicant in prison in order to make sure that the defence rights of the accused were respected.",

The applicant was released on 30 March 2005 since the maximum time for his detention had expired. At that time his defence counsel was relieved of his duties since, under domestic law, the ground for obligatory legal representation of the applicant in the criminal proceedings had ceased to exist. Thus, at the hearing held on 1 April 2005 before the Prelog Municipal Court the applicant was legally unrepresented. The applicant's and the Government's account of what happened at the hearing differ in some significant respects. While the Government asserted that the applicant, after having been properly informed of his rights, waived his right to be legally represented and decided to remain silent, the applicant contended that his objection to the effect that he had not been able to prepare his defence since his request to consult the case file had not been properly complied with had remained completely ignored.",

In his appeal the applicant also complained that his objections to that effect at the hearing had been completely ignored. In view of such a prompt complaint by the applicant and the fact that the transcript of the hearing held on 1 April 2005 was not signed by the applicant, the Court cannot give decisive importance to the record in the transcript that the applicant had waived his right to be legally represented and decided to remain silent. While it is established that the applicant did not make any defence submissions at that hearing, it cannot be unreservedly accepted that he did so because he did not wish to defend himself.

He was brought to the Municipal Court conducting the criminal trial against him on 1 October 2004, when he examined the case file and copied certain documents. However, the judgment adopted on 26 August 2004 was quashed on 14 January 2005 on the grounds, inter alia, that the applicant had neither had sufficient contact with his defence counsel nor sufficient time to prepare his defence. Furthermore, on 7 March 2005, in the resumed proceedings before the Municipal Court, the applicant made a further request to consult the case file. He explained that on 1 October 2004 he had had insufficient time to consult the case file \u2013 which had been voluminous \u2013 and that not all requested documents had been copied. However, his request remained unanswered. The applicant reiterated his complaints about not being given a real opportunity to consult the case file in his appeal against the first-instance judgment of 1 April 2005. Thus, the fact that the applicant did consult the case file on 1 October 2004 cannot be regarded as satisfying the requirement that the applicant be afforded adequate means and facilities for the preparation of his defence. In this connection the Court observes that the Convention \u201cis intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective; this is particularly so of the rights of the defence in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, from which they derive\u201d (see Artico v.

It appears that no contact was made between the trial and the appellate courts in order to facilitate compliance with the applicant's request. After the appellate court upheld the first-instance judgment on 17 May 2005, the applicant made several further requests to consult the case file. In view of the possibility of using further remedies in the criminal proceedings against him, the Court considers that the applicant had a legitimate interest in studying the case file. However, his requests were denied on the grounds that the case file had been forwarded to the Supreme Court. In the Court's view, however, the fact that the case file was with the Supreme Court, does not in itself justify denying the applicant's request.",

As the applicant in the present case did not have such access, he was unable to prepare an adequate defence and was not afforded equality of arms (see Foucher, cited above, \u00a7 36). Regard being had to all the circumstances of the case, the Court finds that the applicant's defence rights in the criminal proceedings against him taken as a whole were infringed to such a degree that it constitutes a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention taken together with Article 6 \u00a7 3.",
