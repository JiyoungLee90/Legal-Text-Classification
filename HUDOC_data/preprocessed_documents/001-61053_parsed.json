Accordingly, the roles of Government Commissioner and representative of the expropriating authority had not been held simultaneously by one and the same person. In itself, the fact that these two officials belonged to the same administrative entity was not evidence of any imbalance, for two reasons: the Commissioner was not representing the expropriating local authority in the proceedings and, consequently, was not defending the same interests as those with which the State\u2019s representative was entrusted; and Article 6 \u00a7 1 did not prevent a main party and an associated party from defending a common cause once adversarial proceedings had begun.",

Accordingly, he defends interests similar to those defended by the expropriating authority, tending towards moderation of compensation assessments. In addition, as in the instant case, he sometimes belongs to the same administrative entity, and even the same entity at d\u00e9partement level, as the expropriating authority\u2019s representative. The Government Commissioner\u2019s role is entrusted to the Director of Revenue (Property) of the d\u00e9partement in which the Expropriations Division is based or delegated to another official from this administrative authority (Article 13-7 of the Expropriations Code). For its part, the State as expropriating authority is represented in certain d\u00e9partements \u2013 including Charente-Maritime \u2013 by officials from the same territorial Revenue Department (Property) (Articles\u00a0R. 178 and R. 179 of the Code of State Property). Accordingly, a situation may arise, as it would appear to have done in the instant case, where the Government Commissioner is the hierarchical superior of the representative of the State as expropriating authority and a certain overlapping between these parties emerges.
