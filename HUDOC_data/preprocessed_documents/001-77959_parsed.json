In addition, she had also said in her direction to the jury that in her view the depositions would be \u2018only one of several elements in a consideration of whether the accused are guilty\u2019 ... As I see the case, I do not find it defensible to draw any particular conclusion as regards the police depositions\u2019 significance in the overall evidentiary picture presented to the High Court. In view of the state of the evidence at hand, it may indeed appear probable that D\u2019s confession was a more important element with respect to the other defendants\u2019 convictions than was his deposition about their role. But the doubt that here obtains means that, despite the other important evidence in the case, I must regard it as \u2018a real possibility\u2019 that the reading-out of D\u2019s police depositions had \u2018decisive significance for the overall assessment of the evidence\u2019 (see Norsk Retstidende Rt. 2001-29).",

At the High Court hearing D had availed himself of his right to silence. After his depositions had been read out, the President of the High Court had, on a request by counsel for the second applicant, asked D again whether he wished to give oral evidence in full or in part. Thus the arrangement was that counsel for the other defendants should have an opportunity to put questions to D, but his unwillingness to give evidence had made a real examination impossible. Under Norwegian case-law, the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention would be met if the accused or his counsel were given a formal opportunity to put questions, even if the witness refused to reply, provided that the proceedings considered as a whole were fair. In this connection reference was made to Harri Peltonen v. Finland (dec.), no. 30409/96, 11 May 1999; Luc\u00e0 v. Italy, no. 33354/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-45, ECHR 2001-II; and Craxi v.

When the cases had been joined, there had been no reason to believe that D would not reply to questions at the trial. A complicating factor had been the divergence of views among the defendants during the trial as to whether the reading-out of D\u2019s depositions should be permitted. To separate the proceedings regarding D and to postpone the trial concerning the other defendants until the case regarding D had been finalised (and he could be required to answer questions as an ordinary witness) would have entailed unreasonable consequences, both from the point of view of elucidating the case and of ensuring effective administration of justice, and would have enabled the defendants to obstruct and protract the trial unduly.",

The Court cannot but note that the High Court considered that, as a co-accused, D had not been a \u201cwitness\u201d for the purposes of these provisions (see paragraph 10 above). According to the Supreme Court, the High Court appeared to have proceeded from the assumption that the Convention limitations on the reading-out of depositions to the police did not apply to such statements made by a co-accused (see paragraph 16 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this interpretation by the High Court is hardly consistent with the autonomous meaning of the term \u201cwitness\u201d in the Court\u2019s case-law, according to which the fact that the depositions were made by a co-accused rather than by a witness is of no relevance (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, \u00a7 33, Series\u00a0A no. 235-B). It should be reiterated that where a deposition may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction then, irrespective of whether it was made by a witness in the strict sense or by a co-accused, it constitutes evidence for the prosecution to which the guarantees provided by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply (see Luc\u00e0, cited above, \u00a7\u00a041).",
