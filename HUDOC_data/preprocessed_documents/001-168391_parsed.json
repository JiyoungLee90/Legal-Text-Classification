However, it is unable to follow entirely the method of calculation of this loss suggested by him, for several reasons. Firstly, the \u201cperiod of damage\u201d did not start in 1983, but on 13 July 1994 when a decision to compensate the applicant with a garage was taken by the mayor (see paragraph 8 above). It is noteworthy in addition that the applicant only claimed compensation for the period until 2010. Secondly, it is unclear whether the applicant would have let the garage out, or would have used it himself. And thirdly, the applicant would have inevitably experienced some delays in finding suitable tenants, would have incurred expenses to maintain the property, and would have been subject to taxation on any rent (see Kirilova and Others (just satisfaction), \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, and Dichev, \u00a7 43, both cited above). Having regard to the number of imponderables thus involved, the Court considers that it must rule in equity and awards the applicant EUR\u00a01,500 under the present head.",
