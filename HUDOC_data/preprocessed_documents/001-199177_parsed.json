However, the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is not always the decisive element. The Court must in addition be satisfied that detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 \u00a7 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 40 and 42, Reports 1996III).",

Neither the domestic authorities nor the Government have provided any clarification as to what the wording used in the police record actually stood for. While the Article\u00a027.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences authorises administrative detention, as an extraordinary measure, in order to ensure the correct and timely examination of an administrative case, neither the domestic authorities nor the Government have provided any explanation as to why (1) it was strictly necessary to deprive the applicant of his liberty and (2) no other less stringent measure could have been employed. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s detention at the police station from 19 to 20\u00a0January 2015 was unjustified and arbitrary.",

On 15\u00a0January 2013 the Lazarevskiy District Court established that the applicant had disturbed the peace by having been in an inebriated state, having used foul language and having refused to comply with the legitimate order of a police officer to stop his unruly behaviour. On 28\u00a0August 2013 the District Court considered the criminal case against the applicant on the charge of assault on a law-enforcement police officer, which, according to the District Court\u2019s findings, the applicant had committed in response to the officer\u2019s attempt to put an end to the applicant\u2019s disorderly conduct.
