The expert also observed that O.\u010c. had been refusing treatment for a long time and was not aware of her medical condition. In O.\u010c.'s interview the latter stated that she had not allowed the second applicant to have contact with the first applicant from 31 January 2007 on, as the second applicant was afraid of her father. The expert further examined the second applicant, who told her that she liked spending time with the first applicant. The first applicant did not attend the interview with the psychiatrist. After the examination, the expert concluded that O.\u010c. had been taking good care of the second applicant, who could be in danger only if she was exposed to the active phase of O.\u010c.'s illness. However, if O.\u010c. followed her treatment the prognosis would be good for her. As far as the contact between the applicants is concerned she established that they should continue to have contact as they have up to now, or even spend more time together if the second applicant so wished. However, in the expert's view, the first applicant should be more creative and should share more activities with the second applicant.",

It further observes that the applicants lodged a just satisfaction claim, which was dismissed for not being lodged in accordance with the 2006 Act. The Court also notes that the applicants were requested by the State Attorney's Office to pursue that claim, but expressly refused to do so (see paragraphs 93 and 94 above). Therefore, the Court concludes that the applicants failed to exhaust properly domestic remedies. In addition, the Court considers that there is no reason to conclude that the just satisfaction claim would not have had a reasonable prospect of success if pursued by the applicants in the prescribed manner.",
