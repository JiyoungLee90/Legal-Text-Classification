The Court notes that under the 2004 Act the domestic courts have no competence to examine separately the length of the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings, which amounted in the instant case to a period of over two years. However, in order for the remedy to be Article 13 compliant, the domestic courts should take that period into account when assessing the length of the judicial phase of the proceedings and when calculating the amount of just satisfaction due in the circumstances of a particular case. The Court reiterates in this connection that a remedy may be accepted as effective only if it is capable of addressing all stages of the impugned proceedings.",
