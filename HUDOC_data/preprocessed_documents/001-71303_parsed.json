The RSFSR Marriage and Family Code set a one-year limitation period for an action contesting paternity, the starting point of which was calculated from the date the putative father was informed that he had been registered as the father. As the applicant had not contested paternity when the child was born and had only applied to the courts in December 1997, after the expiry of the time-limit, his action was held to be time-barred. The fact that a new Family Code had been introduced which did not lay down a limitation period for paternity actions was irrelevant because it was only applicable to family-law disputes arising after 1 March 1996.",

Denmark, judgment of 21 November 1984, Series A no. 87, p. 13, \u00a7 33). The State had a positive obligation under Article 8 to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (Botta v. Italy, judgment of 24\u00a0February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I, p.\u00a0422, \u00a7\u00a033). In particular, the child had the right under Article 8 to establish a legal relationship with his natural father (Mikuli\u0107 v. Croatia, no.\u00a053176/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a064-66, ECHR 2002I) and the husband had the right to contest paternity in order to establish that he was not the biological father. In the applicant\u2019s opinion, Article 8 guaranteed the right to dissolve a family tie which was not the result of a biological bond. He concluded on the basis of the Kroon judgment that biological and social reality should prevail over legal presumptions and the quest for legal certainty of relations, so that any presumption of paternity had to be effectively capable of being rebutted and not amount to a de facto rule (Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27\u00a0October 1994, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0297C, \u00a7\u00a040).

Only under these circumstances could he make an informed choice regarding the child: either to disavow it or continue to assume the parental obligations under a form of legalised adoption. Therefore, the legislature should have allowed an appropriate period during which the putative father could make a considered decision. In the applicant\u2019s assessment, his rights would be sufficiently safeguarded only if time started to run from the date the husband learnt of the facts suggesting that he might not be the biological father.

An example of that is the Court\u2019s decision of 19 October 1999 in Yildirim v. Austria. It is therefore not astonishing that a survey of the legislations in the Contracting States on the institution of paternity actions reveals that there is no universally adopted standard, but on the contrary the various legal systems differ considerably according to the political, social and cultural traditions. In my opinion the Court should be careful not to impose a general opinion on how such conflicting interests should be assessed but leave a wide margin of appreciation to national legislators.",
