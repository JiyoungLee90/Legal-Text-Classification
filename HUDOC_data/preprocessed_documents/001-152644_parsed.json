In a judgment of 7 January 2009 (Criminal Division, 08-83364) the Court of Cassation held that in rejecting an application by a disabled prisoner for the suspension of his sentence, the Post-Sentencing Division of the Amiens Court of Appeal had not justified its decision on the basis of Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure since it had not determined, as the applicant\u2019s submissions had invited it to do, whether the two expert opinions indicated that the actual conditions of his detention were incompatible in the long term with his state of health.

He explained that cells for prisoners with reduced mobility were often located on the ground floor, which was normally set aside for prisoners under the \u201cclosed doors\u201d regime; this was not conducive to any communication. The daily routine was a further source of anxiety: \u201cfear of being confronted with violence, fear of a primarily young population, fear of going to the exercise yard. Boredom too, since an occupational activity is no longer accessible to them and the activities available are unsuited to their physical condition. And finally, the humiliation of being dependent. Although many facilities have signed agreements with associations providing personal assistance, there are still too many prisons where the duties of \u2018attendant\u2019 or domestic help are performed by other prisoners employed by the prison management \u2013 the \u2018prison orderlies\u2019; this situation is unacceptable on account of the risks of blackmail and the lack of appropriate training and remuneration.\u201d",

Among the targets of his criticism in that respect were the restrictive conditions laid down in Article 720-1-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by which the execution of a sentence could be suspended only in extremely serious cases and as a short-term measure. He added: \u201cIt must be noted that the experts assigned to assess whether the prisoner\u2019s health is compatible with continued detention do not take sufficient account of the physical conditions of incarceration, quite simply because they are entirely unaware of the constraints it entails\u201d. He recommended that Parliament amend Article 720-1-1 \u201cto introduce a third possible criterion besides the risk to life and the long-term incompatibility of the prisoner\u2019s health with detention, namely granting a request for suspension of a sentence where the treatment required by the prisoner cannot be provided either in detention or even during periods of ordinary or escorted prison leave, because of its repetitive and regular nature\u201d.",

France (no. 33834/03, \u00a7 29, 11 July 2006) for the provisions governing health care in prison. It should be noted that health care for prisoners has been the responsibility of the public hospital service since the Law of 18 January 1994 came into force. Outside appointments and emergency and short-term hospital admissions take place at the hospital to which the UCSA \u2013 an internal unit of the hospital based in the detention facility \u2013 is attached. Any treatment that is unavailable at the UCSA is provided either at the local hospital or in one of the eight secure interregional hospital units (unit\u00e9s hospitali\u00e8res s\u00e9curis\u00e9es interr\u00e9gionales \u2013 UHSI) or the National Public Health Institution in Fresnes (EPSNF). The UHSIs are responsible for providing medical and surgical treatment for detainees referred by UCSA medical personnel for stays of more than forty-eight hours. The EPSNF has medical, aftercare and rehabilitation departments and admits prisoners whose health requires an extended hospital stay or major therapy (see Guide du prisonnier (Prisoner\u2019s handbook),\u00a0OIP, 2012, section on \u201cLa m\u00e9decine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u201d).

The report also mentions \u201can approach to health care that is all too often dependent on the operation of the prison system\u201d, and concludes that \u201cin addition to the rigidity and constraints of the prison environment, the available treatment is still inadequate, the need for more modern premises and equipment is not satisfied and the forms of cooperation between the parties concerned are fragile and incomplete\u201d. Furthermore, it calls for \u201cthe development of a stronger and clearer publichealth policy\u201d through the assistance of regional health agencies, which \u201cassess and identify detainees\u2019 health-care needs.

The Government\u2019s position was all the more unacceptable as the courts in question had merely examined the most immediately visible aspects of his situation, namely the configuration of the premises and the treatment available to detainees. Referring to the reports by the CGLPL and the Justice/Health Interministerial Working Group mentioned in paragraphs 29 and 30 above, he submitted that the competent authorities\u2019 assessment of dignity was limited to the question of the provision of care rather than covering practical living conditions. However, his state of complete dependence on the prison orderly, the conditions in which he took a shower, the security measures imposed on him whenever he was escorted outside the prison and the full body searches all amounted to repeated humiliation undermining his personality. All these measures had been found to be inhuman and degrading by the Court (the applicant cited Vincent v. France, no. 6253/03, 24\u00a0October 2006; Khider v. France, no. 39364/05, 9 July 2009; and Duval v.\u00a0France, no. 19868/08, 26 May 2011), and the same conclusion had to be reached in his case, in view of the cumulative effect of the ill-treatment and his disability, as well as the complete lack of justification for the security measures imposed on him.",

Relying on G\u00fclay \u00c7etin v.\u00a0Turkey (no.\u00a044084/10, 5 March 2013), he emphasised that there were no clear provisions of domestic law that required consideration to be given to personal capacity to cope with detention regardless of the quality of treatment needed, or that allowed situations infringing human dignity to carry on indefinitely. The intensity of the ordeal inflicted on a person with disabilities amounted to disregarding the purposes of the sentence, instead turning it into pure retribution and an indiscriminate punishment.

In addition, the courts found that Uzerche Prison manifestly failed to satisfy the requirements for the applicant\u2019s detention regime, in terms of both the premises and the availability of paramedical care (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). The Court notes in that connection the developments in domestic law and in the positions taken by official bodies as to the need to take account of disabilities when considering applications for the suspension of sentences (see paragraphs 27, 28, 29 and 30 above). Lastly, it observes that it does not appear from the case file that the applicant\u2019s health has deteriorated during his detention or that his disability has worsened as a result of the detention conditions. In particular, the report on the visit to Uzerche Prison by the CGLPL (see paragraph 33 above), which does not deal specifically with the situation for people with disabilities, does not suggest that the conditions there are such as render the applicant\u2019s continued detention incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, should the applicant\u2019s health deteriorate, French law affords him the opportunity to submit a fresh application to have his sentence suspended on medical grounds, a process that Parliament has recently relaxed with a view to making it easier to use (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above).",

It was also very difficult for him to go to the gym since it was not wheelchair accessible, as the Government explained. The Court would note that the application for suspension of the applicant\u2019s sentence was refused subject to his receiving appropriate physiotherapy sessions tailored to his condition, and that the domestic courts pointed out on that occasion that such treatment could not be provided at Uzerche Prison, but in other custodial facilities (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above).

It cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the failure to transfer the applicant to such a facility, in particular to Roanne Prison, was entirely his own fault. Admittedly, the applicant\u2019s assertion that it would not have possible to provide him with the necessary treatment in that prison can only be regarded as speculation; the parties\u2019 observations on this issue differ considerably since they referred to the situation at that prison at different times (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). It is likewise true that the applicant did not formally request a transfer but decided against doing so, firstly in June 2010 because, according to the Government, his \u201cmain motivation related to the previous decisions of the judicial authorities on requests for suspension of sentences, rather than to the treatment he might receive\u201d, and then in August 2011, for unclear reasons (see paragraph 26 above). However, the Court does not consider that this attitude amounted to a refusal of treatment: it notes that in August 2011 the applicant was awaiting the outcome of his court application to have his sentence suspended, which might explain why he did not make any requests to the prison authorities at that time. Furthermore, although Article D. 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that prisoners may request a transfer to another custodial facility more suited to their medical condition, it provides above all that the responsibility for such a transfer lies with the interregional director of the Prison Service, who is to order \u201cany transfer ... with the aim of enabling a sick prisoner to receive treatment in more favourable conditions\u201d (see paragraph 32 above). However, it does not appear from the case file that any specific measures were taken during that entire period or that any efforts were made to allow the applicant to undergo physiotherapy sessions tailored to his condition, despite the repeated recommendations of the UCSA doctors that he be provided with care in a specialist setting (see paragraph 21 above). The attitude of the applicant, who was apparently reluctant to seek a transfer for reasons including the distance from his family (see paragraph 25 above), cannot in itself justify the inaction of the prison and health-care authorities in failing to cooperate (see paragraph 31 above) to provide him with the care deemed necessary by the doctors who had examined him. The Court further notes that the physiotherapy he has received since September 2012 is limited to one weekly fifteen-minute session (see paragraph 21 above).",

It has already acknowledged that measures of this kind may reach the minimum level of severity required by Article 3 to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment (see Khider, cited above; El Shennawy v. France, no.\u00a051246/08, 20 January 2011; and Duval, cited above), but it does not consider that this level has been attained in the present case; the Government\u2019s additional observations on this issue indicate that the applicant was not searched systematically but on specific occasions during his detention, some of which concerned all prisoners at the facility. Moreover, only two decisions ordering searches when the applicant was escorted from the prison for medical reasons have been produced to the Court. Having regard to the reasons given by the Government to justify these occasional measures (see paragraph 20 above), which were not always aimed at the applicant alone, the Court considers that, despite their arduous nature, they do not appear to have attained the requisite level of severity for Article 3 to be applicable. The Court observes in this connection that the conditions and procedures complained of in relation to the transfers and searches of the applicant are not comparable to those observed in other similar cases (see Duval and El Shenawy, cited above; Mouisel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 47; and H\u00e9naf v.\u00a0France, no. 65436/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a054-58, ECHR 2003-XI).",

The Court does not have any information about the precise situation regarding the showers or the frequency with which the applicant can use them. However, it has not been disputed by the Government that he is unable to go there on his own (see paragraph 23 above) and that they are not designed to be accessible to people with reduced mobility. It can also be inferred from the applicant\u2019s condition that the prisoner responsible for assisting him on a day-to-day basis according to the Government (see paragraph 42 above) has to help him to get washed. This state of affairs, where the showers are not wheelchair accessible and the applicant has to rely on a prison orderly to get washed, has been deemed unacceptable by the CGLPL (see paragraph 29 above). Furthermore, while legislation passed in 2009 made it possible for any prisoners with disabilities to designate a helper of their choice (see paragraph 32 above), the Court observes that a measure of this kind, assuming that the conditions governing such a choice have been satisfied in the present case, is not sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s needs, since having a shower is an uncomfortable occasion for him in view of his incontinence, the lack of privacy and the role of the prisoner designated to assist him (see, mutatis mutandis, D.G. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0177). Indeed, it does not appear from the evidence before the Court that such assistance complements the care provided to the applicant by health-care professionals, or that the prisoner designated to assist him has received the necessary training to perform the actions required to accompany a disabled person. The Court observes in this connection that it has held on several occasions that assistance from a fellow inmate, even on a voluntary basis, does not mean that an applicant\u2019s special needs are satisfied and that the State has on that account discharged its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. It has pointed out that it could not endorse a situation where prison staff evade their safety obligations and duty of care towards the most vulnerable prisoners by making their cellmates responsible for providing them with day-to-day assistance or, where appropriate, emergency care; such a situation gives rise to anxiety and places the prisoner in a position of inferiority vis-\u00e0-vis the other prisoners (see Farbtuhs, cited above, \u00a7 60, and D.G. v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 147).",

In view of his severe disability and the fact that he suffers from urinary and faecal incontinence, the length of time during which he was detained without receiving any rehabilitative treatment, and his inability to take a shower without the help of a fellow prisoner, are factors that have subjected the applicant to hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. Those circumstances amount to degrading treatment and thus to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The absence of any indication that the authorities acted with the intention of humiliating or debasing the applicant does not alter that finding in any way (see Farbtuhs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 60).",
