It held that the decision whether or not to include an assistant referee in the list of top-level assistant referees belonged exclusively to the CRC. Determining the number of top-level assistant referees for any given season was also a matter which fell within the CRC\u2019s margin of appreciation. Contrary to what the applicant argued, the former CRC Directive did not in any way limit the CRC\u2019s discretion to select only those referees who were most fit for the position. In particular, the expression \u201ckadar\u201d (\u201cup to\u201d) referred to in the former CRC Directive did not mean that the number of top-level assistant referees had to be exactly twice the number of top-level referees. Instead, the said provision set the maximum number of top-level assistant referees and gave the CRC the ability to reduce the number if it so wished. Accordingly, the CRC had been well within its rights to limit the number of top-level assistant referees to only seventy, and the applicant\u2019s downgrading to the level of \u201cprovincial referee\u201d had been in accordance with the law and procedure.",

There are no mechanisms in the legislation or regulations to protect the Arbitration Committee from outside pressures. Although Article 61 \u00a7 4 of the TFF Statutes provides that the Arbitration Committee shall be independent in carrying out its functions, there are no real assurances for members of the Committee. The applicable law, in particular the Constitution, does not contain any provisions protecting members of the Arbitration Committee from taking orders from public institutions or semi-public institutions like the TFF including the President and the Board of Directors (see, mutatis mutandis, Brudnicka and Others v. Poland, no.\u00a054273/00, \u00a7 41, 3 March 2005). Therefore, the abstract and general provision concerning the independence of the members is completely misleading. This misleading appearance is contrary to the principle of \u201cjustice must not only be done; it must also be seen to be done\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Bramelid and Malstr\u00f6m v. Sweden, nos. 8588/79 and 8589/79, report of the Commission of 12 December 1983, para.\u00a035). The members of the Arbitration Committee are bound by the instructions of the President and the Board of Directors. Furthermore, they are determined at the sole discretion of the President and the Board of Directors. This system places members of the Arbitration Committee in an unprotected and weak position which makes them vulnerable to manipulation ...\u201d",

He argued that the two applications share the same factual background and therefore should be examined together. The Court observes that the applicant complained about various procedural shortcomings in the proceedings before the CAS and the Swiss Federal Court in his application against Switzerland. Whilst the proceedings before the instances of the TFF and the ensuing proceedings originate in the same dispute and thus share much of the factual background, the Court considers that the latter complaint requires a separate examination of the nature and scope of the Swiss system of dispute resolution in the first applicant\u2019s case which not only differs from the Turkish system under review, but also encompasses separate legal issues not raised in the present case. It therefore finds it more appropriate to examine the applications separately and decides not to join them.",

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not preclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v. Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, \u00a7 122, 6\u00a0November 2018, with further references).",

As regards the remaining criteria, the nature of the offence and degree of severity of the penalty, the Court further observes that influencing the match result is unsportsmanlike conduct which goes against the rules of fair play and that the maximum penalty that the applicants risked receiving was a three-year ban under the former Disciplinary Directive (see paragraph 121 above). In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that none of the elements above, taken alternatively or cumulatively, is sufficient to reach a conclusion that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicants concerned the determination of a criminal charge within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.",

It reiterates that, according to its established case-law, disciplinary proceedings before professional bodies where the right to practise a profession is directly at stake gives rise to disputes over civil rights and obligations (see, among other authorities, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23\u00a0June 1981, \u00a7 45, Series A no. 43). The Court observes that under the rules of the TFF, amateur football players play football without receiving remuneration. While professional football players are paid for the time they spend competing and training, amateur football players are only allowed to be reimbursed for the expenses they incur (see paragraph 123 above). It follows that the suspension that was imposed on the applicants, who play football as amateurs, did not put at stake their right to exercise a profession. The Court also notes that the applicants complained of being deprived of their salary for a year as result of the suspension imposed on them. They submitted news reports and columns published in Turkish newspapers and several examples of contracts entered into between amateur players and clubs. The Court accepts that it may be common practice in Turkey for players playing in amateur football leagues to receive a salary or other benefits from their clubs. Be that as it may, it observes that the applicants failed to produce a copy of any agreements they concluded with their club or proof of payments or any other benefits they had received. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicants thus failed to demonstrate that the dispute in question was pecuniary in nature.",

This expression reflects the principle of the rule of law, which is inherent in the system of protection established by the Convention and its Protocols. An organ which has not been established in accordance with the will of the legislature would necessarily lack the legitimacy required in a democratic society to hear the cases of individuals. The phrase \u201cestablished by law\u201d covers not only the legal basis for the very existence of a \u201ctribunal\u201d but also the composition of the bench in each case (see Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, \u00a7 114, 28 November 2002).

Austria, cited above, \u00a7 36). A court or tribunal is characterised in that substantive sense by its judicial function, that is to say determining matters within its competence on the basis of legal rules, with full jurisdiction and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (see ibid., and Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a025781/94, \u00a7 233, ECHR\u00a02001IV). A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of \u201ctribunal\u201d. The procedure before it must ensure the \u201cdetermination of the matters in dispute\u201d as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23\u00a0October 1985, \u00a7 40, Series A no.\u00a097). For the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1, a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated within the standard judicial machinery. It may be set up to deal with specific subject matter which can be appropriately administered outside the ordinary court system (see Rolf Gustafson v.\u00a0Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports 1997IV). In addition, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence from the executive and also from the parties, merits the designation \u201ctribunal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Beaumartin v.

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 119, ECHR 2005-XIII).

In the Court\u2019s view, however, the mere fact that its members are appointed by the Board of Directors is not sufficient to cast doubt on its objective impartiality. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the manner of appointment of the members of a tribunal does not in itself undermine the independence and impartiality of that adjudicatory body, provided that once appointed the members are not subject to any pressure, do not receive any instructions and perform their duties with complete independence (see Zolotas v. Greece, no. 38240/02, \u00a7\u00a024, 2 June 2005).

Accordingly, the representatives of football clubs continued to make up the majority of the Congress at the time of the proceedings relating to the fifth applicant. In addition to retired footballers and referees, each of the presidents of the footballers and referees\u2019 associations were allowed to participate and vote in the meetings of the Congress under the TFF\u2019s rules as in force at the time of the impugned proceedings concerning both applicants.",

On the contrary, the TFF Statutes require individuals who are chairmen or members of the board of a football club to resign before being appointed to the Board of Directors (see paragraph 65 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this attests to the fact that even though having previous experience in a football club has never been a prerequisite to becoming a member, the Board of Directors has always largely consisted of members or executives of football clubs. Those who could be considered to represent the interests of football other than those of clubs have always been the minority in the Board of Directors.",

The Court reiterates that in Mutu and Pechstein\u00b8 it found that, by making an analogy with the national courts which are always financed by the State budget, the CAS cannot be said to lack independence and impartiality solely on account its financial arrangements (cited above, \u00a7 151). In the present case, the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in Mutu and Pechstein. The fact that members of the Arbitration Committee receive remuneration for each deliberation they attend and have their expenses reimbursed by the executive body of the TFF, the Board of Directors, is not in and of itself sufficient to conclude that the Arbitration Committee lacks independence and impartiality.",

In addition, by referring to the relevant rules of civil and criminal procedure, they allow a party to request the withdrawal of a member of the Arbitration Committee. The Court, however, observes that the applicable rules do not require a member to disclose circumstances which may affect his or her independence and impartiality. More importantly, the TFF did not put in place a specific procedure to be followed in cases where the independence or impartiality of a member of the Arbitration Committee is challenged by the parties. Also, the rules do not specify which body is competent to decide on such a challenge (compare and contrast, Mutu and Pechstein, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

The Court observes that the CRC is a standing committee of the TFF, mostly composed of retired referees, which is appointed by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the President. It also notes that the tenure of its members is the same as that of the Board of Directors and that their remuneration is determined by the same. In addition, the Board of Directors sets the rules governing the composition, principles and procedure of the functioning of the CRC. In addition, the applicable rules of the TFF require the CRC to submit the lists of referees that it has prepared to the Board of Directors for approval.

Should a conflict arise between the Board of Directors and the Arbitration Committee, it can easily be resolved to the Board of Directors\u2019 satisfaction: the Board resigns, seeks reappointment in the same or a similar composition and, subsequently, appoints a new Arbitration Committee in conformity with its expectations.

For instance, in several High Contracting Parties to the Convention, judges are appointed by the Parliament, which in turn comprises very few members from the lowest social strata. If, in a given court case, an unemployed and uneducated defendant with ethnic, racial or religious minority roots is facing a victim from the middle or upper social class, would that mean that the judge in his or her case is neither independent nor impartial simply because the composition of Parliament is much closer to the victim\u2019s background?
