While serving his sentence, the applicant was further charged in a different set of criminal proceedings and transferred to a SIZO on 1 February 2001 and ultimately convicted on 1\u00a0June 2005.

In this regard the Court notes that despite the fact that on 1 February 2001 the prosecution authorities issued an order for the applicant\u2019s detention in the SIZO in connection with the new set of criminal proceedings against him, no formal decision on suspending or terminating the applicant\u2019s original imprisonment under the judgment of 30 December 1999 was taken at that time. Nor could it be seen from the relevant domestic law referred to by the courts (see paragraphs 27, 30, 31 and 32 above) that the applicant\u2019s transfer to the SIZO and the selection of that preventive measure in a different set of proceedings implied automatic suspension of the original sentence. Therefore, during the period in question there were no objective grounds to consider that the applicant stopped serving his prison sentence on 1\u00a0February 2001 and that his continued detention required any additional justification prior to 18 July 2003. The subsequent interpretation by the domestic courts of the legal basis for the applicant\u2019s detention could not retroactively create an obligation to justify the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty with a view to his \u201cconviction by the competent court\u201d. Therefore, the applicant\u2019s detention during the period in question was justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention.",

Austria (27\u00a0June 1968, \u00a7 4, Series A no. 8), the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 3 does not give judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (as confirmed in McKay, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

Any request for release would thus be limited to the purely hypothetical question whether the person could be released if he was not already serving a prison sentence. Therefore, even if the applicant\u2019s continuing detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) ceased to be reasonable, it would not automatically cease to be lawful and justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a).

The imprisoned person is deprived of his liberty within the regime defined in the court sentence. But the regime of imprisonment can not deprive of personal liberty as such. An imprisoned person always has and enjoys a certain level of freedom. (For example, according to Ukrainian legislation a person who committed for the first time a crime of medium severity should be sent to a colony with minimal or medium security level. In such colonies detainees have, although restricted, but adequate freedom of movement during the daytime, they receive money, they have right to spend their money, they have right to correspondence and right to visits of family members.) This fact is important, even when assessments of the level of freedom are purely subjective",

But that is always associated with an interference in the process of enforcement of the sentence. The court that makes such a decision, in the nature of things, affects the level of freedom which the prisoner has - and to which he is entitled throughout the term of the sentence - but that does not affect the finding in the present case that, for the period from 1\u00a0February\u00a02001 to 18 July 2003, Article 5 \u00a7 3 did not apply.",
