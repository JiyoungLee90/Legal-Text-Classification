It appears, however, that neither those instructions nor the instructions from the later prosecutor\u2019s decisions of 23 November 2005 and 24 June 2009 were properly complied with. In particular, on at least two occasions forensic experts indicated that the reconstruction of events performed on 29 September 2004 had been conducted in breach of procedure, therefore, the data received could not serve a basis for the expert conclusion. Despite those indications no new reconstruction of events was conducted.",

Although the expert noted that the absence of lights on the applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s bicycle had caused the collision, it remains unclear in the absence of properly obtained evidence whether it was the main or only reason of the accident.
