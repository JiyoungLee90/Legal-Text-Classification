The Basic Principles, which have since been updated, call, inter alia, for the return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance; a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh; a future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding referendum; the right of all IDPs and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation. The idea is that the endorsement of these principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan would enable the drafting of a comprehensive and detailed settlement. Following intensive shuttle diplomacy by Minsk Group diplomats and a number of meetings between the Presidents of the two countries in 2009, the process lost momentum in 2010. So far the parties to the conflict have not signed a formal agreement on the Basic Principles.",

Military build-up between 2005 and 2009, concerning trenches, revetments, military buildings, vehicles and vehicle tracks was followed by continued military development in the region between 2009 and 2012, but of a different type, in that trenches and revetments fell into disuse, while military buildings and vehicle presence continued to increase.",

The report notes that building degradation and vegetation overgrowth obscured building footprints and made structure counts difficult. While in 2005 some thirty-three buildings remained intact, there were only seventeen in 2009 and thirteen in 2012 left. For most of the destroyed buildings, outer and interior walls have been preserved while roofs have collapsed. While the state of the buildings suggests fire as a possible cause of destruction, the report emphasises that the cause of destruction could not be determined via satellite imagery, and, in particular, it was not always possible to state whether or not buildings had been destroyed deliberately. No cemeteries were identifiable on the satellite imagery. The report suggests that this might be due to vegetation overgrowth.",

Referring to documents of various United Nations bodies, in particular the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the applicant asserted that there was no political will on the part of the Government to protect abandoned property of ethnic Armenians, which was often occupied by refugees or internally displaced persons (IDPs), or to provide compensation for it. Moreover, there was a practice of not giving ethnic Armenians access to documentation concerning their property. There were no signs of a change of these practices. In addition, the applicant drew attention to the practical difficulties in pursuing any court case in Azerbaijan. Borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan were closed. As there were no diplomatic relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, ethnic Armenian refugees or citizens of Armenia were unable to obtain visas except via the consular services in neighbouring countries. Visas were only granted in the context of official visits organised by international organisations or diplomatic missions. Postal services between the two countries were not viable either.",

In addition, Article 68 of the Constitution provided for State liability to compensate any damage resulting from illegal actions or omissions of State bodies or their officials.

Furthermore, the Government submitted copies of judgments in two cases concerning inheritance, in which decisions in favour of ethnic Armenians living abroad were given by the appellate courts. The case of Mammadova Ziba Sultan gizi v. Mammadova Zoya Sergeyevna and Mammadov Farhad Tarif oglu (judgment of the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Azerbaijan of 24 May 2007) concerned an inheritance dispute over property, in which the defendants were the ethnic Armenian spouse and son of the deceased, who were both living in the United States of America. The Court of Appeal overturned the judgment of the Court of First Instance dismissing its assessment that the defendants had to be considered as heirs in bad faith. In Sinyukova, Korovkova and Zaimkina (\u201cChagaryan\u201d, judgment of the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Shaki Court of Appeal of 7\u00a0November 2007), the Court of Appeal decided that the State Notary Office of Mingachevir city had to issue an inheritance certificate in respect of an apartment to the three claimants, daughters of an ethnic Armenian living abroad, as they had to be considered as having made their declaration of inheritance in time.

It cannot, and must not, usurp the role of Contracting States whose responsibility it is to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention are respected and protected on a domestic level. The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is therefore an indispensable part of the functioning of this system of protection. States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).

Gulistan was such an area.

The AAAS report based on the interpretation of satellite images from 2005, 2009 and 2012 indicates that there are trenches in or, at the very least, on the edges of the village. These trenches can be seen clearly in the 2005 and 2009 images, but are less clearly distinguishable in the 2012 image. Since the village is on the north bank of the river and there are only Azerbaijani positions there, the Court considers it sufficiently established, based on the available evidence, that the trenches form part of Azerbaijani positions. This also provides an indication of the presence of military Azerbaijani personnel given that trenches need to be maintained (as follows from the AAAS report according to which trenches fell into disuse in the period between 2009 and 2012 and are therefore less clearly visible). In that connection the Court reiterates that it was not in dispute that there were no civilians in the village. In addition, it appears again from the AAAS report and from the DVD submitted by the third-party Government in 2012 that the territory north of the village and thus access routes to it are under the control of Azerbaijani armed forces. Further indications are provided by the DVD submitted by the applicant in 2008, on which smoke can be seen rising from the chimneys of some houses and a man is walking between houses in ruins.",

The statements of former members of the village council submitted by the applicant were not coherent. According to two statements the village council had divided the plot of the applicant\u2019s father between the applicant and his brother, while according to another statement, the village council had taken the decision to allocate land to the applicant. In any case, the procedure described by the applicant was not in accordance with the administrative structures and laws in force in the 1960s: the village council was not entitled to allocate land. In the 1960s, no specific laws, apart from the Constitution, existed on the right to use land. The 1970 Land Code of the Azerbaijan SSR codified the already existing practice: it laid down that only the Executive Committee of the Soviet of the People\u2019s Deputies had the power to allocate land for the purpose of constructing private houses.

They pointed out that in the application form the applicant himself referred to the merger of the Shahumyan district and a neighbouring district into the new Goranboy district.

Plots of land could be allotted to individuals for their use for an indefinite period of time for purposes such as housing and farming. A person to whom land had been allotted had a right, which was protected by law, to use the land.

As explained by the applicant in Solomonides v. Turkey (no. 16161/90, \u00a7 31, 20 January 2009), his titles of ownership had been registered at the District Lands Office. However, at the time of the Turkish military intervention he had been forced to flee and had been unable to take with him the title deeds. The Cypriot authorities had reconstructed the Land Books and had issued certificates of affirmation of title. These certificates were the best evidence available in the absence of the original records or documents. It is noteworthy that in Saveriades v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 16160/90, 22 September 2009) the reasons why the applicant could not submit the original title deeds were specifically taken into account. The applicant argued that he had been forced to leave his premises, where the documents were held, in great haste and had subsequently been unable to return there or otherwise retrieve the title deeds. The Court accepted that the documents submitted by the applicant (such as a sale contract, ownership certificates and a building permit) provided prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the properties in issue, and continued (\u00a7 18):",

In the admissibility decision in the present case, the Court had noted that it was not clear whether the applicant\u2019s house had been destroyed. It went on to say that at that stage it was only concerned with examining whether the facts of the case were capable of falling within its jurisdiction ratione temporis, while a detailed examination of the facts and legal issues of the case had to be reserved to the merits stage (see Sargsyan (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 88). Having regard to its case-law, the Court considered that the applicant\u2019s lack of access to his alleged property, home and the graves of his relatives in Gulistan had to be considered as a continuing situation which the Court had competence to examine since 15\u00a0April 2002. It had therefore rejected the Government\u2019s objection ratione temporis (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 91-92).

Should the house have been destroyed before the entry into force of the Convention, this would indeed constitute an instantaneous act falling outside the Court\u2019s competence ratione temporis (see Moldovan and Others v.

In reply to the Court\u2019s request to explain this apparent contradiction, the applicant asserted that there had been some confusion between his house and his parent\u2019s house which had arisen when his representative drafted the application on the basis of his written statement of 10 July 2006 in which he had used the phrase, \u201cMy mother stayed in the village of Gulistan and our house was destroyed\u201d.

In the applicant\u2019s view, a range of measures would be available to the Government. Such measures could include creating a property-records body and a process allowing refugees and displaced persons to re-establish legal title to pre-war property and file a claim for its repossession.

The Government pointed out that they consistently opposed the unlawful occupation of NagornoKarabakh and the surrounding provinces by Armenian forces. In parallel, they had sought to re-establish control over the territory by all available diplomatic means, in particular by participating in the peace talks in the framework of the Minsk Group. Regular meetings were held by the Co-Chairs of the Group with the Foreign Ministers and Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In so far as individual measures were required to address the situation of refugees and IDPs, the Government referred to the 1991 Order (see paragraph 83 above) which legalised private property swaps between Azeris fleeing Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding provinces and Armenians fleeing Azerbaijan.

In that connection, the Government noted that the Azerbaijani armed forces, whose status was regulated by the 1993 Law on armed forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan, were responsible for defending the borders of Azerbaijan and for securing the safety of its inhabitants. Access to Gulistan, which was situated within an area of military operations, was prohibited by an Order of the Minister of Defence, which they could not disclose as it was strictly confidential. The legal basis for the Minister of Defence to issue such orders was to be found in Article 7 \u00a7\u00a02\u00a0(11) of the Law on defence of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In fulfilling their mission outlined above, the Azerbaijani armed forces had to comply with the Convention and with international humanitarian law. They were thus responsible for minimising possible harm to civilians by preventing them from entering areas of danger. In fact, allowing civilians to enter the village might be regarded as a violation of Azerbaijan\u2019s obligation to protect their right to life under Article 2 of the Convention. It was obvious that Gulistan was a dangerous area, given the presence of landmines and the risk of hostile action.",

While the issues raised fall within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction as defined in Article 32 of the Convention, it is the responsibility of the two States involved in the conflict to find a political settlement to the conflict (see, mutatis mutandis, Kova\u010di\u0107 and Others v.

Comprehensive solutions to such questions as the return of refugees to their former places of residence, repossession of their property and/or payment of compensation can only be achieved through a peace agreement. Indeed, prior to their accession to the Council of Europe, Armenia and Azerbaijan gave undertakings to the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly to resolve the NagornoKarabakh conflict through peaceful means (see paragraph 76 above). Although negotiations have been conducted in the framework of the Minsk Group, more than twenty years have gone by since the Ceasefire Agreement and more than twelve years since the accession of Azerbaijan and Armenia to the Convention, on 15 and 26 April 2002 respectively, with no political solution yet in sight. As recently as June 2013, the Presidents of the Co-Chair countries of the Minsk Group \u2013 France, Russia and the United States of America \u2013 have expressed their \u201cdeep regret that, rather than trying to find a solution based upon mutual interests, the parties have continued to seek one-sided advantage in the negotiation process\u201d (see paragraph 28 above).

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers the deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions.

However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see among many other authorities, Broniowski v.

The Court reiterates that the concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State, including measures depriving a person of his or her possessions. In each case involving the alleged violation of that Article, the Court must, therefore, ascertain whether by reason of the State\u2019s action or inaction the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7 150, with further references). In assessing compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 the Court must make an overall examination of the various interests in issue, bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are \u201cpractical and effective\u201d. It must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of (ibid., \u00a7 151).",

Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (see paragraph 95 above) prohibits individual or mass forcible transfers or deportations in or from occupied territory, allowing for the evacuation of a given area only if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so require; in that case, displaced persons have a right to return as soon as hostilities in the area have ceased.

The Court would point out that the obligation to take alternative measures does not depend on whether or not the State can be held responsible for the displacement itself. In Do\u011fan and Others the Court noted that it was unable to determine the exact cause of the displacement of the applicants and therefore had to confine its consideration to the examination of their complaints concerning the denial of access to their possessions (cited above, \u00a7\u00a0143).

The question therefore arises whether it is sufficient for the Government to participate in these negotiations in order to fulfil their duty to strike a fair balance between the competing public and individual interests.

In a recent case, the Court has found that the authorities\u2019 refusal to return the bodies of the applicant\u2019s relatives and the order of their burial in an unknown location, thus depriving the applicants of the opportunity to know the location of the gravesite and to visit it subsequently, constituted an interference with their private and family life (see Sabanchiyeva and Others v.

Moreover, the Court has found it established that the applicant owned a house in Gulistan which, though badly damaged, still exists to date (see paragraph 197 above). His claim that, having built his house in the early 1960s, he lived there with his family until his flight in June 1992 is supported by a number of witness statements.

In the subsequent case of Demopoulos and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104-29), the Court examined the effectiveness of remedies which had been amended in the meantime. Having carried out a detailed examination, the Court was satisfied that the proceedings before the Immovable Property Commission provided an effective remedy. It noted in particular that: the Commission, which included two independent international members, had been functioning for four years; the Commission had concluded eighty-five applications and some 300 other claims were pending before it; there was no evidence establishing that the proceedings would take an unreasonable length of time; the Commission had paid out significant sums of money by way of compensation; claims could also be made in respect of non-pecuniary damage, including aspects of any loss of enjoyment of home; exchange of property had been effected in several cases; and there was a right to appeal to a court.

There is no doubt that Gulistan is within the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan, just as Transdniestria is within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Moldova. It is another question whether Azerbaijan is in control of the situation or actions on the ground.

Whilst this can certainly be an ultimate goal to be achieved in Europe, it is not a legal criterion on the basis of which one attributes responsibility. In the case at hand, there is no area without protection, because it is a village within the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan and that means that in principle this State is responsible.

There is no question but that it could do more to allow Armenians to return to their homes or to grant compensation. These steps could even be taken unilaterally and possibly be a way of moving towards finding a solution to the conflict from a different angle. The same is true for Armenia.

The Azerbaijani army is located on the other side of the village, so access to the village is controlled by the Azerbaijani army. At first sight the present case may seem similar to some other cases already examined by the Court, but only at first sight. It is true that the Court has developed criteria according to which jurisdiction and effective control are established and, at first sight, some of them, for example those in Ila\u015fcu and Others v.

In reality, the present case is distinguishable from earlier cases in which the Court has been called upon to examine under Article 1 of the Convention the issue of effective control over the area where the alleged violations have occurred. The deserted village, surrounded from both sides by the opposing armed forces, and mined at its edges is, in the language of diplomats, a Line of Contact (LoC) or ceasefire line, and the applicant, being in his homeland, could successfully address his question to the Armenian authorities and ask what the Armenian armed forces are doing in the territory of another sovereign State closing his access to his homeland, or at least complain about the actions of both States.

The undertakings given by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention include, in addition to a duty to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed, positive obligations to take appropriate steps to ensure respect for those rights and freedoms within its territory (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2001-V).

Geographically, the village is situated to the north of these Azerbaijani territories occupied by the Armenian military forces, on the very border of the LoC, which passes through the River Injechay, where Azerbaijani military positions are on the north bank and Armenian troops on the south bank of the river. Gulistan is totally deserted, its surroundings are heavily mined by both sides and violations of the ceasefire are frequent. The unusual feature in this case, as both Azerbaijan and Armenia agree, is that Gulistan, where the applicant claims to have property, is located on the LoC. Both Azerbaijani and Armenian maps bear this out. Neither side claims otherwise. The only argument is about the exact position of the forces around the village. This issue is very important for deciding the question of effective control over the village. Before moving onto an examination of this question, the following general information must be taken into account. The LoC marks the ceasefire line existing at the end of the 1992-94 war, which was frozen by the Bishkek Protocol of May 1994. In view of that, the Court is faced not with an examination of jurisdiction with regard to an area clearly within the jurisdictional competence of a Contracting Party, nor with the situation of an area clearly under the effective control of another Contracting Party, as was the case in Ila\u015fcu and Others (cited above) or other cases already examined by the Court, but rather with a small piece of land that lies on the very ceasefire line itself. In practice the Line of Contact is maintained by the stationing of the armed forces of the parties and the extensive use of land mines. It has been a long time since any civilians lived in the village. There are regular violent exchanges of fire across the LoC, including in the Gulistan area.",

This evidence from the DVD submitted in 2008 is evidence to which the Court unfortunately referred in paragraph 137 of the present judgment. It is obvious that these materials did not prove anything, so, further on in the judgment, the Court, in the hope of finding something proving Azerbaijan\u2019s military presence in the village itself, referred to the Geospatial Technologies and Human Rights Project of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In my view, this did not provide any evidence either, even though the Court interpreted it as such in the same paragraph. Thus, in my opinion, the results of the AAAS report, in particular image 12, clearly show that there are trenches in or at least very close to the village. The representatives of the AAAS do not claim that the trenches are located in Gulistan. They just say in or behind Gulistan. If all the elements of the AAAS report are taken together, as they are presented and interpreted in paragraph 137, they are contradictory, since they claim that the trenches can be seen in the 2005 and 2009 images, but are less clearly distinguishable in the 2012 image, because they are not being used. Besides, they recorded that the area was, on the whole, uninhabited. Accordingly, if the report does not claim that the trenches are located in the village, that there are military forces in the village, or that the trenches are being used, can it be claimed that there is an Azerbaijani military presence in the village? Particularly in the light of the Court\u2019s observation that \u201cas follows from the AAAS report ... trenches fell into disuse in the period between 2009 and 2012 and are therefore less clearly visible\u201d. That being so, by 2012, this must mean that they are not being used.",

If we are to conclude otherwise, then it has to be considered that Armenia, which has occupied part of the territories of another State, also has effective control over this area. As it is confirmed that, due to continuing fighting, no civilian is able to enter the village and the village is totally deserted and heavily mined from all sides, I conclude that neither of the opposing parties has effective control of the village. The case material clearly indicates that Gulistan is a de facto \u201cno-man\u2019s-land\u201d. This is, I repeat, the characteristic of the present case which distinguishes it from other cases in which the Court has decided the question of jurisdiction and effective control. It is a totally new situation and the first case in which the Court has been asked to answer the question of effective control over a \u201cno-man\u2019s-land\u201d situated on an LoC between two hostile parties and has had to solve this new legal issue. On the one hand, it is an internationally recognised territory of Azerbaijan and it is clear that no areas of limited protection should be accepted within the Convention legal space. The Convention requires that the State secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention to everyone under their jurisdiction. On the other hand, the conclusion \u2013 contrary to the facts \u2013 that effective control has to be attributed to one of the parties cannot be based on international law and contradicts the very concept of \u201ceffective\u201d control. In reality the present case does not in any way resemble the classic model of jurisdiction, and in the obvious absence of effective control as a precondition of positive obligations, it is impossible to speak of any positive obligation. In paragraph\u00a0140 of the present judgment the Court affirms that \u201ca limitation of a State\u2019s responsibility on its own territory to discharging positive obligations has only been accepted in respect of areas where another State or separatist regime exercises effective control\u201d. It is the presence of the Armenian occupying forces on the other side of Gulistan that not only closes access to the village but also excludes not only effective but any control at all over this territory of Azerbaijan and therefore discharges Azerbaijan of its positive obligations.",

In my opinion, the defendant State is taking all these measures to re-establish its sovereignty not only over Gulistan, but also over all the occupied territories, is refraining from supporting the separatist regime and calling on the world community to adhere to this position as well and to respect the sovereign right of the State, and is trying, by every means, to re-establish its control over its territory.",

These submissions confirm the continuing opposition of Azerbaijan to the unlawful occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories by Armenia. Azerbaijan\u2019s attempt to re-establish control over its alienated territory is demonstrated through its support of the OSCE Minsk Process as well as continuing efforts in the United Nations. As far as the latter is concerned, the General Assembly decided in 2004 to include an item entitled, \u201cThe situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan\u201d in its agenda. Regular discussions have followed. In this regard it can be noted that the General Assembly adopted two Resolutions (A/RES/60/285 of 7\u00a0September 2006 and A/RES/62/243 of 14 March 2008) reaffirming continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognised borders. The process is continuing under the auspices of the OSCE. The Minsk Process commenced in 1992 and Azerbaijan has made continuing and consistent efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully. The Basic Principles (also called \u201cthe Madrid Principles\u201d) presented by the three Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group call for: the return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control; an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance; a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh; future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will; the right of all internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation. Azerbaijan takes part in the regular meetings held by the Co-Chairs with the Foreign Ministers and the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has offered every support for this process, believing it to be the best means by which it can re-establish its control over the occupied territories. In these discussions, Azerbaijan has made it clear that it is ready to grant Nagorno-Karabakh \u201cthe highest status of self-rule\u201d within Azerbaijan.",

The aggression against Azerbaijan has severely damaged the socio-economic sphere of the country. In the occupied territories, six cities, twelve towns, 830 settlements, and hundreds of hospitals and medical facilities have been burnt or otherwise destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of houses and apartments and thousands of community and medical buildings have been destroyed or looted. Hundreds of libraries have been plundered and millions of books and valuable manuscripts have been burnt or otherwise destroyed. Several State theatres, hundreds of clubs and dozens of music schools have been destroyed. Several thousand manufacturing, agricultural and other kinds of factories and plants have been pillaged. The hundred-kilometre-long irrigation systems have been totally destroyed. About 70% of the summer pastures of Azerbaijan remain in the occupied zone. The regional infrastructure, including hundreds of bridges, hundreds of kilometres of roads, thousands of kilometres of water and gas pipelines and dozens of gas distribution stations have been destroyed. The war against Azerbaijan has also had catastrophic consequences for its cultural heritage in the occupied territories. According to preliminary data, the overall economic loss inflicted on Azerbaijan as a result of Armenian aggression is estimated at 300 billion United States dollars. Added to that is the non-pecuniary damage, which is obviously impossible to quantify.

The procedural reasons for my dissent in the latter case are also valid, in a large measure, in the present case, simply because the flaws in both judgments are similar. As in Chiragov and Others, the present case raises an issue of compatibility of international humanitarian law with the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d), which the majority avoid. Here again, the majority do not face the thorny questions of the case, both in terms of the evidence presented and the legal questions of the jurisdiction of the respondent State over the ceasefire line and the adjacent area and its \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d civilians within its territory. Having acknowledged that Gulistan is a life-threatening, no-go zone and that the respondent State\u2019s refusal of access to civilians to their alleged homes, property and family graves in the extremely sensitive military area of Gulistan is \u201cjustified\u201d, the majority nonetheless suggest vague \u201calternative measures\u201d, derived from the Madrid political proposal, without providing specifics. By treating the cases of Chiragov and Others and Sargsyan as a putative inter-State case, and suggesting to the respondent States similar \u201calternative measures\u201d, the European Court of Human Rights (\u201cthe Court\u201d) wants to send a message to the conflicting parties. In general, the pages of the judgment exude discontent, amounting to disapproval of the negotiation procedure. Left unstated, but implicit in the majority\u2019s reasoning, is that the Court will no longer wait for politicians to come to terms with the NagornoKarabakh conflict and its human consequences. If need be, the Court is willing to replace diplomacy, in view of the fact, censured by the majority, that the peace negotiations \u201chave not yet yielded any tangible results\u201d (see paragraph 236 of the present judgment).",

The Cypriot Government argued that any remedies which might exist in Turkey or in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were not practical or effective for Greek Cypriots living in the government-controlled area and that they were ineffective for enclaved Greek Cypriots, having regard to the particular nature of the complaints and the legal and administrative framework set up in the north of Cyprus. As regards the case-law of \u201cTRNC\u201d courts referred to by the Turkish Government, the Cypriot Government claimed that it related to situations that were different from those complained of in the application, namely to disputes between private parties and not to challenges to legislation and administrative action. The fate that befell the Cypriot Government\u2019s arguments is well known: the Court considered that the Cypriot Government had failed to rebut the evidence laid before the Commission that aggrieved Greek Cypriots had access to local courts in order to assert civil claims against wrongdoers, and held that no violation of Article 13 of the Convention had been established by reason of the alleged absence of remedies in respect of interferences by private persons with the rights of Greek Cypriots living in Northern Cyprus under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

The probative value of the technical passport with no reference to a primary title of ownership, with an empty field entitled \u201cLand parcel size according to official documents\u201d, such information being required by Article 2.2 of the Standard Reporting Forms Instructions, and with the incorrect official stamp for the issuing authority and the incorrect name of the district in the emblem of the stamp, is close to nil. Not even an extraordinary \u201cflexible\u201d assessment of the face value of that evidence can save it from a strong suspicion of having been fabricated. Furthermore, the applicant based his property claims on written statements of witnesses who had not been submitted to crossexamination, as the majority also acknowledge in paragraph 193 of the present judgment. The witnesses presented contradictory testimony on crucial points. For example, Mr Yura Ghulyan\u2019s statement that the applicant built his house \u201con the plot of land provided to him by the collective farm\u201d contradicts that of Mrs\u00a0Kachatryan, Secretary to the Board of the village council of Gulistan, who stated that the applicant had been allowed to divide the plot of land that had already been allotted to his father. The Chairman of the State Land and Mapping Committee of Azerbaijan, Mr Garib Mammadov, himself affirmed that \u201cthe village councils referred to in the case had no authority to adopt a decision on allocation of lands adjoining the house\u201d. Mr Ghulyan\u2019s testimony that there were four rooms on the second floor also contradicts the testimony of Mrs Elmira Chirkinyan and Mrs Lena Sargsyan to the effect that there were three rooms on the second floor. Mrs Lena Sargsyan\u2019s testimony that the total area of the plot of land was 1,500 sq. m is contradicted by that of Mrs Elmira Chirkinyan, who said that it was a total of 1,000 sq. m.

The satellite images did not even show the locations of the cemeteries in the village. To accept the applicant\u2019s alleged residence on the basis of incomplete copies of the applicant\u2019s former Soviet documents and the alleged existence, location and ownership of his family graves in Gulistan on the sole basis of his own word shows, once again, the measure of unlimited flexibility with which the majority approached the evidence produced by the applicant.

Nonetheless, even if some flexibility may be admitted in terms of the Court\u2019s evidential standards in the context of property claims made by especially vulnerable persons, such as refugees and displaced persons, there should be reasonable limits to the flexible approach of the Court, since experience shows that mass displacement of people fosters improper property claims by opportunists hoping to profit from the chaos. Unlimited flexibility will otherwise discredit the Court\u2019s factual assessment. Having failed to meet his burden of proof, the applicant relied on the Court\u2019s flexibility, which in this case exceeded all reasonable limits, as it accepted clearly contradictory testimonial and documentary evidence as being sound and reliable. Such blatant contradictions would strongly suggest a fabricated version of the facts, thus undermining the applicant\u2019s victim status.

Secondly, even accepting the parties\u2019 maps of the area at face value and assuming that the existence of the physical barrier of the river between Gulistan and the Nagorno-Karabakh army facilitates the Azerbaijani army\u2019s access to Gulistan, I do not consider this fact alone sufficient to conclude that the respondent State holds jurisdiction over Gulistan and its surrounding area and that the alleged deprivation of the applicant\u2019s rights under the Convention is attributable to Azerbaijan. Apparently, the Nagorno-Karabakh army is closer to the village and in a more favourable strategic position, with the village within firing distance. In fact, Gulistan is situated midway between two armies, neither of which exercises effective control of the area. That is exactly what makes the area so dangerous.

Accordingly, there is no similarity to the facts in the present case, whether in terms of space (non-conflict, populated zone), time (peacetime), result (death of a person), or even mens rea (negligence on the part of soldiers).

In undertaking to provide a \u201ctimely and decisive\u201d response, the world political leaders affirmed their determination to act not only when the crimes in question were already occurring but also when they were imminent, by using all the permissible and necessary means, including those of a military nature, to avert their occurrence. Conceptually and practically, this responsibility entailed the prevention of such crimes, including the incitement to commit them, as the normative statement of paragraph 138 clarified, reinforced by the statement of political support to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide in paragraph 140. The nature of the requisite response was not left indefinite, since it must be all-inclusive in order to be \u201cdecisive\u201d, and obviously to encompass the full range of coercive and noncoercive enforcement actions available to the Security Council, as shown by the express reference to Chapters VI, VII and VIII of the Charter.

After imposing an affirmative duty on the Security Council to react to the catalogued international crimes, the Outcome Document omitted to mention the consequences of any Security Council failure to respond.

A contrario, any initiative in accordance with the UN Charter for the purpose of ensuring human rights in another State can be taken by States acting individually or collectively, and should not be considered an intrusion in its internal affairs. Some years later, quite restrictively, Article VIII of the 2003 IIL Resolution on Humanitarian Assistance reformulated the rule, with much caution, as follows: in the event that a refusal to accept a bona fide offer of humanitarian assistance or to allow access to the victims leads to a threat to international peace and security, the Security Council may take the necessary measures under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.

In this context, the mention of these measures resonates more like wishful thinking than a legally binding obligation.",

After one century of mass murders committed by political leaders against their own peoples, like the Armenians under Talaat Pasha, the Ukrainians under Stalin, the Jews under Hitler, the Cambodians under Pol Pot, and the Tutsi at the hands of the Hutu, the international community came up with a two-pronged response: on the one hand, in Rome it established the rules on international criminal responsibility of political and military leaders and, on the other, in Vienna it affirmed sovereignty as the responsibility to protect human rights, and the international community\u2019s subsidiary responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in the face of the national authorities\u2019 manifest failure to ensure their protection. Being at the intersection of international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, the responsibility to protect is not a mere political catalyst for international action. It is a customary international rule which creates human rights protection obligations for States. Action aimed at their implementation is thus also subject to the international rule of law, including that of the Convention. Therefore, when implemented by Contracting Parties to the Convention, the responsibility to protect is subject to the oversight of this Court. Those who seek to enforce international law must be fully accountable.",
