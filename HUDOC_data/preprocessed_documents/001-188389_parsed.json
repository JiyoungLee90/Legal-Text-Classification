Accordingly, it is of the view that the annulment in itself did not constitute a violation of the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. At the same time, the Court underlines that the correction of the authorities\u2019 errors should not create disproportionate new wrongs (ibid., \u00a7 140, and the cases cited therein).

Having examined the documents submitted to it by the parties indicating the steps taken by the authorities in the subsequent restitution process (see paragraphs\u00a013-26 above), the Court is unable to conclude that from 2010 to the date of the last available information (12\u00a0October 2018 \u2013 see paragraph\u00a026 above) the Lithuanian authorities acted with sufficient promptness in order to compensate the applicants for the losses which they had sustained as a result of the authorities\u2019 mistakes (see, for similar situations, ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 149-50 and 156). It notes in particular that it appears that no actions at all were taken between July 2012 and May\u00a02016 (see paragraphs\u00a017-19 above). The Court emphasises that the authorities were aware of the applicants\u2019 individual situation \u2013 specifically, that their property rights had already been restored and later had to be annulled because of the mistakes made in the restitution process (see paragraph\u00a015 above). Furthermore, in their letters of August 2012, the applicants reiterated that they had already undergone the process once, and asked for priority treatment (see paragraph\u00a018 above).

Although, in candidates\u2019 meetings, many of the applicants declined the plots which had been offered to them (see paragraphs\u00a019, 23 and 24 above), in their observations to the Court they submitted that the plots offered to them had been of low quality (see paragraph\u00a035 above), and the Court does not find such grounds for refusal unreasonable.",

However, the Court observes that up to that point those applicants had not refused to participate in the restitution process, nor had they taken any action to suspend it (compare and contrast ibid., \u00a7 162).

It observes that, under Lithuanian law, the authorities were entitled to restore property rights by monetary compensation, even without the applicants\u2019 consent (ibid., \u00a7\u00a093). In several previous cases in which the applicants had failed to properly express their will as to their preferred way of restitution, the Court considered that the payment of monetary compensation was compatible with the Convention (see Nekvedavi\u010dius v. Lithuania (merits), no.\u00a01471/05, \u00a7\u00a062, 10\u00a0December 2013, and Valan\u010dien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no.\u00a02657/10, \u00a7\u00a063, 18\u00a0April 2017). Therefore, even if any of the applicants had failed to express their choice as to the form of restitution or had refused the plots offered to them, the Court considers that the authorities had the ability to restore their property rights by monetary compensation, in line with the principles established in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Beinarovi\u010d and Others, cited above, \u00a7 158).",
