Furthermore, it ought to protect the authorities and other persons concerned from being subject to any uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see, for example, Worm v.\u00a0, 29 August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). The rule is intended to ensure that it is possible to ascertain the facts of the case before that possibility fades away, making a fair examination of the question at issue next to impossible (see Pavlenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 42371/02, \u00a7 69, 1 April 2010).",

Germany (25 September 1992, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a033 and 34, Series A no.\u00a0237B) that the right to free legal assistance is not absolute; such assistance is to be provided only if the accused \u201c[does] not [have] sufficient means to pay\u201d. The Court indicated that appointment of counsel under German law had been decided solely in the light of the requirement of the interests of justice rather than any \u201cmeans test\u201d.

Rather, this matter is decided with reference to the presence or lack of waiver by a defendant, while accepting cases of mandatory legal assistance. The CCrP considered counsel\u2019s fees as \u201clitigation costs\u201d to be borne, in general, by the party concerned. It thus appears that even if a defendant was provided with \u201cfree\u201d legal assistance he would still be required to pay for that after the trial. However, a total or partial exception remained possible, for instance on account of indigence (see paragraph 53 above).",
