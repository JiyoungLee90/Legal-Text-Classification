It observes, in particular, that both parties have failed to provide reliable and objective data pertaining to the prices of land and real estate in  at the date of the Turkish intervention. This failure renders it difficult for the Court to assess whether the estimate furnished by the administrator of the applicant\u2019s estate of the 1974 market value of the applicant\u2019s plots of land is reasonable. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicant (Rule\u00a075\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Rules of Court).",
