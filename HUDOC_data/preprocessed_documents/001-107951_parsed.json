The Government concluded that the application had therefore been validly lodged only on 31\u00a0March and 4 April 2006, that is, after the expiry of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. As to the substance of the present complaint, the respondent Government argued that the applicants had no title or pecuniary rights in respect of the cars. It had been incumbent on them to substantiate their title with due regard to the principle affirmanti incubit probatio. Thus, their claims in the compensation proceedings before the national courts had not been in relation to any \u201ccivil rights\u201d. Consequently, the courts\u2019 refusal to examine their case on the merits had not frustrated their right to a court.\u00a0In any event, the applicants had been rightly required to produce a criminal court judgment confirming the criminal conviction of a judge. The claims, which were directed against several public authorities, had depended directly on the existence of such a judgment and could not be processed without it. The applicants had referred to Article 1070 \u00a7\u00a02 of the Civil Code citing, as the basis for their action, an unlawful action by a judge, rather than the delivery of an unlawful court decision.",
