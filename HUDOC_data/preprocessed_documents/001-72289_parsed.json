According to the Court\u2019s established case-law, a temporary backlog of court business does not engage the international responsibility of the State concerned, provided that the State takes effective remedial action with the requisite promptness (see Guincho v.

The evidence adduced by the Government does not support the conclusion that in the present case there occurred a sudden and unforeseeable increase in the number of actions being brought, thereby generating a temporary backlog of business. The changes of presiding judge represent a natural part of the life of a court and may occasion a degree of delay (Deumeland v. Germany, judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 100, p. 28, \u00a7 82).
