This decision, too, could serve as warning to the applicant that in case of continuing disruptive behaviour he could be removed from the courtroom again, for a longer period of time. Moreover, on 2 September 2002 the trial court considered removing the applicant from the courtroom for laughing, but eventually made no decision to this effect. Despite these repeated express and implied warnings the applicant on 5 September 2002 made remarks which could reasonably be seen by the trial court as having disruptive effect on proceedings, in particular given the pattern of the applicant\u2019s prior conduct.",

By continuing to behave in a disruptive manner on 19 June and 5 September 2002 he tacitly waived, of his own free will, his right to be present at the hearings. The circumstances preceding the decisions to remove him during that period, in particular the repeated nature of his behaviour, allow the Court to conclude that this waiver was established in an unequivocal manner. There is also no indication that this waiver ran counter to any important public interest. Moreover, the Court observes that in any case the applicant\u2019s exclusion from the courtroom did not prejudice his defence rights to a degree incompatible with the requirements of a fair trial. Most importantly, he continued to be represented by a lawyer during the parts of the trial from which he himself was excluded. The Court also notes that in assessing the fairness of proceedings it must consider them as a whole, including the decision of the appellate court (see, for example, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16\u00a0December 1992, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 247B).\u00a0The Court observes that in Ukraine the jurisdiction of appellate courts extends to both legal and factual issues and the Court of Appeal had the power to review the case in its entirety and examine the evidence which had been examined by the trial court (see paragraphs 82 and 83 above). During the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, the applicant was both present and represented by his lawyer and could have sought re-examination of the evidence and questions examined by the trial court in his absence (see Jones, cited above, and compare with Idalov v. Russia [GC], no. 5826/03, \u00a7 180, 22 May 2012). The applicant did not argue that he was prevented from exercising any of these rights in the course of the appeal proceedings.",

However, they can override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (see Croissant v. Germany, 25 September 1992, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 237B).
