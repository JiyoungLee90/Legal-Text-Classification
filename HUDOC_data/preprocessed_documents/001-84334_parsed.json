The Court observes that under Russian law parties to proceedings may challenge the progress of the criminal investigation before a supervising prosecutor or a judge. However, the applicant and members of his family were excluded from the proceedings. Contrary to the usual practice under national law, the deceased\u2019s family members were not granted the official status of victims in the criminal proceedings, a procedural role which would have entitled them to intervene during the course of the investigation. The Government\u2019s reference to their departure abroad does not suffice to explain this omission in view of the family\u2019s presence in  for a number of months after the event, including on 17 September 2000 when a team of investigators arrived in Starye Atagi. Thus, it is unclear how they could have made use of this provision. Even assuming that they could have done so, the decisions to adjourn the investigation were anyway repeatedly quashed by the supervising prosecutors. The Court is thus not persuaded that an appeal from the applicant or his family members would have made any difference. The applicant must therefore be regarded as having complied with the requirement to exhaust the relevant criminal-law remedies. In view of this conclusion, the Court is not required to decide whether there existed special circumstances which would have absolved the applicant from the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies.",

A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI; and Tani\u015f and Others v.

Thus, it has found that where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which an issue will arise under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v.

It is obvious that these measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. The Court reiterates that it is crucial in cases of deaths in contentious situations for the investigation to be prompt. The passage of time will inevitably erode the amount and quality of the evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence will cast doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts, as well as drag out the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2002-II).

This is particularly strong corroboration of the fact that the killing of Mr Zubayrayev was carried out by members of the Russian army: a murder by a group of persons who, according to the Government, were other than Government agents would have provided strong grounds for an immediate, quick and effective investigation.

The applicant produced testimony by his mother and corroboration in support of it, and no reason has been produced as to why she could possibly have had a motive to lie. Among the facts included in her statement is direct evidence that the people who killed the applicant\u2019s father \u201cwore insignia of the Russian army\u201d. The majority does not seem to have attached appropriate weight to this aspect. It is not even repeated in the conclusions of the judgment. At the same time, I do not understand what the majority means by saying that the applicant did not \u201csubmit persuasive evidence\u201d. I will not repeat the evidence here but I consider it necessary to point out that the evidence already referred to above is coherent, spontaneous and corroborated. The fact that it comes from only one witness does not detract from its credibility, nor is this a factor affecting the strength of such evidence. Times have changed. Proof of the truth in judicial proceedings no longer requires a minimum number of witnesses, as was once the case in many ancient legal systems.",
