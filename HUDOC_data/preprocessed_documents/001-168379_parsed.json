It is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his case effectively to the courts and that he is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2005II, N.J.D.B. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a076760/12, \u00a7 71, 27 October 2015, and Kaba v.

Where an individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the restriction will not be incompatible with Article 6 where the limitation did not impair the very essence of the right and where it pursued a legitimate aim, and there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a056547/00, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2002-VI, and Agromodel OOD v.

France, no. 46800/99, \u00a7 20, ECHR 2002II). Moreover, since the right of access to court is not absolute, it may be acceptable to impose conditions on the grant of legal aid, such as the financial situation of the litigant. Nevertheless, the question of whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, on the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicant\u2019s capacity to represent him or herself effectively (see Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 61). In this context, it must be ascertained whether the applicant\u2019s appearance before the courts without the assistance of a lawyer would be effective, in the sense of whether he or she would be able to present his or her case properly and satisfactorily (see Airey v. Ireland, 9\u00a0October 1979, \u00a7 24, Series A no. 32). Regard must also be had to the overall context and, in particular, the extent to which the applicant has already enjoyed access to court and equality of arms in the proceedings (see N.J.D.B. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 74).",

The Government also strongly relied on the fact that the claimant company had not been continuously represented by a legal professional. Nevertheless, taking also into account the fact that the applicants were not provided with legal aid because of a rigid application of the domestic provisions without any consideration of their particular circumstances, the Court considers that the safeguards referred to by the Government were not any substitute for competent and sustained representation by an experienced lawyer familiar with the case (see, a contrario, N.J.D.B. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 78). The fact that the claimant company was not continuously represented by a legal professional cannot be regarded as equal to the applicants being refused legal aid and cannot be considered as guaranteeing the applicants an effective defence and an ability to present their case properly and satisfactorily (see paragraph 45 above).",

Although the Court cannot conclude that the applicants waived their right to participate in the said proceedings, it is obvious that they demonstrated a certain lack of diligence by sending a letter informing the court that they would not be able to be present only four days beforehand, bearing in mind that two of those four days fell on a weekend.

The Court finds that although the applicants certainly suffered some damage, it cannot be attributed to the refusal of legal aid alone. In view of this, and in view of the fact that the proceedings in the remaining aspects, save the effective access to court, were fair, the Court rejects the applicants\u2019 claim in respect of pecuniary damage.",
