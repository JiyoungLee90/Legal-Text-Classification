Any preventive measure, including remand in custody, can be applied taking into account the existence of a risk that the accused may: (a) hide from the prosecuting authority; (b) interfere with the pre-trial investigation or trial by illegally influencing the parties to the proceedings or by tampering with or hiding the relevant evidence; (c)\u00a0reoffend or pose a danger to the public; (d) fail to appear before the prosecuting authority without good reason or otherwise evade criminal responsibility and punishment; or (e) hinder the execution of a court judgment (Article 155.1). The following should also be taken into account when deciding upon the need for a preventive measure and choosing the type of measure to be applied: (a) the nature and gravity of the criminal charge and circumstances in which the investigated offence was committed; (b) the accused\u2019s personality, age, health, occupation, and family, financial and social situation; and (c) whether the accused has been convicted or subjected to preventive measures before, and other relevant circumstances (Article 155.2). Moreover, as a general rule, the preventive measure of remand in custody can be imposed only with regard to a person who is charged with an offence which carries a punishment of more than two years\u2019 imprisonment (Article 155.3).",

Turkey, 22 October 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI). Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or taken before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the suspicions which provide the grounds for the detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see\u00a0Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no.\u00a0300A). However, the requirement that the suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention. The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient. The words \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d mean the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, 30 August 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 182, and Cebotari v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 35615/06, \u00a7 48, 13 November 2007).",

Whenever the danger of absconding can be avoided by bail or other guarantees, the accused must be released, it being incumbent on the national authorities to always duly consider such alternatives (see,\u00a0mutatis mutandis, G.K. v.

However, it reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention cannot be seen as authorising pretrial detention unconditionally, even if it is short. Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Belchev v. Bulgaria, no. 39270/98, \u00a7\u00a082, 8 April 2004; Sarban v.

Even when issuing the first order for the applicant\u2019s detention only a few days after his arrest, the national authorities were already under an obligation to demonstrate convincingly their justification for such a measure (see\u00a0Patsuria v. Georgia, no. 30779/04, \u00a7 67, 6 November 2007, and Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no. 37048/04, \u00a7 75, 13 January 2009). Moreover, the Court has already held that there must be an opportunity for judicial consideration of release pending trial even at the very early stages of pretrial detention, where the nature of the offence or the personal circumstances of the suspected offender are such as to render detention unreasonable, or unsupported by relevant or sufficient grounds (see McKay, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a046).",
