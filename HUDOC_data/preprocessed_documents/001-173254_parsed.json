The Government also considered that such interference had pursued the legitimate aim. The City of Moscow was responsible for providing affordable housing to people on low incomes. Accordingly, the City had reclaimed the flat in the interests of those people and assigned it to a family of four persons pursuant to the social housing waiting list. Lastly, the Government argued that the interference with the applicant\u2019s rights could not be considered disproportionate given that the national courts had granted his claims against N. and it remained opened to him to bring any other claim for damages, if necessary. Besides, the applicant\u2019s eviction had been suspended for over two years so that he had been able to make necessary housing arrangements.

The Government did not explain why the city authorities had not verified the validity of the judgment allegedly acknowledging Get.\u2019s title to the flat. The omissions on the part of the authorities should not have been rectified at his expense. The applicant further argued that the loss of the flat had placed an excessive burden on him. Even though the authorities had suspended his eviction for some time, he had been deprived of his property which he had bought in a good faith, without any compensation. Following the loss of his property, he was unable to buy a new flat and currently had to rent a flat. The social housing policy implemented by the city authorities could not justify his loss.",

Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-51, 29 January 2015; Andrey Medvedev v. Russia, no. 75737/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-47, 13 September 2016; Kirillova v.

Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State had alienated its assets to private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures resulting in the loss by the State of its real property should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide owners of the property. The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

Each time it was sold it was encumbered on the registration authorities to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. The Government, however, did not proffer any explanation, as to why those safeguards had not been effective in detecting fraud and protecting the City\u2019s interests. In such circumstances, the Court considers that it was not for the applicant to assume the risk of the title to the flat being revoked on account of the said omissions on the part of the authorities in procedures specially designed to prevent fraud in real-property transactions. The Court reiterates that the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova, cited above, \u00a7 49). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the flat by the applicant and the transfer of the ownership of the flat to the City of Moscow, in the circumstances of the case, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on him. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",
