Two possibilities exist: on 16\u00a0May 2012 the length of the proceedings either already had or had not been excessive, in the light of the criteria developed in the Court\u2019s case-law. If the proceedings, which concerned the determination of the applicant\u2019s civil rights and obligations, had already been excessively long, an expedited completion of the proceedings, in the absence of any monetary compensation, could not be considered to offer sufficient redress (see also Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0185, ECHR 2006V). It is true that the Court has accepted that in criminal cases a reduction of the final sentence imposed on the applicant may sometimes amount to such compensation (see, for example, Tr\u016bps v.\u00a0Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a058497/08, 20 November 2012). However, the complaint in the present case concerns the length of civil proceedings and it has not been shown to the Court in what manner the applicant has been compensated for the allegedly excessive length of the proceedings. On the other hand, if on the date when the Senate adopted its final decision the proceedings had not been excessively lengthy, the correct conclusion to reach would not be that the applicant could not claim to be a victim of a violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01, but instead that the proceedings in question had complied with the requirements of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01.",

The Government referred to the general right of parties to submit motions that is enshrined in section\u00a074(2)(6) of the Civil Procedure Law. In the alternative, the Government submitted that section\u00a0281 of the Law on the Judiciary (Par tiesu varu) authorised the president (priek\u0161s\u0113d\u0113t\u0101js) of the relevant district or regional court to redistribute the case assignment within the respective court.

The Government also submitted three examples of decisions of Latvian courts, from which it appears that in certain situations (the specific cases submitted pertained to complaints about a court\u2019s alleged failure to make available a translation of its decision, about the Senate of the Supreme Court\u2019s alleged failure to correctly apply EU legislation and about damages caused by medical negligence) the civil courts are in principle prepared to examine cases brought on the basis of Article\u00a092 of the Constitution, even in the absence of any more specific legislation.",

Furthermore, the Civil Procedure Law (unlike the Criminal Procedure Law, see Tr\u016bps v.\u00a0Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a017) does not contain any criteria on which the courts could rely in order to determine whether proceedings have been excessively lengthy. Any decisions taken by courts in response to motions to accelerate proceedings are hence left entirely to the discretion of such courts. No further appeal against a refusal to accelerate is available (see, in contrast, Gonzalez Marin v. Spain (dec.), no.\u00a039521/98, ECHR\u00a01999VII). In brief, the Court is not convinced that a motion to accelerate the proceedings could, on the basis of predetermined criteria, have brought relief to the applicant. The Government have not submitted any examples from domestic practice attesting to the contrary. The Court finds that the Riga Regional Court\u2019s reply to the applicant that questions concerning an excessive length of proceedings fell outside its competence (see paragraph\u00a038 above) serves as a proof that a request to accelerate the proceedings was not practically accessible to him.",
