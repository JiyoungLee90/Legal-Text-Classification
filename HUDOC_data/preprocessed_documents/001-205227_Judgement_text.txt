The applicant complained under Article 3 of the Convention about the conditions of his detention in the Kyiv pre-trial detention centre (“the Kyiv SIZO”) and under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him. Furthermore, he complained that there had been a breach of his rights under Article 7 of the Convention on account of the failure of the domestic courts to deduct the duration of his pre-trial detention from the fifteen-year prison sentence imposed on him.
The applicant was born in 1967 and is currently serving a life sentence.
He was granted legal aid and was represented by Mr M. Tarakhkalo, Ms V. Lebid and Ms I. Boykova, lawyers practising in Kyiv.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr I. Lishchyna.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 28 December 2000 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant in respect of one charge of kidnapping for ransom committed earlier in 2000. Those proceedings were assigned case no. 62-2222. Subsequently, various other charges were added to the proceedings: kidnapping, murder, robbery, theft, extortion, police impersonation and illegal arms possession committed in 1996 and later by an organised gang.
On 26 June 2002 the applicant was arrested as a suspect within proceedings no. 62-2222.
On 28 June 2002 he was remanded in custody as a preventive measure pending trial. At that time all the charges against him came under the abovementioned case no. 62-2222. His pre-trial detention within those proceedings was extended on many occasions.
In October 2003 certain charges were severed into a separate set of proceedings (no. 49-1205). The issue of a preventive measure in respect of the applicant was never examined within this set of proceedings, given that his pre-trial detention was maintained in case no. 62-2222. According to the applicant, he was the only one in such a situation, whereas all the other coaccused had the preventive measures in their respect determined within both sets of proceedings.
On 17 October 2006 the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine approved the bill of indictment in case no. 49-1205 and sent it for trial.
On 21 November 2006 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (“the Kyiv City Court”), sitting as a court of first instance, started the trial in those proceedings.
On 21 May 2010 it found the applicant guilty of the following criminal offences committed in 1996 and 1997: double murder for profit, kidnapping, several counts of robbery, illegal arms possession and police impersonation. He was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The judgment stated that the applicant’s sentence started running on 21 May 2010. The court ordered his detention as a preventive measure until the judgment became enforceable. The judgment did not mention the period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention and did not order that it should be counted towards the sentence. Five other persons were also convicted by the same judgment, including Mr Dubovoy, one of the applicants in Volchkova and Others v. Ukraine ([Committee], nos. 14062/05 and 5 others, 8 June 2017; see paragraphs 35 and 40 below). One of the co-defendants, M., was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. The trial court held that his pre-trial detention starting from 24 March 2006 was to be counted towards that sentence. Another co-defendant, O., was given a sentence of six years and six months’ imprisonment and also had his pre-trial detention, starting from 17 May 2005, set off against the sentence. The remaining two codefendants had not been detained as a preventive measure prior to the judgment pronouncement.
The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, in which he argued, inter alia, that the duration of his pre-trial detention, since his arrest on 26 June 2002 (see paragraph 7 above) until the pronouncement of the verdict, should have been deducted from the term of his sentence.
On 19 April 2011 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment in general. It dismissed the above-mentioned argument of the applicant on the grounds that no custodial preventive measure had been applied to him in that set of criminal proceedings.
On 25 January 2012 the Kyiv City Court delivered its judgment in case no. 62-2222 (see paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 above), which was 776 pages long. The court found the applicant guilty of banditry, eleven counts of murder for profit and numerous counts of kidnapping for ransom, extortion, robbery, theft, police impersonation and illegal arms possession committed on various dates between 1997 and 2002. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Twelve other persons were also convicted (M. and O. who had earlier been convicted by the judgment of 21 May 2010 (see paragraph 12 above) were not among them). It was specified in the judgment that the applicant’s sentence had started running on 26 June 2002 (see paragraph 7 above).
On 23 April 2013 the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters (“the Higher Specialised Court”) upheld that judgment.
From 26 June 2002 to 27 June 2013 the applicant was detained in the Kyiv SIZO.
He alleged that the conditions of his detention there had been unacceptable. The applicant referred to a severe lack of personal space (about 2.5 sq. m per inmate) and poor ventilation. No further factual details were provided.
The Government submitted that they were not in a position to provide any information about the conditions of the applicant’s detention in the Kyiv SIZO, given that the relevant documents had been destroyed at the end of the mandatory five-year storage period.
Article 47 provided that the duration of pre-trial detention was to be deducted from the term of the prison sentence on the basis of the “one day for one day” rule.
Pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (d) of Article 93 (as worded before 22 February 2000), murder of two or more persons and/or committed for profit was punishable by imprisonment of eight to fifteen years, or by the death penalty. Under the 22 February 2000 amendments, the death penalty was replaced with a life sentence.
The relevant part of Article 338 read as follows:
“If the defendant was not detained prior to the verdict pronouncement, his or her sentence shall start running from the beginning of its enforcement.
If the defendant was detained in the framework of the proceedings in question [в цій справі] prior to the verdict pronouncement, the duration of that detention shall count towards his or her sentence.”
