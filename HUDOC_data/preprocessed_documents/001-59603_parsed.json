In support of their request, the Government submitted that the applicant association had succeeded in persuading the Conseil d\u2019Etat to quash the ban on its publication with retroactive effect. They argued that the elimination of the impugned measure from the established body of legal rules rendered the applicant association\u2019s complaints inadmissible ipso facto. They also argued that the claim for compensation that the applicant association had deliberately refrained from making had been neither uncertain to succeed nor necessarily bound to increase the length of the proceedings excessively. As to the future, it considered that the applicant association\u2019s status as a victim was equally debatable as there was currently no ban applying to any of its publications.",

On that point, it observed that its aim was to inform as broad a target audience as possible, in various countries and at international level, about human rights and the rights of peoples and in particular about the right of peoples to decide on their own future and exercise self-determination. Its goal therefore was to disseminate ideas which, in the Minister of the Interior\u2019s view, were apt to encourage separatism and hence were liable to ministerial censorship. Furthermore, these books had been drafted jointly by French and Spanish authors and were written in French, Spanish, Basque, German, Italian and English. The applicant association had already undergone a continuous violation of its right to freedom of expression for over nine years. In the final analysis, the law amounted to an extremely grave threat to freedom of expression since it established a set of preventive rules which were exempt from the general rules on freedom of the press, in other words an administrative system in which the courts carried out an ex post facto review without being able to order the suspension of the impugned measure. The Minister had very broad powers of discretion to assess the reasons for a ban and bans were general and absolute in their geographical and temporal scope and could not be tailored to fit particular situations.",

The administrative authorities were empowered therefore to prohibit the publication of a work in the event of a serious threat to public order whether the publication was of French or of foreign origin and, accordingly, the same review was conducted by the courts in both cases (assessing proportionality and necessity). Hence, two publications with the same content, one of French and the other of foreign origin, could not at bottom be treated substantially differently. The alleged difference in treatment actually amounted only to a difference in the legal basis and the procedure followed. It had now become a largely formal difference precisely because of the Association Ekin judgment of 9 July 1997. As a result of this leading decision, the administrative courts were now expected to ensure that, in cases like the one before the Court, contested decisions were in exact proportion to the seriousness of the facts, which themselves had to be of the exact type to justify the decision in law. For instance, only a serious threat to the public interest could justify such a serious sanction and it had been on that basis that the decision affecting the applicant association had been set aside. Moreover, if an individual measure was in breach of Article 10 of the Convention, it would inevitably also be in breach of section 14 of the Law of 1881 as it was now interpreted by the case-law of the Conseil d\u2019Etat because it would exceed the limits to policing powers set by this case-law. Therefore, regardless of any factual considerations, and for all the reasons given above, there was nothing to warrant the argument that the policing powers conferred on the administrative authorities by the contested law were not in themselves in keeping with the provisions of Article 10 of the Convention.",

The Court notes that the provision does not state the circumstances in which the power may be used. In particular, there is no definition of the concept of \u201cforeign origin\u201d nor any indication of the grounds on which a publication deemed to be foreign may be banned. Admittedly, those gaps have gradually been filled by the administrative courts\u2019 case-law. Nonetheless, as the applicant association pointed out, the application of those rules has, in certain cases, produced results that are at best surprising and in some cases verge on the arbitrary, depending on the language of publication or the place of origin.",

In addition, judicial review is not automatic since it can only take place on application by the publisher to the courts. As to the scope and effectiveness of judicial review, the Court observes that, up until the judgment delivered by the Conseil d\u2019Etat in the case before the Court, the administrative courts only carried out a limited review of decisions taken under section 14 of the Law of 1881, as amended. The Conseil d\u2019Etat did not extend its powers of review to a full review of the grounds for the decision until its judgment of 9 July 1997 in the Ekin case. Even so, the applicant association still had to wait more than nine years before obtaining a final judicial decision. Clearly, the length of the proceedings substantially undermined the practical effectiveness of the judicial review, whereas the case should have been dealt with more expeditiously precisely because of its subject matter. An aggravating factor, which was not disputed by the Government, is that, under the statutory provision applicable in the case before the Court, stays of execution were granted only if the requesting party was able to show that a ban would cause damage for which it would be difficult to make reparation. That is, to say the least, a difficult condition to satisfy. Lastly, Article 8 of the decree of 28 November 1983 lays down that if the authorities certify that a ban is urgently required, the publisher is not entitled to submit oral or written observations before the order imposing the ban is adopted, which is what happened in the instant case. In conclusion, the Court considers that the judicial-review procedures in place in cases concerning administrative bans on publications provide insufficient guarantees against abuse.",

The Government argued that the existence of legislation specifically governing publications of foreign origin was justified, among other things, by the fact that it was impossible to institute proceedings against authors or publishers guilty of prohibited conduct when operating from abroad. The Court does not find that a persuasive argument. Although the exceptional circumstances in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, might have justified tight control over foreign publications, the argument that a system that discriminated against publications of that sort should continue to remain in force would appear to be untenable.
