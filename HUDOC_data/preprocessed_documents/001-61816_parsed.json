The applicant would also have been influenced by the fact that a summary procedure involved a maximum sentence of 28 days (and 60 days only if extended powers were granted) whereas trial by a district court-martial could have in theory (and despite the terms of QR 6.121) led to a sentence of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. Additional evidence emerging after his election for a court-martial could have led to a more serious charge being laid against him (QR 6.089).

However, that Order did not amount to a guarantee to the applicant in February 1997 that, if he chose the court-martial option, he would be tried under the new system for which the 1996 Act provided.
