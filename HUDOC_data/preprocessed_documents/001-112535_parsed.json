The first applicant\u2019s buttocks had been covered in blood. The officer had ordered that the second applicant be taken to his office and the first applicant to another. According to the witness, Adam Makhashev had started swearing and expressing his anger against the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. Two other police officers who had been present in the office, Mr M. Kh. and Mr Z.Ar., had asked the applicant to calm down. The latter had suddenly hit the witness in the face, causing bleeding, and then grabbed a stationery knife. Mr M. Kh. and Mr Z.Ar. had managed to take the knife from the applicant. After that the witness had gone to the bathroom to wash the blood off his face.

Having noticed blood on the first applicant\u2019s trousers the witness had asked his colleagues to call an ambulance and returned to his office.

The witness had given his permission. Meanwhile, the ambulance had arrived at the police station and a medical doctor had examined the applicants. The applicants had been asked to go to hospital, but they had refused and signed a document to that effect. Officer Z.Le. had then entered the room and told the witness that the second applicant had claimed that a sum of money had been stolen from him at the police station.

The witness had then asked for an investigator from the prosecutor\u2019s office to come to the police station. Then he and other police officers had gone outside, where they had seen two women and the third applicant, who were swearing. When the police officers had put the second applicant, Adam Makhashev, in a car, one of the women had run up to the vehicle, got into the front seat and demanded to be told where Adam was being taken. The officers had pulled her out and explained to her that they were taking him to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Meanwhile, the third applicant had kept shouting and swearing at the officers. In view of the third applicant\u2019s behaviour, two or three officers had taken him into the police station.

The witness further stated that the applicants had not been beaten in his presence, that he had not seen masked men in camouflage uniforms armed with machine guns at the police station and that during his visit to the GOM-2 he had not seen officer A.Bo.",

Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be difficult in practice. The respondent State\u2019s obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute. The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of racially induced violence (see, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, Nachova and Others v.

As it follows from the documents submitted by the parties, from 25 November 2004 to 21 February 2005, that is, for almost three months, the investigators neither questioned eyewitnesses to the events nor made any attempt to conduct an identification parade or set up a witness confrontation between the applicants and the policemen. Only on 22\u00a0February 2005, after the applicants had complained to the Prosecutor General, did the investigators question the applicants\u2019 relatives Ms A.K. and Ms S.G., whose statements provided the investigators with information about other possible witnesses to the events (see paragraphs 83 and 84 above). Furthermore, between 15 November 2004 and 20 March 2005 the applicants provided the investigators with detailed statements concerning the circumstances surrounding the alleged ill-treatment, including information about the ambulance\u2019s arrival at the police station (see paragraph 85 above). However, the investigators failed to take steps to follow up on this information and to elucidate the discrepancies in the applicants\u2019 statements and those of the implicated policemen. For instance, the investigators failed to examine the crime scene at the police station and to question the applicants\u2019 other relatives who had witnessed the third applicant\u2019s arrest. No statements were obtained from the ambulance doctor, other participants in the fight at the concert hall or the employees of the town prosecutor\u2019s office who had dealt with the applicants on the night of the events in question. Nevertheless, after six months, in May 2005 the investigation was suspended, without the authorities having taken the above-mentioned steps. These shortcomings were criticised by the supervising prosecutor, who ordered the taking of remedial measures and the resumption of the investigation (see paragraph 88 above). Even so, just a few days later, without having taken the required steps, the investigators issued a decision not to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations of illtreatment by the police officers (see paragraph 89 above). From the contents of this document, only a part of which was furnished by the Government, it transpires that this decision was taken solely on the basis on the statements made by the policemen implicated in the incident. In addition, the documents submitted confirm that a decision refusing to initiate proceedings against the policemen on the very same grounds was taken again in April 2006 (see paragraph 90 above).",

The Court further notes that the Government\u2019s submission was based on the statements of the policemen directly accused of the alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 125 above). In such a situation, taking into account the circumstances under which the torture of the second and third applicants took place and its similarity to that of the first applicant, along with the lack of an effective investigation into the matter, the Court is satisfied that the first applicant has made a prima facie case that he was also beaten by the policemen at the GOM-2 police station (see, for a similar situation, Eldar Imanov and Azhdar Imanov v. Russia, no. 6887/02, \u00a7 110, 16 December 2010). The Government\u2019s contention that the first applicant\u2019s injuries predated his arrival at the police station is insufficient to discharge them from the abovementioned burden of proof.

It is noteworthy that the police officers, who, according to their witness statements, had observed the fight and a number of its other participants (see paragraphs 57-59 above), took only the Makhashev brothers to the police station. Furthermore, it is unclear why the applicants were chosen to be taken to the GOM-2, as it does not appear from the documents submitted that any official investigative steps were taken with their participation on 14 November 2004.",
