Criticism consists of a negative or positive assessment of someone\u2019s action or attitude; it is however restricted to the purpose of denouncing negative attitudes. To reach this objective it is not necessary to use statements that insult the person in question and for this reason exceed the boundaries of acceptable criticism. The concept of acceptable criticism applies to the offence of defamation and only in so far as it concerns a charge raised against such person. To cover by this principle a statement that was not a charge against this person, but an expression of contempt and disrespect, would be against the [law]. All criticism should be limited by fairness and the above-mentioned purpose of public interest. In the present case these boundaries were overstepped and it was not necessary, for the purpose of the protection of a public interest, to commit an insult.

In the context of a public debate the role of the press as a public watchdog allows journalists to have recourse to a certain degree of exaggeration, provocation or harshness. Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders (see Castells v. Spain, judgment of 23 April 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0236, \u00a7\u00a043). It is true that, whilst an individual taking part in a public debate on a matter of general concern is required not to overstep certain limits as regards \u2013 in particular \u2013 respect for the reputation and rights of others, he or she is allowed to have recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation, or in other words to make somewhat immoderate statements (see Kuli\u015b v.\u00a0Poland, no. 15601/02, \u00a7 47, 18 March 2008).",

For instance, the domestic courts acknowledged that his allegations that the politician, as mayor of the commune, was incompetent, had a sufficient factual basis. However, when establishing that the applicant had insulted the politician by stating that he was crawling up to another level of incompetence, the domestic courts failed to take into consideration that the impugned statement was a value judgment on a matter of public interest. The domestic court adopted a narrow definition of what could be considered acceptable criticism, excluding from it all statements expressing \u201ccontempt and disrespect\u201d (see paragraph 16 above). In doing so the court did not take into consideration the fact that the impugned statements had been made in the context of a heated political debate. Moreover, it failed to notice that the applicant was exercising his right to impart information and ideas on political questions and on other matters of public interest and in so doing might have recourse to a degree of exaggeration. The statements in question were limited to an assessment of the professional sphere of the life of Mr\u00a0A.W. and denounced his alleged lack of ability as a politician.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a047579/99, \u00a7 50, 20 April 2006) and that they resulted in conditional discontinuation of these proceedings. In view of the margin of appreciation left to Contracting States a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.\u00a0France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007-..., Radio France and Others v. France, no.\u00a053984/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2004II and Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a036207/03, \u00a7 68, 14 February 2008). Nevertheless, the Court notes that when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement entails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed. In this connection, the Court recalls that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence will be compatible with journalists\u2019 freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article\u00a010 only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been impaired, as for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Cump\u01cen\u01ce and Maz\u01cere v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a033348/96, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2004XI). For the Court, similar considerations should apply to insults expressed in connection with a public debate. The Court would further observe that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 1577 (2007) urged those member States which still provide for prison sentences for defamation, even if they are not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay (Resolution Towards decriminalisation of defamation adopted on 4\u00a0October 2007).",

This is, of course correct, although it is also correct that, in holding an interference with freedom of expression to have been disproportionate, the Court has frequently placed emphasis on the fact that recourse could have been had to means other than criminal sanctions (see, for example, Lehideux and Isorni v. France, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 57; Raichinov v. Bulgaria, no. 47579/99, \u00a7 50, 20 April 2006). The Chamber goes on in the same paragraph to hold that when a statement, whether qualified as defamatory or insulting by the domestic authorities, is made in the context of a public debate, the bringing of criminal proceedings against the maker of the statement \u201centails the risk that a prison sentence might be imposed\u201d and that the imposition of a prison sentence for a press offence would be compatible with journalists\u2019 freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 only in exceptional circumstances.",

Irrespective of the severity of the penalty which is liable to be imposed on the journalist, the use of the criminal law, with the attendant risk of a criminal conviction and a criminal penalty, for criticising a politician or other public figure in a manner which can be regarded as personally insulting, is likely to deter a journalist from contributing to public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community and, more generally, to hamper the press in carrying out its important role as a public watchdog. In cases such as the present, involving criticism of a politician in the course of a public debate, it would in my view only be in the most exceptional circumstances that recourse to criminal proceedings against a journalist for alleged insult would be considered as a proportionate response, whether those proceedings originated in a bill of indictment lodged by a public prosecutor or, as in the present case, by the politician himself. The facts of the present case disclose no such exceptional circumstances.",
