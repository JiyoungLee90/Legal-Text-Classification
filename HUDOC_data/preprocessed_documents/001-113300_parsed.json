However, acknowledging that their detention was, by its nature, an administrative penalty, he ruled that the complaint of 21 July 2006 against the penalty could be examined under Article 279 of the CAO. Judge Z.M. went on to criticise the applicants for abusing their right to freedom of expression. He found it established from the case materials that the applicants had truly exhibited \u201cmanifest and gross contempt\u201d towards the Tbilisi Court of Appeal by committing those acts \u201cinside the court building, namely in its central entrance hall\u201d. In any event, the aim of Article\u00a0208 \u00a7\u00a06(1) of the\u00a0CCP was, in the opinion of Judge Z.M., to protect public order not only inside court-houses but also outside them, in adjacent premises. The President of the Court of Appeal had no other choice but to sanction the applicants under Article\u00a0208\u00a0\u00a7\u00a06(1) of the CCP, since what was at stake in the given situation was \u201cnot the judge\u2019s own interests but the authority of the court and the proper administration of justice\u201d. In reply to the complaint that the President of the Court of Appeal had made her decision entirely on the basis of one-sided submissions, Judge Z.M. stated that all the evidence \u2013 the records of the applicants\u2019 arrest and the explanatory notes \u2013 had been drafted and submitted by the bailiffs for consideration by the President in accordance with a procedure envisaged by law. Judge Z.M. also stated that the thirty days\u2019 detention had been an appropriate punishment, given the gravity of the acts committed.",

The President had further twentyfour hours to issue a decision on whether to punish the offender.\u00a0Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the amended Article\u00a0208 further stated that proceedings concerning the imposition of detention on an offender should always be adversarial, and conducted at an oral hearing at which the offender would be given an opportunity to defend him or herself. Should the President decide to detain the offender, the latter was entitled to lodge an appeal against that decision with the higher court within the next forty-eight hours.",

Thus, since the essence of section 76(3) of the Courts Act was to enable bailiffs to protect the administration of justice, it was only natural for the applicants, who were insulting the Tbilisi Court of Appeal in its yard, to assume that bailiffs of that court could have exercised their relevant duties not only within the court-house but also on its protected territory outside.",

The Government then assured the Court that that arrest had not exceeded the maximum permissible limit of three hours, as provided for by Article 247 of the CAO (see paragraph 36 above). In support, the Government referred to the fact that three hours and twenty-five minutes had passed between the applicants\u2019 arrest and the placement of one of them in the remand centre of the Ministry of the Interior, the latter event necessarily occurring after the delivery of the decision of 29 June 2006 (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above); within that time more than twenty-five minutes would have been spent on transporting the applicants from the court-house to the place they were subsequently held in custody.",

On the other hand, if the Code of Administrative Offences were to be considered applicable to their situation, then a clear problem would arise under its Article 246, which excluded court bailiffs from the inclusive list of those State agents who were authorised by law to effect administrative arrests (see paragraph 35 above).",

Georgia\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a071503/01, \u00a7 170, ECHR 2004II), be \u201clawful\u201d. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a013229/03, \u00a7\u00a067, 29 January 2008). This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the\u00a0Articles of the Convention (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a046295/99, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2002IV, and Kafkaris v. Cyprus\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a021906/04, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2008). \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see, for instance, Nasrulloyev v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a0656/06, \u00a7\u00a071, 11 October 2007, and Mooren v. Germany\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 76, 9\u00a0July 2009). The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the\u00a0Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2000III).",

Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v. France, 18\u00a0December 1986, \u00a7 54, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0111). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1. The notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a067). While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute \u201carbitrariness\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, detention will be \u201carbitrary\u201d where, despite complying with the letter of national law, there has been an element of bad faith on the part of the authorities (see Giorgi Nikolaishvili v. Georgia, no. 37048/04, \u00a7 53, 13 January 2009; Bozano, cited above, \u00a7 59; and Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 69) or where the domestic authorities have neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, and Liu v.

What is at stake in the present case is the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 deprivation of liberty. The Court further observes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicants\u2019 arrest and being locked up in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal by the bailiffs, as well as their subsequent punishment by detention, as imposed by the President of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, represented a continuous situation of deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 of the\u00a0Convention. It can be assessed as falling into two periods \u2013 before and after the applicants were brought before the judge who sanctioned their detention in her decision of 29 June 2006.",

The Court notes that bailiffs were not amongst the exhaustive list of those State agents who were empowered to conduct administrative arrests under that Code (see paragraph 35 above).",

However, that domestic provision, which stated that bailiffs could conduct arrests \u201cfor the purpose of handing [offenders] to the police\u201d, did not provide for any statutory time-limit during which an arrested individual could be kept in custody pending his or her appearance before a judicial officer. Consequently, it remains largely unexplained on the basis of which domestic legal provision, the court bailiffs took the liberty of locking the applicants up in the duty room of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal for at least three hours. Indeed, the Court notes that it was only subsequent to the applicants\u2019 arrest on 29 June 2006 that the Georgian legislator finally fixed, on 29 December 2006, a maximum permissible period for the duration of an arrest of an individual suspected of having committed the relevant offences (see paragraph\u00a031 above).",

The wording of these provisions limited the territorial scope of both the court bailiffs\u2019 powers of arrest and the offences of breach of public order and contempt to the interior of court buildings. That being so, the Court has certain doubts that the applicants could have foreseen at the relevant time and to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances that their street picket in front of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal could entail their arrest and detention under the above-mentioned domestic provisions. It reiterates in this respect that national law must be of sufficient quality and, in particular, must be foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risks of arbitrariness (see M. v.

Her findings were based solely on the explanatory notes provided by the court bailiffs and, similarly to those notes, the findings lacked any detailed explanation and were strikingly succinct, and resulted in the endorsement in her decision of the obviously untrue statement that the applicants had committed the acts \u201cinside the court building, in its central entrance\u201d (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 17 above).

As regards the definition of the particular offence of contempt of court, the Court further attaches importance to a finding of the Constitutional Court of Georgia, which characterised it as vague (see paragraph 47 above). That being so, the Court, similarly to its finding under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, has very serious doubts that the applicants could reasonably have foreseen that their demonstration outside the building of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, in its yard, could ever have attracted liability under the above-mentioned wording of the domestic provisions (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Altu\u011f Taner Ak\u00e7am v.

However, having regard to a more conspicuous problem arising with respect to the necessity of the interference, the Court does not deem it appropriate to limit its finding under Article 11 of the Convention to the lawfulness of the interference only (compare with Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07, 6102/08, 30079/08, 7072/09 and 7124/09, \u00a7 116, 14 September 2010, and Hyde Park and Others v.\u00a0Moldova (nos. 5 and 6), nos. 6991/08 and 15084/08, \u00a7 48, 14\u00a0September 2010).",

What is at stake as regards the protection of the authority of the judiciary is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among other authorities, Fey v.

Concurring with the Constitutional Court of Georgia (see paragraph 47 above), the Court reiterates in this regard that the right of peaceful assembly is, like the right to freedom of expression, one of the foundations of any democratic society. Consequently, only truly convincing and most compelling reasons can justify an interference with this right (see Djavit An, cited above, \u00a7 56, and Ouranio Toxo and Others v.\u00a0Greece, no. 74989/01, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2005X (extracts)).",

Thus, the majority of those slogans represented critical value judgments, in which the applicants, resorting to a certain degree of political exaggeration and harsh words, referred to a matter of public concern in  \u2013 the independence of the judiciary; the applicants addressed the Tbilisi Court of Appeal without being violent or rejecting democratic principles in their speech. The Court reiterates in this respect that the judiciary, as with all other public institutions, cannot be immune from criticism, however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words may appear (see Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Ska\u0142ka v.

In any event, in a democratic society, greater tolerance should be shown to those expressing opinions which are critical of important public figures, even if those opinions are expressed, as in the instant case, inarticulately, intemperately or in a provocative manner (see Hyde Park and Others (nos. 5 and 6), cited above \u00a7 43, and Nilsen and Johnsen v.\u00a0Norway\u00a0[GC], no. 23118/93, \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53, ECHR 1999VIII).",

Notably, in the instant case as well, irrespective of the fact that the applicants\u2019 appeal had actually been examined by a judge of the Supreme Court under Article 249 of the CAO, the extraordinary review procedure contained in that domestic provision, which depended on the domestic authorities\u2019 discretionary power and lacked a clearly defined procedure or time-limits, represented an ineffective remedy for the purposes of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 (compare with Galstyan, cited above, \u00a7 126, and Gurepka, also cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-61).
