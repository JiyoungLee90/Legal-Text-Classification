He added that foreign female citizens present in the area often attempted to escape from the police because the latter\u2019s presence hindered them in their work. In the present case the applicant had attempted to avoid inspection by the police but had been stopped by the officers, who had asked her to show her papers without at any time making any humiliating remarks or using physical force.

With regard to the investigations carried out by the authorities following the allegations of ill-treatment, the Court observes that, according to the information provided, the applicant requested a number of evidence-gathering measures, namely, organisation of an identity parade of the officers responsible using a two-way mirror or obtaining from the police the identification numbers of the officers who had been on duty on\u00a015 and 23\u00a0July. When examining those requests, investigating judges nos.\u00a09 and 11, who had jurisdiction to examine the criminal complaints lodged by the applicant, merely requested incident reports from the police headquarters and based themselves exclusively on the report by the headquarters when issuing a discharge order. The Court observes in that connection that the report had been prepared by the Balearic Islands chief of police, who was the immediate superior of the officers in question.",

In that connection it notes that during the public hearing on 11\u00a0March\u00a02008 the defendants were not formally identified by the applicant. In the Court\u2019s view, that hearing cannot be regarded as sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, as it did not succeed in identifying the officers involved. The domestic courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests for an identity parade to be held behind a two-way mirror on account of the time that had elapsed since the altercations and the fact that it would be very difficult to recognise the officers because they had been wearing helmets at the time. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s request was not a superfluous one in identifying the police involved in the incidents and establishing who was responsible, as required by the Court\u2019s case-law (see, among other authorities, Krastanov v. , no. 50222/99, \u00a7 48, 30 September 2004; \u00c7amdereli v. , no. 28433/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 17 July 2008; and Vladimir Romanov v. , no. 41461/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a079 and 81, 24 July 2008)",
