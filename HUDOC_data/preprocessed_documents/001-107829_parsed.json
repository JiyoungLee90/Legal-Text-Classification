It explained that the Property Act had to be regarded as a law controlling the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, having the legitimate aim of ensuring reparation for the injustice committed against Jewish citizens. Even supposing that the applicant had a possession within the meaning of that Article, the relevant provisions of the Property Act had validly defined the scope of his property right (zul\u00e4ssige Inhaltsbestimmung des Eigentumsrechts). He therefore had only a restricted right (eingeschr\u00e4nkte Rechtsposition). The  concluded that restitution was not ruled out under section 4(2) of the Property Act, because the applicant had not acquired title to its pecuniary value (kein Eigentum an dem Verm\u00f6genswert) and had acquired his share after the entry into force of the Property Act. Nor had he been able to dispose of (verf\u00fcgen) his property, and for that reason was simply registered in the land register as a member of the community of joint owners of the inherited estate.",

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.

As regards the amount of the consideration or compensation to which the applicant would be entitled under the Property Act or the Compensation Act, the Court observes that he cannot assert any rights going beyond those provided for by those two Acts (see Maltzan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0112-113, and Leuschner v. Germany (dec.), no. 58623/00, 15 May 2007).
