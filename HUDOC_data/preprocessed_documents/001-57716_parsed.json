Furthermore, under Article 72 the parties to the proceedings may challenge (ablehnen) a judge if they can show that there are reasons for doubting his complete impartiality. Although Article 72 refers expressly to grounds \"other than disqualification\", it is the practice of the courts to apply Article 72 also in cases where a party raises an issue relating to a judge\u2019s disqualification. In fact, the disqualification of a first-instance judge cannot subsequently be pleaded in nullity proceedings unless he was challenged before or at the trial or immediately after the ground for disqualification became known to the party (Article 281 para. 1 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).

The Lingens judgment shows that very harsh words expressed in the context of political debate enjoy this protection. However, as is stated at the beginning of paragraph 2 of this Article (art. 10-2), the exercise of this freedom \"carries with it duties and responsibilities\". In this context one often has to keep in mind Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, concerning the right to respect for private life, as well as what is said in paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) on the protection of the reputation or rights of others. The two principles enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 (art. 8, art. 10) must both be respected in every democratic society worthy of that name. In our time and our part of the world, the application of rules intended to protect these principles is marked by the power of the media and the inability of the individual to protect his reputation. Legal rules have frequently proved not to be an effective tool in this respect, but this fact - as I consider it to be - should not influence our Court when it applies the Convention. The Austrian legislation described in paragraphs 25-33 of the judgment is an example of a set of rules enacted by a  in order to meet the obligations flowing from Article 8 (art. 8) of our Convention.",

He chose, however, to print in full a \"criminal information\" - a kind of private criminal summons - laid by himself and others, in which Mr Grabher-Meyer was said to be suspected of contravening three provisions of Austrian penal law. The criminal-law setting thus given to his criticism took it out of the sphere of mere political debate and carried it into the arena of personal attack, thereby impinging on private life. The contents of the document printed were also, in my opinion, characterised by exaggerations. Here I have especially in mind the strong words to the effect that the statement corresponded to the aims of the Nazis or extolled measures applied by them. These very same words found in the text published by the applicant also, it seems to me, fall outside the ambit of value-judgments. The programme and the acts of the Nazis constitute a set of facts and the statement is another fact. Whether or not that statement reflected that programme and those acts is a question of factual assessment and my own conclusion is that it did not.
