In this respect, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation resulting from the alleged lack of medical assistance during his detention in prison was, to a large extent, based on his personal experience. The Court considers that his testimony describing the conditions of his detention and his medical treatment, of which only the applicant himself had first-hand knowledge, would have constituted an indispensable part of the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case.

In this respect, the Court notes that, in similar cases against , it has already found that the Law on Complaints against Acts and Omissions Infringing Individual Rights and Freedoms provides for a judicial avenue for challenging any act or omission by a public authority infringing an individual\u2019s rights or freedoms.
