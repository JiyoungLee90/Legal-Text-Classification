Continued detention can be justified in a case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. In each such case, it is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in the relevant decisions of the national judicial authorities and of the arguments made by the applicant in his or her application for release that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not the pre-trial detention in question was justified under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Labita v.

Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7\u00a7 73 and 74, 30 January 2003), the national courts limited themselves to the general and abstract declaration that the extension of the detention was necessary to ensure the aims of the investigation. The national courts did not, contrary to the requirements of Article 151 of the CCP, as amended on 25 March 2005, address the question of whether a more lenient measure of pre-trial restraint could suffice (see Idalov, cited above, \u00a7 147).",
