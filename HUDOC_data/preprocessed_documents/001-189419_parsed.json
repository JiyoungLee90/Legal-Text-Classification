The District Court further referred to the previous findings of the Commercial Court to conclude that the claim should be left unexamined (see paragraph 33 above).

Firstly, the applicant company\u2019s claim before the District Court only concerned the loan and interest which were based on the promissory note of 8 November 2002 and the agreement of 28 October 2005, neither of which contained an arbitration clause. If the Arbitration Tribunal was not competent to examine the very same claim because of the lack of an arbitration clause, then the District Court would have had competence. Moreover, as the applicant company\u2019s claim no longer related to the entirety of its claims, as before the Commercial Court, but only to those related to the loan arrangements, the District Court could hardly rely on the same reasoning as the Commercial Court when leaving the applicant company\u2019s claim unexamined. It is difficult to see how the applicant company\u2019s claim concerning only the loan could be regarded as forming a part of a whole together with the contracts of 8 February 1999, 10 April 2000 and 2\u00a0April 2003, when the latter contracts were in no manner even invoked before the District Court. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the District Court left the applicant company\u2019s claim unexamined after having already accepted the case for examination (see paragraph 31 above). The Court also finds it difficult to accept that the Civil Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation went on, in their decisions, to interpret why the Arbitration Tribunal, which is a completely independent body, rejected the applicant company\u2019s claim.",
