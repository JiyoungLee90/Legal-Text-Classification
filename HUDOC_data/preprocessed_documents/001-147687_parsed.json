By a judgment of 11\u00a0November 2011, the Constitutional Court confirmed the first-instance judgment. It again rejected the Government\u2019s objection as to non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies. As regards the merits, it noted that the dispute between the parties had started in 1974 and that thirty-seven years later the applicant was still awaiting compensation for the taking of the land. While it was true that under Maltese law there was no right of action based on the Convention rights before 1987 and the court therefore had no jurisdiction to decide on facts which occurred before that date, the court nevertheless had to have regard to the stage reached in the proceedings up to that date. It noted that there was a delay of thirteen years before and sixteen years after 1987, during which time compensation proceedings had not been initiated. This undoubtedly amounted to an unreasonable delay under Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, there was no valid reason justifying the delay in paying compensation for the expropriation. This therefore also constituted a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as a result of which the applicant was entitled to compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The Constitutional Court confirmed the amount awarded by the first-instance court but refused to issue any instructions to the LAB in relation to the method of calculation of the compensation, as requested by the applicant, noting that it was for the Board to make such an award and that the applicant could take the appropriate steps if he was not satisfied with the sum eventually awarded.",

Those proceedings were still pending in February 2014, after more than forty hearings and adjournments, in part due to the applicant, the Board and the architects. Up to that time the technical members of the LAB had estimated the value of the land (utile dominium) in 1990 to be EUR\u00a0272,623.20. The applicant contested this estimate, which he considered was of no relevance in the context, since according to the law it was the 1992 value which had to be taken into consideration. According to the applicant, land values had increased further by 1992, and he would thus suffer a disadvantage if a land valuation from an earlier date were taken. Moreover, that value was not comparable to the price of other similar plots of land in the area sold at the time. On 26 November 2012, following acceptance of the applicant\u2019s request, the applicant filed before the LAB a set of questions addressed to the architects. In January 2014 the architects in question had still not replied and the case continues to be adjourned for that reason. In October 2014 the case was still pending.",

More importantly, Canadian Brothers Limited had been the sole owner of the full share of the utile dominium of the land in question, so its compensation was separate and not to be shared.

He further noted that compensation under domestic law, which he interprets as being the value of the land in 1992 plus 5% interest per year, would not take account of the losses sustained by the applicant before 1992, a period during which he had been unable to make use of the land. He also noted that the LAB was bound and limited by law, with the result that whatever compensation it determined would not be sufficient. Moreover, he noted that the LAB usually augmented the Government\u2019s offer not on the basis of equity, as claimed by the Government, but simply because the compensation offered by the Government was always low. The applicant referred to the Court\u2019s findings in Guillemin v. France ((Article 50), 2 September 1998, Reports 1998VI).

The applicant further submitted that he had cooperated with the LAB and had been present at each hearing. Moreover, he could not be blamed for delays caused by third parties. It was the LAB\u2019s responsibility to process the case swiftly and yet, pointing to the last year, the applicant noted that there had been several adjournments for the purpose of awaiting the LAB\u2019s architects\u2019 replies to questions, and that between 2010 and 2011 there had been at least two adjournments requested by the LAB itself and two requested by the Government.

Furthermore, the Government contended that this part of the complaint was premature as the determination of compensation was currently pending \u2013 although in its last stages \u2013 before the Land Arbitration Board.

Malta (no.\u00a02226/10, just satisfaction, 9 July 2013) where the Court \u2013 referring to its principal judgment \u2013 had considered it unnecessary to wait for the outcome of the compensation proceedings. In that case the compensation proceedings were still pending more than forty years after the taking, while in the present case the taking had occurred in 1974, and compensation proceedings were now in their final stages. The Government further submitted that the applicant had received EUR 25,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage for the two violations found and would still receive the value of the property at the time of the taking, as established by the LAB (which usually augmented the original offer on the basis of equity) plus interest at 5% per annum, which would adequately fulfil Convention requirements and would render the interference proportionate.",

In addition, the Government was of the view, in response to the applicant\u2019s complaint about the unreasonable time taken to pay compensation, that the time had to be taken as running from the date of the applicant\u2019s first objection, namely September 1992, and not from the time of the taking (1974).

The present case was complex in that the land had belonged to several different owners and a number of persons claimed different rights over the land. Thus, the Government had to constantly file applications with the court to request directions to enable the serving of the notice of the expropriation. Moreover, certain persons had passed away, requiring the Government to take further steps and requiring the heirs to regularise the acts. Quoting the early case-law of the Court, the Government highlighted that the conduct of the parties had to be examined by the Court. In the present case, the Government considered that the delay had been the fault of the applicant and the other owners, who had caused a series of adjournments because they had failed to abide by the orders of the Board to submit further information or evidence. The Government specifically referred to seven adjournments attributable to the owners between 15 June 2006 and 16 October 2012 and noted a delay on the part of the applicant in submitting questions to the LAB by the deadline. The LAB had accepted two of the requests (arising from the aforementioned adjournments - one allowing further evidence and one concerning an onsite visit after the death of one technical member of the Board) in order to guarantee that the value of the land was fair and objective. The Government alleged that the delay had also been attributable to the applicant\u2019s conduct while bringing proceedings, such as informing the board that no onsite visit had taken place when in fact it had, and failing to declare his share in the property.",

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount proportionate to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, whilst a total denial of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in exceptional circumstances (see The Holy Monasteries v.\u00a0Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7\u00a071, Series A no. 301-A). However, while it is true that in many cases of lawful expropriation only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably proportionate to the value of the property, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances. Legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may warrant reimbursement of less than the full market value (see Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v.

The Court notes that the proceedings ultimately concerned the valuation of a plot of land, and even though that process might have been rendered more intricate by the number of parties involved, that alone cannot justify a ten-year delay. Moreover, the fact that further delays were caused because of the death of some of the people concerned does not militate in favour of the Government, given that such circumstances were a natural consequence following the CoL\u2019s inaction for a period of thirty years. Lastly, even though the applicant may have been responsible for some of the delay in the proceedings before the LAB, the Court reiterates that the judicial authorities remain ultimately responsible for the conduct of proceedings before them and ought to weigh up the advantages of continued adjournments against the requirement of promptness (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq, cited above, \u00a7 43). Moreover, a considerable number of the adjournments were in fact attributable to Board members or its architects. A careful examination of the adjournments, and or corresponding minutes, before the LAB from the time the application was filed by the CoL on 12 January 2004 until the technical members presented their report, with the valuation of the property on 17 October 2012, indicates that the case seemed to be proceeding on auto-pilot, with little if any control by, or proper directions from the presiding magistrate over adjournments and time-limits.",

He further claimed EUR 160,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage for the mental suffering caused by the violations, and the frustration of seeing his commercial project (in respect of which he had already applied for permits) come to nothing, despite the area being a prime commercial location.

They pointed out that the current domestic law (following the 2004 amendments which were not the subject of the applicant\u2019s complaints before the domestic court) provided that the applicant could not receive in compensation more than he had asked for in his counter-claim. Moreover, that valuation had given no explanation of the criteria on which it was based. The Government noted that the proceedings before the LAB were coming to an end, and that in those proceedings the technical members of the Board valued the sub-utile dominium of the land (in 1990, the year in which \u2013 according to the architects \u2013 the President\u2019s declaration was served) at EUR 272,623. Thus, the Government considered that the Court should not exceed that amount. They further contended that, according to domestic law, the applicant had lost possession of the property fourteen working days following publication of the expropriation in the Government Gazette, and the compensation calculation therefore ought to be made on the basis of the value in 1974. This was also the basis of the Court\u2019s calculation in Schembri (cited above). Moreover, the Government noted that when they took the land it was simply an empty plot, and had been so for the seven years since the applicant had acquired title to it.
