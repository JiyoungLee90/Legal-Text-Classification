On 4 October 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1995 and lives in Prešov.
On 18 September 1996 the Prešov District Court (Okresný súd) pronounced the dissolution of the marriage of the applicant's parents. The applicant who suffers from serious health problems which necessitate constant care was entrusted to her mother. The father was ordered to contribute financially to the applicant's maintenance. The judgment became final and binding on 25 August 1997.
On 18 March 1998 the applicant, acting through her mother, lodged a petition with the District Court. She sought judicial enforcement of a claim against her father to an amount of money which was due by way of contribution to her maintenance.
On 14 April 1998 the District Court ordered the enforcement.
On 21 January 2002 the District Court discontinued the enforcement as regards a part of the claim as the defendant had paid it voluntarily.
On 22 April 2002, on the applicant's appeal, the  (Krajský súd) quashed the decision of 21 January 2002 finding that the District Court had erred in the ruling on the costs of the enforcement.
On 10 June 2003 the District Court again discontinued the enforcement as the defendant had paid his debt. The decision became final and binding on 3 July 2003.
On 9 August 1999 the applicant, acting through her mother, lodged a request with the District Court that the amount of contributions to her maintenance which her father had been ordered to pay in the above judgment of 18 September 1996 be increased.
On 2 February 2001 the District Court held a hearing at which the applicant's mother claimed an increase in the amount.
On 23 May 2002 the District Court increased the amount of the monthly contributions and decided that it should apply from 1 July 1999 onwards. The District Court authorised the defendant to pay the arrears for the period from 1 July 1999 to 31 May 2002 in monthly instalments in addition to the ordinary monthly payments. In so far as the applicant was claiming contributions of a higher amount, the District Court dismissed the remainder of her claim. Both parties appealed to the .
On 26 September 2002 the  upheld the part of the District Court's judgment of 23 May 2002 in which it had granted the applicant's action. At the same time, the  quashed the part of the District Court's judgment in which it had dismissed the remainder of the action, considering that such a dismissal was superfluous. The ruling became final, binding and enforceable on 23 October 2002.
On 13 November 2002 the applicant, through her mother, filed a petition for enforcement of the judgments of 23 May and 26 September 2002.
On 3 December 2002 the District Court ordered the enforcement. It is still pending.
On 28 August 2000 the applicant's mother, on behalf of the applicant, lodged a petition (podnet) under Article 130 § 3 of the Constitution, as then in force, with the  (Ústavný súd).
She complained of the undue delays in the above enforcement and judicial proceedings and also in two other sets of proceedings.
On 17 May 2001 the Constitutional Court found, inter alia, that the District Court had violated the applicant's right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delay in both cases. The subjectmatters of those proceedings were not of a particular legal or factual complexity. The applicant's conduct did not give rise to any delay and her situation called for special diligence. All the proceedings under review were too lengthy in their entirety. However, at that time, the  lacked jurisdiction to draw any legal consequences from its finding. In accordance with its established practice, when deciding on a fresh constitutional complaint (sťažnosť) under Article 127 of the Constitution, as amended from January 2002, the  refrains from examining again delays in court proceedings which occurred in the period which the  had already reviewed in a previous decision.
