It has declared on many occasions that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective, and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal aid purposes (see Andreyev v.\u00a0Estonia, no. 48132/07, \u00a7 71, 22 November 2011). Owing to the legal profession\u2019s independence, the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his representative; under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) the Contracting States are required to intervene only if a failure by counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention (see Daud v. Portugal, 21 April 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II).",

If they are notified of such a situation, the authorities must either replace or oblige the lawyer to fulfil his duties. Adopting the restrictive interpretation advanced by the Government would produce unreasonable outcomes incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 (c), potentially rendering free legal aid nugatory (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 37; Kemal Kahraman and Ali Kahraman v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 42104/02, \u00a7 35, 26 April 2007; and Iglin v. Ukraine, no.\u00a039908/05, \u00a7 67, 12 January 2012). It will depend on the circumstances of the case whether the relevant authorities should take action (see Daud, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42) and whether, taking the proceedings as a whole, the defence can be regarded as \u201cpractical and effective\u201d as required by Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) (see Rutkowski v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no.\u00a045995/99, ECHR\u00a02000-XI; Staroszczyk v.

In the applicant\u2019s words, shortly before the hearing F.K. assured him that he would be present. Furthermore, there is nothing in the case file to suggest that F.K. ever contacted the registry of the Court of Cassation to request the adjournment of the hearing, as he told the applicant after the hearing. As the Government explained in their observations, there are two ways admissibly to submit a request for the adjournment of a hearing before a court without the need for the lawyer himself or his client to appear: either a lawyer, usually a partner of the lawyer unable to attend the hearing, must attend the court on the day of the hearing to request an adjournment; or, prior to the hearing, the client must send the registry a written request to that effect, to be handed to the President of the court on the day of the hearing ... Accordingly, even supposing that F.K telephoned the registry to inform it of his inability to appear, his request could not have been taken into account because he would not have submitted it in the requisite standard manner. For its part, the registry would certainly have drawn his attention to the fact that a telephone call was not a legitimate way to submit such a request under domestic law.",

The Court of Cassation should thus have adjourned the proceedings in order to clarify the situation, rather than dismissing the appeal as having been abandoned.",
