The Government have not advanced any justification for this interference, and the Court considers that economic difficulties cannot justify such an omission. Furthermore, having regard to the compensation proceedings instituted by the applicant against the debtor, and even assuming that the compensation for the delay in payment awarded by the decision of 17 May 2004 could be considered in the circumstances of the instant case as having de facto some remedial effect, at least with respect to the delays in the recovery of judgment debt under the decision of 4\u00a0August 2000, the Court notes that it also remains unenforced, and the prospects of its execution are as remote as those of the original judgments.",
