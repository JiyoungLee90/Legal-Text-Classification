This being so, the applicant\u2019s allegations that he had to take over a month\u2019s sick leave (see paragraph 27 above) was not supported by any evidence. Nor was there anything to support the applicant\u2019s allegations (see paragraph 17 above) that the police had used a whole container of pepper spray on his face and that he had many scratches and bruises (compare and contrast with Tali v. Estonia, no.\u00a066393/10, \u00a7\u00a078, 13\u00a0February 2014). Indeed, after the event the applicant was examined by a doctor in a hospital apparently not for reasons directly related to the alleged use of excessive force by the police but for heart problems. He did not need hospitalisation and after the medical examination he was placed in police custody (see paragraph 12 above). The Court further notes that no other material has been adduced in the course of the proceedings before it which could call into question the findings of fact of the domestic authorities and add weight to the applicant\u2019s allegations.",
