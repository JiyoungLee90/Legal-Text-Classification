It further held that the De Cubber judgment did not imply that the performance of the functions of investigating judge and trial judge in the same case constituted a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) under all circumstances.  juvenile criminal procedure provided for an exception to the rule of general criminal procedure prohibiting the combination in a single person of the functions of investigating judge and trial judge (see paragraph 20 (a) below).

In particular, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be judged by an impartial tribunal should not be incompatible with the protective treatment of juvenile offenders. Under Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, childhood is entitled to special care and assistance. States, therefore, should afford them the \"necessary protection and assistance so that they can fully assume their responsibilities within the community\", and prepare them \"to live an individual life in society\" (preamble of the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, Resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989), by promoting \"the establishment of laws, procedures, authorities and institutions applicable to children alleged as, accused of, or recognised as having infringed the penal law\" (ibid., Article 40 para. 3).",

The difficulties arising from the penal treatment of young offenders have been faced, in many penal systems, by setting up juvenile courts under specific procedural rules to apply penal or protective measures aiming at the correction or re-education of the minor rather than the punishment of criminal acts for which he is not fully responsible. The educational and psychiatrical aspects of the treatment are therefore essential and the qualifications and functions of the juvenile judge should be seen in terms of these purposes. The organisation of the proceedings in a manner that a single judge deals with the case from the pre-trial investigation adopting the appropriate provisional measures until the execution of the sentence, supervising the adopted protective measures of the judgment, in order to \"[develop] a relationship of trust ... between the juvenile judge on the one hand and the minor and his ... parents or guardian on the other\" (paragraph 18 (b) of the judgment) seems to me both reasonable and commendable to attain these objectives.",

Such an interpretation would be, in my opinion, contrary to Article 60 (art. 60) of the Convention. Furthermore, I think that the protection of children is a matter about which national authorities are better prepared to plan in accordance with the demands of their society. The Convention is meant to be interpreted in the sense of giving the member States a margin of appreciation as to the organisation of their system of penal justice to protect both the interests of the child and those of society.",

Similarly in the present case, for the sake of coherence with the case-law of the Court, when judging whether the applicant\u2019s fear was justified, the Court should have noted, in addition, the specificity of the procedural rules applicable to juvenile offenders under the Dutch system of penal justice so extensively expounded in paragraphs 16 to 26 of this judgment.",
