His father died on 9 October 2002. Thereafter the applicant legitimately considered that the judgment debt would be paid to him as the sole heir, which was confirmed by the above-mentioned succession certificate. Thus, between the acknowledgment of the applicant\u2019s succession rights on 1 June 2005 and the quashing of the judgment on 30\u00a0November 2006, the judgment remained unenforced for nearly one year and six months. Given that the Court has already found that the State\u2019s failure to pay off a judgment debt for more than a year is incompatible with the Convention requirements (see, among others, Kozodoyev and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 2701/04 et al., \u00a7 11, 15 January 2009), the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the applicant was affected by nonenforcement prior to 1 June 2005.

The Court is therefore persuaded that the applicant may also legitimately claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the violation of the legal certainty requirement. Furthermore, the Court notes that the allegations of procedural unfairness in the supervisory-review proceedings are closely related to the legal-certainty complaint and are, as such, concerned the determination of the applicant\u2019s rights.
