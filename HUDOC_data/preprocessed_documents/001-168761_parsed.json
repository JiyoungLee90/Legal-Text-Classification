In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. The Court\u2019s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Dichand and Others v. Austria, no. 29271/95, \u00a7 38, 26 February 2002, with further references).",

Austria, no.\u00a039394/98, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2003XI). Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 313). In cases concerning the press, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press. Similarly, that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining, as must be done under paragraph 2 of Article 10, whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, for instance, Kuli\u015b and R\u00f3\u017cycki v.

The provocative comparisons did not concern Mr V.\u2019s private or family life, but clearly related to his institutional responsibility as the head of the prosecutor\u2019s office of the entire region. The published material, in a satirical and parodic manner, denounced alleged corruption during the election campaign, criticised practices whereby certain candidates received more support from the authorities, which was to the detriment of other candidates, and whereby law-enforcement agencies, including the regional prosecutor\u2019s office headed by Mr V., turned a blind eye to such practices.

Slovakia, no. 35640/97, \u00a7\u00a7 53-4, ECHR 2003IV). In the present case the Court notes, however, that the domestic courts made no attempt to examine the contents of the article in question with a view to establishing whether they were based on a sufficient factual basis as regards the underlying accusations against Mr V. (see, by contrast, ibid., \u00a7\u00a058). Moreover, at the material time Mr\u00a0V., in his quality as head of the prosecutor\u2019s office of the Primorskiy Region, was a public figure who appeared frequently on television programs and in newspapers, which was acknowledged by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 12, 17 and 18 above). The Court reiterates that public officials are subject to wider limits of criticism than private individuals, although the criteria applied to them cannot be the same as for politicians (see Janowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a025716/94, \u00a7 33, ECHR\u00a01999I, or,\u00a0more recently, Otegi Mondragon v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a02034/07, \u00a7\u00a050, ECHR 2011). The Court considers that as a public figure (see paragraphs 12, 17 and 18 above) Mr V. inevitably and knowingly exposed himself to public scrutiny and should therefore have displayed a greater degree of tolerance to criticism than an ordinary civil servant. The Court also rejects the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants used the regional prosecutor\u2019s photograph in their publication without his authorisation (see paragraph 30 above) as that argument was never raised by Mr V. before the domestic courts or examined by them.",

The Court cannot subscribe to that line of reasoning. In its view, the form of a particular statement, remark or expression cannot be dissociated from their context and apparent goal. In other words, an assessment of whether such a statement, remark or expression is \u201cinsulting\u201d will depend on an examination of the ideas they may seek to impart, and the context in which they were made.",

In the present case, the applicants were convicted in criminal proceedings and sentenced to a fine.

Irrespective of the severity of the penalty which is liable to be imposed, a recourse to the criminal prosecution of journalists for purported insults, with the attendant risk of a criminal conviction and a criminal penalty, for criticising a public figure in a manner which can be regarded as personally insulting, is likely to deter journalists from contributing to the public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community (see, for a similar conclusion, Bodro\u017ei\u0107 and Vujin v.\u00a0 Serbia, no.\u00a038435/05, \u00a7 39, 23 June 2009).",

It further notes that those sums were recovered from the applicants as a result of their criminal conviction for their article, which the Court has found to be in breach of Article 10 of the Convention. It is thus clear that there is a direct causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged (see, among other authorities, Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 77, ECHR\u00a01999III). As for the enforcement fee, it resulted from the applicant\u2019s inability to pay the fine in one amount (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above), this fact being uncontested by the Government. It must therefore be regarded as a direct result of the violation found (compare and contrast Kwiecie\u0144 v. Poland, no. 51744/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06466, 9 January 2007, and, more recently, Marinova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos. 33502/07, 30599/10, 8241/11 and 61863/11, \u00a7 119, 12\u00a0July\u00a02016). In such circumstances, the Court considers it appropriate to grant this claim in full and to award each of the applicants EUR 920 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
