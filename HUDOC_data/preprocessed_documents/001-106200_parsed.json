I emphasise she cannot be criticised for that, and the advice was given in good faith and it was accepted in good faith by [her]. However, in my judgment it is a relevant consideration in deciding whether a defendant\u2019s costs order should be made in this case. Her failure to answer questions, in my judgment, to some extent had the effect of bringing this prosecution on herself, allowing the police to believe that the case against her was stronger than it in fact has turned out to be. In particular, a cardinal plank of the prosecution case against her on the conspiracy count was a taped phone call between her and [A.R.] in which on the face of it she appeared to give advice to [A.R.] as to how to steal from the company. Her failure, in my judgment, of putting that phone call into its true context and true timescale clearly influenced the prosecution decision to bring charges against her, and it is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I have come to the conclusion that to that extent she brought this prosecution upon herself and in my judgment that is a proper reason for refusing a defendant\u2019s costs order. In no way is that decision meant to indicate that she is in any way guilty of this offence, she is not, she has rightly been acquitted by this jury.\u201d",

Those reasons could not be construed as relying on continuing suspicions as to the applicant\u2019s innocence. This interpretation was supported by three factors. First, the trial judge had expressly acknowledged the first applicant\u2019s acquittal. Second, counsel had recognised that the first applicant\u2019s conduct had \u201cended him up where he was\u201d. Third, the trial judge had previously directed to the jury to disregard any feelings of disgust they might have had and to reach a verdict based on a \u201cproper, logical, objective analysis\u201d of what had happened (see paragraph 12 above). Therefore, the trial judge had formed the view that, although the first applicant\u2019s conduct was reprehensible, it did not follow that he was guilty of the offences charged.

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty unless he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR\u00a02000-X, and A.L. v. Germany, no. 72758/01, \u00a7\u00a031, 28 April 2005). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 43). The provision applies even where the substantive criminal proceedings have ended, provided that there is a sufficient nexus between the criminal proceedings and the events in issue (see Sekanina v. , 25 August 1993, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 266-A). In such circumstances, the question is whether the trial judge relied on suspicions as to the applicant\u2019s innocence after the applicant had been acquitted (ibid., \u00a7 30; see also Moody v. the United Kingdom, no. 22613/93, Commission\u2019s report of 16\u00a0October 1996, unpublished, and D.F. v. the United Kingdom, no. 22401/93, Commission decision of 24 October 1995, unreported, which both concerned Practice Directions on the making of defendants\u2019 costs orders).",

The facts of the case (summarised at paragraphs 7\u201314 above) clearly show that the trial judge was entitled to find that the first applicant had brought the prosecution on himself. The first applicant had been found half-naked in a state of intoxication with bodily materials of B on him. It was not denied that he had had contact with B or that she had suffered injuries. Nor was it denied that his actions that night were reprehensible. The only issue was whether his actions amounted to rape or sexual assault. The Court finds nothing in the trial judge\u2019s remarks which would indicate a belief that the applicant\u2019s actions meant that he was guilty of rape or sexual assault; disapproval by a trial judge of a defendant\u2019s conduct does not necessarily mean that the trial judge has formed a view as to whether that conduct amounts to a criminal offence (see D.F., cited above).",

To state that judges (and semble other public officials) casting doubt as to the innocence of a person who has been acquitted when there appears to be no realistic possibility of such pronouncements influencing the fairness of other ongoing, or reasonably anticipated, proceedings, are violating Article 6 \u00a7 2 is to give an entirely distorted interpretation to this provision.",
