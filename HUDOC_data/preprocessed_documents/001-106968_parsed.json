The mother said that the applicant had, during the holiday of 1 to 14 July 2005, allowed the daughter to read an inappropriate book, which the applicant denied, saying that the daughter had taken the book as it had an interesting cover page but had not read it (see paragraph 28 above). The applicant was then asked by the judge if he would agree with the mother\u2019s proposal to have contact supervised by the Ljubljana Welfare Office. He agreed at first. However, his representative then stated that the applicant believed that it would be unpleasant for the children to have contact with him under supervision. The judge then appointed an expert in psychology to prepare a new report and stated that she would not issue any decisions imposing fines, due to new circumstances which required the preparation of a new expert report. She further stated that the imposition of monetary fines would be a less severe sanction than removal of the children by force, which had already failed, and would not be reasonable in view of the fact that the applicant was not paying the full amount of maintenance.",

It agrees with the Government that the case was of a certain complexity, which is also demonstrated by the fact that three expert reports and a welfare office report were prepared at the request of the court. However, while in the period after 14 March 2005 the domestic court was active throughout the proceedings, scheduling hearings on a regular basis, the same was not true for the earlier period. In particular, the Court notes that between the second hearing, which was held on 21\u00a0November 2003, and the fifth hearing, on 14 March 2005, no significant steps, apart from the appointment of an expert in psychology, were taken. As a result, the first interim decision setting out provisional contact arrangements was issued a year and a half after the request to that effect was made by the applicant (see, by contrast, Z. v. , no. 43155/05, \u00a7 152, 30 November 2010, and Trdan and \u0106. v. , no. 28708/06, \u00a7 94, 7\u00a0December 2010).

The Government adduced no reasons as to why the judge should or could not have proceeded in that way in the present case.

In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings. As regards the proceedings before the Court, it reiterates that it does not consider itself bound by domestic scales and practices, although it may derive some assistance from them (see, among many other authorities, Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, \u00a7 77, Series A no. 316-B, and Ba\u015fkaya and Ok\u00e7uo\u011flu v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, \u00a7 98, ECHR 1999-IV). In the present case, however, the applicant neither explained his claim by the reference to the statutory domestic scale (see Gaspari v. Slovenia, no.\u00a021055/03, \u00a7\u00a7 81-3, 21 July 2009) nor did he submit any supporting documents or detailed information which would show that the costs claimed have been actually and necessarily incurred. The Court therefore also rejects this claim.",
