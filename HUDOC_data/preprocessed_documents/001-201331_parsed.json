Since there had been cattle loose in the yard, the dog handler and the dog had walked around the house, but the dog had not picked up any fresh trail. According to the dog handler, if the dog had sensed the presence of the person who had left the footprints, it would have barked. However, it had not barked either in the yard or near P.K.\u2019s house, which indicated that the person who had left the footprints had not been there. Furthermore, when the dog handler and the dog had returned to the applicants\u2019 house, he had been informed that the suspect, P.K., had already been arrested; thus, he had not had any further reason to continue the tracking. In the court\u2019s view, the dog handler had carried out his duties properly and there were no grounds to find that any important evidence had been lost because of his actions.",

In the view of the Supreme Court, the dog handler \u2013 faced with an obstacle (the cattle) \u2013 had made a rational decision to take the dog to the back of P.K.\u2019s house and to continue tracking there. It further observed that even if the footprints followed by the police dog had been identified as belonging to P.K., that would have only proved that P.K. had walked by the applicants\u2019 house, but not that he had set their house on fire.
