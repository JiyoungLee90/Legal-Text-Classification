States are exempted from answering before an international body for their acts until they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system, and those who wish to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court as concerns complaints against a State are thus obliged to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system (see, among many other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see, among other authorities, Micallef v.

He initiated enforcement proceedings against the regional governor in early 2007 (see paragraphs\u00a01516 above). In the context of these proceedings, on three occasions the bailiff invited the governor to comply voluntarily with the judgment or else risk being fined (see paragraphs 16, 19 and 21 above). Although the governor failed to comply, the bailiff did not fine him nor does it appear that he otherwise pursued enforcement further. The applicant in turn failed to challenge in court the bailiff\u2019s inactivity.",

In particular, in a 2012 case (see paragraph 33 above) the court ordered a bailiff to continually impose fines under Article\u00a0290 of the 2006 Code until the municipal agricultural agency, a public authority which owed enforcement, complied with a final judgment. In this same context, the Court has already held that a mechanism of financial sanctions imposed on public officials, such as the one of weekly fines described immediately above, could in principle be an effective domestic remedy capable of compelling the responsible official to comply with the judgment (see Stoyanov and Tabakov v. Bulgaria, no. 34130/04, \u00a7\u00a096 first sentence, 26 November 2013). Taking into account the spirit and aim of the protection system under the Convention, namely to give first an opportunity to the national authorities to put a violation right before the Court is seized, the Court notes that the requirement to use such a remedy could not be considered to place an excessive burden on an applicant and that, as of mid-2012, it can be said that this remedy appears available and in principle effective and applicants are therefore expected to use it before applying to the Court.",

Noting that the legislative remedy was created only after the decision in the present case became final, and the case law demonstrating its effectiveness appeared many years later, the Court finds that the Government have not shown that the domestic practice was sufficiently consolidated, or that domestic case-law showing that this remedy had been successfully used even existed at the time when the applicant applied to the Court (see for a similar approach Norbert Sikorski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 115 and 117).

According to the relevant procedure the regional governor had to act in order to ensure that compensation bonds were issued to the applicant in implementation of the judgment.

For example, illegal and arbitrary dispossessions of property in principle justify restitutio in integrum and, in the event of non-restitution, payment of the up-to-date full value of the property (see Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece (Article 50), judgment of 31 October 1995, Series A no. 330-B, and Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, ECHR 2001-I). The Court observes in the present case that, had the governor enforced the judgment, the applicant would have been in possession of housing compensation bonds with nominal value of about EUR 6,000 at the time of their emission. However, having regard to the information available to it about the market value of the housing compensation bonds issued to owners (or their heirs) of nationalised property and, in particular, to the fact that between August 2006 and the end of 2015 that market value ranged between\u00a037% and 73% of the nominal value of the bonds, the Court finds it appropriate to make a global assessment in respect of the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damage. Thus, taking into account the amount and type of compensation awarded by the national court to the applicant in the final judgment of 19 July 2005, as well as the valuation of the interest accrued on that amount as estimated in the expert report submitted by the applicant, the Court awards the applicant EUR 5,763 in respect of pecuniary damage.",
