Moreover, he complained that the Court of Magistrates which had been requested to examine speedily the lawfulness of his arrest did not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention in so far as, according to section 409A of the CC (see paragraph 35 below), only the prosecution had a right of appeal, not the accused.

As noted in the judgment, the Civil Court held that the arrest warrant of 5 February 2004 should be rescinded on the grounds that the court issuing it had no competence to do so and had acted ultra vires and that the applicant\u2019s arrest was therefore devoid of any legal basis and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 1.

The majority have rejected the Government\u2019s objection of lack of victim status on the grounds that in its judgment the Constitutional Court neither expressly nor in substance acknowledged a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 during the ten-day period between 12 and 22 November 2004 and, consequently, did not redress such violation. It is argued that, in its judgment confirming the decision of the , the  \u201cmade no reference...to a violation in respect of the ten-day period\u201d. It is said that, on the contrary, the  insisted that the  \u201cshould not have ordered the applicant\u2019s release in view of the fact that he was detained in ; consequently, it follows that he could not have upheld the finding of such a violation\u201d.

It is true that the Constitutional Court did not uphold the Civil Court\u2019s order to release the applicant for reasons which would seem to be clear from its judgment, namely that the applicant was detained in Spain and that it was not within the jurisdiction of a Maltese court to direct the courts or authorities of another sovereign State to release a detainee within its own territory. This was indeed underlined by the fact that, when the Spanish court was informed of the order of the Civil Court, it decided on 16\u00a0November 2004 that the applicant\u2019s release was a matter to be determined on the basis of Spanish law, without reference to Maltese law, and declined to release him (judgment \u00a7 18). It does not, in my view, follow from this that the Constitutional Court did not acknowledge that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 5 \u00a7 1 had been violated; on the contrary, the court expressly found that the arrest warrant was null and void and that the applicant\u2019s arrest was unlawful and in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",

I cannot share this view. It is apparent from the reasoning of the  why it considered that an increase in the sum awarded was not justified. Not only had the release of the applicant been a matter outside the control of the Maltese courts, but the breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 was a procedural rather than a substantive one; as the Constitutional Court emphasised, the arrest warrant had been issued by the wrong court but had been validly grounded in Maltese law. It was for the very reason that the unlawfulness was due solely to a procedural defect that the Constitutional Court found the compensation granted by the first court to be adequate, confirmed the sum awarded and went on to note that a new warrant under section 355 V of the Criminal Code could be issued and would be perfectly lawful (see judgment \u00a7 22). In the light of this explanation, I see no reason why the compensation awarded by the Civil Court, which was itself not fixed by reference to the number of days which the applicant had spent in detention, should have been increased to reflect the further ten days of detention, six of which were in any event attributable to the Spanish authorities.",
