However, for the purposes of the examination of the present case, it is not necessary to determine whether the respondent State may be held responsible for the procedural failings which might have occurred after that date; indeed, a violation of the procedural limb of Article 2 of the Convention can be found in relation to the period preceding the outbreak of hostilities, for the reasons set out below (see, for the same approach, Burgas v.\u00a0Ukraine [Committee], no. 8976/07, \u00a7\u00a039, 18 December 2018).",

Moreover, given that the domestic rules on criminal procedure afforded the possibility of a joint examination of criminal responsibility and civil liability arising from the same culpable actions, the applicant acted reasonably in pursuing the case within the framework of the criminal proceedings. The Court will therefore examine whether the criminal investigations in issue satisfied the criteria of effectiveness required by Article 2 of the Convention (see Antonov v. Ukraine, no. 28096/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04749, 3 November 2011; Zubkova v.

However, the Court has already held that pre-investigation inquiries do not comply with the principles of an effective remedy, because the inquiry officer can only take a limited number of steps and the victims have no formal status, meaning that they are excluded from effective participation in the procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, Strogan v. Ukraine, no. 30198/11, \u00a7\u00a053, 6 October 2016, with further references). It is notable that throughout that long period of time the authorities supervising the quality of the pre-investigation inquiries repeatedly criticised the investigators and ordered further inquiries (see paragraph 8 above). The repetition of such remittal orders discloses a serious deficiency in the criminal proceedings (see Zubkova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a040).",

Consequently, those decisions were quashed by the supervising prosecutors who considered that the investigations had been incomplete and deficient (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above). In that regard, the domestic authorities initiated disciplinary proceedings against the investigators in charge for their failure to ensure proper investigation of the accident (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). However, by April 2014, the length of the domestic inquiries and investigations had exceeded eight years, which does not appear to be justified in view of the above considerations.",
