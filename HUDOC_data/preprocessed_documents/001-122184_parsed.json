Nevertheless, it considered that the referral made by the Court of Appeal in its inferior jurisdiction was, in itself, valid. Its decision had not included the issues arising under Articles 6 and 17, which therefore could not be entered into because the courts with constitutional jurisdiction were limited to dealing with matters referred to them by the Court of Appeal. The Constitutional Court reversed the firstinstance judgment in part. It upheld the part of the judgment dismissing the CoL\u2019s complaints and quashed the rest, therefore finding no violation of the applicants\u2019 property rights. It considered that before the 2004 Act the LAB could have awarded compensation higher than that requested by the parties, thus rather than clarifying the law, the Act limited the compensation that could be awarded. Nevertheless, the applicants did not have a possession under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, in that they had had no legitimate expectation to receive an amount higher than MTL 380,000 (as established by their ex parte expert), which they had claimed. Firstly, when the 2004 Act came into effect, the report of the new architects had not yet been included in the case file. Secondly, before the 2004 Act the applicants had not claimed compensation higher than that awarded, and thirdly, when architects R.L. and J.J. were appointed, the applicants had been aware of the new legislation. Moreover, the applicants had received fair compensation since they had been awarded the entire sum they had asked for. Indeed, it was clear that the valuation made by the court-appointed experts was in stark contrast with the valuations made by the previous architects and the ex parte experts; it was therefore arbitrary and disproportionate, as no reasons had been given to justify the huge difference. Thus, the 2004 Act had not violated the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. As to the fact that twenty years had passed without compensation having been paid, the court considered that part of the monies had already been deposited and could have been withdrawn by the applicants without prejudice to further proceedings. Moreover, the applicants had eventually been awarded triple the sum which had been offered to them at the time of the expropriation and were still to receive 5% interest on the amount, thus they were not made to bear an excessive individual burden. The court ordered that the case be remitted to the Court of Appeal in its superior jurisdiction for the continuation of the proceedings.",

Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 52). The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. They must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Air Canada v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30, Series A no. 316-A).",

The Court reiterates that because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Furthermore, the notion of \u201cpublic interest\u201d is necessarily extensive. In\u00a0particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos.\u00a046720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, ECHR 2005-VI, \u00a7\u00a091; Immobiliare Saffi v.

The Court also reiterates that in the area of land development and town planning, the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their town and country planning policies. Nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, the Court must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the individual\u2019s right of property (see Abdilla v. Malta (dec.), no 38244/03, 3\u00a0November 2005, and Vassallo v. , no. 57862/09, \u00a7 37, 11\u00a0October\u00a02011).",

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 only in exceptional circumstances (see The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 71, Series A no. 301-A ). However, while it is true that in many cases of lawful expropriation only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances. Legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v.

The same applies to abnormally lengthy delays in administrative or judicial proceedings in which such compensation is determined, especially when people whose property has been expropriated are obliged to resort to such proceedings in order to obtain the compensation to which they are entitled (see Aka v.

Such a statement cannot be ignored by the Court, which may revise its position upon being presented with relevant evidence as to the practice of the Maltese courts in this matter.

More importantly, the Court considers that the owners cannot be blamed (as submitted by the Government) for having defended their case before the domestic jurisdictions.

Indeed, as it appears, the fact that proceedings did not end in 1996 (after two years) had not been due to any fault of the applicants. It was the Government, who at that point, requested a retrial to correct what they refer to as a manifest error made by the LAB. The LAB took six years to decide on the retrial request, and then about three years to decide on the merits of the case again at first instance. No reasons have been advanced for the repeated adjournments. It then took the Court of Appeal just under a year to make an incomplete constitutional referral, and nearly another year following the constitutional proceedings to dismiss the case on procedural grounds. Again, no explanation has been submitted for those periods of inaction. On the other hand, the Court considers that three years for two degrees of jurisdiction before the constitutional jurisdictions cannot be considered excessive. However, having regard to the entire duration of the proceedings, which lasted over two decades and which appears to have been mainly the result of a weakness in the legal system, the Court considers that the overall length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",

It would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed an individual to bring a civil action before a court without ensuring that the case was determined by a final decision in the judicial proceedings. It would be inconceivable for Article 6 \u00a7 1 to describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without guaranteeing to the parties that their civil disputes will be finally determined (see Multiplex v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a058112/00, \u00a7\u00a045, 10\u00a0July 2003, and Kuti\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a048778/99, \u00a7\u00a025, ECHR 2002-II).

Indeed, given the protracted compensation proceedings lasting for over two decades, the Court considers that it is unfortunate that the domestic courts had not found it possible to take a different view of the matter. However, although the course of action taken by the domestic courts may have been unfortunate, the Court notes that, in principle, the applicants would still be able to pursue their claim for compensation, as demonstrated by the Government\u2019s recent request to recommence those proceedings.

Thus, the sum to be awarded to the applicants should be calculated on the basis of the value of the property at the time of the taking, and be converted to the current value to offset the effects of inflation, plus simple statutory interest applied to the capital progressively adjusted. Since in the present case the applicants have not received any payment at the national level, no deduction is necessary.

However, the Court is unable to accept the amount chosen by the Government as representing the value of the property at the time of the taking which is the starting point of that calculation. Similarly the Court cannot accept the valuation submitted by the applicants as representing the value of the property at the time of the taking. Indeed the Court notes the discrepancy between the two ex parte valuations presented by the applicants during the domestic proceedings, the second valuation being more than four times the amount originally estimated. The Court notes that the LAB, in its decision of 27 March 2006, considered that the fair value of the property in 1990, when it was taken, was EUR 885,160, (see paragraph 24 above) as submitted by the applicants\u2019 ex parte architects. The Government have not substantiated why they found that valuation to be too high. The Court therefore considers that a sum close to that accepted by the LAB must be used as a starting point for its valuation. Furthermore, the Court has regard to the legitimate purpose of the restriction imposed, mainly social housing, recalling that legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less reimbursement than that of the full market value (see, inter alia, Ghigo v.  (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, \u00a7 18, 17 July 2008).
