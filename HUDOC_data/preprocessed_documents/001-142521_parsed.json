Furthermore, an extension order requires a more solid basis to show not only that there was genuinely \u201ca reasonable suspicion\u201d, but also that there were other serious public-interest considerations which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighed the right to liberty (see Perica Oreb, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114 and 116; Panchenko v.
