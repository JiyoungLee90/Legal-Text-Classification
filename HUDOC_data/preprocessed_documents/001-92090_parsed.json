One of these programmes, called activity guarantee (aktivitetsgaranti), was a programme for persons who were, or who were at a risk of becoming, unemployed for a long period as well as for groups of persons who often had difficulties in finding a job. The purpose of the programme was to give the participants greater opportunities to find a job and it involved different activities such as short term education and the possibility to try different kinds of work. Each person who participated in the programme had a personal supervisor from the Employment Service and together they were supposed to set up a plan for the activities in which the participant was taking part. The participant was obliged to attend meetings and to meet his or her supervisor on a regular basis, and he or she also had an obligation to apply for suitable jobs which were advertised through the Employment Service.",

Section 3 \u00a7 1, of the 1986 Act states that the provisions in the Act are subsidiary if they differ from the provisions in any other act or ordinance. According to Section 22, a decision may be appealed against by any person whom the decision concerns, provided the decision affects him or her adversely and an appeal against the decision is permitted. Section 22(a) states that appeals are to be made to the administrative courts. The preparatory works (Government Bill 1997/98:101 pp 59 and 112) state that one of the purposes of Section 22(a) is to assign a competent court when a prohibition to appeal against a decision has to be set aside because it would be in violation of the Convention.",

By using the word \u201cmay\u201d, the Government underlined that the sphere of labour market policy programmes should be governed by current labour market policy concerns which gave the authorities unfettered discretion to decide whether and to which individuals such programmes should be assigned.",

According to the Government, that criterion was laid down so that the authorities could refrain from assigning a person to a programme or cancel a person\u2019s assignment to the programme with reference to overall labour market policy. That policy criterion also demonstrated the unfettered discretion available for the authorities when deciding whether to assign a person to a programme. As a consequence, no attention whatsoever should be paid to a person\u2019s need or suitability for assignment to a programme if the individual\u2019s participation in the programme was not appropriate from an overall labour market policy perspective.
