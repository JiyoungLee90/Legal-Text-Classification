In August 2003 Olya had moved N. to the house which she had bought from Ru. In September 2003 Volodya and Olya had placed N. in a hospital in the town of Svetlovodsk. From there, N. had called his relatives in Kyiv and had learned that his apartment in Kyiv had been sold. He had then returned to Kyiv and had complained to the police.

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2000IV). The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s allegations of physical and psychological ill-treatment by Ch., B., T., and S. are not supported by any evidence or any detailed account of facts. Moreover, before the first-instance court, the applicant himself stated that the police had not beaten him (see paragraph 31 above). It is notable that no injuries were found on the applicant during his medical examination on 13 February 2004 (see paragraph 12 above). The Court therefore considers that the applicant has not made out his complaint concerning ill-treatment by the police. It follows that his complaint about lack of effective investigation into that ill-treatment is also unsubstantiated. As regards the part of the complaint which concerns the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in the ITT, it was lodged more than six months after the date on which the applicant\u2019s detention in that facility had ended (27 July 2004).

It therefore concludes that the applicant raised the complaint concerning the questioning of witnesses within the six-months time-limit. In his application form lodged on 29 August 2006, he further developed this complaint by specifying the names of the witnesses in question. The Court further notes that Te. and Ro. were questioned by the Kyiv Court of Appeal in the applicant\u2019s presence, and he was able to put questions to those individuals. With regard to the questioning of Pl. and Ru., and the recall of Te. as a witness, the Court reitirates that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention does not give the accused an unlimited right to have witnesses called and domestic courts have some discretion in deciding whether the hearing of a defence witness is likely to help to establish the truth. In particular, as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce. More specifically, Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 235B). It is not sufficient for an accused to complain that he was not permitted to examine certain witnesses; he must also support his request to call witnesses by explaining the importance of doing so and it must be necessary for the court to take evidence from the witnesses concerned in order to be able to establish the true facts (see Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898/99, \u00a7 29, ECHR 2003V, with further reference). The Court takes note that the applicant\u2019s requests to call Pl. and recall Te. were granted by the courts; however, the case file does not contain any material which would enable the Court to establish how the questioning of Pl. and Ru. and repeated questioning of Te. was important to the case. The Court notes that Pl. and Ru. were not eyewitnesses of the events which had taken place in the applicant\u2019s house in Kyiv. In particular, Ru. was a former owner of the house in which N. lived for some time after he had left the applicant\u2019s house, while Pl. was a doctor who treated N. in the Svetlovodsk hospital (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). In such circumstances, the Court discerns no arbitrariness in the trial court\u2019s decision to proceed with the case without hearing Ru. and Pl. and repeatedly questioning Te.",
