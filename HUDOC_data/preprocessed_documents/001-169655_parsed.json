During the examination the applicant stated that he had been tortured in police custody, and gave a detailed description of his ill-treatment. In particular, he stated that on 6 and 7 March 2010 police officers X., S. and M. had tortured him with truncheons, a device which gave electric shocks and cigarette burns. As a result of the examination, the experts noticed numerous scars (\u00e7ap\u0131q) and areas of pigmentation (piqmentasiya sah\u0259l\u0259ri) on various parts of the applicant\u2019s body. They pointed out that, while the scars had been caused by a hard blunt object, the areas of pigmentation had resulted from intense heat.

The domestic courts considered this treatment torture and violent treatment (see paragraph 26 above). Having regard to the nature of the ill-treatment, which also included the administration of electric shocks, the Court considers that it could only have been intentionally inflicted, because a certain amount of preparation and exertion would have been required to carry it out.

His detention was subsequently extended for the first time by the Sumgayit City Court\u2019s decision of 7 May 2010 for a period of one month. That decision was upheld by the Sumgayit Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 14 May 2010. On 3\u00a0June 2010, for a second time, the Sumgayit City Court extended the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of one month. That decision was upheld by the Sumgayit Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 11 June 2010. The further extension of the applicant\u2019s detention period until 22 July 2010 was decided by the Sumgayit City Court on 6 July 2010. However, the applicant did not appeal against that decision. On 16 August 2010 the Sumgayit City Court dismissed the prosecutor\u2019s application for an extension of the applicant\u2019s detention period, but ordered his detention for a period of seven days, taking into account the prosecutor\u2019s intention to object to that decision. On 23\u00a0August 2010 the Sumgayit Court of Appeal dismissed the prosecutor\u2019s objection, and the applicant was released from detention. The Court will therefore limit its examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the two periods of detention extended by the decisions of the Sumgayit District Court on 7 May and 3 June 2010, decisions which were subsequently upheld by the Sumgayit Court of Appeal on 14 May and 11 June 2010 respectively following the applicant\u2019s appeals (see Isayeva, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-89).",

The period to be taken into consideration therefore starts on 6 March 2010 when he was arrested for possession of narcotic substances, a criminal offence (see Crowther v. the United Kingdom, no. 53741/00, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 26, 1 February 2005, and Dimov\u00a0v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 56762/00, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 132, 8\u00a0March 2007). As regards the end of the proceedings, the Court notes that, while in February 2014 the applicant submitted that he had never been informed of any decision concerning the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him, on 11\u00a0April 2014 \u2013 the date on which the last observation in this case was filed by the Government \u2013 the latter did not make any observations on the applicant\u2019s submissions. There is no material before the Court to suggest that the proceedings against the applicant were ever actually completed. Thus, the Court can say with certainty that the proceedings in question lasted four years and one month at the very least after their institution at the investigation stage (see Grigoryan v. Armenia, no.\u00a03627/06, \u00a7 128, 10\u00a0July\u00a02012).",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that an accused in criminal proceedings should be entitled to have his case conducted with special diligence, and that, in criminal matters, Article 6 is designed to avoid a\u00a0person who has been charged remaining too long in a state of uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings (see Nakhmanovich v.
