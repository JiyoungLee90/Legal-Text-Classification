Ukraine, no. 67534/01, \u00a7 41, 27 July 2004). The Court also finds it unnecessary to embark on a discussion of the exact amount of the Company\u2019s debt to the applicant, the outcome of which would be of no relevance in the present case as the principal question to be determined is whether the State is responsible for the delay in the enforcement of the LDC decisions (see, mutatis mutandis, Sokur v. Ukraine, cited above \u00a7\u00a032). It suffices for the Court to find that, in any event, the oldest of the unenforced decisions was taken in February 2000.",

The Court recalls that it has already found in the Sokur v.  case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35) that this procedure, applied in similar circumstances, can lead to the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, in the present case, the situation was aggravated by a striking discordance between the domestic authorities as to the correct interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act. The Court notes that there were two unsuccessful attempts by the Bailiffs to enforce the applicant\u2019s judgment debts. The Bailiffs\u2019 actions were based on the interpretation of Article 12 of the Bankruptcy Act given by the Supreme Court of Arbitration and the Minister for Justice, which interpretation sanctioned the parallel development of bankruptcy proceedings and enforcement in cases of salary arrears. This interpretation was first endorsed by the Kherson Regional Court of Arbitration which, however, a year later, reversed its opinion on the issue and prohibited the attachment and forced sale of the Company\u2019s property.",

Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, 18 February 1999, \u00a7 54). However, it observes that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their authorities can meet its requirements (see, mutatis mutandis, Podbielski v. Poland, judgment of 30 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, p. 3395 \u00a7 38). In the present case the domestic courts did not choose the solution which would have permitted the State to honour its obligations under the Convention. Instead, the bankruptcy injunction created a situation in which the apparently active Company, where the applicant is still a full-time employee, was capable of meeting his salary arrears (see paragraphs 16 and 20 above), but the Bailiffs were prevented from pursuing the legal enforcement of the court decisions in the applicant\u2019s favour against the Company.",

The Court recalls that domestic law does not offer a creditor like the applicant, or the Bailiff, any possibility to challenge this restriction in case of abuse or an unjustified application. Nor can a compensation claim be made for the delay in enforcement caused by this restriction (see Sokur v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035).",
