Serbia, cited above, \u00a7 56; see also, mutatis mutandis, Tudor Tudor v. Romania, no. 21911/03, \u00a7 29, 24 March 2009). All this created a state of continued uncertainty, which in turn must have reduced the public's confidence in the judiciary, such confidence, clearly, being one of the essential components of a State-based on the rule of law. Further, notwithstanding the Governments submission to the contrary, it would appear that even the Supreme Court's case-law on the matter had not effectively become consistent until, at best, the latter part of 2008 (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above), which was well after some of the applicants could have attempted to lodge their respective appeals on points of law (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above), whilst formally this consistency had apparently never been secured in accordance with Article 40 of the Court Organisation Act (see paragraphs 17 and 29 above). Or, in other words, it could not reasonably be argued that, irrespective of the fact that the applicants' claims had never been considered by the Supreme Court at third instance, their suits had nevertheless substantively been determined in a manner consistent with that court's settled case-law (see, mutatis mutandis, Iordan Iordanov and Others v. , no. 23530/02, \u00a7 47, 2\u00a0July 2009).",
