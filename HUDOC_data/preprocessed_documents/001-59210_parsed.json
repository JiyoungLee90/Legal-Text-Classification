Moreover, as from mid-1990 the suspects had agreed to import cocaine from Majorca to Germany and to sell it there. Several accomplices had been recruited as members of the criminal organisation and had been involved in the numerous criminal offences. As regards the fraudulent trading in options, almost one thousand victims had been defrauded by the criminal association between the beginning of 1989 and March 1993, and they had lost a total of sixty million German marks. Moreover, between October 1990 and August 1992 approximately 100 kg of cocaine had been imported to and sold in Germany. The District Court found that, having regard to the statements made by some witnesses and the defendants, the results of the telephone-tapping operations and other results of the investigations, there was a strong suspicion that the applicant, Ms S. and Ms\u00a0L. had committed the criminal offences in question.",

Moreover, the suspects obviously had sufficient financial means to abscond. According to the District Court, there was also a danger of collusion within the meaning of Article 112 \u00a7 2.3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since, as members of a criminal association, the suspects were accustomed to disguising the extent of their activities by having recourse to \u201cmen of straw\u201d and fictitious contracts, and were therefore likely to suppress evidence or influence witnesses.",

Moreover, in the course of ensuing review proceedings, the accused must be heard and, to the extent that the investigation will not be prejudiced, the relevant results of the investigation at that stage must be given to him. In some cases, such oral information may not be sufficient. If the facts and the evidence forming the basis of a decision in detention matters cannot or can no longer be communicated orally, other means of informing the accused, such as a right to consult the files (Akteneinsicht), are to be used. On the other hand, statutory limitations on an accused's access to the files until the preliminary investigation is completed are to be accepted if the efficient conduct of criminal investigations so requires. However, even while those investigations are in progress, an accused who is detained on remand has a right of access to the files through his lawyer if and to the extent that the information which they contain might affect his position in the review proceedings and oral information is not sufficient. If in such cases the prosecution refuses access to the relevant parts of the files pursuant to Article 147 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the reviewing court cannot base its decision on those facts and evidence and, if necessary, has to set the arrest warrant aside (Federal Constitutional Court, op. cit.).",

Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 13, \u00a7 36). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to an adversarial procedure. While national law may satisfy this requirement in various ways, whatever method is chosen should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment thereon (see, mutatis mutandis, Brandstetter v.

This would not appear to have been too difficult to achieve in the present case.

When, in September 1993, the public prosecutor's office requested the prolongation of the applicant's detention on remand, it based the suspicion against him on the contents of the investigation files, which then also included the opinion of a stockbroking expert and business documents which had been seized in the meantime. Those elements thus appear to have been essential to the issue of the applicant's continued detention. In his reply to the prosecutor's request for the applicant's detention to be continued, counsel for the applicant drew the Court of Appeal's attention to the limitations on the defence resulting from the refusal of access to the files (see paragraph 17 above).",

This requires that the accused be given a sufficient opportunity to take cognisance of statements and other pieces of evidence underlying them, such as the results of the police and other investigations, irrespective of whether the accused is able to provide any indication as to the relevance for his defence of the pieces of evidence to which he seeks to be given access.",

In view of this, it is an over-formalistic and disproportionate response to require yet another request for access to the numerous new volumes of the case file which had been compiled since access to the file had been granted in November 1993 (see paragraph 20 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the public prosecutor's office does not appear to have waited for another request by the defence before sending to it the complete investigation files on 9 June 1994 (see paragraph 27 above).",
