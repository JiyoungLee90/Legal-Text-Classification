France (dec.), no. 57220/00, \u00a7 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). As regards the possibility of lodging a claim for inflation losses, the Court notes that the Government omitted to comment on the effectiveness of the remedy suggested. In any event, the Court observes that the main reason of non-enforcement of the judgment of 21 June 1999 cited by the Government was the lack of funds allocated from the federal budget. In these circumstances, a claim for inflation losses arising out of protracted enforcement of the judgment would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution which would not be enforceable because of insufficient funding (see Pogulyayev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 34150/04, \u00a7\u00a013, 3 April 2008). Thus, it appears that such an action would not bring the applicant closer to the liquidation of his debt. As regards the possibility to lodge a claim for non-pecuniary damage, the Government did not advance any arguments to demonstrate that the remedy suggested would be an effective one, as well as available in theory and in practice, and their argument was confined to a mere assertion that the remedy was effective. The Court accordingly rejects the Government\u2019s argument about the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

However, there is no need for the Court to establish the accuracy of these allegations, since the Government\u2019s argument should in any event be rejected for the following reasons. The Court recalls its established case-law that a person who has obtained an enforceable judgment against the State as a result of successful litigation cannot be required to resort to enforcement proceedings in order to have it executed (see Koltsov v. Russia, no. 41304/02, \u00a7\u00a016, 24 February 2005; Petrushko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 36494/02, \u00a7\u00a018, 24\u00a0February 2005; and, mutantis mutandis, Metaxas v.\u00a0Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27 May 2004). As soon as the judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour becomes enforceable, it is incumbent on the State to comply with it (see Reynbakh v. Russia, no. 23405/03, \u00a7 24, 29\u00a0September 2005). The Court accepts that a successful litigant may be required to undertake certain procedural steps in order to recover the judgment debt (see Shvedov v. Russia, no. 69306/01, \u00a7\u00a029\u201337, 20 October 2005). However, the requirement of the creditor\u2019s cooperation must not go beyond what is strictly necessary and, in any event, does not relieve the authorities of their obligation under the Convention to take timely and ex\u00a0of\ufb01cio action, on the basis of the information available to them, with a view to honouring the judgment against the State. This especially applies where, in view of the complexities and possible overlapping of the execution and enforcement procedures, an applicant may have reasonable doubts about which authority is responsible for the execution or enforcement of the judgment. In this respect the Court further recalls that it is incumbent on the State to organise its legal system in such a way that ensures co-ordination between various enforcement agencies and secures honouring of the State\u2019s judgment debts in good time, irrespective of changes in the domestic law (see Reynbakh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24).",

The award had nonetheless remained unenforced for more than four years. Furthermore, in the Court\u2019s view, the authorities failed to ensure a requisite co-ordination between the State agencies involved in the enforcement of the judgment. The Court notes, in particular, that the system of administration of finance of the responsible military unit changed as early as on 1 January 2002 (see paragraph 9 above). However, it was not until 16 January 2003 that the writ of execution was returned to the applicant. It appears accordingly that for more than a year the writ had remained either with a local department of the Central Bank or with the bailiffs\u2019 office unexecuted. It does not appear that during the said period the authorities took any initiative to comply with the judgment or informed the applicant of the relevant change of the procedure.",

Russia, no.\u00a041842/04, \u00a7\u00a028, 8\u00a0November 2007).\u00a0The Court reiterates that it would impose an excessive burden on the applicant if he were to follow every change in the procedure and forward the writ of execution from one competent State agency to another (compare with Reynbakh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a023-24). The Court accordingly concludes that the applicant\u2019s behaviour in the present case does not relieve the authorities from their responsibility under the Convention to ensure timely execution of the judgment against the State.",
