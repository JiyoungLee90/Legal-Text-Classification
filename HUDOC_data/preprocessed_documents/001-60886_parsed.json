While the EAT held a preliminary hearing concerning the application for appeal from the ET on 3\u00a0October 1995 and ordered a hearing of the appeal, this hearing was not in fact listed until 11 July 1996 when the date was fixed for 17 September 1996. As the judgment was not given until some six weeks later, a delay of twelve months had occurred since the first instance's final decision on 9\u00a0October 1995. While the Government asserted the reason for the delay in listing was the necessity to have the notes of evidence of the ET Chairman transcribed \u2013 some 50 pages -, this does not satisfactorily account for the lapse of time in a case which was already old. Furthermore, though the applicant lodged her appeal with the Court of Appeal on 12 December 1996 a hearing was not held for over fourteen months, on 16 February 1998, and it took another thirteen months between the lodging of the applicant's petition with the House of Lords and its summary refusal of leave.",
