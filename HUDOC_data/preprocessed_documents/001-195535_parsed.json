It also notes that, in accordance with Rule 47 \u00a7 5, as in force at the time, the date of a first communication was as a general rule considered to be the date of the lodging of the application in question, thus interrupting the six-month time-limit set by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s reference to the Practice Direction, which set a time-limit of six weeks for a completed application form to be returned to the Registry. However, that time-limit was indicative, rather than obligatory. It aimed to ensure that applicants pursued their applications \u201cwith reasonable expedition\u201d (see Smertin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a019027/07, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28, 2\u00a0October 2014). The Court furthermore notes that subsequently both of the applicants and their representatives duly signed\u00a0and submitted power of attorneys to the Court (see paragraph 12 above). For those reasons, the Court finds that the date on which the application was lodged, 4 February 2008, should stand (see Khadzhimuradov and Others v. Russia, nos. 21194/09 and 16\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7 54-58, 10 October 2017).",

Moreover, the Government did not dispute the circumstances of the abduction as presented by the applicant to the Court.",

In respect of Yevloyeva and Tomova (no.\u00a014667/09) the Court does not observe discernible lulls that could, along with the applicants\u2019 lack of contact with the authorities, have negatively influenced their compliance with the admissibility criteria (see paragraph 75 above and the appended table). In Ozdoyev and Tsechoyev (no. 9782/08) and Murdalova and Elmurzayev (no.\u00a066832/11) the most significant gaps amounted to about one and half years (see paragraphs 37 and 178 and the appended table).

In support of that assertion, they referred to evidence contained in their submissions and documents from the criminal investigation files disclosed by the Government. They also submitted that they had each made a prima facie case that their relatives had been abducted by State agents, and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government. Given the lack of any news about their relatives for a long time and the lifethreatening nature of unacknowledged detention in Chechnya at the relevant time, they asked the Court to consider their relatives dead.",
