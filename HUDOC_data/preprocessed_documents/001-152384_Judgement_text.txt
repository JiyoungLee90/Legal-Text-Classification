The case originated in an application (no. 31596/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Abdullah Günay (“the applicant”), on 3 July 2007.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Erbil, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 12 January 2010 the complaints concerning the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention and the criminal proceedings brought against him and his right to compensation for unlawful detention were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1979. At the time of the introduction of the application, he was detained in the Kırıkkale F-type prison.
On 24 April 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Istanbul police.
On 30 April 1999 the applicant was taken before a judge who ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention.
On 6 May 1999 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and two other persons charging them under Article 125 of the former Criminal Code with having carried out activities on behalf of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an illegal organisation) for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory.

The bombing had caused the death of thirteen innocent people and the injury of numerous persons.
On 7 May 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.
