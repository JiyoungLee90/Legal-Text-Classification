The Government did not contest the authenticity of that document. Nor did they provide the Court with any evidence, such as acknowledgment of receipt or similar, showing that the summons had reached the applicant in good time. It therefore follows that the applicant had not received the summons in good time. In so far as the Government claimed that the applicant\u2019s representative had not appeared at the appeal hearing, the Court observes the applicant had not been represented before the first-instance court and it follows from the case file that he had not appointed any representative for the appeal hearing.

It follows that the domestic authorities failed to demonstrate that they had taken a reasonable effort to duly summon the applicant to the hearing (see by contrast Babunidze\u00a0v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no. 3040/03, 15 May 2007). In these circumstances the Court considers that the applicant was not provided with an opportunity to appear at the appeal hearing of his case.
