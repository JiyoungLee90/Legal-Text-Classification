The Government pointed out, however, that that was possible only on condition that the disclosure was limited to the strict requirements of the medical practitioner's defence in court and did not take the form of a deliberate public disclosure; they referred in that connection to a Watelet judgment delivered by the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation on 19\u00a0December 1885, although they did not produce it or cite its publication reference. The applicant company produced a judgment of 22 May 2002 in which the First Civil Division of the Court of Cassation held that \u201cpursuant to Article 901 of the Civil Code [by which 'persons making a donation ... must be of sound mind'], which amounts to authorisation within the meaning of Article 226-14 of the Criminal Code, practitioners are released from their obligation not to disclose facts which become known to them in the practice of their profession; since the purpose of professional confidence is to protect the non-professional who confided such facts in the professional, they may be disclosed not only to the non-professional but also to persons with a legitimate interest in ensuring this protection\u201d. The Court of Cassation inferred from this that the trial courts could rule that an expert appointed in proceedings for the determination and partition of an estate should have access to the deceased's medical records without being blocked on grounds of medical confidentiality by the practitioner in possession of the records.",

Kayser, La protection de la vie priv\u00e9e par le droit, Economica, 3rd edition, \u00a7 214, and to the \u201cconvergent opinions\u201d of Mr N.J.

Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, among other authorities, The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, \u00a7 49, and Hertel v.\u00a0Switzerland, judgment of 25 August 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, pp. 2325-26, \u00a7 35).",

On the one hand, that measure had been intended to afford redress for the damage caused by the breach of medical confidentiality, and, on the other hand, the criminal conviction in the applicant company's case for aiding and abetting a breach of medical confidentiality had been binding on the civil courts in their assessment of the issue of negligence. In the Government's submission, in view of the space they occupied, the passages which disclosed facts covered by the rules of medical confidentiality could not be separated from the rest of the book without depriving it of its fundamental content and thereby disfiguring it; prohibition of the continued distribution of the book in its entirety had therefore been the only means of stopping the damage. In addition, the particular circumstances noted by the domestic courts had justified the amounts awarded to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's heirs in damages. The size of those amounts should in any event be seen in relative terms, given that the applicant company had made a substantial profit through the sale of 40,000 copies of the book and, having been ordered to pay damages jointly and severally with Dr Gubler, had only actually had to pay 50% of the award.",

It pointed out, firstly, that the book complained of had raised issues of general interest; it had contributed both to the right of citizens \u2013 towards whom President Mitterrand had voluntarily assumed a duty of \u201cmedical transparency\u201d \u2013 to receive information about a \u201cState lie\u201d, and to a more general debate about the health of serving leaders. The extent of the disclosures made in the book did not detract from that; the applicant company submitted in that connection that it had been for Dr Gubler and his publisher to decide what information to impart to the public about the President's health (it referred on that point to Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999-I). It further argued that the debate had not become any less pressing after Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's death; indeed, many public figures had continued to talk about the matter long after the book had been published. Secondly, the applicant company submitted that the information in the book had already been very widely disseminated: there had been an \u201cadvance publication\u201d of extracts in the 16 January 1996 issue of the magazine Paris-Match, of which one million copies had been sold; 40,000 copies of the book had been sold before the urgent-applications judge had ordered the discontinuation of its distribution; and by 13 March 1996, when the Court of Appeal had decided to maintain the injunction, the book had been disseminated on the Internet and had been the subject of considerable media comment. Relying on Vereniging Weekblad Bluf! v. the  (judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 306-A), it concluded that the prohibition on the book's distribution had not been justified.",

The applicant company pointed out in particular that, contrary to what the Government had maintained, the civil courts had not been bound by the criminal conviction of its managing director for aiding and abetting a breach of medical confidentiality. The civil courts had been required to consider private interests alone; their sole task had been to assess and make good the damage sustained by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand up to the date of his death as a result of the invasion of his privacy through the breach of medical confidentiality. A person's right to institute court proceedings in the event of such interference lapsed on his death; such differential treatment of the right to receive and impart information according to whether or not the invasion of the deceased's privacy had occurred by means of a breach of medical confidentiality was not based on any \u201cobjective grounds\u201d within the meaning of Du Roy and Malaurie v. France (no. 34000/96, ECHR 2000-X). The applicant company considered it \u201cparticularly perverse\u201d for the Government to argue that a blanket ban on distribution was justified by the fact that merely removing the passages that breached medical confidentiality would have effectively deprived the book of its fundamental content and disfigured it. Such an argument amounted to justifying the wholesale censorship of a piece of writing by the fact that partial censorship infringed its author's right under the Code of Intellectual Property not to have his work distorted. Lastly, the applicant company pointed out that the civil courts had awarded Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's heirs FRF 340,000 in damages, an extremely large amount seeing that they had not directly sustained the damage and an interim injunction had been issued prohibiting the distribution of the book.",

It notes that the urgent-applications judge gave her ruling on 18 January 1996, the day after publication of Le Grand Secret, which itself had taken place barely ten days after President Mitterrand's death. Clearly, the distribution so soon after the President's death of a book which depicted him as having consciously lied to the French people about the existence and duration of his illness and \u2013 as the Paris Court of Appeal noted in detail in its judgment of 13 March 1996 \u2013 constituted a prima facie breach of medical confidentiality could only have intensified the grief of the President's heirs following his very recent and painful death. Moreover, the President's death, after a long fight against his illness and barely a few months after he had left office, certainly aroused strong emotions among politicians and the public, so that the damage caused by the book to the deceased's reputation was particularly serious in the circumstances. The Court further observes that the interim injunction did not prejudge the outcome of the subsequent dispute between the parties on the merits. In particular, as her injunction was based on the \u201cmanifestly unlawful infringement\u201d, the urgent-applications judge, like the Court of Appeal when it reviewed the injunction, was not required to enter into a discussion of the legally delicate issue of whether the right to bring an action relating to a prohibition on disclosing information was vested only in the living. On an application by the widow and children of the President, who had died a few days previously, the urgent-applications judge, in this context of grief, had to order a measure that was likely to put an end to the infringement. In view of the date on which the injunction was issued and its temporary nature, the discontinuation of the distribution of the book in question until such time as the relevant courts had ruled whether it was compatible with medical confidentiality and the rights of others, was justified by the legitimate aim or aims pursued.",

It notes that by 23\u00a0October 1996, when the  tribunal de grande instance gave judgment, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had been dead for nine and a half months. Clearly, the context was no longer the same as on 18 January 1996, when the urgent-applications judge issued the interim injunction prohibiting the distribution of Le Grand Secret. The judge issued the injunction the day after the book's publication, which itself had taken place barely ten days after President Mitterrand's death; as the Court has already held, distribution of the book so soon after the President's death could only have intensified the legitimate emotions of the deceased's relatives, who inherited the rights vested in him (see paragraph 47 above). In the Court's opinion, as the President's death became more distant in time, this factor became less important. Likewise, the more time that elapsed, the more the public interest in discussion of the history of President Mitterrand's two terms of office prevailed over the requirements of protecting the President's rights with regard to medical confidentiality. This certainly does not mean that the Court considers that the requirements of historical debate may release medical practitioners from the duty of medical confidentiality, which under French law is general and absolute, save in strictly exceptional cases provided for by law. However, once the duty of confidentiality has been breached, giving rise to criminal (and disciplinary) sanctions against the person responsible, the passage of time must be taken into account in assessing whether such a serious measure as banning a book \u2013 a measure which in the instant case was likewise general and absolute \u2013 was compatible with freedom of expression.",
