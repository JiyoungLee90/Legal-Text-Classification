The windows were so high that they could not be opened without the assistance of a guard. There were about seven inmates in the cell, some of them with HIV and some suffering from other illnesses. The toilet was separated from the living area by a waist-high wall and leaked. As a result, there was always a bad smell. The shower also leaked and the cubicle door was broken. It was so humid in the cell that the plaster had fallen off the ceiling and the walls were covered in mould. The cell was infested with mice and lice. There were no household appliances like a kettle or microwave. Nor were there any beds or bedside cabinets as shown by the State Prisons Service on television (see paragraph 45 above). Ms Sa. specified that in fact none of the detainees had ever been held in the cell presented by the authorities on television. There was no hot water and the pressure in the cold water taps was so low that inmates had to store water for their own use. Furthermore, the SIZO administration did not provide them with any tableware. Their daily walk lasted only twenty minutes and took place in a small walking area covered with bars. Furthermore, according to Ms Sa., the food in the SIZO was neither fresh nor tasty.

Lastly, the Court takes note of the fact that the application of any security measures to the applicant was the direct responsibility of her security guards. Accordingly, it is not prepared to take at face value their statements denying her handcuffing (see paragraph 23 above).",

In this regard, it is important to consider, for instance, the danger of a person absconding or causing injury or damage (see Raninen v. Finland, 16\u00a0December 1997, \u00a7 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, and Henaf v. France, no. 65436/01, \u00a7\u00a7 50-53, ECHR 2003XI). The Court has also held on many occasions that handcuffing or shackling of an ill or otherwise weak person is disproportionate to the requirements of security and implies an unjustifiable humiliation, whether or not intentional (see, for example, Okhrimenko v. Ukraine, no. 53896/07, \u00a7 98, 15 October 2009, and Salakhov and Islyamova v. Ukraine, no.\u00a028005/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0155 and 156, 14\u00a0March 2013).",

Accordingly, applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Nonetheless, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide \u2013 to the greatest possible extent \u2013 some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a032362/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 20 May 2010). However, after the Court has given notice of the applicant\u2019s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce the relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see Gubin v.
