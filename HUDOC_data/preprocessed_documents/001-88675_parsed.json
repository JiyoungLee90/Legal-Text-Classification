Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that the remedy indicated by them would have been capable of providing redress in the applicants\u2019 situation, namely that it would have led to the release of Isa and Shamil Khalidov and the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Musayeva and Others v. , no.\u00a074239/01, \u00a7 69, 26\u00a0July 2007).

During this period the applicants have applied to various official bodies with enquiries about Isa and Shamil Khalidov, both in writing and in person. Despite their requests, the applicants have never received any plausible explanation or information as to what became of Isa and Shamil Khalidov following their kidnapping. The responses received by the applicants mostly denied that the State was responsible for the abduction or simply informed them that an investigation was ongoing. The Court\u2019s findings under the procedural aspect of Article 2 are also of direct relevance here.",

However, such a remedy is only required in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Halford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997III, p. 1020, \u00a7 64).",
