The applicant contended that, since the notion of \u201cinsult\u201d was defined only in criminal law but not in the Civil Code, he had not been able reasonably to foresee that the use of such a neutral word would give rise to civil liability. The Court considers that it need not determine whether the legal norms applied in the defamation claim were formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to regulate his conduct, since the interference was, in any event, not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d for the following reasons.",

In assessing whether such a need exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not however unlimited, but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for example, Grinberg, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a026-27, with further references).",

A consistent reading of the article would have revealed that the applicant had first examined what the conduct of a \u201cnormal\u201d governor should have been in a similar situation and then expressed his view on Mr Rutskoy's reaction. Finally, the applicant stressed that he had not stated that the governor had been generally abnormal; his value judgment had referred to one specific manifestation of the governor's professional activities, namely his advising his assistants to cover up the budget deficit.",

On the other hand, his case was similar to the Oberschlick case, where the public use of a much stronger word \u201cidiot\u201d (Trottel) in respect of a politician had been found not to be disproportionate (see Oberschlick v.

It cannot, however, accept their finding that in the context of the applicant's article the word was employed to suggest that the Governor was insane. The Court notes that the article opened with a description of the contents of an audit report which had revealed a shortage of funds allocated for the purchase of office furniture. The applicant stated his view that under such circumstances an imaginary \u201cnormal governor\u201d would have attempted to identify those responsible, ensure their prosecution and seek restitution of the stolen money. He then contrasted the conduct of that fictitious \u201cnormal governor\u201d with the real-life reaction of Governor Rutskoy, who had advised his assistants to re-evaluate the work that had been carried out so as to cover up the deficit. The article concluded with an expression of the applicant's opinion on the \u201cabnormality\u201d of a State official's dispensing such advice. Against this background, the Court considers that the term \u201cabnormal\u201d, taken in its context, should be understood in the sense given to it by the applicant, namely to describe the conduct of a State official which did not appear appropriate in the circumstances of the case.",

However, the question remains whether there was a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see Jerusalem, \u00a7 43, cited above). In the present case the domestic courts were satisfied as to the accuracy of the facts related in the applicant's article \u2013 in particular, as regards the handwritten instruction by Governor Rutskoy for his assistants to re-evaluate the work that had been carried out \u2013 and dismissed that part of the Governor's claim as unfounded.

The domestic courts did not explain why they favoured the interpretation of the statement suggesting that the Governor was mentally deficient over the one criticising shortcomings in the discharge of his duties. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the need to put the protection of the politician's personality rights above the applicant's right to freedom of expression and the general interest in promoting this freedom where issues of public interest are concerned has not been convincingly established.",

That the proceedings were civil rather than criminal in nature and the final award was relatively small does not detract from the fact that the domestic decisions were not based on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see paragraph 17 above).
