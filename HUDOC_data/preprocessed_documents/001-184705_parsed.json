These factors contributed to the length of the proceedings and therefore had an impact on the length of the applicant\u2019s detention. The Government also stressed that the links between the coaccused persons made it appear likely that, if released, they would have attempted to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. The Government pointed out that this risk had not been illusory, since the applicant had taken a number of actions aimed at disrupting the proceedings. They noted in particular that during the hearings held in 2014 and 2015, the applicant had provoked the witnesses, tried to influence their testimony, disrupted their questioning and interrupted the presiding judge. In consequence, he had contributed to the length of the proceedings.",

The judicial authorities also considered that in view of the complexity of the case, which involved numerous coaccused, multiple charges and a number of witness statements, including the testimony of five \u201ccrown witnesses\u201d, the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending (see G\u00f3rski v. Poland, no. 28904/02, \u00a7\u00a057, 4\u00a0October 2005). However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see for instance Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a080-81, 26\u00a0July 2001; and Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7 49, 4 May 2006).",

In this regard, the Court reiterates its caselaw according to which, in cases concerning organised crime, a relatively longer period of detention on remand could be justified given the particular difficulties in dealing with those cases in the trial courts (see Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a036, 4\u00a0August 2006). However, it does not give the authorities unlimited power to extend this preventive measure. Firstly, with the passage of time, the initial grounds for pre-trial detention become less and less relevant and the domestic courts should rely on other \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds to justify the continued deprivation of liberty (see, among many other authorities, I.A. v. France, judgment of 23\u00a0September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII, p. 2979, \u00a7\u00a0102; and Labita v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000IV). Secondly, even if, due to the particular circumstances of the case, detention on remand is extended beyond the period generally accepted under the Court\u2019s case-law, particularly strong reasons would be required to justify this (see Pasi\u0144ski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 6356/04, \u00a7 44, 20 June 2006).",

Poland, no. 39912/06, \u00a7\u00a039, 21 February 2012). The Government relied on the allegations of the applicant\u2019s misconduct during the hearings (aimed at provoking the witnesses, influencing their testimony and disrupting questioning) and the fact that the applicant had abused his procedural rights, inter alia, by submitting unfounded applications. However, they offered no documents or other evidence substantiating those allegations. Therefore, with the passage of time, the grounds relied on became less relevant and cannot justify the entire period of over three years and six months for which the most serious preventive measure against the applicant was imposed (see \u015alusarczyk v.\u00a0Poland, no. 23463/04, \u00a7 156, 28 October 2014).",
