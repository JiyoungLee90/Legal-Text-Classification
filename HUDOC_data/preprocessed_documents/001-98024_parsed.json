Referring to the Court's decision in the case of Homann v.  (no. 12788/04, \n9 May 2007), the Government considered that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was only applicable in respect of the proceedings concerning the determination of the sentence, which were terminated by the judgment pronounced on 16 September 2002. It did not, however, apply to the proceedings concerning the applicant's transfer requests, as no new charges had been brought against the applicant following the final sentence. According to the Government, in the case of an assurance given in proceedings concerning a criminal charge, Article 6 only applied in so far as that assurance had had an impact on the accused's conduct in the proceedings and could possibly be considered to constitute a violation of the right to a fair trial.
