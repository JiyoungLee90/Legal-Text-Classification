Leanza and Mr I.M. Braguglia, and by their successive co-Agents, respectively Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli.
On 10 October 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in .
The applicant is the owner of a flat in , which he had let to M. D'A.
In a registered letter of 12 April 1984, the applicant informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term and asked her to vacate the premises.
In a writ served on the tenant on 28 April 1984, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Naples Magistrate.
By a decision of 16 July 1984, which was made enforceable on 17 October 1984, the Naples Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 30 June 1986.
The tenant objected to the Naples Magistrate decision and informed the applicant that she would not leave the premises.
On 16 July 1990, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.
On 17 September 1990, he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 4 October 1990.
Between 4 October 1990 and 25 November 1991, the bailiff made three attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession.
On 13 November 1992, the applicant served a second notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.
On 24 December 1992, he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 8 January 1993.
Between 8 January 1993 and 16 September 1993, the bailiff made two unsuccessful attempts to recover possession.
On 16 September 1993 the tenant asked for a suspension of the enforcement proceedings.
On 16 July 1996, the applicant served a third notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.
On 2 October 1996, he informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 10 October 1996.
Between 10 October 1996 and 4 December 1998, the bailiff made eight unsuccessful attempts to recover possession.
Pursuant to section 6 of Law no. 431/98, the tenant asked for a suspension of the enforcement proceedings. The Naples Court of Appeal decided to suspend it until 15 October 1999.
On 9 November 1999, the applicant informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 19 November 1999.

On 28 February 2002, the applicant served a fourth notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.
On 17 April 2002, the applicant informed the tenant that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 6 May 2002.

On 20 June 2002, the law-decree no. 122 postponed the enforcement of the eviction proceedings until 30 June 2003.
According to the last information submitted by the applicant on 12 September 2003, he had not yet recovered possession of the flat.
Since 1947 the public authorities in  have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents. This has been achieved by rent freezes (occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases), by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement, suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession. The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies, the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V. Lastly, for some cases, a suspension of the enforcement of the orders for possession until 30 June 2004 was introduced by Legislative Decree no. 147 of 24 June 2003, which became Law no. 200 of 1 August 2003.
As regards the control of the rents, the evolution of the Italian legislation may be summarised as follows.
The first relevant measure was the Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978 which provided machinery for “fair rents” (the so-called equo canone) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation.
The second step of the Italian authorities dated August 1992. It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies. Accordingly, a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions (the so-called patti in deroga) entered into force. Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price.
Lastly, Law no. 431 of 9 December 1998 reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents.
The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat. In this regard, Article 1591 of the Italian Civil Code provides:
“The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until the date when he leaves, together with other remaining damages.”
However, Law no. 61 of 1989 set out, inter alia, a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease, proportionally increased according to the cost of living (Article 24 of Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978) plus 20%, along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat.
In the judgment no. 482 of 2000, the  was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with the Constitution. The  held that it was compatible with the Constitution with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law. The  explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation, when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary. While evictions were suspended ex lege, the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant, both measures being temporary and exceptional. Besides, the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages.
The  declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention. Accordingly, it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant.
