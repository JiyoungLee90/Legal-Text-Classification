While it can be accepted that some such cases may be more complex than others, the Court does not consider the present one to be of such complexity as to justify the enforcement proceedings of this length. While it is true that there were other property-related claims in respect of the flat at issue, it is observed that the first such proceedings had already ended in 1999, which is long before the Convention entered into force in respect of the respondent State, and the second such proceedings lasted between 2008 and October 2009, that is when the enforcement proceedings here at issue had been stayed anyhow and therefore could not be considered to have had any influence over it.",
