The applicants\u2019 reference to their unofficial religious marriage had not demonstrated the validity of their family ties. The applicants had not furnished any evidence that the first applicant was the family breadwinner. His explanations concerning the leg injury had not been sufficient to justify the delay in regularising his immigration status. Furthermore, the first applicant had arrived in Russia at a mature age, twenty-seven, which demonstrated that he could not be considered as either a long-term or a settled migrant. He had never applied for a residence permit or Russian nationality and he had relatives in Azerbaijan. The Government further stated that the first applicant had already been fined in 2007 for a failure to regularise his stay in Russia and that that fact had been taken into account by the domestic courts when deciding on his administrative removal.",

In particular, as regards Mr Sh.G., a national of Azerbaijan, on 16 September 2015 the Perm Regional Court overruled the decision on his administrative removal taken by the Sverdlovskiy District Court in Perm as disproportionate. The Regional Court took into account that Mr Sh.G. had lived in Russia for almost twenty years, that he had finished school and a training college in Russia and that he maintained relationship with his relatives in Russia and did not have family or place of residence in Azerbaijan. As for Mr M.U., a national of Uzbekistan, on 18 November 2013 the Ordzhenikidzevskiy District Court in Perm fined him for residing in Russia without a valid residence permit, but decided not to impose on him the administrative removal. It found that the removal was a disproportionate measure in view of Mr M.U.\u2019s residence in Russia since 2006 and his marriage in 2010 to a Russian national with whom he had two children. It is the Government\u2019s contention that the instant case was, however, different from these cases for the reasons set out above (see paragraph 38 above).",

In particular, in respect of Mr A.T., a national of Uzbekistan, who had overstayed the authorised term of his residence in Russia, on 7 November 2013 the Perm Regional Court overruled the decision on his administrative removal taken by the Sverdlovskiy District Court in Perm having found that the removal was a disproportionate measure. Its conclusion was based on the finding that for three years Mr A.T. had cohabited with a Russian national Ms V.A. without officially registering their marriage and that they had a son together. As for the case of the Ukrainian national Mr A.S., on 8 October 2013 the Perm Regional Court overruled his administrative removal ordered by the Ordzhenikidzevskiy District Court in Perm as a disproportionate measure. The Regional Court took into account the fact of Mr A.S.\u2019s cohabiting for three years with a Russian national Ms N.A., that they had a daughter as well as that Mr A.S. was the family\u2019s breadwinner. In its ruling the Regional Court noted that the paternity over the child had been officially established only after the court of the first instance had decided to expel Mr\u00a0A.S. from Russia.",

The Court notes, firstly, that in the present case the Government have neither specified which domestic court proceedings would have been an effective remedy for the second applicant, nor provided any examples to that end. Secondly, the applicants were the victims of the same alleged violation of their rights, therefore the second applicant was not required to exhaust remedies which proved to be futile for the first applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Finogenov and Others v.
