Captain P. did not appear in court during the trial. This delayed the proceedings, because the prosecution insisted on having P. examined in court. A suspicion arose that Captain P. may never have existed, and it was confirmed by the research carried out by my advocate ... He dialled the phone number listed in the statement and made sure that he reached the correct office. However, he heard that there was no employee by the name of P. and never had been. We prepared two written inquiries for the director of the Economic Crimes Directorate, to which he gave evasive replies ...

This coincides with the applicant\u2019s submission that he had been obliged to share the cell with up to thirty-five individuals.

The Court is also mindful of the fact that the cells in which the applicant was detained contained some furniture and fittings, such as bunk beds and the lavatory, which must have further reduced the floor area available to him.

Even though there is no indication that there was a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, the Court finds that the fact that he was obliged to live, sleep and use the toilet in the same cell as so many other inmates was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and to arouse in him feelings of anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him.",

The claim that Captain P. did not actually exist had been effectively disproved by the testimony of Major Kr., who had stated that Captain P. had taken part in the operative inquiry, that of Lieutenant-Colonel B., who had confirmed Captain P.\u2019s employment in the police, and the mention of Captain P. in the search record and in the statements by the attesting witnesses. The letter from the head of the Personnel Department, dated 11 August 2004, did not describe the nature of the inquiry or specify whether Captain P. was or was not listed in the records on the date of the letter or at the time of the applicant\u2019s arrest and trial.

The prosecutor\u2019s insistence on obtaining Captain P.\u2019s attendance prompted the applicant\u2019s counsel to place a call to his office phone number as it was listed in the written statement. Upon finding that the number was incorrect, in early June 2004 the attorney launched written inquiries. By the time of delivery of the District Court\u2019s judgment on 8 June 2004, the defence had not yet obtained any documents confirming or disproving the identity and police employment of Captain P. It was not until 11 August 2004 that the  police human resources department replied that Captain P. was not their employee.",
