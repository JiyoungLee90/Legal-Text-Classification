However, all those efforts proved to have little impact on the applicant\u2019s right to participate effectively in his children\u2019s lives or visit them regularly. The Court notes that the difficulties in enforcing the contact arrangements were largely due to his daughter\u2019s refusal to see him but also due to the mother\u2019s reluctance to allow M.G. contact with his father without J.G. present. The aversion of the applicant\u2019s daughter towards him, as observed by the domestic authorities, was partly due to his behaviour during the time the family lived together (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a029 above). Moreover, at the hearings before the enforcement court both children stated that they did not want to have contact with their father because they were afraid of him (see paragraphs\u00a026 and 33 above). The Court is mindful of the fact that contact and residence disputes are by their very nature extremely sensitive for all the parties concerned, and it is not necessarily an easy task for the domestic authorities to ensure enforcement of a court order where the behaviour of one or both parents is far from constructive. In the present case, the mother\u2019s uncooperative attitude and the daughter\u2019s manifest hostility towards the applicant made it particularly difficult for the domestic authorities to take action to fully enforce the applicant\u2019s contact rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Wdowiak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071).",

The applicant occasionally visited M.G. at his school. The applicant organised these visits on his own initiative outside of the enforcement proceedings. While it appears that the school authorities were aware of them (see paragraph\u00a035 above), it is unclear whether any authorised person was present during these visits. The Court is aware of the fact that after a certain period of time characterised by the absence of contact the applicant must have become more agitated and sought other ways to see his son. Be that as it may, the Court considers that the unauthorised and unsupervised meetings with a particularly vulnerable child were not a constructive way to establish contact. Therefore, the applicant has also to some extent contributed to the difficulties in ensuring the enforcement of the interim order.",

The Court notes that the applicant ultimately failed to pursue the custody proceedings, by not attending the main hearing, and that consequently the interim order was revoked and the enforcement proceedings terminated (see paragraphs\u00a013, 14\u00a0and 43 above).",

As said by the Court in Zdravkovi\u0107 (cited above \u00a7\u00a064), and in many other of its judgments, \u201c[i]n this context, the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who do not cohabit (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102)\u201d.",

The supervised contacts took place in the presence of social workers (see paragraph\u00a035 of the judgment).

It was only natural for a good father who had been unable for years to have contact with his son, due to the mother\u2019s failure to comply with the order, to at least find a way to see his son. Under such circumstances, and since the order did not prohibit such contact, there was nothing wrong with that initiative, and there was no evidence that it had negative consequences for his son\u2019s psychological development as the majority considered (see paragraph\u00a072). On the contrary, as the Social Care Centre said in its report to the domestic court, according to the information submitted by M.G.\u2019s school the applicant\u2019s meetings with his son at the school \u201chad always been warm and affectionate and M.G. had never displayed any signs of fear or anxiety\u201d (see paragraph 35 of the judgment), and that is why it was suggested that a meeting be organised between M.G. and the applicant at the Social Care Centre in the presence of social workers (ibid).
