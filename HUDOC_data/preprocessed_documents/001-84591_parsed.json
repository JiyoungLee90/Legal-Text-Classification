Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II). It further notes that the costs of the domestic proceedings can be awarded if they are incurred by an applicant in order to try to prevent the violation found by the Court or to obtain redress therefor (see, among other authorities, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium (former Article 50), judgment of 18 October 1982, Series A no.\u00a054, p. 8, \u00a7 17). In the present case the Court finds that, the costs of the proceedings before the domestic courts cannot be considered to have been actually and necessarily incurred in order to prevent or to have redressed a breach of the Convention. The claim concerning those costs must therefore be rejected.",
