The applicant had frequently been transferred from one cell to another, the conditions in all the cells being very similar. The toilets in every cell had been virtually open, requiring the inmates to relieve themselves in front of the others. This had constituted an affront to human dignity.

Prisoners had done their own washing (except for the bed linen) so the cells had often been humid from the attempts to dry clothes. There had been no adequate ventilation system, the applicant being obliged to stay in his cell together with smokers. His health had suffered as a passive smoker.

However, such restrictions had been compatible with Article 8 of the Convention (cf. the aforementioned Peers v. Greece; Vala\u0161inas v. Lithuania; Puzinas v. , no.\u00a044800/98, 14 March 2002). Nevertheless, the applicant\u2019s correspondence to the Court and State institutions, including the national courts, had not been censored. Moreover, when the applicant had complained of delays in the dispatch and receipt of correspondence, he had failed to provide the domestic courts with the details of the letters concerned.

The Court thus finds that this aspect of the applicant\u2019s complaint cannot be dismissed as abstract.

The Court recalls that it has on a number of occasions criticised the relevant Lithuanian legislation, and particularly its rather vague definition of the word \u201ccensorship\u201d, which has resulted in a number of cases of abuse by the authorities in their extensive screening or withholding of detainees\u2019 correspondence (see Jankauskas v. , no.\u00a059304/00, \u00a7\u00a7 19-23, \n24 February 2005; the aforementioned Puzinas v. Lithuania, \u00a7\u00a7 18-22; \u010ciapas v. , no. 4902/02, \u00a7\u00a7 24-26, 14 November 2006). It notes that in the aforementioned Puzinas case (\u00a7 21), it found that the censorship of prisoners\u2019 correspondence had, at least in theory, a legal basis in Article 41 of the Prison Code, and pursued the legitimate aim of \u201cthe prevention of disorder or crime\u201d. However, the Court observes from its examination of the present case that the domestic law and practice did not clarify the criteria which could have justified a blanket system of censorship of prisoners\u2019 correspondence. That is to say, the domestic law and practice did not lay down clearly the full extent of the administration\u2019s discretion in this field. Consequently, prisoners like the applicant were unable to foresee which of their incoming and outgoing general correspondence might be stopped or delayed by the censor (cf. e.g. Tan v. Turkey, no\u00a09460/03, \u00a7 20-26, 3\u00a0July 2007). An issue as to the quality of the law therefore arises (cf. mutatis mutandis, Liu v. , no.\u00a042086/05, \u00a7 56, 6\u00a0December 2007). It follows that an argument could be made that the inadequate quality of the pertinent domestic law and practice in themselves constituted a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",

He managed to pursue his complaints despite his alleged financial and linguistic disadvantages and, in essential areas, he was provided with extra assistance, for example with interpretation (see paragraphs 13, 35 and 47 above). The Court concludes that the present case does not disclose any appearance of discrimination against the applicant. It follows that this complaint is similarly to be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
