The Court notes in particular that a colour photo of the applicant was inserted into the medical record of 4 March 2008 \u2013 a style of picture which would not ordinarily be found in medical records. The text stating that the applicant took part in fighting has also been erased form that document. However, the applicant had already offered an explanation of how this text came to be erased in the initial stages of the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 10 above) and therefore it cannot be said that he was trying to conceal any essential information. In any event, given the police findings concerning the accident (see paragraph 14 above), the information that the applicant took part in the fighting does indeed appear to be incorrect. Similarly, the medical record of 20 November 2008 contains handwritten text and a sketch highlighting part of the x-ray of the applicant\u2019s skull which is so obviously not part of the original document that the Court could not have been misled into accepting it.

As to the first attack that took place on 4\u00a0March 2008, he pointed out that the domestic authorities had not taken any steps to prosecute and punish the perpetrators for more than five years, although the police report had indicated that the domestic authorities had been well aware of their identities. The police and the school administration had failed to take the necessary measures to protect students from physical assault. Moreover, the police had not taken all necessary measures after the attack to investigate the circumstances in which it had occurred: they had not questioned any witnesses, lodged criminal complaints with the State Attorney\u2019s Office or instituted minor offences proceedings in the Minor Offences Court. The State Attorney\u2019s Office had done nothing to investigate the attacks and after five years there was the possibility that the prosecution could become time-barred. Had the State Attorney\u2019s Office considered that there was no reason to institute proceedings, it should have dismissed his complaint and allowed him to prosecute the matter himself as a subsidiary prosecutor. As to the attack of 19 December 2010, the applicant pointed to the significant delays in scheduling hearings before the Dubrovnik Municipal Court and asserted that he had been threatened by one of the Moko\u0161ica group with the aim of making him withdraw his criminal complaint.",

Nothing from the applicant\u2019s statement at the time had indicated a violent attack against him and therefore the domestic authorities had only taken further steps when the applicant had lodged his criminal complaint. Although the police had taken all necessary investigative steps, they had been unable to identify the exact person who had attacked the applicant, which had been crucial in this case. There had been no delays in the course of the investigation and the State could not be held responsible for not identifying every offender. The applicant had been allowed access to the case file but he had failed to appear on 14 July and 19 August 2011 to inspect and copy the case file. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had not been able to take over the prosecution, the Government pointed out that the applicant, just like the State Attorney, could not prosecute an unknown perpetrator. On the other hand, given that the applicant had complained that this had been a deliberate attack against him, the prosecution could not have been instituted without identifying the specific perpetrator who had thrown a rock at the applicant.",

A criminal complaint against a third suspect had been rejected and the applicant had had every opportunity to pursue the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor had he considered it appropriate. He had been allowed to effectively participate in the proceedings and it had been his responsibility to use that right diligently. Nothing in the case file suggested any irregularity in the work of the State Attorney\u2019s Office or the Dubrovnik Municipal Court. Lastly, the Government considered that the applicant\u2019s arguments as to the existence of an organised group from the Moko\u0161ica neighbourhood had been misplaced and unsubstantiated. Such a group had existed in the 1990s but there was no evidence that it was still active. It was true that the criminal prosecution had been pending against M.N. for making death threats against the applicant with the aim of intimidating him to withdraw his criminal complaint, but the Government considered that it had not been sufficient evidence that the applicant had been attacked by an organised group.",
