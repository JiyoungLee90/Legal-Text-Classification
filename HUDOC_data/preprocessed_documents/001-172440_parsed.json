As a result, this test was only performed after August 2006 when the investigating authority provided the forensic experts with a number of carbines ... It is uncontested that these carbines were the ones that had been used by the officers of the special mobile unit on 25\u00a0April 2006.

The representative is deemed to act in the applicant\u2019s interest; the representative\u2019s actions are normally deemed to be based on the applicant\u2019s instructions and wishes, and require co-operation between them in the course of the proceedings before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, V.M. and Others v.

This is obviously, and in particular, the case with claims for just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage. While it is clearly preferable to have an indication of what the applicant considers to be adequate, this cannot be seen as a condition sine qua non for awarding compensation. Rule 60 \u00a7\u00a03 empowers the Court to reject a claim where, because of the absence of itemised particulars or supporting documents, it is not in a position to rule (easily) on the quantum of the damage. We further note that, according to the very wording of Rule 60 \u00a7 3 itself, that provision is based on the assumption that a claim has been made; if no claim at all has been made, the principle ne ultra petitum is a sufficient basis for the Court not to make an award, and there is no need to mention any other possible failure by the applicant.",

The fact that the Court has, in a limited line of cases relating almost exclusively to certain respondent States, deviated from the rule clearly elucidated in its Rules of Court and enunciated in its case-law is not a sound basis for the validation of this divergent case-law by the Grand Chamber. While it is true that the terms of Article 41, the Rules of Court and the Court\u2019s own case-law on just satisfaction provide for a certain degree of judicial discretion, we would argue that this discretion comes into play only when certain formal and substantive requirements are met, only when necessary and only when it is first established, at the outset, that the internal law of the respondent State allows only partial reparation to be made.",

Nevertheless, is it not in the very nature of a document like the Convention \u2013 an international treaty signed in 1950 and subsequently ratified by 47 High Contracting Parties \u2013 that it is left to the Rules of Court to specify to which formal and substantive requirements an award by the Court of just satisfaction is subject? Like all procedural rules governing the organisation, procedure and proceedings in a court of law, whether national or international, the Rules of Court contain the details that the relevant Convention article lacks. They put flesh on the bones of those Convention provisions which concern procedure and the organisation and functioning of the Court. Neither, for example, does Article 41 specify that the satisfaction for which it provides covers pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages as well as costs and expenses. This only became clear over time, as the Court interpreted and applied first Article 50 and then Article 41 of the Convention, in conjunction with the relevant Rules of Court. Nor is mention made in Article 41 of the need for the establishment of a causal link. Should this lead us to call into question the requirements established in this regard in the Rules of Court, the Practice Direction and the Court\u2019s own case-law? Finally, the reasoning of the majority in \u00a7 67 of the Grand Chamber judgment can so easily be turned on its head.

This is the preferred route of the majority. However, their choice is not borne out by the terms of Article 41, which contain conditions as explained above, by the clear terms of the remainder of Rule 60, by the terms of the Practice Direction or by the prevailing position of the Court in its case-law. All point to the fact that the Court will award just satisfaction but only in certain circumstances and where certain conditions, formal and substantive, are fulfilled. It would be strange for Rule 60 to establish the conditions for the processing and grant of an award only to nullify those conditions immediately thereafter. Furthermore, whatever one is to deduce from the reference to paragraphs and may in Rule\u00a060(3), even that Rule, given its reference to \u201cthe claims\u201d, presupposes that such claims have been made.

In addition, it indicates that, it is in the nature of non-pecuniary damage that it does not lend itself to precise calculation.

Similarly, as regards the cases cited in \u00a7 72, in all of them except one, Blesa Rodr\u00edguez, where the applicant had merely indicated his wish for compensation in the application form, the applicants in question had made duly submitted claims but had expressly left the amount to the discretion of the Court.",

It features, in fact, as one of the two compelling considerations to determine whether the Court should make an award of just satisfaction in the absence of a duly made claim. This sequence is questionable for this issue is, according to the terms of Article 41, the first which should be tackled before the Court exercises whatever power Article 41 confers on it. It is not an issue which falls to be determined when the Court is considering, in exceptional cases, whether to grant an award in the absence of a claim; it is a question the answer to which triggers the Court\u2019s engagement with Article 41 in the first place.",

While we entirely agree with the need for the Court to act flexibly and in accordance with the principle of equity, procedural rules are there to ensure that it will do so only where a claim for just satisfaction is duly made and subject to certain conditions. In other words, we agree with the existence of a discretion in the hands of the Court, we disagree regarding the moment when this discretion can be exercised and insist that it is circumscribed \u2013 as all discretions should be \u2013 by clear, coherent and accessible procedural (and substantive) rules.

Firstly, the Grand Chamber provides for three cumulative conditions but attaches to these conditions not one, but two, illustrative lists of examples. The cumulative nature of the conditions is no doubt intended to restrict the circumstances in which the judicially-created exception applies. The use of \u201cfor example\u201d and \u201cfor instance\u201d is likely to have the opposite effect. Secondly, the terms of this compelling condition are quite loose and open-ended \u2013 violations of many different Convention articles in many different circumstances could come within these terms. Thirdly, it is noteworthy that the Grand Chamber did not accept the applicant\u2019s invitation to pin the exception to the absolute nature of the right violated. This is both wise and worrying. It is wise because, as the majority themselves indicate, citing the violation of Article 8 of the Convention as a result of the proceedings leading to the adoption of the applicant\u2019s daughter in X. v. Croatia, the violation of qualified rights may also have an enormous and tragic impact \u2013 such as the loss of one\u2019s own child in adoption or child custody cases (a form of living death for some parents). In the small number of cases where the Court has granted an award in the absence of a duly made claim, it has, more often than not, justified its departure from the Rules of Court with reference to the absolute character of the article of the Convention violated or to the fundamental importance of the right at stake. However, in some other cases, no such justification for the award is provided, the latter being simply tied to the particular circumstances of the case. The breadth of the Grand Chamber\u2019s language reveals the worrying aspect \u2013 namely, how difficult it will be for the Court to limit the parameters of its own judiciallycreated exception. What will it do, for example, when faced with an Article 6 case resulting from child custody proceedings where what is at issue are due process rights with, however, in the background, the very real and tragic loss of access to children in a transnational custody dispute? It is not difficult to envisage the exception becoming so broad that it will further consume the rule from which it was intended to only exceptionally deviate.",

Unfortunately, although it tries to do so by extracting a pattern from the divergent case-law, we would respectfully argue that it will be difficult to ensure clarity, transparency and coherence in the case-law when the exception is subsequently applied. Furthermore, some possible grounds for delimiting the scope of the exception are notable by their absence. Of relevance could be the fact that an applicant was not legally represented, was considered particularly vulnerable or was the victim of a double violation of an article having an absolute or fundamental character. While the vulnerability criterion might be an excessively fluid and subjective one, the other two are objective and easily verifiable.",

Even though the Court now confirms the divergent case-law which has allowed for the award of just satisfaction in exceptional cases in the absence of a specific claim, the terms delimiting the scope and application of this judicially-created exception may not be sufficiently clear and foreseeable for the reasons explained above. One might expect divergence as regards reliance on the exception, divergence as regards the quantum of damages which result from its application and even divergence as regards the respondent States with reference to which it is said to apply in the circumstances of each case. It is also striking that the majority judgment is framed in terms of the exceptional award by the Court of \u201cjust satisfaction\u201d in the absence of a specific claim, but there is no discussion as regards whether this exception applies exclusively to non-pecuniary damage, the head at issue in the instant case. Paragraphs 69, 72-73, 79-80, 81, 83 and 92 of the majority judgment seem to limit the exception to the award of just satisfaction under that head but the reasoning of the majority in the remainder of the judgment refers to just satisfaction in general and, as such, to all three heads. While the applicant claimed neither moral damage nor costs and expenses, application of the requirements of the Rules of Court was suspended as regards the first omission but not as regards the second.",

It relates to compliance with the Rules of Court and the circumstances in which they \u2013 and the Practice Directions which clarify them \u2013 can be circumvented by the parties. A central tenet of the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 6 of the Convention is that domestic rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging court documents are aimed at ensuring the proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty. The Court has repeatedly signalled to litigants that they should expect those rules to be applied. Why would the Court, given this case-law, choose to undermine its own procedural rules in the manner outlined above? What the Court has found wanting under Article\u00a06 are national rules which, in themselves, are excessively formalistic or which are applied by the authorities with excessive formalism. However, it can hardly be argued, in the instant case, that the Rules of Court were applied in an excessively formalistic manner. The applicant, who was legally represented, was informed that a wish for compensation expressed in his application form did not suffice and that a specific claim had to be submitted. The procedure for submitting a claim was explained and a deadline set. When this deadline was not respected, it was extended by the President of the Section but still not respected.",

It could have upheld its prevailing case-law, confirming and clarifying for the future that the Rules of Court required the submission of a specific claim for an Article 41 award to be made, while highlighting why, in certain exceptional cases, the Rules as they stand at present fall short of what the Convention system requires. Since the Court, perhaps unique amongst international courts, possesses exclusive competence to adopt and amend the Rules of Court by virtue of Article 25(d) of the Convention, the plenary could have subsequently amended those rules and, specifically, the problematic Rule 60(3), if required. It is suggested that such a path, involving the drafting of procedural rules by a Court committee specialised in that field, their submission for observations to the High Contracting Parties and others and their approval by the plenary court and not a Grand Chamber formation representing a fraction of the Court, would have allowed for the establishment of clearer procedural rules while preserving the integrity of the Rules of Court more generally.
