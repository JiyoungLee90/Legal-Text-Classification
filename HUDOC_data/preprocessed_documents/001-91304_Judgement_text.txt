The case originated in an application (no. 56753/00) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Bulgarian nationals, Mr Dimitar Angelov Dimitrov and Mrs Anka Vasileva Dimitrova (“the applicants”), on 23 November 1999.
The applicants were represented by Mr T. Borodjiev and Mr I. Maznev, lawyers practising in . The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs S. Atanasova of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged that they had been deprived of their property in violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 of the Convention.
On 9 November 2007 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on its admissibility and merits at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants and the Government each submitted observations on the admissibility and merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1).
Judge Kalaydjieva, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). On 1 October 2008, the Government, pursuant to Rule 29 § 1 (a), informed the Court that they had appointed in her stead another elected judge, namely Judge Lazarova Trajkovska.
The applicants were born in 1942 and 1946 respectively and live in .
In 1972 the applicants purchased from the  municipality a threeroom apartment of seventy-four square metres located in a threestorey building in the centre of the city. The apartment had become State property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in  in 1947 and the following several years.
In November 1992 some of the heirs of the former pre-nationalisation owner brought proceedings against the applicants under section 7 of the Restitution Law.
As the proceedings had not been brought by all heirs of the prenationalisation owner, they only concerned half of the applicants’ apartment. The proceedings ended by a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 26 May 1999.
The courts found that the applicants’ title was null and void because the area where the apartment was located had been earmarked for construction of buildings of more than three storeys, according to the Sofia building plan of the 1970s, and the relevant legislation prohibited the sale of apartments in three-storey buildings located in such areas.
In 1998 and 1999 other heirs of the pre-nationalisation owner brought proceedings against the applicants under section 7 of the Restitution Law seeking to recover the remaining half of the apartment. It appears that those proceedings were terminated as time-barred.
In 1999 the applicants requested to be accommodated as tenants in a municipal dwelling. This was refused as they still owned one half of the apartment.
In 2000 the applicants vacated half of the apartment, which the restored owners started to use.
The applicants vacated the whole apartment in 2005 when they and the restored owners sold their respective parts of the property to a third party. The applicants received 70,000 euros (EUR). On an unspecified date the new owner demolished the building.
In 1998 the applicants requested compensation bonds. On 17 April 2001 the regional governor granted the request and ordered that an expert be appointed to assess the value of the property. On 6 June 2001 the governor issued another order rectifying an obvious error in the first one. The applicants did not visit the governor’s office to receive the new order and the proceedings were apparently stayed.
The relevant background facts and domestic law and practice have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01, and 194/02, 15 March 2007.
Shortly after the adoption of that judgment, on 8 May 2007 the Government published regulations implementing section 7 (3) of the Restitution Law (State Gazette no. 37 of May 2007). The regulations enable persons currently in possession of housing compensation bonds to obtain payment at face value from the Ministry of Finance.
