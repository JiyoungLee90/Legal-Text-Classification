The court also rejected as unproven the second applicant\u2019s allegations that G.\u2019s photographs had been heavily retouched by the defendant for a dramatic effect. As regards the descriptive comments about the second applicant\u2019s role in G.\u2019s injuries, the court considered that they represented value judgments not susceptible of proof in court. On the basis of the above, the court rejected the second applicant\u2019s claim as groundless. The court did not address the second applicant\u2019s arguments concerning the breach of her right to the presumption of innocence as a result of premature speculations concerning the nature and degree of her responsibility for G.\u2019s injuries.",

More specifically, in part 8 of the Resolution, the Plenary Supreme Court noted that cases concerning the protection of honour, dignity and business reputation should be differentiated from cases concerning the protection of other intangible rights the inviolability of which is specifically protected by the Constitution of Russia and other laws and the dissemination of which may cause nonpecuniary damage even if the information in question is truthful and non-defamatory. In particular, in cases concerning the dissemination of information about the private life of an individual, it should be taken into account that unauthorised dissemination of even truthful information concerning private life may lead a court to award compensation for nonpecuniary damage resulting from the dissemination of such information (Articles 150 and 151 of the Civil Code). The only exception to this rule was when the information about the private life of a plaintiff had been disseminated with the aim of protecting some public interest under part 5 of Section 49 of the Law \u201cOn the media\u201d... If false information about the person\u2019s private life was disseminated, then a defendant could be obliged not only to retract such information, but also to compensate any resulting non-pecuniary damage under Article 152 of the Civil Code.",

At the same time, the Court is mindful of the fact that the circumstances in which it may be necessary to take a child into public care are so variable that it would scarcely be possible to formulate a law to cover every eventuality. In view of the above, and since the removal order was reviewed by the courts at two levels of jurisdiction, the Court considers the scope of the discretion conferred on the domestic authorities reasonable and acceptable for the purposes of Article 8 (see Kuimov v.

Keeping in mind that the authorities\u2019 primary task was to safeguard the interests of the children, the Court can accept that the Golyanovo District Agency could reasonably have considered that placing the applicants\u2019 children G. and P. in public care for some time was in their best interests, in anticipation of the outcome of the criminal investigation into the events of 20 March 2009 and the conclusions to be drawn in the light of its findings.",

The courts gave due consideration to all the relevant circumstances of the case and carefully assessed the impugned order. Before the courts the applicants were represented by counsel and were fully able to state their case and to contest any evidence in the case file they considered false.

Moreover, the relevant resolution of the Supreme Court provided some guidance as regards the interpretation and application of Article 141 of the Family Code concerning the grounds for the bringing of revocation of adoption proceedings (see paragraph 103 above). In view of the above, and since the contested measure was reviewed by the courts at two levels of jurisdiction, the Court considers the scope of the discretion conferred on the domestic authorities reasonable and acceptable for the purposes of Article 8 (see Kuimov, cited above).",

It is true that this term was applicable to all cases, irrespective of the exact reason and probable duration of the State care, and arguably it could be seen as in some sense inviting the domestic authorities to revoke the adoption. Still, the Court observes that the decision to revoke the adoption of the applicants\u2019 children was made by a court which had the power either to grant such a request or to turn it down as unfounded. Given that the judicial determination of this question by the courts at two instances provided a substantial procedural safeguard against arbitrariness, it cannot be said that the provision in question fell short of the requirement of lawfulness of Article 8 \u00a7 2.",

The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the responsible authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care (see Kutzner v. Germany, no.\u00a046544/99, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2002I), subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child. After a considerable period of time has passed since the child was originally taken into public care, the interest of a child not to have his or her de facto family situation changed again may override the interests of the parents to have their family reunited (see K. and T., cited above, \u00a7 155).",

According to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, such measures should only be applied in exceptional circumstances and can only be justified if they are motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the children\u2019s best interests (see Johansen v. Norway, 7 August 1996, \u00a7 78, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, and Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 148, ECHR 2000VIII). The question whether the revocation of the applicants\u2019 adoption of G. and P. was justified must be assessed in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time the decisions were taken and not with the benefit of hindsight. That question must moreover be considered in the light of the reasons mentioned in paragraphs 33, 34 and 40 above for taking the applicants\u2019 children into care.",

However, the Court sees no need to resolve these doubts, because the provision in question does not in any event give permission to release such data to the public at large. Paragraph 5 of Article 61 sets out specifically that even in the case of a necessary disclosure, the persons in receipt of such sensitive information are also bound by medical confidentiality and are liable for any resulting damage. Furthermore, both Article 13.14 of the Code of Administrative offences of Russia and Article 137 of the Criminal Code expressly penalise the disclosure of such sensitive information and provide for no exception within which the actions of the  officials could fall.",

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private and family life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves. The boundary between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under this provision does not lend itself to precise definition. The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar.

As later confirmed in the criminal proceedings against the applicants, the first applicant had never mentioned points (a) and (b), and his alleged confirmation in this regard was a falsehood later acknowledged as such by doctor  (see paragraph 57). It appears that this information was taken by journalists from G.\u2019s medical card and then edited and partly reproduced in issue no. 62 of 25 March 2009 of the newspaper. With some diligence, the domestic courts could easily have verified and spotted this mistake by summoning and hearing either the first applicant or doctor , or both.",
