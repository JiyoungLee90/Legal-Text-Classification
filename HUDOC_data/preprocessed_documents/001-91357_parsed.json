However, the problem results from the wording of the overall message given to the readers, where their authors state that they will rather die than enter the cells and call on others to take action in order to support their general resistance and not to content themselves with mere declarations. It is clear that the message given is not a peaceful one and cannot be seen as a mere criticism of the new prison system. While it is true that the applicants did not personally associate themselves with the views contained in these declarations, they nevertheless provided their writers, who expressed their affiliation to illegal armed groups, with an outlet to stir up violence and hatred.\u00a0Accordingly, the content of these declarations must be seen as capable of inciting violence in the prisons by instilling an irrational reaction against those who introduced or were in charge of the new incarceration system. In other words, the message which is communicated to the readers is that recourse to violence is a necessary and justified measure of self-defence in the face of the aggressor who wants to turn their lives into prison cells (see paragraph 8 above). It is to be noted that in a similar case the Court had already expressed its concern about the making of such declarations at a time when serious disturbances had taken place in several prisons between the security forces and detainees, resulting in the deaths and injuries of parties to the conflict (see Falakao\u011flu and Sayg\u0131l\u0131, cited above, \u00a7 33). In such a context, the Court considers that there were indeed reasons to fear for violent reactions and thus to be reticent in view of the events that had taken place in the prisons in less than two months after the publication of the impugned declarations (ibid.)",

Rather, the events occurred when members of the security forces entered, simultaneously, into twenty penitential centres in which the hunger strikers were detained and violent clashes erupted between them and the protesting prisoners.",

Necessity implies the existence of a \u201cpressing social need\u201d not a \u201cpossible\u201d one.

The logic of their position would require the press not just to look over its shoulder to ensure that its publications do not add fuel to flaming fires. They must, in addition, look into the future to try to ascertain whether a fire might some day occur and, if so, whether their publication could be identified as one of a number of matches that may be accused of having caused it! Such a burden places an unworkable restriction upon the freedom of the press and jeopardises the protection of a fundamental value in a democratic society. There is nothing in the case law of this Court to justify the imposition of such a restriction.",
