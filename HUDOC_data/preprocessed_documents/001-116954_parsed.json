Having regard to the information available to the police, it had to be expected that there would be an altercation between hooligans from Bremen and from Frankfurt am Main in or in the vicinity of Frankfurt, which would entail the commission of criminal or regulatory offences, in the context of the football match. As a rule, the time and place of such altercations were agreed on in advance by the groups of hooligans concerned. The applicant was considered to have attempted to evade police surveillance in order to arrange an altercation between hooligans. He was known to the Bremen police as a \u201cgang leader\u201d of the  hooligans. He had further been observed speaking to a hooligan from Frankfurt am Main in the pub. He had further attempted to hide in the ladies\u2019 bathroom of that pub. In order to prevent altercations between the groups of hooligans being arranged, it was indispensable to detain the applicant so as to separate him from the other members of the group. Furthermore, he could be released just one hour after the end of the football match, when the Frankfurt am Main and Bremen hooligans had left the stadium and its surroundings and were no longer in the applicant\u2019s vicinity.",

He had added that during a search of the members of the group in Frankfurt am Main, a mouth protection device and several pairs of gloves filled with quartz sand had been found, which were instruments typically used by hooligans during altercations. During these clashes, offences such as bodily assault and breach of the peace (Landfriedensbruch \u2013 that is, acts of violence against persons or things committed jointly by a crowd of people in a manner which endangers public safety) were committed on a regular basis. He had personally told the group that they would be accompanied to the football stadium by the police and that every person leaving the group would be arrested.

The Court is therefore satisfied that seizing the applicant\u2019s telephone alone and possibly separating him from his group, would not have been sufficient in itself to prevent him from arranging a brawl since he could have had access to another telephone. Moreover, the detention lasted some four hours, and only until approximately one hour after the end of the football match, when the football supporters had left the stadium and its surroundings and a brawl had thus become unlikely. The police could reasonably consider in these circumstances that the applicant\u2019s detention for a relatively short duration was necessary to prevent his committing an offence (see, a contrario, Schwabe and M.G., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-78).",

It reiterates in this respect that the Convention obliges State authorities to take reasonable steps within the scope of their powers to prevent threats to life or illtreatment of which they had or ought to have had knowledge, but it does not permit a State to protect individuals from criminal acts of a person by measures which are in breach of that person\u2019s Convention rights, in particular the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1.

The Government stressed \u2013 and this was uncontested by the applicant \u2013 that the police was obliged, nowadays, to avert hooligan brawls both during the weekly football matches of the German Federal Football League and during football championships (see paragraph 54 above). The obligation not to hinder the peaceful running of such a sports event involving large numbers of spectators and to protect the public from dangers notably to their physical integrity was therefore a weighty duty in the circumstances of the case.",

As for the duration of his detention of some four hours, the Court, referring to its findings above (see paragraph 81), considers that the applicant had not been detained for longer than was necessary in order to prevent him from taking further steps towards organising a hooligan brawl in or in the vicinity of Frankfurt am Main on 10 April 2004.

Notwithstanding that the police had specifically ordered the applicant to refrain from arranging a brawl and to stay with his group of football fans, the obligation not to commit criminal acts or regulatory offences (see section 32 \u00a7 1 no. 2 of the Hessen Public Security and Order Act) is in our opinion too general for the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention. There should be a specific and concrete obligation, and a demonstrated failure to fulfil that specific and concrete obligation. The \u201cgeneral duty of obedience to the law\u201d is not such a specific and concrete obligation (Engel and Others v. Netherlands, 8 June 1976, p.\u00a028, \u00a7 69, Series A no. 22). All the examples in the Court\u2019s case law, referred to in paragraph 92 of the judgment, concern obligations to perform specific acts. To the best of our knowledge the Court has never considered that an obligation to refrain from committing criminal acts could constitute an \u201cobligation\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention. The majority considerably extends the scope of that provision by holding that the duty not to commit a criminal offence in the imminent future, to be distinguished from the obligation to comply with a specific measure that has been ordered, is an obligation which, in case of non-fulfilment - or even, as in the present case, in case of the mere risk of non-fulfilment -, falls under it (compare Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos 8080/08 and 8577/08, \u00a7 82, 1\u00a0December 2011). We think, as the Court held in the Engel case, that such \u201ca wide interpretation would entail consequences incompatible with the notion of the rule of law from which the whole Convention draws its inspiration\u201d (ibid., p. 28, \u00a7 69).",

There was no other obligation to fulfil than the general obligation - imposed by law, not by an individual measure - not to commit certain crimes and regulatory offences. This general obligation did not, in our opinion, become specific and concrete, merely because the applicant was reminded of it in the context of a specific football match.",

The majority specifies that a preventive detention is permitted only \u201cin connection with criminal proceedings\u201d (paragraph 68, referring to Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 50, ECHR 2000-IX). Since the applicant was not suspected of having committed any criminal act, as preparatory acts were not punishable under German law, he was not arrested and detained for prosecution purposes. For that reason, according to the majority, his detention did not comply with one of the conditions set forth in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) (paragraph 83).

Lithuania, cited above, \u00a7 50). In our view this case law has gone too far in holding that the requirement in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of bringing the arrested or detained person \u201cbefore the competent legal authority\u201d means, in all of the situations set out in that provision, that the intention should be to bring \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d against that person.

Netherlands, 22 May 1984, p.\u00a025, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 77; Brogan and Others v. United Kingdom, 29\u00a0November 1988, pp. 31-32, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 145-B; \u0130kincisoy v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 26144/95, \u00a7 103, 27 July 2004). An early, \u201cprompt\u201d release, without any appearance before a judge or judicial officer, may occur frequently in cases of \u201cadministrative\u201d detention for preventive purposes. Even so, in such a situation it will be enough for the purpose of guaranteeing the rights inherent in Article 5 of the Convention if the lawfulness of the detention can subsequently be challenged and decided by a court.",

In our opinion the police, faced with the situation of a large football event with the assembly of many aggressive supporters in which the applicant appeared and, as assessed by the authorities, planned to instigate fights, could reasonably consider it necessary to arrest and detain the applicant. He was detained for approximately four hours. It does not appear that this period exceeded what was required in order to prevent the applicant from fulfilling his intentions.",
