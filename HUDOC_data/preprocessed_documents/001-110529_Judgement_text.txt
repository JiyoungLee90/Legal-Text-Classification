The case originated in an application (no. 2248/06) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Lyubov Nikolayevna Blinova (“the applicant”), on 17 December 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Lutkovska, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 7 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Izyum.
In May 1994 the applicant initiated a land dispute with her neighbours.
On 29 August 2005 the proceedings, which had taken place before the courts of three levels of jurisdiction, were completed by a final ruling of the Supreme Court allowing the applicant’s claim in part.
In the course of the proceedings, there was one remittal of the case from the appellate court to the first-instance court for fresh consideration. The courts also ordered seven forensic technical expert examinations.
There were several adjournments in the proceedings due to the parties’ failure to appear for hearings.
