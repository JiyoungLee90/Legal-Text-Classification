It held that no persuasive arguments had been adduced to show that Article 417 of the Civil Code could at that time be relied on for the purpose of seeking compensation for the excessive length of proceedings or that such an action offered reasonable prospects of success (see Ma\u0142asiewicz v.\u00a0Poland, no. 22072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14 October 2003, and, for administrative proceedings, Boszko\u00a0v.

Indeed, it appears that the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal's judgment submitted by the Government is of a rather exceptional character and does not reflect a well-established practice of the Polish courts. As regards the remaining judgments submitted by the Government, the Court notes that they contain no reasoning and thus it is impossible to examine in what factual circumstances the relevant judgments were given.
