The Government had thus made the erroneous calculations with regard to the cells where he had been detained in Bjelovar Prison. In fact, he had only actually had 2.25 square metres of personal space throughout his stay in Bjelovar Prison.

Thus, the Court has already found that the freedom of movement allowed to inmates in a facility and unobstructed access to natural light and air have served as sufficient compensation for the scarce allocation of space per convict (see, for example, Shkurenko v. Russia (dec.), no. 15010/04, 10\u00a0September 2009; Norbert Sikorski v. Poland, no. 17599/05, \u00a7 129, 22\u00a0October 2009; Vladimir Belyayev v.

In this connection, it notes with concern a period of twenty-seven days during which the applicant disposed of less than three sq. m. However, this was at the same time accompanied with sufficient freedom of movement and the confinement in an appropriate detention facility. Thus, the Court concludes that, in the circumstances of the case, it cannot establish that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention, although not always adequate, reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (compare Vladimir Belyayev, cited above, \u00a7 36).",

As far as I understand it, such a presumption is neither a \u201csimple\u201d nor an unrebuttable one. This means not only that the burden of proof lies with the Government to rebut the presumption, but also that the respondent State has to present strong evidence counterbalancing the extreme lack of space in the specific circumstances of the case and in relation to the particular applicant.

As is clear from this wording, all the above aspects are seen as a bare minimum when the space afforded to the applicant is above the necessary 3 (or 4) sq. m.

Nevertheless, the word \u201chardly\u201d does not figure in at least some of the judgments quoted in paragraph 56 of the present judgment (see, for instance, Logothetis and Others v. Greece, no. 740/13, \u00a7\u00a041, 25 September 2014) and seems questionable to me because it creates uncertainty and leaves the door open to abuses. Let us put it more clearly: if a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d has to have a real meaning, a flagrant lack of personal space \u2013 that is, significantly below the required minimum \u2013 should not be accepted under any circumstances.",

Is the lack of \u201cappalling\u201d sanitary and hygiene conditions the appropriate standard for accepting that the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d can be rebutted in a given case?

This means that the applicant was confined in his cell for the rest of the day \u2013 that is, for twenty-one hours. Is this sufficient to rebut the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d? One should note, in this regard, that in a number of reports the CPT has criticised States for keeping detainees confined in their cells for more than twenty hours a day (see for instance the latest report on Croatia, cited above, \u00a7 39, in relation to remand prisoners at Zagreb and Sisak County Prisons).",

It is precisely in such situations that work and other activities outside the overcrowded spaces become particularly important. It is for this reason that in Samaras and Others v. Greece, for instance, the Court \u2013 while finding a violation of Article 3, especially because of overcrowding \u2013 took into consideration the fact that some of the applicants were working outside their cells for part of the day in determining the appropriate amount to award by way of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (Samaras and Others v.\u00a0Greece, \u00a7 71, 28\u00a0February 2012; see also Tzamalis and Others v.

More generally, however, given the different approaches outlined above in respect of the minimum space to be allocated to detainees, as well as the lack of a clear methodology for the application of the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d criterion, the Court\u2019s case-law may need to be further reflected upon so as to ensure the necessary consistency.",
