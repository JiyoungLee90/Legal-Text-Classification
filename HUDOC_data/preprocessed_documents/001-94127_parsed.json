The conduct of the person concerned, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be taken into account (see Chahal, cited above, \u00a7 81; Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 138).

That review should be capable of leading, where appropriate, to release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov v.
