The case originated in an application (no. 8472/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Duran Yavuzdoğan (the applicant) on 12 February 2007.
On 25 May 2010 the Court was informed of his death on 20 May 2009 and that his successors, Ms Döndü Yavuzdoğan, Ms Ayşe Yavuzdoğan, Ms Tülay Arslan (Yavuzdoğan), Mr Erkan Yavuzdoğan, Ms Şenay Yavuzdoğan and Mr Seyit Yavuzdoğan, stated their wish to pursue the application. For practical reasons, Mr Duran Yavuzoğlu will continue to be called “the applicant”, although his successors are now to be regarded as such (see Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, § 1, ECHR 1999-VI, and also Ahmet Sadık v. Greece, 15 November 1996, § 3, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V ).
The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 4 September 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1943 and lived in Eskişehir.
On 13 October 2000 the Turkish State Railways brought compensation proceedings against the applicant before the Eskişehir Civil Court of First Instance for the unlawful occupation of its property. Within the same proceedings the administration also requested that unlawful occupation of the building on the property to be stopped as well as the demolition of it.
On 21 June 2005 the court partially granted the administration's request and ordered the applicant to pay the plaintiff the principal amount of TRL 1,374,000,000 and plus TRL 787,205,000 as interest. It also decided that the building on the property be demolished.
On 22 February 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 21 June 2005.
On 5 October 2006 the Court of Cassation dismissed a request by the applicant for rectification of the judgment.
