She stated that she had recorded in the hospital\u2019s consultation register that the applicant had reported that he had suffered a craniocerebral trauma as a result of an attack, and that she had not found traces of violence. Her professional opinion was that the applicant\u2019s symptoms could have been caused by his surgery or because of intense stress. She also stated that the applicant was discharged around 6 p.m.",

The court ordered that the investigation clarify the contradictions between the medical documents prepared in the case, underlining that all the medical documents produced after the incident mentioned that the applicant had suffered a craniocerebral trauma, while the forensic report of 2 August 2004 held that the applicant\u2019s condition had another cause, the details of which were not mentioned. In this respect, the court considered it necessary that the medical documents be reviewed by the Superior Review Panel of the Bucharest Forensic Institute (Comisia Superioar\u0103 de Avizare a Institutului de Medicin\u0103 Legal\u0103 Bucure\u015fti). In addition, the court ordered the identification and taking of statements from all those involved in transporting the applicant to the hospital by ambulance, in order to clarify everything relating to his state of health, his injuries and any comments made by the applicant, in order to explain his condition. Moreover, the court considered that the investigation needed to clarify the applicant\u2019s statements that he had been admitted to Bal\u015f Hospital on 7 April 2004 with two different diagnoses of craniocerebral trauma caused by an attack and spasmophilia under two different entries, nos. 634 and 851 respectively, the truthfulness of the two records and the need to make them. Furthermore, the court referred to the necessity for the investigators to request the medical file drawn up by the ambulance doctors on 7 April 2004 in order to verify the authenticity of the information contained in it, in the light of the applicant\u2019s claim that the content of the said documents had been changed.",
