Restrictions on an individual\u2019s professional life may fall within Article 8 where they have repercussions on the manner in which he or she constructs his or her social identity by developing relationships with others. In addition, professional life is often intricately linked to private life, especially if factors relating to private life, in the strict sense of the term, are regarded as qualifying criteria for a given profession (see \u00d6zp\u0131nar v. Turkey, no.\u00a020999/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-48, 19 October 2010).

In those circumstances, it was the need to protect the rights of the Catholic Church from the propagation by its own members \u2013 namely, priests who obviously had an increased duty of loyalty towards the Church \u2013 of ideas that might appear to undermine its doctrinal consistency that had led the Court to hold that Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s dismissal pursued a legitimate aim, namely protection of the rights and freedoms of the Catholic Church. In the case at issue, in contrast with the Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez case, the applicant considered that it was impossible to conclude that his second marriage could have had any adverse effects on the interests of the Catholic Church, especially since he had been a layman employed by the State, and since his first marriage had been annulled by the competent Church authorities. The applicant thus contended that his dismissal from public service, in which he had been employed under a permanent employment contract as a layman teacher of religious education, solely on the grounds of his second marriage, constituted an extreme and disproportionate measure affecting his rights.",

Thus, his chances of pursuing his specific professional activity had been seriously affected on account of events mainly related to the personal choices he had made in the context of his private and family life. Moreover, precisely because of his specialised educational background and skills, it had been difficult for him to secure alternative employment or be entitled to social assistance.

Moreover, the applicant stressed that the Agreement between the Government of Croatia and the Croatian Episcopal Conference on Catholic religious education in State schools and pre-school education institutions, to which the domestic courts had also referred, had never been promulgated or published as a binding law. Accordingly, teachers of religious education had no means of foreseeing the consequences of any action they might undertake.

The fact that he had entered into a second marriage had not been known to anyone outside his family and close circle of friends, and nothing in his behaviour had threatened the credibility of the Catholic religious community. Accordingly, unlike in the Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez case, there had been no discrepancy between the ideas that have to be taught and the teacher\u2019s personal beliefs that might raise an issue of credibility of the Church. The applicant had not actively and publicly campaigned against any idea or issue, let alone an idea important to the Catholic Church. Nor had he campaigned in any way in favour of his way of life. Although he had divorced his former wife and married his present wife, he had not done it in any way that could be understood as promoting an idea of marriage different from the Church\u2019s. He had divorced discreetly and consensually, and had done nothing to promote the idea of divorce or to undermine the idea of marriage as promoted by the Catholic teachings. Furthermore, no other aspects of his life could have been considered contrary to the Church\u2019s teachings. The applicant also pointed out that divorce was a reality that occurred commonly in Croatian society. Thus, his divorce could not have had any adverse effect on public sentiment or the public interest.

He had also been aware, when the canonical mandate was granted to him, that he would lose it if the Church no longer deemed him suitable to teach Catholic religious education.

The Catholic Church\u2019s autonomy in its relationship with the State on matters of religious education had been established in the Agreement between the Holy See and Croatia on education and cultural affairs. This Agreement essentially resembled other treaties regulating the relationship of the Catholic Church with a number of other European countries. Relying on the Court\u2019s case-law in Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez (cited above), Obst (cited above) and Siebenhaar\u00a0 (cited above), the Government contended that the Court had recognised the importance of religious communities\u2019 autonomy to choose persons suitable to teach their doctrine. Thus, in the Croatian legal system, although the State formally acted as the employer of teachers of Catholic religious education in the State education system, the decision as to the suitability of persons for that post and the substance of their teaching always remained in the hands of the Catholic Church. The Church\u2019s autonomy was exercised through its right to assess the circumstances in which a canonical mandate could be issued. This undoubtedly included the right to assess whether the person to whom a mandate had been issued was living his or her life in accordance with the Church\u2019s teachings. Accordingly, if the person was living in circumstances contrary to the Church\u2019s doctrine, this could undermine the credibility of that religious community. From this perspective, the \u201cduty of allegiance\u201d referred to in the Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez case was equally binding for a layman and a priest teaching religious education.",

In the ADF\u2019s view, maintaining the integrity of Church autonomy was paramount in a democratic society. The States had a duty of neutrality and impartiality and were required, under the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 9, to refrain from interfering with Church autonomy or the right to manifest religious beliefs.

Moreover, the ADF stressed that the Court had held, in view of the wide variety of constitutional models in existence, that the States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in this context. The Court had therefore been reluctant to override the decision of the national authorities when the case involved the relationship between the Church and those who work for it.

The State could only demand that any teaching be provided in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner. Overall, Church autonomy, steeped both in freedom of thought, conscience and religion and in freedom of association, required State neutrality. In a democratic society, proportionate limitations to Article 8 were justified both to protect the integrity of religious bodies issuing teaching certificates and to maintain the integrity of the State school system by requiring teachers to hold relevant qualifications in order to teach sensitive subject matters.",

In the ECLJ\u2019s view, the bishop\u2019s decisions represented an exercise of Church autonomy guaranteed under Article 9 of the Convention, and could not as such be subjected to judicial review before the civil courts, unlike the ensuing decisions of the civil authorities, based on the bishop\u2019s decision. Of particular importance in this context was the principle of religious institutional autonomy, reaffirmed in the Court\u2019s case-law. Moreover, the principle of heightened duty of loyalty, generally recognised in labour law, was also applicable in the context of employment by a religious community, irrespective of whether such employment was direct or indirect through the State employment system. In both instances, it was for the authorities of the religious community to assess an individual\u2019s suitability to teach religious education. Such a heightened duty of loyalty was particularly important in the context of the interrelationship between the religious and civil aspects of an employee\u2019s professional activity. Accordingly, it could also have a bearing on certain aspects of his or her private life. Therefore, it could be expected that the behaviour of a teacher of religious education should not undermine the credibility of a particular religious doctrine.",

The Agreement stipulates in particular that Croatia must ensure that Catholic religious education is available in all State elementary and high schools and pre-school education institutions as a mandatory course for all those who have chosen it under the same conditions as any other mandatory course. At the same time, Croatia accepted that Catholic religious education in the State public education system would be taught only by qualified religious education teachers who were, in the opinion of the Church authorities, suitable for that position. The suitability for the position in question is expressed through the existence of a canonical mandate issued by the diocesan bishop and the withdrawal of the mandate leads to the immediate loss of the right to teach Catholic religious education (see paragraph 32 above). The Court notes that such an arrangement does not differ from those in a significant number of other Council of Europe Member States (see\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, cited above, \u00a7 67), and the agreements which Croatia has entered into with other religious communities (see paragraph 42 above).",

In observing the requirement of heightened duty of loyalty aimed at preserving the Church\u2019s credibility, it would therefore be a delicate task to make a clear distinction between the applicant\u2019s personal conduct and the requirements related to his professional activity (compare Siebenhaar, cited above, \u00a7 46; and see paragraph 45 above, canon 804 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Canon Law).",

It was therefore for the courts to ensure that the Church\u2019s autonomy is exercised in a manner which is not arbitrary or taken for a purpose that is unrelated to the exercise of its autonomy and that it did not produce effects disproportionately interfering with the applicant\u2019s Convention rights (see\u00a0paragraph 103 above; and Lombardi Vallauri v.

It also examined the reasonableness of the requirement to hold a canonical mandate to teach religious education and found that, in view of the nature of the position of teacher of religious education and its proximity to the mission of disseminating the Church\u2019s teachings, the requirement to hold a canonical mandate was not an excessive burden for persons who chose to become religious education teachers. The Constitutional Court also observed that Catholic religious education teachers in the State education system in Croatia had a sui generis employment status, as provided for under the Agreement of 18 December 1996 between the Holy See and Croatia on education and cultural affairs. In particular, such a status followed from the requirement to hold a canonical mandate, which could be issued only by the competent Church\u2019s authorities based on their assessment as to the teacher\u2019s suitability for that post. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had been employed in the State education system under such an arrangement and that he had been well aware of the requirements related to the canonical mandate and the consequences of its withdrawal (see paragraph 23 above).",

The Constitutional Court held that despite the withdrawal of his canonical mandate, the applicant still had his degree in theology, which gave him the possibility to teach courses in ethics and culture. The schools at issue had discharged this obligation by trying to find another post for the applicant; having been unable to find such a post, they had terminated his contract of employment. In those circumstances, the Constitutional Court concluded that a fair balance had been struck between the protection of the applicant\u2019s interests and the State\u2019s duty towards the Catholic Church (see paragraph 23 above).",

The conclusions thus reached do not appear unreasonable to the Court, especially as the Constitutional Court placed emphasis on the applicant\u2019s knowledge of the requirements of special allegiance towards the teachings and doctrine of the Church concomitant with his status of teacher of Catholic religious education, and the duty of the competent domestic authorities to take into account the fact that as the applicant had entered the State education system, the withdrawal of his canonical mandate could not in itself lead to his dismissal from the teaching profession. The Constitutional Court carried out a thorough analysis and examined the issue from various perspectives (see\u00a0paragraphs 24 and 25 above). As to references to the Church\u2019s autonomy to impose a special requirement for religious education teachers to hold a canonical mandate, it does not appear, in the light of the review exercised by the national courts, that this was improperly invoked in the present case (compare Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, cited above, \u00a7 148).",
