Before the Commission and the Sub-Commission, the Applicant maintained that the presence of a member of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation at the deliberations of 21st June 1965 had violated Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. Without disputing that there is a considerable difference between the respective functions of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation and the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the courts below, he stressed that in accordance with the law the former does sometimes appear as a party even though this did not happen in this case. Furthermore, the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation does, in the view of the Applicant, exercise supervision over the Procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux at the Court of Appeal (section 154 of the Act of 18th June 1869); a very strong statutory tie, therefore, links him with them, his subordinates, even if in practice the supervision in question is nowadays rather discreet. Again, the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation was, in the great majority of cases, the opponent - at any rate potential - of the convicted persons who appealed to the highest court in : the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral usually submitted that their appeals should be dismissed and his opinion was nearly always adopted - as in this case - by the judges. Then the Applicant stressed that the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, after having developed his submissions at the end of the hearing in open court, also participated in its private deliberations from which the parties are excluded. This caused a violation of the rights of the defence and, particularly, of the principle of \"equality of arms\", as it was defined in the opinions given by the Commission in the Ofner, Hopfinger, Pataki and Dunshirn cases (Applications Nos. 524/59, 617/59, 596/59 and 789/60, Yearbook of the Convention, Vol. 6, pp. 696 to 706 and 730 to 732). The Applicant specified that he did not mean, however, to raise the slightest doubt as to the absolute conscientiousness with which the Court of Cassation fulfils its function or to suggest that the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department might attempt unduly to influence the court in any direction other than that of strict justice. In other words, Delcourt was not criticising persons but rather the institution which gave an advantage to the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department. Admittedly, the legislation in issue dated back for more than a century and a half and the Belgian Parliament had decided on two occasions that it did not need to amend it. The legislation, however, dated from a time of absolute monarchy and carried that stamp; furthermore, the incorporation of the Convention into the domestic law of a  necessarily \"kept bringing to light new controversial points which had not been noticed by the national legislature\".",

In actual fact, this highest court in  does not deal with the merits (fond) of cases (Article 95 of the Constitution and Section 17 of the Act of 4th August 1832); save in certain exceptional matters, irrelevant to this case, the Court of Cassation\u2019s sole function is to decide questions of law. The Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department is confined to assisting the Court in the exercise of its functions. That department does not, ordinarily, conduct prosecutions and it has not the character of a party (Article 37 of the Prince Sovereign\u2019s Decree of 15th March 1815). In almost all cases it is completely independent of the Minister of Justice and has no right of direction over the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department which is attached to the courts of first instance and appeal and which is the prosecuting authority in normal cases.

Established in the interests of the law itself, the Court of Cassation judges judgments and not persons, save in certain exceptional matters which are irrelevant to the present case. It is not therefore the function of that Court to decide disputes concerning civil rights and obligations or to determine criminal charges (d\u00e9cider, soit des contestations sur ses droits et obligations de caract\u00e8re civil, soit du bien-fond\u00e9 de toute accusation en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale) within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), as that provision has been interpreted in a series of decisions by the bodies set up to ensure the observance of the Convention.",

As a general rule, it has not the character of a party (Article 37 of the Decree of 15th March 1815); in the very rare cases where under the relevant law the department assumes the position of a party and institutes prosecutions the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral is not present at the deliberations (Article 39 of the Decree of 15th March 1815). As the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral is not concerned with the question of the guilt of the accused, he is neither their adversary nor the tool of the prosecution. For example, there is nothing to prevent him from submitting to the Court that an appeal in cassation brought by the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Appeal should be dismissed or from putting forward on his own initiative grounds for setting aside a conviction; and there are statistics to show that this is often the case. The Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department attached to the Court of Cassation is not, therefore, in alliance with the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department attached to the courts below; besides, the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation exercises, in practice, over that department supervision of a purely doctrinal and scientific nature without the least power of direction (Section 154 of the Act of 18th June 1869). Furthermore, the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation is entirely independent in his relations with the Minister of Justice.",

To sum up, the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to the Court of Cassation \"forms part of, and is identified with\", the Court like the judges. In these circumstances, the presence of one of the members of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the deliberations did not upset the \"equality of arms\" to the detriment of the Applicant. There was some inequality in this case but it worked to the advantage of Delcourt; unlike him, the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s departments attached to the lower courts whose decisions were challenged in cassation did not have an opportunity to put forward their arguments in open court on 21st June 1965 (Article 34 of the Decree of 15th March 1815); those departments did not even avail themselves of their right to reply in writing to the memorial filed by the appellant on 20th May 1965. In the Government\u2019s view, the Delcourt case cannot be compared with the Pataki and Dunshirn cases; the present case is closer to the Ofner and Hopfinger cases in which the Commission and the Committee of Ministers did not find any violation of Article 6 (art. 6).",

It has ruled that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does not apply to the procedure which regulates in  the examination of applications for provisional release (Neumeister judgment of 27th June 1968, \"As to the Law\" paragraphs 22 and 23; Matznetter judgment of 10th November 1969, \"As to the Law\" paragraph 13).

Article 95 of the Belgian Constitution provides that the Court of Cassation \"does not deal with the merits of the cases submitted to it\". Accordingly, in the Government\u2019s view there is not, strictly speaking, a prosecution or a defence before that Court: prosecution and defence cease to exist the moment that the judges dealing with the merits give judgment in final instance, subject to the possibility of their being reborn in the event of the Court of Cassation referring a case back to a lower court after quashing the decision attacked. For the rest, the Court of Cassation does not go into the substance of the offences alleged against accused persons and judges not persons but judgments in regard to which it confines itself to supervising their validity. That Court does not therefore determine criminal charges (\"bien-fond\u00e9 de toute accusation\").

He loses his status of a convicted person or, as the case may be, the benefit of his acquittal, at any rate provisionally, when a decision is set aside and the case is referred back to a trial court. A judgment in cassation sometimes has even more direct repercussions on the fate of an accused. If the highest court dismisses the appeal in cassation, the acquittal or conviction becomes final. If the Court of Cassation allows the appeal without ordering the case to be sent back, because, for example, the facts which led to the conviction do not constitute an offence known to the law (see Article 429 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the judicial decisions given thereon), then by its own sole decision it puts an end to the prosecution.",

The same names, such as Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department (minist\u00e8re public), are used to designate different institutions - which easily causes confusion. Moreover, the departments attached to the courts of first instance, of appeal and of cassation seem to constitute, in certain aspects, one single corps. Thus, Section 154 of the Act of 18th June 1869 (replaced recently by Article 400 of the 1967 Judicial Code) provides that the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation \"shall exercise supervision over the Procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux attached to the courts of appeal\", and it is only an examination of the practice which reveals that this supervision does not involve any power to intervene in the conduct of given cases but merely to give general opinions on matters of doctrine.",

The Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation sometimes acts as the moving party: the task, for example, falls to it sometimes to institute a prosecution or disciplinary proceedings against judges (see also Article 90 of the Constitution concerning the indictment of ministers on impeachment). Furthermore, its members are sometimes recruited from among the members of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the courts below. Therefore, some litigants may quite naturally be inclined to view as an adversary a Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral or an Avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral who submits that their appeals in cassation should be dismissed. They may be all the more inclined to do so when they find themselves deprived of any real debate before the highest court because the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Appeal only very rarely makes use of the right of reply \u2013 in any event restricted - which the law confers on it in proceedings in cassation. And one may imagine that such litigants can have a feeling of inequality if, after hearing a member of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation make, in open court, final submissions unfavourable to their pleas, they see him withdraw with the judges to attend the deliberations held in the privacy of chambers.",

It may be noted, moreover, that the Avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Justice of the European Communities, even though there are analogies between his functions and those of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Belgian Court of Cassation, does not take part in the deliberations.",

No doubt it is equally true that the officers of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the courts of first instance and appeal do not have the character of public accusers; indeed, Article 4 of Section VIII of the Decree of 16th-24th August 1790 so states expressis verbis.

The Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation, on the other hand, upholds a different interest, that which is concerned with the observance by the judges of the law and not with the establishment of the guilt or innocence of the accused.",

The Court is of the opinion that this is the case here. In this connection, the Court notes that on two occasions a parliament chosen in free elections has deliberately decided to maintain the system, the first time unchanged (preparatory work to the Act of 19th April 1949), the second time in substance and after studying the question in the context of the Convention (preparation of the new Judicial Code). Furthermore, the propriety and fairness of the rule laid down in Article 39 of the Decree of 15th March 1815 and then in Article 1109 of the 1967 Judicial Code - as it operates in practice - appears never to have been put in question by the legal profession or public opinion in .

These complaints thus also related to the role of the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department attached to the Court of Cassation and are intimately linked with the matters which formed the subject of Delcourt\u2019s original complaint accepted by the Commission in its decision of 6th April 1967; indeed, they were adduced by him essentially in support of that complaint.
