The case originated in an application (no. 33029/05) against the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, lodged with the Court, under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), by, at that time, a citizen of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr Slobodan Dorić (“the applicant”), on 13 September 2005.
As of 3 June 2006, following the Montenegrin declaration of independence,  remained the sole respondent in the proceedings before the Court.
The Government of the State Union of Serbia and  and, subsequently, the Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 6 December 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in .
On 30 June 1988 the , where the applicant was employed as a clerk, issued a decision leaving the applicant unassigned to a specific post, which ultimately resulted in his dismissal.
On 7 October 1988 the applicant thus filed a suit against the Municipality, seeking reinstatement and salary arrears.
On 24 January 1989 the  (Osnovni sud udruženog rada) in  ruled against the applicant, and by 18 May 1989 this decision became final.
The applicant subsequently twice requested the re-opening of the proceedings (podneo predlog za ponavljanje postupka), but to no avail.
On 13 January 1992 the applicant filed a third request of this sort and on 19 March 1996 the Fifth Municipal Court (Peti opštinski sud) in Belgrade (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”), to which the case had been transferred, finally decided to have his case re-opened.
Between 9 October 1997 and February 2004, the Municipal Court obtained four expert reports concerning the exact amount of salary arrears owed to the applicant, as well as the accrued statutory interest.
Following two remittals, on 4 July 2006 the Municipal Court rejected the applicant’s request for reinstatement, but partly granted his pecuniary claim.
On 27 June 2007 the District Court (Okružni sud) in  (“the District Court”) ordered the applicant’s reinstatement, but quashed the remainder of the judgment rendered at first instance and ordered a retrial.
On 6 March 2008 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Srbije) rejected the respondent’s appeal on points of law (revizija).
The proceedings before the Municipal Court thereafter continued in respect of the applicant’s pecuniary claim only. Following two additional expert reports which had been provided, on 28 June 2008 the Municipal Court again ruled partly in favour of the applicant.
On 17 July 2008 the respondent Municipality filed an appeal against this judgment. According to the information made available to the Court by the parties to date, the case is apparently still pending before the District Court.
