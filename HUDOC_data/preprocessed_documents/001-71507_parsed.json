Higher courts\u2019 power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (Ro\u015fca v. Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a025).",

Re-opening due to newly-discovered circumstances is not, as such, incompatible with the Convention. Moreover, Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 specifically permits the State to correct miscarriages of justice in criminal proceedings. However decisions to revise proceedings must be in accordance with the relevant statutory criteria and the misuse of such a procedure may well be contrary to the Convention, given that its result \u2013 the \u201closs\u201d of the judgment \u2013 is the same as that of a request for annulment.
