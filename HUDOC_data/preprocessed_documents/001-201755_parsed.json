On the date of her disappearance, late in the evening, he had received a telephone call from her. He had been drinking with his friends, and then, at night, he had arrived at Ms Mezhidova\u2019s block of flats and picked her up. He had driven with her to a side of the Staropromyslovskiy highway in Grozny and they had stayed in the car drinking alcohol. His two friends, Mr Zelemkhan M. and Mr Said-Emi A. had driven up in their car and they had all been chatting and drinking. Then he had driven away with Luiza Mezhidova for about twenty to thirty minutes, during which time she had told him that she loved him and complained of her relationship with her parents. Then they had had sex, after which she had asked him to marry her as she had not wanted to return to her parents. He had told her that he was already married and that he did not intend to divorce his wife. Then they had returned to the place where the car with Mr Zelemkhan M. and Mr\u00a0SaidEmi\u00a0A. was parked. After that he had driven Luiza Mezhidova to the taxi stand where there had been a taxi awaiting passengers \u2013 next to the traffic light at Mayakovskogo Street, on the Staropromyslovskiy highway. As he had been afraid to be seen with her and she had been very upset with him, he had not got out of the car when Luiza Mezhidova had got into the taxi. Then he and his two friends had driven to their respective homes. During the questioning, Ibragim M. also stated that contrary to the rumours, he had not killed his friend A., who had died as a result of mishandling a gun. He also confirmed that he had sometimes lent Luiza Mezhidova some money and that she had always repaid him. He further stated that he had been surprised to learn that she had gone missing as he had seen her on the night of her disappearance. According to Ibragim M., it was possible that she had had some other men in her life as she had \u201cliked drinking and quick to get into a sexual relationship\u201d.",
