According to this report, there were no signs of ill-treatment on his body (see paragraph 8 above). The Court is aware of the lack of details in this report.

In this connection, it is observed that the public prosecutor took statements from the eye-witnesses to the applicant's arrest for the first time in January 1997. In their statements the witnesses explained that they had seen the police officers who had beaten the applicant on 1\u00a0August 1996 and would be able to identify them if they met face to face. The Court further finds it remarkable that it was not until 23 March 1998, i.e. eighteen months after the alleged incident, that the \u0130stanbul Forensic Medicine Institute delivered its final report. At this point, it is important to note that when preparing this report, the Forensic Medicine Institute based itself solely on the medical report of 15 October 1996 given by the . Subsequently, while the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the four police officers, this was on 3 June 1998, almost two years after the incident. The witnesses were heard again by the \u0130stanbul Criminal Court on 9 February 1999 but neither the applicant nor the witnesses were given an opportunity to confront the accused officers in person. When the criminal court gave a decision of non-jurisdiction on 29\u00a0December 1999, the proceedings had already been pending for more than three years. In the resumed proceedings before the \u0130stanbul  in January 2000, the same witnesses and the accused police officers were once again heard before the . However, this time the witnesses explained that, although at the time of the events they had seen the police officers who had beaten the applicant, as a considerable time had passed they no longer felt that they would be able to recognise the officers, even if they met them in person. Having regard to all these facts, the Court cannot but conclude that the authorities failed to conduct the investigation with due expedition. Because of this delay, the applicant and his witnesses were deprived of the opportunity to meet the accused police officers face to face and identify them.",
