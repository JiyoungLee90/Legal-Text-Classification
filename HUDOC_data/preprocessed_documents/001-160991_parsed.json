He alleged that the conditions of his detention in the prisons where he had been held in the period after his conviction and until its review by the Supreme Court and in 2012 had been unacceptable. He further complained that the domestic courts had extended his pre-trial detention in his absence and had failed to provide him with copies of relevant orders. He also alleged that in 2010 the detention facility administration had interfered with his correspondence with his lawyer concerning his complaint against the police.

Nor had he complained to the SIZO medical staff upon admission to the SIZO on 9 December 2008, even though from that time on, he had no longer been under the control of the police and had had no reason to fear reprisals. The medical expert had noted that the injuries she had observed on the applicant on 6 December 2009 could have been inflicted on 30 November 2008. Moreover, in view of the results of the psychiatric examination, which the applicant had undergone during the pre-trial investigation, he could well have suffered the concussion before his arrest. The applicant and his defence counsel, having examined the medical expert\u2019s report of 6 December 2009 and the results of the psychiatric examination of 18 March 2009, had not raised any objections. The Government also questioned the applicant\u2019s allegation that the supposed reason for the alleged ill-treatment had been to extract a confession from him. They submitted that in the course of his trial, the applicant had never altered his account of the events at the victims\u2019 house which he had originally given to the police on 6 December 2008. In view of these considerations, the Government maintained that the applicant\u2019s complaint under the substantive limb of Article 3 was manifestly illfounded.",

Concerning the delay in raising his complaint, he submitted that even after he had been transferred from police custody to the SIZO he had continued to fear reprisals from the police because they had frequently taken him out of the SIZO and could have ill-treated him. For that reason, he had not started complaining of ill-treatment until the pre-trial investigation had been completed.

Given that the applicant admitted that he had tried to run away from the police and had fallen as a result, it is plausible that some of the injuries could also have been sustained on that occasion. In particular, the applicant could have suffered the bruises on his face and body and the concussion when he was tripped up to prevent him from fleeing, fell on the asphalt pavement and was subsequently restrained by the police officers.

The applicant had examined her report during the pre-trial investigation but neither he nor his counsel had raised any objections. The Government argued that the expert would not have been in a position to give an opinion as to the exact timing of the injuries at the court hearing, more than a year and three months after the examination had been conducted. As to the applicant\u2019s request to call the police officers as witnesses, the Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s allegations had already been examined within the framework of pre-investigation enquiries. The officers had also been questioned during the pre-trial investigation and the court had had the transcripts of those interviews at its disposal and had read them out in the course of the trial. It was not up to the court to conduct its own investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment, but the court could refuse to take into account any evidence it considered inadmissible. The court\u2019s refusal to call the witnesses indicated by the applicant had not, therefore, influenced the fairness of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Government maintained that there had been no violation of Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and 3\u00a0(d).",

Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused\u2019s behalf; its essential aim, as indicated by the words \u201cunder the same conditions\u201d, is full equality of arms in the matter. The task of the European Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings in issue, considered as a whole, were fair (see Vidal\u00a0v. Belgium, 25 March 1992, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 235-B). An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to his defence rights (see Guilloury v. France, no.\u00a062236/00, \u00a7 55, 22 June 2006). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them, as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Bricmont v. Belgium, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a089, Series A no. 158, and Destrehem v. France, no.\u00a056651/00, \u00a7 41, 18 May 2004).",

Ukraine, no. 17416/03, \u00a7 105, 31 October 2013), or if this testimony would be of other importance to his conviction (see, for example, Perna v.

While making this admission, the applicant always insisted that he had not stabbed N. and, indeed, had played a lesser role in attacking N. than his co-defendants.
