This period was marked by repeated referrals of the case for reconsideration between the courts at three levels of jurisdiction. During the last round of proceedings, however, the decisions were given by two levels of courts only. While the matter before the courts was of a certain complexity, in particular on account of contradictory evidence as regards the direct cause of Oleksandr Lanetskyy's death, the Court finds that the judicial examination featured certain delays, which cannot be explained by this complexity.",
