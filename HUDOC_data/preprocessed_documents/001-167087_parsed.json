Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 may not stop the authorities from reporting on ongoing criminal investigations (see Allenet de Ribemont v.\u00a0France, 10 February 1995, \u00a7\u00a038, Series A no. 308). The prosecutor had told the interviewer merely about facts found by the investigation. The article had not been an official statement; it merely continued a series of the newspaper\u2019s own reports on crime in the town. The prosecutor had been discreet and tactful.

But officials who talk to the media needed to be discreet and circumspect. The prosecutor had been convinced of the applicant\u2019s guilt as he had used statements of fact in his speech. There had been employed no phrase in the interview which could have made the readers question at least to some extent the applicant\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor\u2019s superiors had admitted that his comments had been unethical. It would have sufficed not to mention the names of the applicant and other persons in the interview, for instance by reducing them to their initials, just like it had been done in the first part of the same article.

The applicant does not complain under that provision, and under Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a02 the prosecutor\u2019s comment is an issue in itself. As the Government point out, prosecutors do not lose their freedom of speech by being prosecutors, the more so since their silence could create an information vacuum that might be filled by irresponsible sources. However, a prosecutor\u2019s words come from an authority and are particularly persuasive in the public\u2019s eye. The prosecutor\u2019s outspoken comments were clearly a declaration of the applicant\u2019s guilt which, firstly, encouraged the public to believe him guilty and, secondly, prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.",
