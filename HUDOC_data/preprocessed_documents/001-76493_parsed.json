They came because a large group of fighters, including casualties, had been detained. They were accompanied by journalists, including TV cameramen. They first visited the Alkhan-Kala hospital, where a large group of wounded fighters was found in the cellar. The cellar was dirty, the wounded were lying on the floor and there was a strong smell of decay. The soldiers deposited a large number of arms and ammunition collected from the fighters near the hospital. They then went to Alkhan-Kala\u2019s central square to see a convoy of three or four buses containing fighters, some of them wounded. The buses were blocked on all sides by army vehicles and guarded by servicemen, who had already disarmed the men inside. Local residents had gathered to watch behind the security cordon. When the senior officers approached the buses they noticed one of the fighters near the first bus, who had been talking to a reporter. He was wearing a new army camouflage jacket and behaved in an aggressive and provocative manner, trying to instigate the detainees and local residents to disobey. The witnesses suggested that he had been under the influence of narcotics. Some witnesses also noted that he was wounded in the hip. Colonel-General Baranov talked to the detainee and calmed him down using harsh words, saying that he should be shot. He also found identity documents, a compass and a map in his pocket. The soldiers then took the detainee away from the bus containing the other fighters and placed him next to a metal fence about five metres away, where he remained calmly for an hour or an hour and a half. Colonel-General Baranov and other army officers left Alkhan-Kala after about an hour and a half, and the detained fighters were left in the charge of the GUIN servicemen. The witnesses stressed that Baranov\u2019s words had not been regarded as an order, that Yandiyev had remained near the bus for a long time after the conversation and that, in any event, there had been far too many people around to issue or to carry out such an order. They also specified that most of the servicemen appearing in the videotape belonged to the Ministry of the Interior (OMON) or Ministry of Justice (GUIN) troops, and thus were not subordinate to a Colonel-General in the army. They denied that summary executions had taken place.",

The witness stated that he had concluded from the fighter\u2019s inadequate reaction that Yandiyev had been intoxicated, but as there was no smell of alcohol, he thought he might be under the influence of narcotics. The officer said that his harsh reaction had been caused by the detainee\u2019s dangerous conduct, which could have incited other fighters and the villagers to disobey. In his first witness statement Mr Baranov claimed that the video footage had been altered to omit the fighter\u2019s provocative statements. He stressed that the servicemen surrounding him were not his subordinates and thus could not have taken orders from him. In any event, nobody regarded his remarks as an order and Yandiyev was simply taken away from the bus and stood by the fence for a long time afterwards.

He was stopped by a group of armed men who ordered him to remove his belongings and to take the bus to the Alkhan-Kala hospital.

First of all, the Government do not deny that he was detained during a counter-terrorist operation in the  on 2 February 2000. Second, the videotape and numerous witness statements contained in the criminal investigation file confirm that he was interrogated by a senior military officer who, at the end of the interrogation, said that he should be executed. Whether these words were interpreted as a proper order within the chain of command is under dispute between the parties, but there can be no doubt that in the circumstances of the case the situation can be reasonably regarded as life-threatening for the detained person. Third, there has been no reliable news of the applicant\u2019s son since 2 February 2000. The evidence to the contrary in the case file, referred to by the Government, is very weak, since neither of the witnesses who claim to have seen Yandiyev after February 2000 knew him very well, and both merely allege that they caught a glimpse, from a distance, of a person who resembled him (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077-78 above). By contrast, his family, fellow students and other persons detained on the same day have not seen or heard of him since 2\u00a0February 2000. His name was not found in any of the detention facilities\u2019 records. Finally, the Government do not submit any plausible explanation as to what happened to Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev after his detention. The versions that he escaped or was killed during an ambush found no support during the investigation.",

The applicant was not questioned until January 2002, the military officers who had participated in Yandiyev\u2019s apprehension and other eye-witnesses were questioned only in autumn 2005 (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-62 above), other detainees and the bus driver were questioned between May 2004 and October 2005 (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-73 above), and the servicemen from the Ministry of Justice who had been responsible for guarding and transporting the detained persons were questioned in November 2005 (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a074 above). Most importantly, Colonel-General Baranov was questioned for the first time in June 2004, that is, four years and four months after the events in question and three years after the investigation had opened. In fact, it appears that most of the actions necessary for solving the crime occurred only after December 2003, when the applicant\u2019s complaint was communicated to the respondent Government. These delays alone compromised the effectiveness of the investigation and could not but have had a negative impact on the prospects of arriving at the truth. While accepting that some explanation for these delays can be found in the exceptional circumstances that have prevailed in  and to which the Government refer, the Court finds that in the present case they clearly exceeded any acceptable limitations on efficiency that could be tolerated in dealing with such a serious crime.",

The investigation failed to identify or question any servicemen or officers from these units. The information contained in the document of February 2005 relating to the discovery of bodies in mid-February 2000 was not pursued. Moreover, despite numerous indications to the contrary (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0110-111 above as to whether Yandiyev may be presumed dead), the investigation continued to pursue the version that he could have escaped from detention and remained at large.",

For more than six years she has not had any news of him. During this period the applicant has applied to various official bodies with inquiries about her son, both in writing and in person (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021-40 above). Despite her attempts, the applicant has never received any plausible explanation or information as to what became of Yandiyev following his detention on 2\u00a0February 2000. The responses received by the applicant mostly denied the State\u2019s responsibility for her son\u2019s detention and disappearance or simply informed her that an investigation was ongoing. The Court\u2019s findings under the procedural aspect of Article 2, set out above, are also relevant here (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0120-125), especially the fact that the criminal investigation into the disappearance started only one and a half year after the event.",

It has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see Kurt, \u00a7\u00a7 122-125, cited above; and, also cited above, \u00c7akici, \u00a7\u00a0104; Akdeniz and Others, \u00a7 106; \u00c7i\u00e7ek, \u00a7 164; and Orhan, \u00a7\u00a7 367-369).",

It appears that most of the detainees arrested on the same day were taken first to the \u201cfiltration point\u201d in Tolstoy-Yurt and then to several pre-trial detention centres. Yandiyev\u2019s detention was not logged in the relevant custody records and there exists no official trace of his subsequent whereabouts or fate. In accordance with the Court\u2019s practice, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee. Furthermore, the absence of detention records, noting such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see the above-cited judgments in Kurt, \u00a7\u00a0125; Timurta\u015f, \u00a7\u00a0105; \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131, \u00a7\u00a0105; \u00c7i\u00e7ek, \u00a7\u00a0165; and Orhan, \u00a7\u00a0371).",

However, its reasoning and findings in relation to Article 2 above, in particular as concerns the delays in the opening and conducting of the investigation, leave no doubt that the authorities failed to take prompt and effective measures to safeguard Yandiyev against the risk of disappearance. Moreover, the Court notes that as late as December 2000 the authorities continued to deny the involvement of federal servicemen in Yandiyev\u2019s apprehension (see \u00a7\u00a7\u00a025-26 above).",
