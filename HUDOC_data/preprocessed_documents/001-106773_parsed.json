When they eventually started ordinary proceedings, the proceedings before the LAB had been suspended, and resumed only following the  judgment in 2009. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, the delay in the proceedings before the LAB had been caused by the owners, who had instituted other proceedings only after the LAB proceedings had been initiated, although nothing had prevented them from doing so before. Moreover, it had taken the owners twelve years to produce their evidence to contest the amount of compensation offered.

The Government submitted that in 1974 when the land was expropriated, the area was still rural in nature and considered as agricultural land of little value. Thus, it could not be said that the applicant suffered a disproportionate burden, particularly in the light of the fact that following the Government\u2019s development programme, the part of the applicant\u2019s land which was returned to the owners had substantially increased in value.",

Thus, the sum to be awarded by the LAB would be fixed with reference to the value as on 19 January 1999, with interest calculated from 1974 to the date of payment. Therefore, in the present case the value of the land had not been pegged to the value in 1974 as had been the case in Schembri and Others v. Malta (no. 42583/06, 10 November 2009), where the Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Given that land prices in  in 1999 were not low, the applicant should therefore receive adequate compensation for the interference suffered. They noted that the present case did not concern an expropriation which had been unlawful; therefore, under the Court\u2019s case-law it did not merit current market value compensation. Moreover, the applicant together with the other owners had been awarded EUR 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage by the domestic courts.",

The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property.

In\u00a0particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos.\u00a046720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, ECHR 2005-VI, \u00a7\u00a091; Immobiliare Saffi v.

The Court also reiterates that in the area of land development and town planning the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their town and country planning policies. Nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review the Court must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the individual\u2019s right of property (see Abdilla v. Malta (dec.), no 38244/03, 3\u00a0November 2005).",

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01 only in exceptional circumstances (see The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 71, Series A no. 301-A ). However, while it is true that in many cases of lawful expropriation only full compensation can be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances. Legitimate objectives in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, such as those pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v.

The same applies to abnormally lengthy delays in administrative or judicial proceedings in which such compensation is determined, especially when people whose land has been expropriated are obliged to resort to such proceedings in order to obtain the compensation to which they are entitled (see Aka v.

San Marino (no. 40786/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2004VIII), which concerned property that had been lawfully expropriated but not used, the Court found that the partial use of expropriated land raised an issue as to respect for property rights, having regard in particular to the change in use following the approval of a new land-use plan. A similar situation obtained in the cases of Ke\u00e7ecio\u011flu and Others v. Turkey (no. 37546/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 8 April 2008) and Motais de Narbonne v. France (no. 48161/99, \u00a7 19, 2 July 2002). In the latter case the Court found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of a significant delay between a decision to expropriate property and the actual undertaking of a project in the public interest which had formed the basis of the expropriation. While the placing in reserve of expropriated property, even for a long period of time, does not necessarily entail a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, there is clearly an issue under that provision where such an action is not itself based on public-interest grounds and where, during that period, the property in question generates a significant increase in value of which the former owners are deprived (ibid, \u00a7 21).",

While acknowledging that a certain delay may occur when undertaking projects of a certain size the Court cannot consider reasonable a delay of nearly three decades in concretising the plans. In the present case, the Government have not advanced any other argument capable of justifying this delay; in consequence, it cannot be said that the delay was itself based on any public-interest concern (see Motais de Narbonne, cited above, \u00a7 22, in fine). The Court considers that it is undisputable that the land has generated an increase in value of which the owners have been deprived (see Motais de Narbonne, cited above, \u00a7 22).

Without prejudice to the effectiveness of an action under the Civil Code \u2013 an action of a general nature and in respect of which the Government have not produced any evidence in relation to its prospects of success (see, mutatis mutandis, Horvat v. Croatia, no.\u00a051585/99, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 2001VIII, and Marini v. Albania, no. 3738/02, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2007XIV (extracts)) - the Court considers that, in such cases, owners could not be expected to incur the expense and burden of instituting proceedings to ensure the authorities\u2019 fulfilment of their legal obligation (see, mutatis mutandis, Apostol v. , no. 40765/02, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, ECHR 2006XI, in relation to enforcement proceedings). Moreover, the mere fact that the Government would have been forced by means of a court decision to initiate proceedings, would not guarantee that those proceedings would thereafter be pursued with due diligence. Indeed, the Court has previously found a violation of the reasonable time requirement in relation to LAB proceedings in the Maltese context (see, Bezzina Wettinger, cited above, \u00a7 93; and Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq v. Malta, no. 26771/07, \u00a7 43, 5 April 2011). The Court observes, in this context, that the applicant\u2019s case is still pending, twelve years after the institution of proceedings before the LAB to determine the relevant compensation. The Government imputed this latter delay to the fact that ordinary and constitutional proceedings were eventually taken up by the owners, and in consequence the proceedings before the LAB were suspended. At the same time the Government also argued that it had taken the owners twelve years to produce the relevant evidence. The Court is unconvinced by this argument, it reiterates that the judicial authorities remain responsible for the conduct of the proceedings before them and ought to weigh the advantages of continued adjournments pending the outcome of other cases against the requirement of promptness (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri, cited above, \u00a7 43). More importantly, the Court considers that the owners cannot be held to blame (as submitted by the Government) for having eventually made use of their right to institute proceedings, under civil and constitutional law, to safeguard their property rights in view of the authorities\u2019 inaction and/or on the merits of the taking itself. Thus, the Court finds that the Government\u2019s argument cannot be accepted.",
