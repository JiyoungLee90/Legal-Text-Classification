In its judgment of 16 July 2012, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional and consequently annulled the provisions on the compulsory retirement age of judges (sections 90(ha) and 230 of the 2011 Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Act) as of 1\u00a0January 2012 (the date of entry into force of the Act). The Constitutional Court held that the new regulation violated the constitutional requirements for judicial independence on both \u201cformal\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d grounds. From a formal perspective, a cardinal Act ought to determine the length of judicial service and the retirement age, in order to guarantee the irremovability of judges. Reference to the \u201cgeneral retirement age\u201d in an ordinary Act did not fulfil that requirement. With regard to the substantive unconstitutionality of the provision, the new regulation had resulted in the removal of judges within a short period of three months. Notwithstanding the relative freedom of the legislature to determine the maximum age of serving judges, and the fact that no specific age can be deduced from the Fundamental Law, the Constitutional Court held that the introduction of a lowered retirement age for judges had to be done gradually, with an appropriate transition period and without violating the principle of the irremovability of judges. The greater the difference between the new retirement age and the age of 70\u00a0years, the longer the transitional period required for introducing a lower retirement age. Otherwise, the irremovability of judges, which constituted an essential element of the independence of the judiciary, would be violated.",

XX of 2013, which repealed section 230, amended section 91 and added section 233/C to Law no.\u00a0CLXII of 2011, with effect from 2\u00a0April 2013. Under the modified scheme, the reduction of the compulsory retirement age to a unified limit of 65 years will be effective as of 1\u00a0January 2023. Transitional provisions apply to the period between 2\u00a0April 2013 (the entry into force of the amendment) and 31\u00a0December 2022. During this interval, the age-limit for compulsory retirement will vary between 70 and 65 years, according to the date of birth of the person concerned (the older a judge is, the longer the preparation time accorded to him or her before compulsory retirement). For those judges who had already been affected by the rules of compulsory retirement and forced to retire, the new law introduced the possibility of choosing, within a 30-day time-limit to be calculated from the amendment\u2019s entry into force, from three options. Firstly, they could request a stand-by post at the court from which they had retired, meaning that they would receive the difference between their pension allowance and 80% of their last basic salary (that is, calculated without the additional allowances received for holding senior positions, and so forth) and that, once in every three-year period, they may be ordered to perform judicial or managerial tasks for a maximum of two years. Secondly, they could apply to be reinstated to their normal judicial service. In that case, they would also be entitled to salary arrears for the period of their unconstitutionally ordered retirement. However, they could not be reinstated to their previous senior positions, such as court president (vice-president) or head of division (deputy head of division), unless that position had not been filled in the meantime. Thirdly, those who did not request reinstatement or placement in a stand-by post were entitled to lump-sum compensation, equal to one year\u2019s salary.",

According to different sources, this provision entails that around 300 of the most experienced judges will be obliged to retire within a year. Correspondingly, around 300 vacancies will need to be filled. This may undermine the operational capacity of the courts and affect continuity and legal security and might also open the way for undue influence on the composition of the judiciary.

It seems that the labour courts have started to reinstate the retired judges. The Venice Commission\u2019s delegation has however learned that the implementation of this judgment has resulted in considerable legal uncertainty. While the legal basis of early retirement was annulled with ex tunc effect, the individual resolutions of the President of Hungary, which dismissed some ten per cent of the Hungarian judges, are considered to remain in force, even if their legal basis had ceased to exist. The President of Hungary did not repeal them.

These new provisions are widely seen as being solely adopted to dismiss the sitting President of the Supreme Court, Mr Baka, who in the past had been critical of the government\u2019s policies of judicial reform and who had successfully challenged a number of government decisions and laws before the Constitutional Court. Mr Baka was the Hungarian Judge to the European Court of Human Rights from 1991 to 2007, and was elected President of the Supreme Court by the Hungarian parliament in June 2009. Mr Baka had not previously served a five year term as a judge in Hungary, and was therefore, despite his 17 years of experience as a judge on the ECHR, ineligible for the post of President of the Curia. The widespread perception that these legal provisions were adopted against a specific person is strengthened by the fact that, in June 2011, the parliament adopted a decision that suspended all appointment procedures for judges until 1 January 2012, when Mr Baka would no longer be in office. This despite the backlog in cases that is often mentioned by the authorities as one of the underlying reasons for the reform of the judiciary. As mentioned by the Venice Commission, generally formulated legal provisions that are in reality directed against a specific person or persons are contrary to the rule of law. In addition the politically motivated dismissal of the President of a Supreme Court could have a chilling effect that could threaten the independence of the judiciary.\u201d",

In its judgment of 6\u00a0November 2012 in Commission v. Hungary, C-286/12, EU:C:2012:687, the CJEU declared that by adopting a national scheme requiring the compulsory retirement of judges, prosecutors and notaries when they reach the age of 62 \u2013 giving rise to a difference in treatment on grounds of age which was not proportionate as regards the objectives pursued \u2013 Hungary had failed to fulfil its obligations under Council Directive 2000/78/EC (see paragraph 65 above). The CJEU observed that the categories of persons concerned by the provisions in issue benefited, until their entry into force, from a derogation allowing them to remain in office until the age of\u00a070, which gave rise, in those persons, to a well-founded expectation that they would be able to remain in office until that age.

The Committee also notes that presidential decree of 24 January 1997 No. 106 was not based on the replacement of the Constitutional Court with a new court but that the decree referred to the author in person and the sole reason given in the presidential decree for the dismissal of the author was stated as the expiry of his term as Constitutional Court judge, which was manifestly not the case. Furthermore, no effective judicial protections were available to the author to contest his dismissal by the executive. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the author\u2019s dismissal from his position as a judge of the Constitutional Court, several years before the expiry of the term for which he had been appointed, constituted an attack on the independence of the judiciary and failed to respect the author\u2019s right of access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.

The Committee notes in this regard that the Minister of Justice, in his statement of June 1999 ..., and the Attorney-General of the Republic, in the report by the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office of 19 September 2000 ... recognize that the established procedures and safeguards for dismissal were not respected. Furthermore, the Committee considers that the circumstances referred to in Presidential Decree No. 144 could not be accepted by it in this specific case as grounds justifying the fact that the dismissal measures were in conformity with the law and, in particular, with Article 4 of the Covenant. The Presidential Decree merely refers to specific circumstances without, however, specifying the nature and extent of derogations from the rights provided for in domestic legislation and in the Covenant and without demonstrating that these derogations are strictly required and how long they are to last. Moreover, the Committee notes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo failed to inform the international community that it had availed itself of the right of derogation, as stipulated in Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. In accordance with its jurisprudence, the Committee recalls, moreover, that the principle of access to public service on general terms of equality implies that the State has a duty to ensure that it does not discriminate against anyone. This principle is all the more applicable to persons employed in the public service and to those who have been dismissed. With regard to Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant, the Committee notes the absence of any reply from the State party and also notes, on the one hand, that the authors did not benefit from the guarantees to which they were entitled in their capacity as judges and by virtue of which they should have been brought before the Supreme Council of the Judiciary in accordance with the law, and on the other hand, that the President of the Supreme Court had publicly, before the case had been heard, supported the dismissals that had taken place ... thus damaging the equitable hearing of the case. Consequently, the Committee considers that those dismissals constitute an attack on the independence of the judiciary protected by Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. The dismissal of the authors was ordered on grounds that cannot be accepted by the Committee as a justification of the failure to respect the established procedures and guarantees that all citizens must be able to enjoy on general terms of equality. In the absence of a reply from the State party, and inasmuch as the Supreme Court, by its ruling of 26 September 2001, has deprived the authors of all remedies by declaring their appeals inadmissible on the grounds that Presidential Decree No. 144 constituted an act of Government, the Committee considers that, in this specific case, the facts show that there has been a violation of Article 25, paragraph (c), read in conjunction with Article 14, paragraph 1, on the independence of the judiciary, and of Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant.\u201d",

A procedure is not objective or reasonable if it does not respect the requirements of basic procedural fairness. The Committee also considers that the right of equal access to public service includes the right not to be arbitrarily dismissed from public service. The Committee notes the author\u2019s claim that the procedure leading to his dismissal was neither objective nor reasonable. Despite numerous requests, he did not receive a copy of the proceedings from his first hearing before the JSC [Judicial Service Commission] on 18 November 1998; this is confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of 6 September 2004, and is not contested by the State party. Nor did he receive the findings of the Committee of Inquiry, on the basis of which he was dismissed by the JSC. The decision of the Court of Appeal confirms that these documents were never provided to him, in accordance with the express provision of Rule 18 of the JSC rules.",

In the case of Rever\u00f3n Trujillo v. Venezuela, the Court emphasized that judges, unlike other public officials, enjoy specific guarantees due to the independence required of the judiciary, which the Court has understood as \u2018essential for the exercise of the judiciary.\u2019 The Court has reiterated that one of the main objectives of the separation of public powers is to guarantee the independence of judges. The purpose of protection is to ensure that the judicial system in general, and its members in particular, are not subject to possible undue restrictions in the exercise their duties by bodies outside the Judiciary, or even by judges who exercise functions of review or appeal. In line with the case law of this Court and of the European Court of Human Rights, and in accordance with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary (hereinafter \u2018Basic Principles\u2019), the following guarantees are derived from judicial independence: an appropriate process of appointment, guaranteed tenure and guarantees against external pressures.",

This Court has accepted these principles and has stated that the authority responsible for the process of removing a judge must act independently and impartially in the procedure established for that purpose and must allow for the exercise of the right to defense. This is so because the free removal of judges raises the objective doubt of the observer regarding the judges\u2019 real possibilities of ruling on specific disputes without fear of reprisals.",

However, it is important to point out that judicial independence should not only be analyzed in relation to justiciable matters, given that the judge must have a series of guarantees that allow for judicial independence. The Court considers it pertinent to specify that the violation of the guarantee of judicial independence, as it relates to a judge\u2019s tenure and stability in his position, must be examined in light of the conventional rights of a judge who is affected by a State decision that arbitrarily affects the term of his appointment. In that sense, the institutional guarantee of judicial independence is directly related to a judge\u2019s right to remain in his post, as a consequence of the guarantee of tenure in office.",

The Court deems it pertinent to point out that the objective dimension is related to essential aspects for the Rule of Law, such as the principle of separation of powers, and the important role played by the judiciary in a democracy. Consequently, this objective dimension transcends the figure of the judge and collectively affects society as a whole.

It noted that the criterion introduced in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no.\u00a063235/00, ECHR 2007II) in respect of the applicability of Article 6 to disputes concerning civil servants was indistinguishable from the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint under this provision (access to a court). It therefore joined the issue of its competence ratione materiae to the merits (see paragraph\u00a071 of the Chamber judgment). In applying the test introduced in the above-mentioned judgment (hereafter \u201cthe Vilho Eskelinen test\u201d), the Chamber observed that under Hungarian law judges of the Supreme Court, including their president, were not expressly excluded from the right of access to a court. In fact, domestic law expressly provided for the right to a court in the event of dismissal of a court executive (see paragraph 74 of the Chamber judgment). Rather than by express exclusion, the applicant\u2019s access to a court had been impeded by the fact that the impugned measure \u2013 the premature termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court \u2013 had been written into the new Constitution itself and had therefore not been subject to any form of judicial review, including by the Constitutional Court. In those circumstances, the nature of the impugned measure itself rendered the applicant\u2019s access to a court impossible \u201cin practice\u201d (see paragraph 75 of the Chamber judgment). Therefore, it could not be concluded that the national law had \u201cexpressly excluded access to a court\u201d for the applicant\u2019s claim. The first condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test had not been met and Article\u00a06 applied under its civil head (see paragraph 76 of the Chamber judgment).",

He considered that none of the conditions of the test that would render Article\u00a06 inapplicable to his dispute had been met. As regards the first condition, an implied bar was not enough; the national law must expressly exclude access to a court for a certain post or category of staff, and that exclusion must be of an abstract nature, that is, it must concern all office holders and not a specified person. The impugned legislative act terminating his mandate concerned him alone. Hungarian law, rather than excluding access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, expressly ensured that a court executive had the right of access to a court in the event of his or her dismissal. Furthermore, the impugned measure terminating his mandate was unforeseeable and of an abusive nature. As regards the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test, the applicant\u2019s legal status, far from being incomparable with that of the other court executives, did not involve any special exercise of discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty to an extent that would justify the exclusion of his access to a court in relation to his dismissal. Although he performed some special tasks within the judiciary (coordination, guidance and advocacy, aimed at the continuous development of the judiciary), from the perspective of the separation of powers he did not have a stronger \u201cbond of trust and loyalty\u201d with the State than his colleagues.

They maintained that the Vilho Eskelinen test was intended for cases which did not concern the right of access to a court but rather the applicability of the procedural guarantees provided for by Article 6 \u00a7 1. In any event, they were of the opinion that the two cumulative conditions of the test had been met, rendering Article\u00a06 inapplicable. Firstly, contrary to the conclusions of the Chamber judgment (see paragraph\u00a075 of the Chamber judgment), the nature of the impugned measure itself had rendered the applicant\u2019s access to a court impossible not \u201cin practice\u201d, but \u201cin law\u201d. It would be unreasonable to expect the legislature to enact a provision expressly excluding access to a court in respect of measures that are obviously and undisputedly not subject to any form of judicial review. As regards the second condition, the applicant\u2019s post involved by its very nature the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State (the Government referred to Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 9 July 2002, concerning the President of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic; and Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11\u00a0December 2007, and Nazsiz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22412/05, 26\u00a0May 2009, both concerning public prosecutors). If public prosecutors had been found by the Court to fall within the category of public servants exercising discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty, it was surprising that the President of the Supreme Court of Hungary, whose privileges were regulated among those of the highest-ranking public officials, had not been found by the Chamber to fall into that category. In the light of the constitutional status of the President of the Supreme Court, it seemed to be quite arbitrary to conclude that the termination of his mandate was not linked to the exercise of State power to at least the same extent as termination of the employment of public prosecutors.",

This special role must accordingly be given significant weight in assessing any restrictions imposed by the other branches of the State on Convention rights applicable to judges. In order to preserve the special role of the judiciary, the Convention should be interpreted in a manner that limits the scope for the executive or legislative branch to justify the imposition of restrictions on Article 6 rights of judges in employment disputes on grounds of legitimate interest. The power exercised by a judge, although quintessentially of a public nature, is both structurally and inherently distinct from that of public servants of the executive or legislature. The International Commission of Jurists submitted that under the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test it would rarely, if ever, be objectively justifiable in the public interest for the executive or legislative branches to impose measures excluding the application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to employment disputes involving judges, particularly in those cases that affected judicial independence, and, therefore, the separation of powers and the rule of law.

Following the functional criterion adopted in Pellegrin, employment disputes involving posts in the judiciary were excluded from the scope of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 because, although the judiciary was not part of the ordinary civil service, it was nonetheless considered part of typical public service (see Pitkevich v.

According to these criteria, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant\u2019s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State\u2019s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a \u201cspecial bond of trust and loyalty\u201d between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article\u00a06 applies. It will be for the Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a062).",

The rules governing the tenure of the President of the Supreme Court were contained not in the 1949 Constitution but, during its term of validity until 31\u00a0December 2011, in Law no. LXVI of 1997 \u2013 the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act (see paragraphs 40-43 above). Section 62 of that Act listed the president of a court among the so-called \u201ccourt executives\u201d, that is, judges responsible for the management and administration of courts. Since the applicant was elected President of the Supreme Court under Article 48 \u00a7\u00a01 of the 1949 Constitution, he became a \u201ccourt executive\u201d. Under section 69 of the 1997 Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act, court executives were appointed for six years, with the undisputed consequence that the applicant\u2019s term of office as President of the Supreme Court should in principle have been six years (from 22 June 2009 until 22\u00a0June 2015). Section 73 of the Act contained an exhaustive list of reasons for terminating the mandates of court executives (mutual agreement, resignation, dismissal, expiry of the period of the term of office and termination of the person\u2019s judicial office). As this provision indicates, unless a term of office was terminated on the ground of its expiry or that the person\u2019s judicial mandate had come to an end (sub-sections (d) and (e)), the only permissible grounds were mutual agreement, resignation or dismissal (sub-sections (a) to (c)). Furthermore, as regards the latter, pursuant to section 74/A(1), the only possible ground for dismissal was demonstrable incompetence in performing the managerial position, in which event the incumbent was entitled to seek judicial review of the dismissal before the Service Tribunal (see paragraph 43 above). It thus transpires from the terms of the said provisions that there existed a right for an office holder to serve a term of office until such time as it expired, or until his or her judicial mandate came to an end. This is further shown by the fact that, should the office be terminated at an earlier stage against that person\u2019s consent, namely by way of dismissal, he or she would have standing to apply for judicial review of that decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Zander v. Sweden, 25\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a024, Series A no. 279B).",

For instance, in Suk\u00fct, cited above, concerning the early retirement of an army officer on disciplinary grounds, Turkish constitutional law clearly specified that the decisions of the Supreme Military Council were not subject to judicial review.

In Nedeltcho Popov, cited above, a provision of the Bulgarian Labour Code clearly provided that the domestic courts did not have jurisdiction to review disputes regarding dismissals from certain posts in the Council of Ministers, including the post held by the applicant (chief adviser). Although that restriction was later declared unconstitutional (with no retroactive effect), the Court noted that \u201cat the time of the applicant\u2019s dismissal\u201d he did not have a right of access to a court under national law to bring an action for unfair dismissal (ibid., \u00a7\u00a038).",

The proposals to terminate his mandate and the new eligibility criterion for the post of President of the K\u00faria had all been submitted to Parliament after the applicant had publicly expressed his views on a number of legislative reforms, and had been adopted within an extremely short time (see paragraph 94 of the Chamber judgment).

The early termination of his mandate thus constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression (see paragraph 97 of the judgment).",

Issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constituted questions of public interest, the debate of which enjoyed the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. It had been not only the applicant\u2019s right but also his duty as President of the National Council of Justice to express his opinion on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary. As regards the proportionality of the interference, the applicant\u2019s term of office as President of the Supreme Court had been terminated three and a half years before the end of the fixed term applicable under the legislation in force at the time of his election. The Chamber reiterated that the fear of sanction had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the exercise of freedom of expression and, in particular, risked discouraging judges from making critical remarks about public institutions or policies (see paragraph 101 of the judgment). In addition, the impugned measure had not been subject to effective judicial review by the domestic courts.

There was a unanimous perception at both national and international level that a causal link existed between the expression of his opinion on the legislative reforms in question and the legislative measures entailing his premature removal. The chain of events and the very significant amount of evidence furnished by him all supported that causal link. The interviews given by the two members of the parliamentary majority and the Government\u2019s assurances to the Venice Commission all pre-dated the applicant\u2019s speech in Parliament on 3\u00a0November 2011, after which the proposals to terminate his mandate and to abolish his post-term allowances had been submitted. The alleged link between the changes affecting the Supreme Court on the one hand, and the termination of his mandate on the other, had merely been created subsequently by the Government as a pretext. The applicant noted in this regard that none of the proposals for the termination of his mandate were supported by an explanatory memorandum justifying the measure in question by the fundamental changes in the functions and tasks of the supreme judicial authority. They referred only to the entry into force of the new Fundamental Law, which could hardly be seen as a sufficient and acceptable reason in the circumstances of the case. In any event, both the functions of the new K\u00faria and the role of its president remained essentially the same. The fact that the managerial tasks attached to the position of the President of the National Council of Justice, which was accessorial to that of the President of the Supreme Court, had been taken away, affected in no way whatsoever the validity of his election to the presidency of the supreme judicial body.",

Such a change could not justify in itself the termination of the fixed-term mandate of any court president. But even if the function of the Supreme Court had changed, transitional measures should have provided him with the possibility of serving his term of office in full (he referred, on this point, to the judgment of the CJEU of 8 April 2014 in Commission v. Hungary on the premature removal of the former Hungarian data-protection supervisor, see paragraph 70 above, which should apply a fortiori to a Supreme Court president). He pointed out that in a democratic society governed by the rule of law no reconsideration, either by the legislature or by the executive, of the suitability of any elected judicial official could be allowed before the expiry of the term of office (without prejudice to the legally provided grounds for dismissal or revocation). Furthermore, the only purpose of introducing the new eligibility criterion (five years of judicial service) had been to provide justification for his removal, albeit retroactively. To support his version of the events, the applicant referred to several statements in the Hungarian and international press, as well as to reports by international institutions (notably the Venice Commission).",

The fact that the public expression of his opinions pre-dated the termination of his mandate was not sufficient to prove that there was a causal relationship between them. The applicant\u2019s mandate had been terminated because of the fundamental changes in the functions of the supreme judicial authority in Hungary. The function to which he had been elected (comprising a mixture of administrative and judicial functions) had ceased to exist upon the entry into force of the new Fundamental Law of Hungary. His activities had been mostly connected with the functions of the President of the National Council of Justice, which had been separated from the functions of the President of the K\u00faria. In addition, the functions and competences of the K\u00faria itself had also been changed and broadened (it had been given a new power to supervise the legality of local-government regulations, and new tasks in securing the consistency of the case-law). Relying on the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 19 March 2013 concerning the termination of the mandate of the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 55 above), the Government noted that the major changes in the functions of the President of the K\u00faria as compared to the President of the Supreme Court justified the reconsideration of the applicant\u2019s suitability for the post of administrative head of the K\u00faria, having regard to his professional expertise and previous professional career.",

The third party referred to the international and comparative-law standards on judicial independence and irremovability of judges, including presidents of courts. In this respect, for instance, the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic had in a judgment of 11 July 2006 interpreted the principle of judicial irremovability as protecting against arbitrary removal from high judicial office and held that the Constitution required that court presidents and deputy court presidents could be removed only \u201con the grounds foreseen in the law and on the basis of a decision of a court\u201d. The Constitutional Court had reiterated this principle in a judgment of 6\u00a0October 2010, in which it had stated that \u201c[i]t is not possible to construct a duality in the legal position of the chairman of a court as an official of State administration, on one hand, and judge, on the other hand.

The possible scope for limitations to the right to freedom of expression of civil servants, as established in Vogt v. Germany (26 September 1995, Series A no. 323), should, when applied to judges, be interpreted in the light of the specific role of the judiciary as an independent branch of State power, in accordance with the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law. Provided that the dignity of judicial office was upheld and the essence and appearance of independence and impartiality of the judiciary not undermined, the State should therefore respect and protect the right and duty of judges to express their opinions, particularly in matters concerning the administration of justice and respect for and protection of judicial independence and of the rule of law.",

The Court observed that, in that letter, the Prince had criticised the content of the applicant\u2019s public lecture on the powers of the Constitutional Court and announced the intention to sanction him because of his opinion on certain questions of constitutional law. The Court therefore concluded that Article\u00a010 was applicable and that there had been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression. Similarly, in Kudeshkina (cited above), the Court observed that the decision to bar the applicant from holding judicial office had been prompted by her statements to the media. Neither the applicant\u2019s eligibility for public service nor her professional ability to exercise judicial functions formed part of the arguments before the domestic authorities. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not to the holding of a public post in the administration of justice, the right to which is not secured by the Convention (see Kudeshkina, \u00a7\u00a7 79-80; see also, as regards the disciplinary dismissal of a public prosecutor, Kayasu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 7781).",

In Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above, the Court considered that the Government\u2019s proposal to dismiss the applicant as President of the Supreme Court (based on a report by the Minister of Justice) essentially related to the applicant\u2019s ability to exercise his functions, that is, to the appraisal of his professional qualifications and personal qualities in the context of his activities and attitudes relating to State administration of the Supreme Court. The report submitted by the Minister of Justice referred, among other things, to the applicant\u2019s failure to initiate the dismissal of a Supreme Court judge who had attacked an official of the Ministry of Justice and to his alleged failure to apply professional criteria when proposing candidates to fill the posts at the Supreme Court. Although it also referred to the views expressed by the applicant on a draft amendment to the Constitution (raising concerns about the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary), the documents before the Court did not indicate that the proposal to remove the applicant was \u201cexclusively or preponderantly prompted by those views\u201d. Similarly, in the Harabin judgment (cited above), it was the applicant\u2019s professional behaviour in the context of the administration of justice which represented the essential aspect of the case. The disciplinary proceedings against him (after refusing to allow an audit by Ministry of Finance staff that he considered should have been conducted by the Supreme Audit Office) related to the discharge of his duties as President of the Supreme Court, and therefore lay within the sphere of his employment in the civil service. Furthermore, the disciplinary offence of which he had been found guilty did not involve any statements or views expressed by him in the context of a public debate. The Court accordingly concluded that the disputed measure did not constitute an interference with Article 10 rights and declared the relevant complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0150-53).",

In order to answer that question, the scope of the measure must be determined by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation (see Wille, cited above, \u00a7 43). Having regard to the facts of the present case and the nature of the allegations made, the Court considers that this issue should be examined in the light of the general principles emerging from its case-law on the assessment of evidence. It reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. The Court\u2019s role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005-VII). The Court adopts those conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts in their entirety and from the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (ibid.). It has been the Court\u2019s practice to allow flexibility in this respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved. In certain instances, only the Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting the applicant\u2019s allegations; consequently, a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti, non neganti, incumbit probatio is impossible (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no.\u00a055723/00, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR 2005IV). Although these principles have mainly been applied in the context of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see Akta\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a024351/94, \u00a7 79, 24\u00a0April 2003, and ElMasri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no.\u00a039630/09, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a015152, ECHR 2012), the Court observes that there are examples in which they have been applied in respect of other Convention rights (Article\u00a05 in Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a088-90, 23\u00a0February 2012; Article 8 in Fadeyeva, cited above; Article 11 in Makhmudov v.

It notes at the outset that the applicant, in his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice, publicly expressed his views on various legislative reforms affecting the judiciary. On 12 February 2011 the applicant\u2019s spokesperson explained to a newspaper the concerns felt by the applicant in relation to the Nullification Bill ordering the annulment of final convictions (see paragraph\u00a016 above). On 24\u00a0March 2011 he delivered a speech in Parliament on certain aspects of the draft version of the new Fundamental Law of Hungary (see paragraph 18 above). On 7 April 2011 the applicant, together with other court presidents, addressed a letter to the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister in which they criticised the proposal in the draft version of the Fundamental Law of Hungary to reduce the mandatory retirement age of judges (see paragraph 19 above). On 11\u00a0April 2011 the applicant addressed a letter to the Prime Minister in which he again criticised the proposal on the retirement age of judges, stressing that the proposal was humiliating and that it infringed the principles of the independence and irremovability of judges (see paragraph\u00a020 above). On 14\u00a0April 2011 the applicant in his capacity as President of the National Council of Justice, together with the plenary of the Supreme Court and other court presidents, issued a public communiqu\u00e9 criticising again the new retirement age of judges, as well as the proposal to modify the National Council of Justice (see paragraph 21 above). In their communiqu\u00e9, they expressed the view that the new retirement age had been regulated in the Fundamental Law to avoid any possibility of judicial review by the Constitutional Court, and suggested that there had been political motivation behind that approach. On 4 August 2011 the applicant challenged certain new legislation on judicial proceedings before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 22 above). On 3 November 2011 the applicant delivered another speech before Parliament, in which he raised his concerns about the proposal to replace the National Council of Justice by an external administration (the National Judicial Office) entrusted with the management of the courts (see paragraph 23 above). In his speech, the applicant strongly criticised the proposal, and stated that the new body would have \u201cexcessive\u201d, \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and \u201cuncontrollable\u201d powers. The applicant again criticised the new retirement age of judges, stating that it would have a severe effect on the Supreme Court.",

On 6 July 2011 the Government had assured the Venice Commission that the drafting of the transitional provisions of the Fundamental Law would not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime (see paragraph 26 above). The Court does not accept the Government\u2019s argument that the fact that those two interviews were given after the applicant had expressed some of his criticisms proves that the contested measure was not ultimately a consequence of those criticisms. All of the proposals to terminate his mandate as President of the Supreme Court were made public and submitted to Parliament between 19 and 23\u00a0November 2011, shortly after his parliamentary speech of 3\u00a0November 2011, and were adopted within a strikingly short time. The termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate came into effect on 1 January 2012, when the Fundamental Law came into force and the new K\u00faria became the legal successor to the Supreme Court.",

This is corroborated by the numerous documents submitted by the applicant which refer to the widespread perception that such a causal link existed.

This is particularly important in the case at hand, since the reasons behind the termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate lie within the knowledge of the Government and were never established or reviewed by an independent court or body, in contrast to the case of the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court. The Court notes that the explanations given at the relevant time in the bills introducing the amendments on the termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate were not very detailed. The bills referred in general terms to the new Fundamental Law of Hungary, the succession of the Supreme Court and the modifications to the court system resulting from that Law, without explaining the changes that prompted the premature termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate as President. This cannot be considered sufficient in the circumstances of the present case, in view of the fact that the previous bills submitted during the legislative process had not mentioned the termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate (see paragraph 30 above, versions of 21 October and 17 November 2011), and that previous declarations by the Government and members of the parliamentary majority had indicated precisely the opposite, namely that the applicant\u2019s mandate would not be terminated upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law (see paragraphs 25-26 above). Furthermore, neither the applicant\u2019s ability to exercise his functions as president of the supreme judicial body nor his professional conduct were called into question by the domestic authorities (see, conversely, Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above, and the judgment in Harabin, cited above, \u00a7 151).",

The Government pointed out that the function to which the applicant had been elected had ceased to exist, since his activities were mostly connected with the managerial functions of the President of the National Council of Justice, which \u2013 following the entry into force of the Fundamental Law \u2013 were separated from the functions of the President of the K\u00faria. In this respect, the Court would emphasise that the position of the President of the National Council of Justice seemed to be auxiliary to that of the President of the Supreme Court and not the other way round. Furthermore, if the applicant was deemed competent to exercise both functions at the time of his election, the fact that one of them was subsequently removed should not in principle affect his suitability to continue exercising the other function. With regard to the alleged changes in the competences of the supreme judicial body, they do not appear to be of such a fundamental nature. The main new competence attributed to the K\u00faria was the power to review the legality of local government regulations and to establish local governments\u2019 failure to comply with statutory legislative obligations. As to the role in safeguarding the consistency of the case-law, that had already existed previously (see Article 47 \u00a7\u00a02 of the former Constitution, which mentioned uniformity resolutions), although new means to carry out this task were introduced under the new legislation, with more detailed regulations (creation of groups analysing the case-law, publication of guiding decisions from lower courts).",

It observes in this regard that the applicant expressed his views on the legislative reforms in issue in his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and of the National Council of Justice. It was not only his right but also his duty as President of the National Council of Justice to express his opinion on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary, after having gathered and summarised the opinions of lower courts (see paragraph 44 above). The applicant also used his power to challenge some of the relevant legislation before the Constitutional Court and used the possibility to express his opinion directly before Parliament on two occasions, in accordance with parliamentary rules (see paragraph 46 above). The Court therefore attaches particular importance to the office held by the applicant, whose functions and duties included expressing his views on the legislative reforms which were likely to have an impact on the judiciary and its independence. It refers in this connection to the Council of Europe instruments, which recognise that each judge is responsible for promoting and protecting judicial independence (see paragraph 3 of the Magna Carta of Judges in paragraph 81 above) and that judges and the judiciary should be consulted and involved in the preparation of legislation concerning their statute and, more generally, the functioning of the judicial system (see paragraph 34 of Opinion no. 3 (2002) of the CCJE in paragraph 80 above; and paragraph 9 of the Magna Carta of Judges in paragraph 81 above).",

Although the Government relied on the need to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, the views and statements publicly expressed by the applicant did not contain attacks against other members of the judiciary (compare with Di Giovanni and Poyraz, both cited above); nor did they concern criticisms with regard to the conduct of the judiciary dealing with pending proceedings (see Kudeshkina, cited above, \u00a7 94).",

His statements did not go beyond mere criticism from a strictly professional perspective. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s position and statements, which clearly fell within the context of a debate on matters of great public interest, called for a high degree of protection for his freedom of expression and strict scrutiny of any interference, with a correspondingly narrow margin of appreciation being afforded to the authorities of the respondent State.",

This can hardly be reconciled with the particular consideration to be given to the nature of the judicial function as an independent branch of State power and to the principle of the irremovability of judges, which \u2013 according to the Court\u2019s case-law and international and Council of Europe instruments \u2013 is a key element for the maintenance of judicial independence (see the principles on the irremovability of judges emerging from the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 6 \u00a7 1 in Fruni v.

Secondly, the Court seems to take for granted its jurisdiction to assess the compatibility of constitutional provisions with the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d), without explaining the grounds and breadth of its remit. Both the substance and the procedure for adopting the impugned provisions were assessed under the presumption that the Court had a \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d Kompetenz-Kompetenz to verify the Convention compliance of the constitutional reforms in question, including on issues related to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. Thirdly, for the purposes of its assessment of the constitutional reform, the Court acknowledges the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court as a right under domestic law, although the issue of the premature termination of the applicant\u2019s mandate as President of the Supreme Court was included in a transitional constitutional provision with the deliberate purpose of precluding him from contesting it before the Service Tribunal. The Court found this right of access to be a given by reading into the domestic law the international standards on judicial independence, which are \u2013 for the most part \u2013 soft law. In straightforward terms, the Court not only ascribes direct effect in the Hungarian legal order to the Article 6 guarantee of judicial independence and right of access to a court; it goes further and affirms the Convention\u2019s supra-constitutional effect, in order to override the contradicting domestic constitutional provision. In so doing, the Court affirms itself as the European Constitutional Court, with power to declare domestic constitutional provisions devoid of any legal effects within the relevant domestic legal order.",

He argues that the constitution-making majority in the legislature deliberately chose to enact a legislative act at the highest level of the hierarchy of laws in order to preclude his access to the Constitutional Court. At the same time, he claims that the first condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test was not met, in that his right of access to a court was not excluded by domestic law. The logical contradiction in the applicant\u2019s reasoning is pointed out by the Government, who argue that, since the Fundamental Law is part of domestic law and it excluded access to a court, then access to a court is in fact excluded by domestic law. Furthermore, in view of the special constitutional status of the President of the Supreme Court compared with other judges and the administrative heads of lower courts \u2013 given that none of the other judges or court executives were elected by Parliament and enjoyed the same privileges as the applicant, and no court executive other than the President of the Supreme Court was excluded from supervision by the National Council of Justice \u2013 the applicant\u2019s mandate as President of the Supreme Court was, again according to the Government, of a \u201cgovernmental\u201d nature.

This was the legal framework in force at the time of the applicant\u2019s election and during his mandate, until 31 December 2011. The Court adds that, in the event of unconsented premature termination of the mandate, the office holder had \u201cstanding to apply for judicial review of that decision\u201d, invoking, mutatis mutandis, Zander v. Sweden. Accordingly, it concludes in paragraph 109 that at the time of his election and during his mandate, the applicant had an arguable claim to have had an entitlement under Hungarian law to protection against arbitrary removal from his office as President of the Supreme Court. In other words, the Court reads into the domestic legal framework at it stood on 1 January 2012 a right, on the basis of the Court\u2019s case-law, to apply for judicial review of a decision to terminate the mandate of the President of the Supreme Court.",

Paragraph\u00a0114 of the judgment provides the ultimate legal basis upon which that question is answered. The Court refers to the \u201cinternational and Council of Europe standards on the independence of the judiciary and the procedural safeguards applicable in cases of removal of judges\u201d, including the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the UN Human Rights Committee\u2019s General Comment No. 32, the \u201crelevant case-law\u201d of the Human Rights Committee, the European Charter on the Statute for Judges, the Consultative Council of European Judges (CCJE) Opinion no.\u00a01, the Magna Carta of Judges (Fundamental Principles) of the CCJE and even the relevant case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR). To put this clearly: the Court invokes the soft law of the Council of Europe and other international organisations and also a case from another international court as a legal basis not only to sustain the principle of the independence of the judiciary in abstracto, but also to assert in concreto the existence of the applicant\u2019s individual civil right to irremovability and of access to a court to protect that right in the Hungarian legal framework on 1\u00a0January 2012.",

Admittedly, the Court concludes that section\u00a011(2) of the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law contradicted not only ordinary law as it stood on 31\u00a0December 2011, but also the guarantee of judicial independence, including the guarantee of judges\u2019 irremovability, enshrined in Article 48 \u00a7\u00a03 of the 1949 Constitution, to which the Court pointedly refers in paragraph 108 of the judgment. This same guarantee of judicial independence had been included in Article 26 \u00a7\u00a01 of the new 2011 Fundamental Law itself, which made the impugned transitional provision a remarkable example of an \u201cunconstitutional constitutional provision\u201d (verfassungswidrige Verfassungsnorm).",

The First Amendment of 18 June 2012 to the Fundamental Law clarified that the Transitional Provisions were part of Fundamental Law in order to shield them from review by the Constitutional Court. On 29 December 2012, in its decision no. 45/2012, the Constitutional Court declared null and void some of the provisions on the grounds that they did not comply with the requirement of transitionality.

Equally irrelevant for the Court is the classification of the principles of independence of the judiciary, the irremovability of judges and access to a court for the protection of such irremovability as a matter of customary international law or even jus cogens. For the Court, it suffices to affirm the existence of such principles in general international law, in Council of Europe law and, in particular, in the Convention.

According to the Government, it is clear from the wording of Article 6 that the holders of rights under Article 6 are those who are parties to judicial proceedings, and not the judges dealing with their cases. Hence, the Government were of the opinion that no individual right of judges to independence could be derived from Article 6, which deprived the applicant of victim status. The Court finds differently, by ascribing direct effect in the domestic legal order to the Article 6 guarantee of independence of the judiciary, and the concomitant right of access to a court to protect that independence. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the applicant had not only an arguable claim, but an enforceable individual civil right in domestic law, read through the lens of the Convention and other very pertinent Council of Europe and international-law instruments. Furthermore, by stating that this right prevailed over the contradicting transitional constitutional provision which had hindered the applicant\u2019s access to a court, the Court acknowledges the direct, supra-constitutional effect of the Convention guarantee of independence of the judiciary, and the concomitant right of access to a court in order to protect that independence.",

Regardless of the fact that the applicant was not removed from his office as a judge and was permitted to serve as a Supreme Court judge, his removal from the position of President of the Supreme Court had a chilling effect on the expression of professional opinions by other judges, the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in Hungary. In this political and social context, the Court perceives a serious risk that all Convention rights and freedoms would be in danger in Hungary, since they would be put in the hands of any given political majority which could manipulate the highest members of the judiciary like pawns in a chess game. The Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s removal from office should indeed be subject to political considerations, given that his position was more administrative or \u201cgovernmental\u201d than judicial and that his views were more of a political than of a professional nature, is therefore flatly rejected by the Court \u2013 as is the argument that the organisational and functional changes to the system of court administration and to the competences of the K\u00faria, and the new eligibility criteria, were justified by the need to enhance the independence of the judiciary. The same should have been the case with regard to the Government\u2019s point that \u201cjudicial service at an international court cannot be equated with national judicial service from the point of view of the independence, or the perceived independence, of the judiciary.\u201d Quite apart from an outrageous lack of respect for the judges of the Court, this \u201cGovernment point\u201d casts doubt on the very independence of this Court.",

It also concerns judicial independence within the system of the administration of justice itself. Judges must be free, in their individual capacity, not only from any external influence, but also from any \u201cinside\u201d influence. This \u201cinternal judicial independence\u201d implies that judges do not receive instructions and are not subjected to pressure from their colleagues or from persons exercising administrative responsibilities in a court, such as the president of a court or the president of a court\u2019s section (see Parlov-Tkal\u010di\u0107 v.

Here, we would refer primarily to General Comment No.\u00a032 on Article 14 of the ICCPR (right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial). This General Comment emphasises the various aspects of the guarantee of independence from the perspective of the judges themselves (appointment, qualifications, security of tenure, remuneration, promotion, transfers, suspensions, dismissal, disciplinary measures, etc.), and the measures that the States should take to guarantee judges\u2019 effective independence and their protection from \u201cany form of political influence in their decision-making\u201d, and from conflicts of interest and intimidation (see the passages quoted in paragraph\u00a073 of the judgment).",

Thus, we note that the Committee has received various communications from judges themselves, alleging, in particular, that they were dismissed (or that their mandates were ended prematurely) in breach of the established procedures and safeguards. In these cases it has found that \u201cthose dismissals constitute[d] an attack on the independence of the judiciary protected by Article 14, paragraph\u00a01, of the [ICCPR]\u201d (see Mundyo Busyo et al. v. Democratic Republic of Congo, Communication No.\u00a0933/2000, 19\u00a0September 2003, passage quoted in paragraph 75 of the present judgment). Admittedly, in this case, as in others, it dealt with this type of communication under a combination of Article 14 \u00a7 1 of the ICCPR and Article 25 (c), which recognises the right of every citizen to have access, \u201con general terms of equality, to public service in his country\u201d. It is also true that the right of access to public office is not, as such, expressly protected by the Convention. However, as is clear from the above-cited wording in the Mundyo Busyo et al. case, the Committee in that case examined the impugned dismissal not only under Article 14 \u00a7 1 of the ICCPR in combination with Article 25 (c), but also from the perspective of judicial independence as protected on an autonomous basis by Article 14. This approach was confirmed in the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee (CCPR) in Bandaranayake v. Sri Lanka, Communication No.\u00a01376/2005, UN Doc.\u00a0CCPR/C/93/D/1376/2005 (2008), where the Committee found, inter alia, that \u201cthe dismissal procedure [had] not respect[ed] the requirements of basic procedural fairness and failed to ensure that the author benefited from the necessary guarantees to which he was entitled in his capacity as a judge, thus constituting an attack on the independence of the judiciary\u201d (see paragraph 76 of the present judgment).",

Ecuador (preliminary objection, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 23\u00a0August 2013, Series\u00a0C No.\u00a0266, on the removal by parliamentary resolution of twenty-seven judges of the Supreme Court of Justice of Ecuador, built on its earlier case-law on the right to an independent judge, guaranteed by Article\u00a08 \u00a7\u00a01 of the American Convention in terms, as we have seen, that are practically identical to those used in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

A positive response to this question would indicate that the judges themselves could rely on Article 6, without necessarily having to prove that an interference with their independence had simultaneously amounted to an unjustified interference in the exercise of their right to freedom of expression or another right enshrined in the Convention.

After noting that the provision in question \u201cdoes not state a right of access to the courts or tribunals in express terms\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 28), it referred to all of the principles of interpretation contained in Article\u00a031 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, including the importance of the preamble, which is \u201cvery useful for the determination of the \u2018object\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019 of the instrument to be construed\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 34). In a similar vein, it drew attention to the \u201cprofound belief\u201d of the signatory Governments in the rule of law, referred to in the preamble, and the key role of this concept in the Convention system. It concluded in this regard that \u201cin civil matters one can scarcely conceive of the rule of law without there being a possibility of having access to the courts\u201d (ibid.). It also reiterated the terms of Article\u00a031 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c) of the Vienna Convention, which indicates that account is to be taken also of \u201cany relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\u201d, including the \u201cgeneral principles of law recognized by civilized nations\u201d within the meaning of Article 38 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. It noted that one of those principles forbids the denial of justice. Taking all of these aspects into consideration, it reached the still renowned conclusion that \u201c[i]t would be inconceivable ... that Article 6 \u00a7 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to parties in a pending lawsuit and should not first protect that which alone makes it in fact possible to benefit from such guarantees, that is, access to a court ... the right of access constitutes an element which is inherent in the right stated by Article 6 \u00a7 1\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03536).",

In my opinion, however, the rule of law is hardly imaginable without an obligation on the State to offer safeguards for the protection of judicial independence and, hence, without the corresponding right of judges themselves to independence. Moreover, as is clear from the entirety of the international-law materials cited in the present judgment, judicial independence is today an integral part of the general principles of international law which must be taken into account in interpreting the Convention. Equally, an interpretation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 which finds that it protects the judge\u2019s subjective right to independence would be perfectly compatible with that provision\u2019s object and purpose. In this connection, I subscribe to the idea, set out in the Magna Carta of Judges, to the effect that \u201c[j]udicial independence and impartiality are essential prerequisites for the operation of justice\u201d (text quoted in paragraph\u00a07 above). Indeed, how can one hope that persons involved in court proceedings will enjoy the right to an independent judge if judges themselves are not afforded safeguards capable of ensuring that independence? In my opinion, a subjective right of this sort for judges is inherent in the safeguards of the first paragraph of Article\u00a06, and in the concept of a fair hearing. I believe that this approach is borne out by the above-mentioned case-law of the Human Rights Committee and of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.",

They protect those citizens who seek justice, but not the individuals who exercise judicial power. These guarantees cannot be analysed as the individual rights of a judge, even if they co-define (with certain other legal rules) the legal status of the persons holding judicial office. A right-holder may decide freely how to exercise his or her rights and to what extent he or she may assert them through legal remedies.

The speaker requires a legal basis to speak in his or her official capacity. There should be a legal basis for any official utterance.

Official speech could then, in principle, express private views and serve the personal interest of the right-holder, including the purpose of his or her personal fulfilment. A situation in which official speech interferes with the rights of another person could not be treated as mere State interference with that person\u2019s rights, but would instead represent a situation of conflict between the freedom of speech of the public official on the one hand, and the rights of that third person on the other. A very thorough balancing exercise would then be required to resolve the conflict between these conflicting rights.

The failure to do so affected the Government\u2019s position in the proceedings. The approach adopted seems to depart from the strict standards of a fair trial as developed by the Court itself.",

It may be that such a rule does not necessarily reflect a generalisation about facts (based on the principle praesumptio sumitur de eo quod plerumque fit), but in any event it has to take into account the factual context in which it operates and have a strong axiological foundation. I note, furthermore, that in European legal culture there is wide acceptance of the principle affirmanti non neganti incumbit probatio. Although the Court affirms in the context of Article 2 and 3 cases that \u201cConvention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio\u201d (see, for example, Hassan v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29750/09, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2014), exceptions to this principle require a strong justification. Even if there is no doubt that the Government should be required to justify reforms which entail interference with rights protected under the Convention, in cases such as the instant one the burden of proof as allocated by the Court may be extremely difficult (if even possible) to meet. Under the rules applied by the majority, a constitutional reform causing detrimental consequences to a specific person holding public office (or to a clearly identified group of office holders) who had previously criticised the Government will henceforth usually be considered as an unacceptable interference with that person\u2019s freedom of speech. Thus, the question of the allocation of the burden of proof in such cases should be re-examined.",

The impugned measure does not appear to be a sanction for past utterances, but rather a tool to influence the way in which two State organs will operate in the future. In other words, the applicant was most probably replaced not because of what he said or did not say in the past, but because he was considered to be a person who might try, in the future, to use his powers in a way that would hinder the parliamentary majority\u2019s policy.

It is true that, prior to the constitutional reform, Hungarian legislation provided for a six-year mandate and defined the specific conditions for its termination.
