Indeed, the Court\u2019s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to \u201censure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto\u201d, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E.G. v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a050425/99, \u00a7\u00a027, ECHR 2008\u2013..(extracts)). The object of the pilot judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v.  (dec.), no.\u00a050003/99, \u00a7\u00a034, ECHR 2007XIV (extracts)). While the respondent State\u2019s action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction where appropriate of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers of redress in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198, and Xenides-Arestis v. , no.\u00a046347/99, \u00a7\u00a050, 22 December 2005).",

The problem appears to have its origin in socially-oriented legislation enacted by Parliament or the Government, which bestows social housing privileges on a very wide category of persons at the expense of the local governments. According to this legislation more than twenty different categories of persons are entitled to receive accommodation free of charge. For instance, a judge is entitled to social housing after six months\u2019 service; a police officer, depending on his or her rank, after one or three years; a military officer after one year; a prosecutor after one year.",

In fact the local governments are placed in a situation where they have to choose between fulfilling their normal duties such as, for instance, providing community services and operating schools and kindergartens or using the funds for building accommodation for judges, police officers, prosecutors and others. An example which addresses the situation of the social housing cases is the case of Caraman v. Moldova ((dec.), no. 3755/05, 22\u00a0April 2008) where the parties reached a friendly settlement agreement according to which the Government were to pay the applicant damages and to \u201censure the urgent enforcement of the judgment\u201d in favour of the applicant.

The Court notes that the Government admitted that this situation was also contrary to the principle of local autonomy and decentralisation. In admitting the existence of the systemic dysfunction, the Government have already taken some general measures with a view to solving it. In particular, the Ministry of Justice has prepared a draft law intended to cancel social housing privileges for twenty-three categories of persons (see paragraph 31 above). The Court agrees that such a measure, if followed through, is capable of solving the problem for the future. However, as rightly pointed out by the applicants and admitted by the Government, this initiative does not provide solutions for the judgments granting social housing rights which already exist. The Court considers that this problem, although not particularly complex, raises issues which go, in principle, beyond the Court\u2019s judicial function. It will thus abstain in these circumstances from indicating any specific general measure to be taken in this respect. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the necessary measures to be adopted by  in this respect. The Court therefore leaves it to the Committee of Ministers to ensure that the Moldovan Government, in accordance with its obligations under the Convention, adopts the necessary measures consistent with the Court\u2019s conclusions in the present judgment.",

The Court therefore considers that the respondent State must grant adequate and sufficient redress, within one year of the date on which the judgment becomes final, to all victims of non-enforcement or unreasonably delayed enforcement by State authorities of domestic judgments concerning social housing who lodged their applications with the Court before the delivery of the present judgment.
