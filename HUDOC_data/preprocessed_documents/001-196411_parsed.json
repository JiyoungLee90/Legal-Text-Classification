When speaking of \u201claw\u201d, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, and requires the measure complained of to be based on adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions (ibid., \u00a7 74, and see also, among many other authorities, Leki\u0107 v.

At the same time, they did not rely on any legal provision that would have made the delivery of the benefit in question conditional on any limits on the budgetary funds, that provided for any discretion on the part of the executive authorities to reduce or refuse that benefit once the limit of the allocated budgetary funds had been reached, or any similar provision, which could have formed a legal basis for such a finding. It is noteworthy in this connection that, in subsequent court decisions taken in the context of proceedings examining similar claims, it was clearly stated that that the existing legal framework established the right of those entitled to be provided with the necessary medicines not only free of charge but also without any restrictions, and that setting a maximum quantity of a particular medicine per person, or having insufficient budgetary funds allocated to a particular region could not be the basis for a refusal to provide the individuals concerned with medicines that were essential for their lives (see paragraph 43 above).",

It reaffirms that the fact that a person has entered into and forms part of a State social-security system does not necessarily mean that that system cannot be changed, either as to the conditions of eligibility for payment or as to the quantum of the benefit. The Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations. In present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints going to the impairment of social welfare rights, and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems (see, recently, Bacz\u00far v. Hungary, no. 8263/15, \u00a7 28, 7 March 2017).",

It is also of relevance that the welfare benefit in question concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to receive the medicine necessary for the treatment of his cancer, which presupposed that uninterrupted enjoyment of that benefit was critical for the applicant\u2019s life. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, a refusal to provide such a benefit to an applicant who satisfied all of the conditions was impossible to foresee and is ultimately difficult to reconcile with the rule of law.",

The applicant insisted that that request had not been reflected in the transcript of the hearing. With reference to the criteria regarding legal aid in civil proceedings established in the case of Steel and Morris v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom (no.\u00a068416/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005II), the applicant stressed that what had been at stake in his civil dispute had been particularly important to him, given that it had concerned the provision of medicine essential for his life. He further argued that the case at hand had been legally and factually complex, given the fact that its subject matter had been governed by laws and numerous executive decisions and orders and had involved many parties. The applicant also contended that, being an old-age and disability pensioner without any legal qualifications, he had been unable to represent himself effectively in the relevant proceedings. He insisted that his experience working in a law firm, as referred to by the Government (see paragraph 84 below), had been irrelevant, as that firm had only provided consulting services and had never represented clients before a court. The applicant also stressed that during the relevant period he had been following a cancer treatment regime, and that his health condition had made it physically difficult for him to represent himself before the courts. With reference to the fact that his adversaries in the proceedings had been the State authorities, represented by professional lawyers, whilst he had had to present his case on his own without any legal assistance or advice, the applicant argued that he had been placed at a substantial disadvantage vis\u00e0vis the opposing party, which had compromised the overall fairness of the proceedings.",

The Government also contended that, in any event, the applicant had been fully able to state his case and to present his arguments before the domestic courts. They pointed out, in particular, that the documents submitted by the applicant to the first-instance court revealed that in 2007 the applicant had been employed as a deputy director of a consulting law firm, which, in the Government\u2019s view, demonstrated that he had legal knowledge and experience. His court claim, as well as his written submissions and applications, had been coherent, motivated and had contained references to the relevant domestic law. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s civil case had not been particularly complex, the case file had comprised only 226 pages, and the proceedings before the first-instance court had lasted for less than two months (from 10 December 2007 to 5 February 2008), during which period there had been four hearings.

The question whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, upon the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicant\u2019s capacity to represent him or herself effectively (see Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

It further considers that, although what was at stake for the applicant was of significant importance to him, his case does not appear to have been particularly complex either factually or legally. Indeed, neither the facts nor the law were contested by the parties. The materials in the Court\u2019s possession reveal that the applicant\u2019s written submissions were welldeveloped and reasoned; that he was able to file written applications and requests, which were examined by the courts and granted, in so far as the courts considered it appropriate to do so; and that he actively participated in oral pleadings, and advanced his arguments (see paragraph 18 above). Overall, it is clear that the applicant was fully able to state his case and to represent himself effectively, and his arguments were not only addressed but also received reasoned replies.

It observes that, as established by the domestic courts and acknowledged by the Government, the applicant spent EUR 1,400 on the purchase of that medicine (see paragraphs 9, 23 and 90 above).
