In particular, the Court observes that, during more than eleven years in which the investigation has been pending, the investigators made no attempt to verify information concerning the use of military vehicles by the abductors and their possible itinerary, despite the fact that the first applicant, when interviewed, provided the relevant information. Moreover, there is no indication that the investigators took any steps to verify the applicants\u2019 allegation that their relative had been taken to the premises of the Western Zone Alignment. Having regard to the witness statements obtained by the investigators in August 2001 and, in particular, to the fact that many of them submitted that the abduction of Vakhit\u00a0Avkhadov had not been an isolated incident but that several other men had been abducted in the same manner and at the same time from UrusMartan (see paragraphs 52-59 above), the Court notes that the investigators made no attempt to take such basic steps as identifying the servicemen who participated in the operation, establishing their chain of command, and obtaining information from the checkpoints about the possible passage through them of the convoy of military vehicles.",

However, bearing that fact in mind and having regard to the documents submitted by them and the first applicant\u2019s request to be granted victim status made in 2002, it transpires, at the very least, that she was not aware of the decision to grant her victim status issued in 2001 (see paragraphs 33 and 54 above). Furthermore, in view of the applicants\u2019 repeated requests for access to the case file and to be provided with information on the progress of the investigation (see paragraphs 42, 43 and 46 above), the Court seriously doubts that they were informed of important developments in the investigation. Accordingly, the investigators failed to ensure that the investigation received the required level of public scrutiny or to safeguard the interests of the next of kin in the proceedings (see O\u011fur v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021594/93, \u00a7 92, ECHR 1999III).",

Moreover, owing to the time that had elapsed since the events complained of, certain investigative measures that ought to have been carried out much earlier could no longer usefully be conducted.",

The investigation was repeatedly suspended and resumed, but it appears that no significant investigative measures were taken to identify those responsible for the abduction. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants could not be required to challenge in court every single decision of the district prosecutor\u2019s office. Moreover, as it has established above, the applicants received only fragmentary and incomplete information about the course of the investigation and the investigative measures taken. Against that background, the Court finds that the remedy cited by the Government was ineffective in the circumstances and dismisses their preliminary objection as regards the applicants\u2019 failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the context of the criminal investigation.",
