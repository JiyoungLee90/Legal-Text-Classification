In that respect, it notes that the Hague Convention does not prevent a parent with sole custody of a child taking the child abroad (see paragraph 59 above). Moreover, the Romanian courts concluded in the present case that the removal of the applicant\u2019s child was not wrongful within the meaning of the Hague Convention. Consequently, the proceedings did not directly determine the question of the applicant\u2019s right of access and neither their outcome nor their allegedly protracted nature had a decisive impact on the exercise of that right. It is true that the applicant\u2019s objective in seeking to have the child returned to Romania was to ensure that he could exercise the right of access which he had been granted by the Romanian courts and that both the removal of the child and the fact that he remained in the United Kingdom throughout the subsequent proceedings to a certain extent frustrated the exercise of the applicant\u2019s rights. The Court notes, however, that the applicant did have access to his child in the United Kingdom during the proceedings and that although that access was limited he did not apply to the English courts for any extension of his rights or for any modification of the manner in which they were exercised. Furthermore, the Court finds it striking that the applicant did not at any stage ask to have the child returned to Romania on a temporary basis with a view to exercising his right of access, which in any event was limited to eighty-two days a year, and that it was only in 2007 that he applied to the English courts for recognition of the judgment of the Romanian court granting him a right of access (see paragraph 57 above). In all these circumstances, the Court finds that neither State failed to take adequate steps to secure the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right of access to his child.",

It is for this reason that the proceedings under the Hague Convention require special expediency. Against this background, the Court notes several factors which raise concern. In the first place it notes that several adjournments were ordered at the beginning of the proceedings, notwithstanding the urgent nature of the matter. Moreover, it took six months for the first instance court to examine the case without, however, giving a decision on the merits. In addition, although the courts twice agreed to speed up the proceedings, they subsequently had to adjourn the advanced hearings because they had failed to ensure that the observations were submitted earlier than the day before the hearing. Consequently, on both occasions the speeding up did not have the desired effect. Most importantly, however, the Court notes that between August 2004 and May\u00a02005 there were no developments in the proceedings before the Romanian courts. The Government submitted that this was due to the workload of the Romanian Court of Cassation; however, the Court cannot accept this argument. In the first place, it was not the Court of Cassation which examined the appeal on points of law, but the Bucharest Court of Appeal. In any event, even assuming that the delay occurred due to the Court of Cassation\u2019s workload, the Court recalls that Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, among many other authorities, Kyrtatos v. Greece, ECHR-2003..., 22 May 2003, \u00a7 42).

Technically, the application of the Hague Convention therefore depends on the application of Romanian law in the matter. A separate question therefore arises as to whether the idea of litigating this issue before the Romanian courts does not in fact conflict with the primordial imperative of the Hague Convention. This imperative, as we emphasized in our dissent in Maumousseau and Washington, is time. In other words, if the application of domestic law were to be litigated with unreasonable delay in each of these cases then the fait accompli logic referred to above would always produce an undesired effect.

If the father in this case had pursued the same remedies as Mr  in his case, the mother\u2019s action would perhaps have been regarded as a kidnapping. However, the case got bogged down in the Romanian courts and the international action never materialised.
