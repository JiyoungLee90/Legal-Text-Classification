In any event, and to reply more fully to their objection, in so far as the Government were of the view that he should also have instituted two other sets of proceedings, civil and administrative, the Court reiterates that an individual is not required to try more than one avenue of redress when there are several parallel remedies available in various branches of law. It is for the applicant to select the legal remedy that is most appropriate in the circumstances of the case (see, among other authorities, Airey v.\u00a0Ireland, judgment of 9\u00a0October 1979, Series A no.\u00a032, p.\u00a012, \u00a7\u00a023, and Boicenco v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a041088/05, \u00a7\u00a080, 11\u00a0July 2006).

It would be inconceivable that Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants \u2013 proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious \u2013 without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article\u00a06 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see Immobiliare Saffi v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a022774/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 1999-V).",

By virtue of Article\u00a01 of the Convention, each Contracting Party \u201cshall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention\u201d. The obligation to secure the effective exercise of the rights defined in that instrument may result in positive obligations for the State. As regards the right guaranteed by Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01, those positive obligations may entail certain measures necessary to protect the right to property, even in cases involving litigation between private individuals or companies. This means, in particular, that States are under an obligation to ensure compliance with the procedures enshrined in the legislation for the enforcement of final decisions, whether judicial or administrative, conferring rights on individuals (see Fuklev v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a071186/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08991, 7\u00a0June 2005, with further references). This principle applies with all the more force when it is the State itself which is obliged to comply with such decisions.",
