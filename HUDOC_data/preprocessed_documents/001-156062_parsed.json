However, the Court is ill-equipped to engage in, or verify, the valuation of residential property across Russia; nor indeed would it be appropriate for the Court to do so, given that the applicant was free to choose his place of residence. The Court notes in addition that the judgment awarded a fixed amount which was not based on any price per square metre. Consequently, the Court cannot accept the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage based on a price per square metre (see Baygayev v. Russia, no.\u00a036398/04, \u00a7\u00a028, 5\u00a0July\u00a02007).
