This was because the programme had first been sent by satellite link to Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd, the British company responsible for the programme content, and thereafter uplinked to a satellite, which had in turn transmitted the programme to viewers in Sweden. As Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable, X could not be held responsible for the programme content under Chapter 6.

Having regard to the above, the offence committed against the applicant through the programme could not be examined by United Kingdom courts. The applicant also submitted that Swedish courts were competent to examine the case under the Brussels I Regulation (see further paragraph 35 below).

It further stated that the burden of proof concerning the applicability of the Constitutional Law rested on the applicant and that he had not, in response to X\u2019s refutation, established that the decisions concerning the programme content were taken in Sweden.

It considered that it could be assumed that the said rule on transmission of programmes referred to a purely technical transmission to a satellite from where the programmes are broadcast directly to the public in Sweden. In such a case, no real programming activities existed outside Sweden. It further stated that the provisions in the Constitutional Law on sole responsibility and the related provisions are based on programming activities being conducted in Sweden. If, however, the programming activities are conducted abroad, the conditions for applying the legal principles of freedom of the press are largely lacking. In determining whether programming activities are conducted in Sweden or abroad, it is the place where decisions on the programme content are taken which is crucial, and not the place where the programme is actually made or the technical means of broadcasting used.",

Consequently, Chapters 1-9 of the Constitutional Law were not applicable to the transmission. However, the court continued, the question whether the defendants were protected as informants under Chapter 10, section 2 of that law did not concern a procedural issue and was therefore to be examined in the continued proceedings on the substance of the case in the lower courts.

The court noted that it had previously taken the position that the Constitutional Law was not applicable to the broadcast in question, as the programme was found not to have emanated from Sweden. The issue was thus whether the persons summoned before the court in their capacity as programme hosts and participants were covered by the freedom of communication under Chapter 10, section 2 of that law and thereby excluded from liability under tort law for the statements made in the programme. It found that, according to Chapter 10, section 2, compared with section 1, the freedom of communication was applicable to statements in television programmes broadcast from transmitters outside Sweden. It further noted that the protection of informants under the Constitutional Law also covered \u2013 with certain exceptions which are not relevant here \u2013 persons participating by performing in a television programme. For a person communicating information to be protected in this respect it was also deemed necessary for the information to have been submitted to a receiver of information for publication, as set out in Chapter 1, section 2. This requirement was found to be met as the statements had been made in a live-broadcast programme that had been sent via a communications satellite to a broadcaster abroad before being transmitted to the Swedish public via satellite. In these circumstances, it was clear that the defendants, in their capacity as programme hosts and participants, were covered by the freedom of communication under the Constitutional Law.",

They held that, from that time, it was a general principle of law that, to the extent that Sweden had a duty to provide redress to victims of Convention violations through a right to compensation for damages, and this duty could not otherwise be fulfilled, compensation for damages could be ordered without direct support in law. This had been accepted by the Court as an effective remedy which potential applicants could be expected to exhaust (see, for instance, Eriksson v. Sweden, no.\u00a060437/08, 12 April 2012). The present application had been introduced with the Court three months after the judgment of 3 December 2009.

They further mentioned that both the Swedish Broadcasting Authority and Ofcom had confirmed that the latter UK authority had supervisory jurisdiction over the broadcasts in question. In the Government\u2019s view, Swedish jurisdiction was therefore excluded through a binding provision of EU law. The applicant contested both that the broadcaster in the case had its head office in the United Kingdom and that its editorial decisions were taken there and argued that the AV Directive did not stipulate that the broadcasts of TV3 fell outside Swedish jurisdiction, the latter conclusion instead having been drawn entirely by way of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of national law.",

The supervision performed by the authority of the single state designated to have jurisdiction would cover such issues as the registration and licensing of a broadcaster and the investigation whether its programmes comply with rules on advertising as well as restrictions aimed at preventing crimes and discrimination and protecting minors and public health. It is doubtful, however, that the Directive regulates all issues of jurisdiction that may arise in relation to the broadcast of a television programme. This conclusion appears to be supported by a judgment of 9 July 1997 of the ECJ in which the court, examining the AV Directive\u2019s similar predecessor, the Television without Frontiers Directive of 1989 (89/552/EEC), in particular its regulation of advertising, found that the Directive, whilst coordinating provisions on television advertising and sponsorship, did so only partially. The court further held that a State could take measures against a television broadcast although it was not designated as the broadcasting \u2013 and, thereby, jurisdictional \u2013 State under the Directive, provided that the measures would not prevent the transmission as such and would not involve a secondary control of a broadcast in addition to the one performed by the broadcasting State (Cases C-34/95, C-35/95 and C-36/95, Konsumentombudsmannen (KO) v De Agostini (Svenska) F\u00f6rlag AB and TV-Shop i Sverige AB, paragraphs 27-38). Thus, it appears that the jurisdiction over broadcasters vested in one State under the 1989 Directive did not have general application, extending to matters not regulated therein. The same must be presumed to be valid also for the 2010 AV Directive. In this connection, it is telling that when, in Article 28, the AV Directive addresses the situation where a person\u2019s reputation and good name have been damaged by incorrect facts presented in a programme, it only talks about a right of reply or equivalent remedies, and does not deal with defamation proceedings and an appurtenant claim for damages.",

Rather, jurisdiction under EU law is regulated by the Brussels I Regulation. According to Articles 2 and 5 of that Regulation, both the United Kingdom and Sweden appear to have jurisdiction over the present matter: X is domiciled in Sweden whereas Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd is registered, and thus domiciled, in the United Kingdom, and the harmful event could be argued to have occurred in either country, as the television programme was broadcast from the United Kingdom and the alleged injury to the applicant\u2019s reputation and privacy manifested itself in Sweden.",

Moreover, as will be further described in the following, there were strong connections between Sweden, on the one hand, and the television programme and the UK company responsible for the programme contents and involved in its broadcasts, on the other. These circumstances are sufficient to conclude that there was a prima facie obligation on the Swedish State to secure the applicant\u2019s rights, including the right of access to court.

It appeared impossible for the applicant to have adequate and effective access to a court in Sweden to seek redress for the alleged defamation. In Sweden private actions for defamation can be brought against the media only under the terms of the Freedom of the Press Act and the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression. Such claims can be pursued even if \u201cliability under criminal law has lapsed or an action under criminal law is otherwise excluded\u201d (FPA Ch. 11, CLFE, Ch. 8). However, as is set out in the judgment, the possibility of bringing a private action in respect of the alleged defamation was excluded in accordance with the Constitutional Law since the television programme was considered not to emanate from Sweden, the broadcast having been transmitted via a company in the United Kingdom which was deemed to have had editorial control over it.",

The applicant is a Swedish national residing in Sweden. Does the application concern a right or freedom to be secured by Sweden within its jurisdiction as understood in the Convention? It certainly does. I find unconvincing the reasons given in paragraph 42 of this judgment for joining the jurisdiction issue under Article\u00a01 to the merits of the complaint. The engagement undertaken by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention is confined to \u201csecuring\u201d the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 86, Series A no. 161). There can be no reasonable doubt, I think, that the case brought before the Court falls within the jurisdiction of Sweden within the meaning of Article 1. An attack on a person\u2019s reputation surely affects a right under the Convention (Article 8) and the alleged harm done was within the territory of Sweden (locus damni), where the television programme was received by the public, and where the applicant, a Swedish national, had his reputation. To my mind these circumstances were more than enough for the Court to rebut the Government\u2019s argument of a lack of jurisdiction under the Convention before addressing the merits of the complaint concerning Article 6.",

This is a matter where distinctions can be made. Hence, Article 6 \u00a7 1 will be complied with if the person concerned had available to him reasonable alternative means to protect effectively his rights under the Convention (see Waite and Kennedy v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7\u00a7 68-74, ECHR 1999-I; Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2001-VIII; and Chapman v. Belgium (dec.), no.\u00a039619/06, \u00a7\u00a7 51-56, 5 March 2013). If litigation before an alternative forum abroad, determined in accordance with private international law, would not be too burdensome for the applicant concerned, this could (at least in theory) also be an acceptable way of securing his rights and freedoms. In the present case the Swedish courts indicated that the applicant could litigate in the United Kingdom. Supposing the English courts were to apply their domestic law, the standard of proof in the defamation case would differ. In Sweden the truth of statements made is not incompatible with defamation, whereas in the United Kingdom it would be, but it may be doubtful whether that disadvantageous aspect for the applicant would fall within the complaint concerning the right of access to court.",

According to European private international law, the choice of forum in a trans-border tort case, in so far as is relevant here, is regulated by the Brussels I Regulation, which (also) includes derogations from the standard rule. In Shevill and Others (Case C-68/93), eDate Advertising and Martinez (Joined Cases C-509/09 and C161/10) and Wintersteiger (Case C523/10) the European Court of Justice has allowed the courts assuming jurisdiction in a member State in accordance with the \u201cplace where the harmful event occurred\u201d or where the centre of the alleged victim\u2019s interests is based to hear an action for damages for harm caused by the publication of a defamatory newspaper article or an Internet publication; the same would apply, it may be assumed, to a broadcast via satellite. The problem in the case in hand is thus certainly not one of European Union law on jurisdiction. Under the Convention, whether a domestic court can exercise jurisdiction over a defendant\u2013 like the broadcasting company in the United Kingdom in the present case \u2013 located or domiciled in a country other than the High Contracting Party against which the application is directed, in relation to an alleged offence or civil wrong committed via satellite or over the Internet, is primarily a question to be answered by the courts by applying domestic law and hence in conformity with their international obligations, including the relevant principles of European private international law. Jurisdiction in this domain of forum choice has a different meaning from that contained in the concept of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in Article 1 of the Convention.",

The right of access to court may narrow the possibilities of choice of jurisdiction, favouring one particular choice over the others, but it may also dictate that jurisdiction should be allowed where other grounds would perhaps not suffice. Article 6 \u00a7 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way Article 6 embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 36, Series A no.\u00a018). It is important that access to court, when assessed as a right established under Article 6 of the Convention, is \u201cpractical and effective\u201d (see Bellet v. France, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 333-B). For the right of access to be effective, an individual must \u201chave a clear, practical opportunity to challenge an interference with his rights\u201d. The fact of having access to domestic remedies, only to be told that one\u2019s actions are barred by operation of law, does not always satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (ibid., \u00a7 36; see also Nunes Dias v. Portugal (dec.), nos. 2672/03 and 69829/01, ECHR 2003IV). In the specific circumstances of a particular case, the practical and effective nature of this right may be impaired, for instance by the prohibitive cost of the proceedings in view of the individual\u2019s financial capacity or by the excessive amount of security for costs in the context of an application to join criminal proceedings as a civil party (see Ai\u0308t-Mouhoub v.\u00a0France, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII, and also Garc\u00eda Manibardo v. Spain, no.\u00a038695/97, \u00a7\u00a7 38-45, ECHR 2000II) or excessive court fees (see Kreuz v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a028249/95, \u00a7\u00a7 60-67, ECHR 2001VI; Podbielski and PPU Polpure v.

In normal circumstances the option to litigate in London (United Kingdom) cannot be considered a practical alternative for a Swedish resident alleging damage done to his reputation in Sweden. The connections to Sweden, as enumerated in paragraph 73 of the judgment, are overwhelming in this case. To my mind some of these connections, such as the nationality of the anchorman and the location of the sponsoring companies\u2019 activities, as well as the alleged place of the applicant\u2019s conduct, have no bearing on the applicant\u2019s right of access to court in Sweden.
