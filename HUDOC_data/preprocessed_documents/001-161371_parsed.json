The Court has also found in a number of cases relating to claims under Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention that applications concerning property rights are, in principle, transferable to heirs (see, among other authorities, Nerva and Others v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a042295/98, \u00a7\u00a033, ECHR\u00a02002VIII, and Sobelin and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a030672/03 et al., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-45, 3\u00a0May 2007, for issues relating to both Article\u00a06 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention). In assessing the transferability of complaints, the former Commission and the Court have taken into account, for example, the fact that the link between the complaints at stake and the deceased applicant was not exclusive, and that the late applicant\u2019s next of kin had personally suffered consequences (see, in the context of Article\u00a06 of the Convention, Funke v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a010828/84, Commission decision of 6\u00a0October 1988, Decisions and Reports 57, p.\u00a018), that the heirs had an interest of their own (see, regarding Article\u00a08 of the Convention, Armonien\u0117 v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a036919/02, \u00a7\u00a029, 25\u00a0November 2008), or that the domestic proceedings concerned the late applicant\u2019s pecuniary rights (see Jeruzal v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a065888/01, \u00a7\u00a025, 10\u00a0October 2006).",
