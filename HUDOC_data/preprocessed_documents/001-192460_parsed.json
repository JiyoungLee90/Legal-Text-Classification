Given the state of the Court\u2019s case-law at the time, the applicant could not be blamed for such a formal flaw in his application.

As to the applicant\u2019s argument that he applied for review of his conviction under the extraordinary review procedure, the Court notes that that procedure involved the request to have criminal proceedings which ended in a final decision reopened (see paragraph 37 above).

The proceedings were resumed and the applicant was arrested after O.\u2019s statement (see paragraphs 24 and 26 above), strongly indicating that her evidence was not only one of the three key elements of the evidence but was a decisive element of the case against him in the sense that, judging from the above-mentioned sequence of events, her evidence likely determined the outcome of the case (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 123).",
