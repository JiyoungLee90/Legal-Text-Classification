Having regard to the fact that the criminal proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case had lasted some nine years and two months, the court, noting in particular the lack of any activity between January 2003 and January 2007, concluded that this period could not be considered reasonable. In its detailed reasoning, the court emphasised that due to the nature of the criminal acts involved \u2013 two counts of continuous sexual assault on a minor committed against two victims, one of whom had been the applicant \u2013 the criminal proceedings should have been conducted in a particularly diligent, determined and prompt manner in order to alleviate, as much as possible, the applicant\u2019s suffering and severe mental distress caused by frequently having to relive the traumatic events. The local court further pointed out that the delays must have been very stressful for her, in addition to which she had had no effective remedies at her disposal in order to accelerate the proceedings. Considering the continuous nature of the acts suffered by the applicant and the fact that she had been called to testify and relive these events a number of times during the proceedings, the local court deviated from the general practice of the domestic authorities to make an award, within the statutory range of between EUR 300 and 5,000, equal to 45% of the sum that would be awarded for a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time by the Court. Thus, the applicant was awarded EUR 4,000, although she would not apparently have been entitled to such amount purely on the basis of the excessive length of the proceedings.",

They had taken statements from the victims, suspect and possible witnesses, obtained expert opinions on the psychological states of the victims and J.D., and an indictment had been lodged only a few days after the investigation had been concluded. In addition, once the competent court had commenced the trial on 14 April 2008, the proceedings had again been conducted conscientiously and effectively; J.D.\u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence had been decided in six months. The offender had therefore been identified and appropriately punished, and so the fundamental purpose of the criminal proceedings had been fulfilled. In view of this, the Government asserted that the only point in relation to which they could be considered as not having complied with their positive obligations under Article 3 was the excessive length of the criminal proceedings. In this connection, however, they argued that the situation had resulted from a systemic problem of court backlogs, which had, however, been effectively addressed as part of the \u201cLukenda\u201d project created specifically to deal with considerable delays in processing cases.

This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, such as by taking witness statements and gathering forensic evidence, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see Denis Vasilyev v. Russia, no.\u00a032704/04, \u00a7 100, 17 December 2009, with further references). The promptness of the authorities\u2019 reaction to the complaints is an important factor (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). Consideration has been given in the Court\u2019s judgments to matters such as the time taken to open investigations, delays in identifying witnesses or taking statements (see M\u0103t\u0103saru and Savi\u0163chi v.

Recalling that the applicant had been awarded and paid compensation for non-pecuniary damage before the domestic courts, the Government emphasised that in deciding the applicant\u2019s claim, the domestic courts had taken account of the particular circumstances of the criminal proceedings, emphasising that the applicant, then a minor, had been a victim of a series of offences over a long period of time, and that during the criminal proceedings she had been required to repeatedly testify and relive the abuse she had suffered. In its judgment, the competent local court had considered the whole duration of the proceedings and the way in which their particular circumstances had affected the applicant. The court had evaluated all these circumstances in relation to the activity expected of the competent authorities.",

Consequently, the applicant had been awarded a considerably higher amount than would normally have been granted under the 2006 Act. In conclusion, the Government asserted that the domestic authorities had identified, examined and evaluated the substantial deficiencies on which the applicant had based her allegation of a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3, and had awarded her just satisfaction, the amount of which she had evidently agreed with, as she had not contested the judgment in so far as part of her claim had been dismissed.",

Slovenia, no. 26867/02, \u00a7 40, 3\u00a0May 2007), but also from the limitation of the amount of compensation which may be awarded for non-pecuniary damage to a maximum of EUR\u00a05,000. Thus, in a number of cases in which the procedural shortcomings examined under Articles 2 and 8 consisted mainly or predominantly of delays (see, in addition to \u0160ilih and Eberhard, cited above, Z. v. Slovenia, no. 43155/05, \u00a7 129, 30 November 2010, and K.\u00a0v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 41293/05, \u00a7\u00a7 111-120, 7 July 2011), the Court did not require the applicants to use the remedies available under the 2006 Act, as the focus of its analysis was not merely the length of proceedings, but the question whether, in the circumstances of the case seen as a whole, the State had complied with its positive obligations under the relevant provisions of the Convention. It is true that in the present case, the local court, in addition to assessing the criteria relating to the length of the proceedings \u2013 the complexity of the case, the conduct of the authorities and that of the applicant, and the importance of what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute \u2013 took notice of the fact that the State had failed to ensure the diligent prosecution of the criminal offence committed against the applicant. Still, its lengthy and detailed reasoning was mainly focused on the aforementioned length criteria, and the award of damages was, ultimately, made in respect of the excessive length of the proceedings. In these circumstances, and in view of the Court\u2019s above-mentioned case-law, the applicant\u2019s acceptance of the amount awarded for the violation of her right to have the trial concluded within a reasonable time in the domestic proceedings cannot be considered as a waiver of her claim under Article 3 made before the Court and thus as prejudicial to her status of victim in the present case. Accordingly, it must next be determined whether the compensation awarded to the applicant in the domestic proceedings was in fact sufficient to deprive her of her victim status.",

Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2010). Having regard to the wider margin of appreciation left to the domestic courts in this regard (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 77, and the references cited therein), the Court has emphasised, in particular, that the sums awarded may not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases. Whether the amount awarded may be regarded as reasonable falls to be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case, taking into account different factors, among which are the duration and severity of the violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7 74, and Shishkin v. Russia, no. 18280/04, \u00a7 108, 7 July 2011). Where the amount of compensation is substantially lower than what the Court generally awards in comparable cases, the applicant retains his or her status as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged breach of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Scordino, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 182-92 and 202-15).",

It is especially difficult in a case where personal suffering, whether physical or mental, is the subject of the claim.

Italy (dec.), no. 34368/02, 25\u00a0November 2004). The Court does not doubt that the domestic courts in the present case attempted to assess the level of suffering and anguish sustained by the applicant as a result of the lack of effectiveness in conducting the criminal proceedings concerning the continuous sexual assault committed against her. Nevertheless, the amount received by her was, albeit increased, based on criteria applied by the domestic courts for awarding non-pecuniary damages for excessive length of proceedings. This amount, however, is substantially lower than the Court\u2019s award in the similar case of W. v.
