The prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial favours a substantive, rather than a formal, conception of \u201ccharge\u201d; it requires the Court to look behind the appearances and examine the realities of the procedure in question (see Deweer v.

Applying these principles to the situation before it, the Court finds that Mr Yankov was subject to a \u201ccharge\u201d from the moment when the police took a statement from him in which he confessed to taking part in the commission of the offence, that is, 27 January 1995 (see Howarth v. the , no. 38081/97, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9 and 20, 21 September 2000, and Martins and Garcia Alves v.
