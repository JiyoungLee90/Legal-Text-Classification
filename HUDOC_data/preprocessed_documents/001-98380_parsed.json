According to the Government, the district prosecutor's office received the applicant's complaint about the abduction only on 20 April 2004. However, they failed to submit either a dated and stamped copy of the applicant's complaint or any other documents confirming that it had indeed been obtained by the prosecutor's office on the above-mentioned date. Bearing in mind its findings concerning the Government's unjustified refusal to provide the documents from the case file and the fact that it had been incumbent on the law-enforcement bodies to report the information on the abduction to the district prosecutor's office (see Khalidova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a022877/04, \u00a7\u00a093, 2 October 2008), the Court cannot but conclude that the three-month delay in opening the investigation was attributable to the domestic authorities.

Furthermore, the applicant, having no access to the case file and not being properly informed of the progress of the investigation, could not have effectively challenged acts or omissions of investigating authorities before a court.
