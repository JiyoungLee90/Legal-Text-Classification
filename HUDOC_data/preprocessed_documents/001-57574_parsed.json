Furthermore, the employer\u2019s duty to respect this right did not include any obligation in principle to pay equal wages to union and non-union employees or to members of different organisations. The mere fact that different wages were accorded to different groups of employees did not by itself lead to the conclusion that a measure violating Section 3 had been employed. However, any favouring either of members of the organisation which reached agreement or of non-union employees, with the aim of exercising against the members of the other organisation the type of pressure envisaged in Section 3, would constitute a violation of that provision.",

Moreover, no recognised norms existed for determining such sectors, and the concept of representation was ambiguous and disputed. The Court then referred to the State\u2019s failure to negotiate an agreement which would exclude retroactivity to all non-union employees within the sectors in which SACO and SR were representative. In this respect the Court considered that the facts of the case did not support the conclusion that this failure showed any intention on the part of the State to violate the right to organise. Otherwise, the State would, as soon as one federation organised industrial action, be barred from upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in any other way than by refusing retroactive validity for agreements concluded with respect to all employee organisations. Such a general limitation of the State\u2019s possibilities of upholding the principle could not be based on Section 3 of the 1936 Act.",

The Court indicated that the plaintiffs\u2019 view concerning the State\u2019s purpose in its treatment of non-union officials might have appeared more reasonable if it had been possible to show that the large majority of non-union officials were active within the main field of activity of SACO and SR. Conversely, it would be less reasonable to take notice of the treatment of the group of non-union officials if these could primarily be classified within the field of recruitment of SF and TCO-S.

Such a right, which is enunciated neither in Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) nor even in the Social Charter of 18 October 1961, is not indispensable for the effective enjoyment of trade union freedom and in no way constitutes an element necessarily inherent in a right guaranteed by the Convention.",

Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) nevertheless leaves each State a free choice of the means to be used towards this end. The grant of a right to strike represents without any doubt one of the most important of these means, but there are others. Such a right, which is not expressly enshrined in Article 11 (art. 11), may be subject under national law to regulation of a kind that limits its exercise in certain instances. The Social Charter of 18 October 1961 only guarantees the right to strike subject to such regulation, as well as to \"further restrictions\" compatible with its Article 31, while at the same time recognising for employers too the right to resort to collective action (Article 6 para. 4 and Appendix). For its part, the 1950 Convention requires that under national law trade unionists should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11 (art. 11), to strive through the medium of their organisations for the protection of their occupational interests. Examination of the file in this case does not disclose that the applicants have been deprived of this capacity.",

While the granting of retroactivity of salary increases or other benefits in itself falls outside the scope of Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) (cf. paragraph 34 above), in the present circumstances it is linked to the exercise of a right guaranteed by the said provision, namely the freedom to protect the occupational interests of trade union members by trade union action. The Swedish State has in fact selected collective bargaining, the concluding of collective agreements and the recognition of the right to strike as three of the means of making possible the conduct and development of such action by trade unions in both the public and private sectors. Moreover, it was in the wake of a strike, following bargaining and within the framework of a collective agreement that the Office adopted the conduct complained of by the applicants. Accordingly, Article 14 (art. 14) is pertinent in the present context. In connection with both this question and the criteria to be adhered to, the Court refers to the judgments it delivered in the \"Linguistic\" case (23 July 1968, Series A no. 6, pp. 33-35, paras. 9-10) and, subsequently, in the National Union of Belgian Police case (27 October 1975, Series A no. 19, pp. 19-20, paras. 44-47).",
