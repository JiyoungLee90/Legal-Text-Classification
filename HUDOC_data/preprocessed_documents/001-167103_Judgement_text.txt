The case originated in three applications (nos. 5969/09, 51884/10 and 38785/13) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals and one Tadjik national, Mr Andrey Vladimirovich Ryzhikov, Mr Vyacheslav Nikolayevich Pronoza and Mr Saydmurod Bekovich Abdurakhmonov (“the applicants”), on 30 December 2008, 13 August 2010, and 16 May 2013 respectively.
Mr Ryzhikov was represented by Ms P. Tamakulova, a lawyer practising in Yekaterinburg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The applicants’ complaints concerning the length of pre-trial detention were communicated to the Government.
The applicants were prosecuted in Russia for various crimes. They were arrested and detained pending investigation and trial. Their detention was ordered and extended by the courts. The detention orders were essentially based on the gravity of the charges, the primary grounds being the risk of the applicants’ absconding and interfering with the course of justice. The detention and extension orders used stereotyped formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures.
The first applicant was born in 1973 and lived, prior to his arrest, in Yekaterinburg, Sverdlovsk Region. In 2007 the applicant was arrested in Ukraine. On 24 May 2008 he was extradited to Russia and was placed in pre-trial detention until 27 December 2010 when he was released on bail. On 22 April 2011 the Kirovskiy District Court of Yekaterinburg convicted him of fraud.
The second applicant was born in 1978 and lived, prior to his arrest, in Angarsk, Irkutsk Region. On 23 September 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On 25 September 2007 the court remanded him in custody. On 24 June 2010 the Irkutsk Regional Court convicted the applicant of fraud.
The third applicant was born in 1967 and lived, prior to his arrest, in Yekaterinburg. The applicant was arrested on 16 August 2012. On 17 August 2012 the court held to place him in pre-trial detention. On 10 October 2013 the Sverdlovsk Regional Court convicted the applicant of trespass, battery, robbery and sexual assault.
