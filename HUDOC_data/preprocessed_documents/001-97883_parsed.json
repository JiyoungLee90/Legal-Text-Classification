She also noted that she was still unsure whether she had seen her son's body when she had been asked to verify the identity of the body found on 14 June 2001. She mentioned the absence of a number of marks which her son had had on his body and that she had been pressured into saying that it was her son's body. She also mentioned that her son had complained of violence among the soldiers. It appears that the applicant's complaint was forwarded to the Buiucani District Court. According to the applicant, she was presented with a corpse in an advanced state of decomposition which she was not sure to have identified as her son. Moreover, the photos of the corpse suggested that the victim had received a blow to the head and revealed two strangulation marks, suggesting that he had been hanged from the tree after being asphyxiated. She expressed her doubts to the authorities and asked for an exhumation in order to verify that information, but this was refused.",

In particular, V. I.'s interests had not been represented, the applicant having been treated only as a witness and not as the victim's representative as required by law. That omission had prevented the applicant from exercising her procedural rights under Article 47 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d, see paragraph 18 below), taking into account that she had a number of objections to the manner in which the investigation had been carried out. The applicant's rights had not been explained to her by the investigators, in violation of Article 51 CCP (see paragraph 18 below). The court found that, contrary to legal requirements, the investigation had not analysed fully and objectively the circumstances of the case. The court also found a discrepancy between the post-mortem psychiatric expert report, which apparently found that V. I. had had suicidal tendencies, and the decision taken only several months earlier by the medical commission finding him fit for military service and not disclosing any concerns about his psychological health. The court annulled the decision of 28 December 2001 and ordered a further investigation by the military prosecutor's office.",

According to the court, the investigators had failed to verify whether I. C. had in fact had any information relevant to the case and what the source of that information had been. The court also noted that the applicant had challenged the validity of the autopsy and that the prosecutors were concerned more with finding materials denigrating her late son than looking for the perpetrators.

As to the obligation to keep the applicant informed, this was not required by law since, in the absence of a crime, she had not been recognised as a victim's representative.

This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that a person was killed by an agent of the State. The mere fact that the authorities have been informed of the death will give rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances in which it occurred (see Sabuktekin v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a027243/95, \u00a7\u00a098, ECHR 2002II (extracts); Kavak v. , no.\u00a053489/99, \u00a7\u00a045, 6 July 2006; and Al Fayed v.

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident (see, for example, Salman v.

The Court considers that it is first of all for the domestic investigating authorities to decide on the need to perform specific investigative measures. Moreover, they have a certain discretion in deciding whether to carry out such measures (see Al Fayed, cited above, \u00a7 82), especially when the latter are not obviously necessary for the type of crime concerned or when a repetition of investigative measures already performed is requested, as was the autopsy in the present case.",

The possibility to fully exercise these procedural rights ensures that the victim's point of view is taken into account by the judicial authorities in deciding on various aspects of an investigation, even if the decisions eventually taken are not in line with the expectations of the victim or his/her representative (compare Al Fayed, cited above, \u00a7 82).",

This was true even if the investigation concerned suicide and not murder, since it had to be verified whether the crime of incitement to suicide had been committed (see paragraph 12 above). The domestic courts expressly found that the applicant had been deprived of the possibility of exercising her procedural rights and that she had not been informed of those rights (see paragraph 11 above). The Court has no reason to doubt the domestic courts' interpretation of the law, which is moreover consistent with the State's obligations under Article 2 of the Convention.

This lack of information included the important initial phase of the investigation, during which the applicant could have raised her most serious objections regarding the decisions taken. In this connection, it is to be noted that the applicant expressly emphasised the need for a quick decision on exhumation in order to dispel her doubts, which she could not effectively request from the investigator in the absence of any information concerning the case.

Even assuming that the applicant received the summons in due time, despite her unchallenged statement to the contrary, the Court considers that the seriousness of the complaints made required the court to at least verify whether the applicant had in fact lost interest in the case or waived her right to be heard. In this connection, the Court notes that the summons mentioned that the parties' presence was mandatory, which is hard to reconcile with the lack of any form of verification of the reason for one party's absence. The applicant's presence was even more important in view of the fact that whatever the decision of the Buiucani District Court, it was final and not subject to any form of appeal.
