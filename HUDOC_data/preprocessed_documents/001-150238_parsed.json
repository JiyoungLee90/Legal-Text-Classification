It is true that a\u00a0considerable number of hearings were scheduled and that most of the adjournments were caused by reasons which could not in themselves be attributed to the trial court (see paragraphs 13-19 and 40 above). However, the duty to administer justice expeditiously was incumbent in the first place on the domestic authorities (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0130, ECHR 2000XI).
