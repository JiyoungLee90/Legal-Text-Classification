The Commission\u2019s Delegates recognised that the fact, asserted by the Government that in 1976 Jeffrey was not scheduled to take the above-mentioned examinations was relevant as regards the level of any future employment. They also regretted that he had not reacted to the suggestion by the Government that he should seek enrolment on a training course which they would provide free of charge. However, the Delegates considered both in their initial and in their final observations, that Jeffrey\u2019s suspension negatively affected his career \"to a measurable degree\"; they saw his claim as comprising elements of material and moral damage, for both of which he was entitled to compensation in an amount to be determined by the Court.",

The Court, in considering this claim, has not overlooked the fact that the incident which led to Jeffrey\u2019s suspension was the breach by him of the school\u2019s disciplinary rules. Nevertheless, his suspension from school was both out of proportion to the disciplinary offence committed and, as the Court found in its judgment of 25 February 1982, in violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) to the Convention.",

                                "content": "The extent to which Jeffrey suffered material damage is even more problematical. It is true that, in the normal course of events, an individual who has not had the full benefit of educational opportunities will be likely to encounter greater difficulties in his future career than one who has. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that, even had the suspension not occurred, Jeffrey\u2019s schooling would probably have led to no more than a limited qualification. Moreover, the entire responsibility for his situation cannot be attributed to the respondent State: Jeffrey does not appear to have pursued to the full the possibility of undertaking further study and training, and he did not react to the suggestion made by the Government in this connection (see paragraph 24, sub-paragraph (b), above). Again, whilst he did make some attempts to earn a living on a self-employed basis, he remained for a considerable period unregistered with the local employment exchange. Finally, it has to be recognised that in the current economic situation even many of those who have completed their education and training experience problems in finding employment. The Court therefore concludes that, whilst the suspension may well have contributed to the material difficulties which Jeffrey encountered, it cannot be regarded as the principal cause thereof.",
