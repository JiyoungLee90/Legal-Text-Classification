Lastly, the nine-month period between 23 May 2005 and 1\u00a0March 2006 corresponding to the applicants' so-called appeal against the rejection of their petition for review, which was not recognised under the law and thus futile, must be attributed to them (see paragraph 8 above).

Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.

However, having regard to its finding under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (paragraph 12 above), the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine separately whether there has also been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Zangh\u00ec v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A no. 194-C, p. 47, \u00a7\u00a023).",

However, these cases were terminated on 26 February 1998, 31\u00a0March 1999 and 23 May 2005, respectively, that is, more than six months before the date of introduction of the application. The applicants' so-called appeal against the Supreme Court's decision, not recognised under the law, was no effective remedy in the circumstances and did not influence the running of the six-month time-limit. Lastly, the applicants submitted that the court decisions adopted so far in the case concerning the constitution of a contract amounted to a breach of their rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court notes that this case is still pending before the Supreme Court, a circumstance rendering this complaint premature. In any event, it is satisfied that the lower courts adjudicated a civil-law dispute between private parties in proceedings devoid of any appearance of arbitrariness. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded.
