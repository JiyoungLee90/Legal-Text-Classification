The case originated in an application (no. 26529/10) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of , Ms Amira Bobić (“the applicant”), on 30 April 2010.
The applicant was represented by Muhić & Others, a law firm based in . The Bosnian-Herzegovinian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
The applicant complained, in particular, of the non-enforcement of a decision of 27 June 2007 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the ”) in her favour.
On 16 December 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Bijeljina.
From 1979 until 1992 she worked as an accountant in a socially-owned catering company (“the company”) in Bijeljina, in what is today the Republika Srpska. During the 1992-95 war the company dismissed all its employees of Bosniac and Croat origin, including the applicant. The relevant decision reads as follows:
“Given the special nature of the services performed by the company, all employees of Bosniac and Croat origin should no longer come to work from 22 July 1992”.
Following unsuccessful civil proceedings pursued by the applicant against the company, on 4 May 2000 she appealed to the Human Rights Chamber (a domestic human-rights body set up under Annex 6 to the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace).
In 2002 the company was privatised.
On 27 June 2007 the Constitutional Court (which inherited the cases of the Human Rights Chamber) ordered the Republika Srpska (one of the two Entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina) the following: first, to secure the applicant’s reinstatement within three months of the date of delivery of that decision; second, to pay her outstanding salary for the period from 13 December 1996 (when the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the company) until 27 June 2007, together with default interest at the statutory rate and all work-related benefits, as well as to continue to pay the applicant her salary and all work-related benefits until her reinstatement; and third, to pay the applicant 20 convertible marks (BAM) per working day starting from the date of delivery of that decision until her reinstatement. The Republika Srpska was to pay default interest on the above amounts at the annual rate of ten percent from the expiry of the three-month period until settlement.
On 23 August 2007 the Republika Srpska Government transmitted the decision of 27 June 2007 to the company for enforcement. On 25 September 2007 the company informed the Republika Srpska Government that the decision could not be enforced because the applicant’s post no longer existed. It claimed, furthermore, that it was not its responsibility to enforce the decision since it had not been a party to the proceedings before the . On 23 October 2007 the Republika Srpska informed the company that, in accordance with Rule 56 of the Rules of the  (see paragraph 15 below), it was indeed the company’s duty to enforce the decision of 27 June 2007.
On 15 June 2010 the Republika Srpska paid the applicant BAM 16,807.47 in respect of the third order from the Constitutional Court’s decision for the period until 10 June 2010 (the principal debt in the amount of BAM 13,380 and default interest on that sum in the amount of BAM 3,427.47). It would appear that it has continued to pay the amount of BAM 20 per working day since then.
On 8 December 2010 the  held that the third order from its decision of 27 June 2007 had been enforced. It further held that the first order had not been enforced, but that its non-enforcement was justified. In this connection, it relied on the reasoning which the company had provided to the Republika Srpska Government (see paragraph 10 above). Lastly, the  did not say anything as regards the second order.
At its session of 9 March 2011 the Republika Srpska Government concluded that it was the company’s responsibility to enforce the Constitutional Court’s decision of 27 June 2007, and not the responsibility of the Republika Srpska.
Under Article 239 of the Criminal Code 2003 (published in Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“OG BH”) nos. 3/03, 37/03, 32/03, 54/04, 61/04, 30/05, 53/06, 55/06, 32/07 and 8/10), non-enforcement of a decision of the Constitutional Court is a criminal offence:
“An official of the State, the Entities or the Brčko District who refuses to enforce a final and enforceable decision of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Human Rights Chamber, or the European Court of Human Rights, or who prevents the enforcement of any such decision, or who frustrates the enforcement of any such decision in some other way, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of between six months and five years.”
Rule 56 of the Rules for processing the cases of the former Human Rights Chamber (published in OG BH no. 38/07), as well as Rule 74 § 1 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court (published in OG BH nos. 60/05, 64/08 and 51/09) provides that the decisions of the Constitutional Court are final and binding on every legal and physical person. Furthermore, Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of the  provides that all public bodies have a duty to enforce its decisions within their respective competence as established in the Constitution and the law.
