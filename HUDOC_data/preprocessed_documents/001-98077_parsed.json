While reporting and commenting on court proceedings, provided that they do not overstep the bounds set out above, contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that hearings be public, it is to be noted that the public nature of court proceedings does not function as a carte blanche relieving the media of their duty to show due care in communicating information received in the course of those proceedings (see Council of Europe Recommendation No.\u00a0Rec(2003)13 on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings; outlined in Flinkkil\u00e4 and others v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-46). In this connection, the Court notes that the Finnish Guidelines for Journalists, as in force at the relevant time, stated that the publication of a name and other identifying information in this context was justified only if a significant public interest was involved (see Flinkkil\u00e4 and others v. Finland, cited above, \u00a7 41).",

The article also included pictures of A. and B. as well as of A.'s wife and children. Linked to this article there was a news clip which was entitled \u201cB. danced samba without A.\u201d. It contained only a few lines but B.'s name, together with her picture, and the fact that she had been convicted for having assaulted A.'s son were mentioned in the clip.

As B. had taken an active and willing part in the events of 4\u00a0December 1996, leading to A.'s conviction and dismissal, it is difficult to see how her involvement in the events was not a matter of public interest. Even though the articles in question focused also on other issues than the incident, the Court considers that there was a continuing element of public interest involved also in respect of B. In this connection, the Court also notes that the national authorities reached different conclusions as to whether B. could be considered as having waived her right to privacy when choosing to become involved with a public figure and in being a party to the incident, leading also to her conviction. In the Court's opinion this indicates that, at least to some degree, the national authorities also considered that the public interest was engaged in the reporting.",

The severity of the sentence and the amounts of compensation must be regarded as substantial, given that the maximum compensation afforded to victims of serious violence was approximately FIM 100,000 (EUR\u00a017,000) at the time (see Flinkkil\u00e4 and others v.

In general, the reasoning in the District Court's and the Appeal Court's judgments in the present case is quite extensive. As far as the reasoning concerns the restrictions on freedom of expression, the courts stated in very detailed manner that the facts mentioned in the article were those to which the protection of private life typically applied, that B.'s position in society was not such that the exception for public figures applied to her, and that neither the incident nor the fact that her identity had been revealed earlier led to any other conclusion.
