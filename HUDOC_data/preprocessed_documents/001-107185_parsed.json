In this connection, the Court expresses, once again, its serious concern with yet another example of this malpractice, according to which, despite the initial arrest in respect of a more serious criminal charge, the investigative authorities, thereafter, \u201cartificially\u201d decrease the severity of the charge in order to classify it under an article of the Criminal Code which would not require them to ensure obligatory legal representation of the suspect.",

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant\u2019s position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court\u2019s findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.\u00a028957/95, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2002-VI; Lukenda v.

This obligation has been consistently emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments (see, for example, ResDH(97)336, IntResDH(99)434, IntResDH(2001)65 and ResDH(2006)1). In theory it is not for the Court to determine what measures of redress may be appropriate for a respondent State to take in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. However, the Court\u2019s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a shortcoming found in the national system of protection of human rights (see Driza v.\u00a0Albania, no. 33771/02, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2007XII (extracts)).",

In the case Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v.
