The court found that the search had been carried out on an order issued by the prison authorities under section 91(2) of the Bavarian Execution of Sentences Act (see paragraph 30 below) to the effect that one prisoner out of five was to be strip-searched on that day. As the order did not permit such a search to be dispensed with in a particular case, it constituted a disproportionate interference with the detainee\u2019s personality rights (allgemeines Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrecht) under Article 2 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law read in conjunction with Article 1.",

In order to strike a fair balance between the detainee\u2019s personality rights and respect for his privacy on the one hand, and the prison\u2019s security interests on the other hand, it would have been necessary for the search order to permit the prison staff to dispense with a strip search in cases where an abuse of visiting rights by the prisoner concerned was very unlikely.
