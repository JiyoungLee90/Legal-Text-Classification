In the absence of an effective remedy the Court concludes that it was the very act of quashing the final judgment of 10\u00a0March 1999 that triggered the start of the six-month time-limit for lodging this part of the application to the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Sardin v. Russia (dec.), no. 69582/01, ECHR 2004-II). The Court further notes that the quashing of a final judgment is an instantaneous act, which does not create a continuing situation, even if it entails a re-opening of the proceedings as in the instant case (see Sitokhova v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a055609/00, 2 September 2004). In the present case the final judgment of 25 October 2004 in the part which had allegedly not been enforced was quashed by the Presidium of Pskov Regional Court on 12 March 2004, and ceased to be binding and enforceable. There is nothing in the present case to suggest that the applicant had not been aware of the judgment by 5 August 2004, the date of the examination of the Commissariat\u2019s extraordinary appeal against the amended judgment at the , at latest. However, it was not until 7 December 2005, more than six months after the decision had been quashed, that the applicant complained to the Court that the authorities had failed to enforce the judgment in the part providing for index-linking of the award.",
