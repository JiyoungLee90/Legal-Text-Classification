After securing the surroundings of an apartment building, the police officers knocked on the door of a flat on the 12th floor of the building, in the presence of the building manager and asked the suspects to open the door in order to check their identities. One of the suspects opened the door an inch and closed it immediately stating that he would bring the identity papers. The suspects then proceeded to hang the flag of the illegal organisation from the window of the flat and to shout slogans. They also set fire to some furniture in the flat. At that point the police were unaware of the number of suspects. An ambulance was brought to the scene. The suspects were told to surrender themselves and to open the door of the flat.",

It stated, inter alia, that the operation had lasted for more than nine hours and that throughout this time the police officers had repeatedly ordered the deceased to surrender. Relying on the evidence given by the witnesses and considering the mindset of the police officers during the operation, the court concluded that the police officers had had no intention to kill the militants since they had brought an ambulance to the scene of the incident before the operation and had asked them to surrender by megaphone several times. The police officers had opened fire only after the deceased had started firing on them. With reference to the ballistics report issued by the Forensic Institute, the court also found that the deceased had discharged 700 bullets and the police officers had discharged 420 bullets.

Then they had started a fire in the flat and opened fire on the police officers, following which a team led by R.A. had decided to enter the flat considering that the militants would not surrender. The police team had opened the flat door using an explosive. The militants had started firing on the police officers and the clash which followed had resulted in the death of the three militants. The police officers had found a number of documents belonging to the illegal organisation, weapons, ammunition and partly burned banknotes at the scene of the incident. The evidence submitted by the parties led the court to conclude that the police officers had acted in selfdefence. The fact that the operation had started at 11 p.m. and ended next day at 8 a.m. and that the militants had repeatedly been asked to surrender indicated that the police officers had had no intention to kill. The court attached importance to the fact that the police officers\u2019 statements were consistent as regards the course of events.",
