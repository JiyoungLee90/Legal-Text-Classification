The Constitutional Court found that these provisions could not be interpreted as allowing for the transfer of such facilities to local authorities without payment to creditors during insolvency proceedings, of reasonable and fair compensation which is able to secure a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. The court further held the said provision to be unconstitutional in so far as it allowed the property transfer without effective judicial control.",

While liquidation proceedings may objectively justify some limited delays in enforcement, the continuing non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant\u2019s favour for seven or eight years could hardly be justified in any circumstances.
