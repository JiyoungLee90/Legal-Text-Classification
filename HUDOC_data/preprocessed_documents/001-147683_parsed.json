Indeed, the case was of certain complexity; in particular the Court is aware that it concerned a criminal group consisted of six members, that the group operated on the territory of Poland and abroad, there was a number of witnesses to be heard including two anonymous witnesses whose hearings were not depended exclusively on the trial court\u2019s schedule.
