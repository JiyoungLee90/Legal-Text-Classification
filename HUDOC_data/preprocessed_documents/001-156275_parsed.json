The judge examined the material brought before him and, with the assistance of an Arab-speaking interpreter, heard evidence from the applicant. The applicant explained that he had applied for asylum in Russia, but had left as he realised that he would not receive it. He had crossed the border illegally and had identified himself by giving another name in order not to be deported back to Russia. The applicant was not assisted by a lawyer. The judge concluded that there were grounds to detain him as his identity had not been determined and there were reasons to consider that he had misused the asylum procedure. He had arrived in Latvia from a country, where his life had not been endangered and where he had applied for asylum; these facts evidenced that he misused the asylum procedure. On the same date, the applicant lodged an appeal (one page) against that decision in English, stating in simple terms that he had received the court\u2019s decision and wished to appeal against it. He submitted that he had been in danger in Russia and had been ill; he expressed the wish to be granted refugee status in Latvia and undertook to provide all his documents as soon as possible. On 13\u00a0May 2013 his appeal was sent for translation; on 7 June 2013 a translation was received. On the same date, the appeal, its translation and the case file were forwarded to the Latgale Regional Court (Latgales apgabaltiesa) and the applicant was informed that a single judge would examine his appeal following a written procedure; the applicant could submit further observations within forty-eight hours.

The judge concluded that there were grounds to consider that the applicant attempted to misuse the asylum procedure.

The applicant\u2019s lawyer was not present, but the judge examined her written request to release the applicant on account of the fact that he had provided his identity documents and had not misused the asylum procedure. She argued that the applicant could be placed in an open and specialised institution \u2013 an accommodation centre for asylum seekers in Mucenieki. The judge disagreed and concluded that there were grounds to detain the applicant under section 9(1)(2) of the Asylum Law. The fact that his application for asylum was accepted for examination did not indicate that he would comply with the requirements arising from the asylum procedure as he testified that he would again apply for an asylum in another European country in case he received a negative decision in Latvia, which was contrary to the applicable procedure. In such circumstances, it was impossible to predict his further actions if placed in an open accommodation centre; there was a possibility that he might leave Latvia and thereby obstruct the asylum procedure as he had already done in a safe third country (see paragraph 6 above). On the same date, the applicant lodged an appeal (one page) against that decision in Latvian, stating that there was no evidence that he had misused the asylum procedure, might leave the country or obstruct the asylum procedure. He disputed the relevance of the fact that he had applied for asylum in Russia as it was not a safe third country. His appeal was forwarded to the Latgale Regional Court together with the case file. On 15\u00a0July 2013 the applicant was informed that his case would be examined on 30 July 2013 by a single judge following a written procedure; it was explained that the applicant could submit further observations within forty-eight hours. That information was handed to him by the State Border Guard Service and he signed to acknowledge receipt of its translation on 18\u00a0July 2013.",

She referred to the findings of the city court to the effect that there were grounds to believe that the applicant might misuse the asylum procedure. There was evidence that he had left Russia after several months and without awaiting a final decision in response to his application for asylum. Upon arrival in Latvia, he had withheld his real identity. It was due to diligent work of border guards that his identity could be established. Moreover, the applicant admitted that he had left Russia because he believed that his application for asylum would be refused; he also admitted that he would attempt to obtain asylum in another European country if it was refused in Latvia. Therefore, the judge upheld the conclusion of the lower court that it was impossible to predict the applicant\u2019s further actions upon release. The decision was drafted in Latvian, but its contents were explained to the applicant. On 6\u00a0August 2013 he signed the decision, confirming that it had been explained to him in English; he respected the decision and agreed with it.",

During the hearing, the applicant explained that he would continue to pursue the asylum proceedings; he was aware of the relevant procedures and duties, he would not leave Latvia until the end of the asylum procedure. The judge concluded that the applicant misused the asylum procedure on the same grounds as indicated in the previous decisions and that he should remain in detention. With reference to section 9\u00a0(3) of the Asylum Law, the judge noted that the time-limit for his detention had not yet expired. The applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision, as the Asylum Affairs Division was due to make a decision in less than one month and his previous experience had shown that detention appeals took about one month to be examined.",

The applicant lodged appeals against the decisions of 10 May and 8 July 2013, but not against the decision of 6 September 2013. The applicant\u2019s argument before the domestic courts was that there was no need to detain him as he had provided identity documents and there was no reason to consider that he had misused the asylum procedure. Those arguments were examined by the domestic courts at first and second instance. There is nothing in the case file indicating that the appellate court, if repeatedly confronted with the issue, would take a different stance on this issue. In view of the fact that the applicant\u2019s status was due to be decided in less than one month and that the domestic courts had taken approximately one month to examine his previous appeals, the Court considers that it cannot be held against the applicant that he chose not to pursue appellate proceedings in so far as the 6\u00a0September 2013 decision was concerned.",

In this connection, the Government referred to the CPT\u2019s conclusions following its 2011 visit, which described the material conditions there as \u201cvery good\u201d (see paragraph 33 above). They admitted that the domestic authorities had taken almost five months to examine the applicant\u2019s asylum application.

The State Border Guard Service had taken approximately one and a half months to complete the inquiry, carry out the interviews, establish the applicant\u2019s identity and collect other data. Once all the information had been collected, it was forwarded to the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs, who examined it and granted the applicant subsidiary protection status. There were no periods of unjustified inactivity attributable to the authorities.

Three days later a judge authorised his detention for a further two months on the same grounds, which decision was upheld on appeal. Subsequently, on 8 July and 6 September 2013 the judge reviewed the lawfulness of his detention and concluded that even though his identity documents had been obtained in the meantime, there were reasons to believe that the applicant might still misuse the asylum procedure. His further detention was authorised under section\u00a09(1)(2) of the Asylum Law. The Court rejects the applicant\u2019s argument that his detention from 4 to 7 October 2013 was unlawful, because he was detained under a valid detention order issued by the judge on 6\u00a0September 2013 (see paragraph 28 above).

The national courts found that, initially, the applicant\u2019s identity had not been determined. Subsequently, during the second set of review proceedings, the argument was raised that the applicant\u2019s identity had been established, but the judge of the Daugavpils (City) Court rejected it, since there was evidence that the applicant might leave the country and misuse the asylum procedure. That decision was upheld on appeal (see paragraphs 26 and 27 above). Accordingly, the Court finds that the national authorities acted in good faith in detaining the applicant during the period underlying the detention orders. The Court also considers that the national authorities acted in good faith in detaining the applicant from 4\u00a0to 7 October 2013. The Court is mindful of the practical implications arising from the need to inform and formally notify an asylum seeker of a decision regarding his application; it considers that a period of three days cannot be considered arbitrary in the circumstances of the present case, where this period fell over a weekend and where the relevant decision-making and enforcement authorities were located in different cities. Moreover, the Court notes that, according to domestic law, the decision to grant subsidiary protection status entered into effect only when the applicant was notified of it (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 38 above). As soon as that decision took effect, on 7 October 2013, the applicant was immediately released given that the grounds for his detention had ceased to exist (see paragraph 30 above).",

Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2000\u2011III). Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in appeal proceedings (see, among many other authorities, Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23 November 1993, \u00a7 28, Series A no. 273B). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before a court of appeal (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25\u00a0October 2007). In order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings were conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction. As is the case for the \u201creasonable time\u201d stipulation in Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the question whether the right to a speedy decision has been respected must be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case, including the complexity of the proceedings, the conduct by the domestic authorities and by the applicant and what was at stake for the latter (see Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7 106, 9 July 2009 and the cases cited therein). The Court must, in particular, examine whether any new relevant factors that had arisen in the interval between periodic reviews were assessed, without unreasonable delay, by a court with jurisdiction to decide whether or not the detention had become \u201cunlawful\u201d in the light of those new factors (see Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11, \u00a7 215, 2\u00a0October 2012).",

As noted in paragraph 69 above, while States are not required to set up courts of appeal to review the lawfulness of detention, should they choose to do so, the appeal court also has to comply with the requirement of \u201cspeediness\u201d. It is incumbent on the judicial authorities to make the necessary administrative arrangements to ensure that urgent matters are dealt with speedily, and this is particularly necessary when the individual\u2019s personal liberty is at stake (see S.T.S. v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a0277/05, \u00a7 48, ECHR 2011 and the case-law cited therein).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, these were rather straightforward matters, and it has not been argued by the parties that the case itself disclosed any features of particular complexity, necessitating detailed investigation and warranting lengthy consideration. Nor was it argued that proper review of the applicant\u2019s detention had required, for instance, the collection of additional observations and documents (contrast with Longa Yonkeu, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43 and 157, where a hearing was held before the appellate court).",
