Russia (dec.), no. 68798/01, 5\u00a0February 2004). At the same time, an analysis of Articles 113, 115 and\u00a0116 of the CCP suggests that, whichever specific method is chosen to notify the parties, the domestic courts should be in possession of evidence confirming the receipt of such notification by the addressee (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Government adduced no evidence of receipt by the applicant of the notification about the appeal hearing (compare Prokopenko v. Russia, no. 8630/03, \u00a7 18, 3 May 2007). In these circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the domestic authorities notified the applicant of the appeal hearing in accordance with domestic law and in such a way as to provide him with an opportunity to attend it and prepare his case.",
