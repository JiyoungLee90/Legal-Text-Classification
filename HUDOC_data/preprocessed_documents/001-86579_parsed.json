As regards adjournments of hearings, the Court notes that, although on a number of occasions it was the applicant who requested them demanding additional documents or presence of witnesses, the final discretion as to whether to grant such requests always remained with the judicial authorities, who bear ultimate responsibility for management of their proceedings so that they are expeditious and effective (see e.g. Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0183, ECHR 2006-...). Additionally, regard being had to the reasons adduced by the appellate court for remittals of the case for a fresh consideration and the correspondence between the Tsentralno-Misky Court and the defendant\u2019s chief officer (see paragraphs 13-14 above), it appears that before September\u00a02001 little had been done to ensure submission of comprehensive information by the defendant, who was a State entity, as well as employer of most of the witnesses.",
