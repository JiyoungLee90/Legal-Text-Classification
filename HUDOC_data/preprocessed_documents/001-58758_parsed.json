He told me that I had put sand in Mr Vildeuil's tractors, and I said that that was not true ... He then said that he would go and get my wife. I said no, because, knowing my wife, I was sure that she would have refused to follow him out of fear and she would have been worried.

He then shoved and punched me, saying that I had been trying to leave and would not have come back \u2013 even though I had turned up at the station as requested. I told him to let go of me and we went back to the station. He continued to grip me more and more firmly while pushing me about, and flung me on to the front doorstep with a judo throw. The officer called two of his colleagues, who arrived straight away. They were wearing shorts but were bare-chested. One of them sat astride me and twisted my arm behind my back, another put his foot on my head, and the third one, after fetching a bag of handcuffs and passing it to the one who was sitting on my back, held my feet. They handcuffed me, put the chain around my neck and fastened it to my other arm. I was lying on the ground, practically strangled by the chain. ... The officers then sent me to the cell, where I remained until the next day without anything to eat ... They let me out the next day, 30 September, and handcuffed me to a chair leg. The police officer questioned me again and asked me ... if I had put sand in a tractor. I said no ... The officer called me a liar and a thief ... I didn't argue and I said that I [had] rights. He made fun of me and made me sign a piece of paper, without even reading out what he had written on it. I signed the document without knowing what it was about, not only because of my reading difficulties but also because of his threatening tone, everything I had just gone through and the worsening pain in my shoulder...\u201d",

At his request I issued a detailed medical certificate ... On the same day I ordered an X-ray of his cervical vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae and right shoulder. On 3 October 1988 the patient brought back the X-rays ... The examination did not reveal any lesions to the bones or joints. I saw Caloc again on 12 October 1988 at his request; as his right shoulder was still causing him pain, I prescribed additional medical treatment. On 29 October 1988, since the medical treatment had not alleviated the pain, I referred him to the physiotherapist. I should add that as on 29 October 1988 Mr Caloc complained of his left shoulder, I ordered an X-ray of that shoulder; the results did not indicate any lesions to the bones or joints. I prescribed treatment for the left shoulder only. My client followed the course of treatment and in fact the physiotherapist informed me that the treatment had had a beneficial effect.

The allegation is, moreover, wholly incompatible with the standard official design of security cells, and [the applicant] was confused about the matter at the general confrontation on 12 September 1994. The fact that [the applicant] did not complain of any pain to Dr\u00a0Thomas [at his medical examination while in police custody] but did to Dr K\u00e9clard two days later does not necessarily mean that any violence occurred in the intervening period since, as the three doctors interviewed on 26 March 1993 pointed out, pain is sometimes not felt until two to three days afterwards. Nor were the confessions of 30 September necessarily the result of ill-treatment meted out the night before. [The applicant] was entirely at liberty to retract them shortly afterwards. Yet he did not do so until the hearing on 13 March 1989 [in the criminal proceedings against him], having in the meantime confirmed them to other police officers and a member of the State legal service. There is therefore no proof at all that [the applicant] was ill-treated after the police officers' initial efforts to restrain him; only at that time was he subjected to any violence ...\u201d",

Was the violence used to apprehend Mr Caloc proportionate, considering that he was suspected of a trivial act, had come on his own initiative to the police station, had no previous criminal record and only wanted to leave the police station to get clarification of a possible misunderstanding in a context where some of the policemen were ignorant of the local language? Did the police act responsibly when they asked a doctor to ascertain whether Mr Caloc was fit to undergo detention, without emphasising the violence used when Mr Caloc had been arrested, when one bears in mind that this violence had, in their opinion, been of such a serious nature that the authorities later alleged that it was in itself the cause of Mr Caloc's three days of total incapacity and nineteen days of unfitness for work? According to Rule 24 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, a medical officer must see and examine every prisoner with a view particularly to the taking of all necessary measures. A common-sense inference from the fact that Dr Thomas made absolutely no reference to this violence, the applicant's fall, etc., in his report does not lend any persuasive weight to later statements by the authorities (based on a statement of late January 1992 by one of the policemen involved) that this violence was the sole reason why the doctor was asked to see and examine the applicant. If that had been the case, it could also have been expected that it would have been recorded that the applicant complained of nothing despite the fall and the violence. Furthermore, would it not in itself amount to inhuman treatment if in those circumstances the police used the opinion of the medical expert, whom they had not informed of the earlier violence, to justify Mr Caloc's detention notwithstanding their own knowledge? And, lastly, the Government are, in my opinion, also responsible for the cumulative effect on Mr Caloc's health of the violence used for apprehending him, the shortcomings of the medical examination of the person arrested, leading to his being declared fit to undergo detention, and the detention under the actual circumstances. The general principle in international law, based on the general consensus of contemporary thought, is that whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law-enforcement officials shall \u201cexercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved\u201d (see Principle 5(a) of the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials).",

                        "content": "My concerns in the case are not allayed when the Government plead that Mr Caloc was detained in a completely bare security cell with no holes in the walls other than for ventilation (the diameter of those holes was only slightly larger than that of a cigarette), so that Mr Caloc could not have been shackled to the wall as he submitted to the Court. Detention under such circumstances may in itself amount to degrading if not also inhuman treatment. The lack of light in the cell contravenes Rule 11 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Why the applicant had to be handcuffed when he was detained in this kind of cell also merits some explanation. The information provided by the Government does not suffice to bring this treatment of the applicant into line with Rule 33 of the Standard Minimum Rules, on instruments of restraint. Moreover, it would have been easy for the Government to provide the Court with photographs of the detention facility used, and not leave the Court with almost nothing but general references to all detention facilities in Martinique having been inspected and found to meet standard requirements.",
