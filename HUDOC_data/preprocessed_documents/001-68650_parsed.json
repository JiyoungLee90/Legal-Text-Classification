It clearly transpired from that context that the applicant had not accused J.K. of stealing, or of any intention to steal. What the applicant blamed J.K. for was that, by becoming a member of the election committee and by carrying out this work for remuneration, he had deprived other inhabitants of Wodzis\u0142aw, who were worse off financially, of the possibility of earning additional income. The amount to be received by J.K. for his work in the committee represented, in the economic conditions prevalent in the municipality at that time, a significant purchasing power. It was only fair, the applicant stressed, that this amount should have been paid to other persons, not to the councillors, who in any event were at the same time in receipt of considerable remuneration for their work in the municipal council as elected political representatives of the community. The applicant emphasised that the value judgments contained in the leaflet could be considered as being quite harsh because of their provocative form, but the applicant's purpose was to draw the attention of the public to the shortcomings of the acts of councillors, including J.K.",

The issues involved in the case related to the principles which should govern their conduct, and in particular whether it was appropriate at all that they should use their \u2013 paid - public office as an opportunity to enrich themselves by allocating to themselves further, temporary but paid, functions in the public service. In the Court's opinion, these are important issues which may give rise to a serious public discussion concerning the rules of conduct applicable to elected representatives of the local community. Consequently, the principles concerning the scope of permissible criticism of politicians should apply to the present case.",
