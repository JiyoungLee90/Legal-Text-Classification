Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v. , no. 33354/96, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2001II, and Solakov v. \u201cthe \u201d, no. 47023/99, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2001X). As regards the exceptions, the Court, in Al-Khawaja and Tahery (cited above), referred to two requirements. First, there must be a good reason why the witnesses could not be examined by the accused and second, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, must be provided (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 119-47).",

However, there appears to be no indication in the 1983 MOA that such a request should have been made by the accused, nor that he or she needed to be informed about the court\u2019s intention to call a certain witness. Moreover, as can be seen in the applicant\u2019s case with respect to the hearing scheduled for 3\u00a0October 2005 (see paragraph 9 above), the examination of a witness could be scheduled prior to the hearing of the accused. The Court therefore finds that the applicant could not be blamed for failing to attend the first examination of the witness.",

The domestic courts justified the holding of the second examination in the absence of the applicant by referring to S.\u2019s coherent account of the incident, difficulties in summoning the applicant to her oral hearing and lack of significance of the evidence given by S. during the second examination (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above). While it is true that service of the summons concerning the applicant\u2019s hearing was repeatedly unsuccessful and that the applicant, even after being properly summoned, at first failed to appear before the court, this does not seem to be particularly relevant to the question of her presence at the examination of S. In this connection, the Court notes that the legal provisions of the 1983 MOA did not provide for an adversarial hearing but only for an oral hearing or questioning of the accused. As the Court has noted above, examination of witnesses appeared to be a separate procedural act, to which the accused was not automatically invited (see paragraphs 26 and 38 above). As regards the remaining grounds relied on by the domestic courts, the Court finds them equally unpersuasive. It notes that the local court must have been aware that the applicant, who challenged factual aspects of her case, had been unable to test the only witness and to cast doubts on her credibility during the first examination. Having regard to the nature of the issues decided in the impugned proceedings, which does not disclose any exceptional circumstances, the local court should have ensured that the applicant had an opportunity to question S. at least at her second examination, even more so since she had contested the account given by S. and had made an explicit request to cross-examine her.",
