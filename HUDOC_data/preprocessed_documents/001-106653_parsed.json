As to the number of participants, they have been interrogated, questioned and confronted within a relatively short period of time (see paragraph 8 above). The applicant\u2019s conduct does not appear to have significantly contributed to the length of the proceedings. On the other hand, the Court is of the opinion that the main delays have been caused by the lengthy examination of the case by the  (see paragraph 6 above) and by thirty adjournments of the hearings (see paragraph 8 above). In the latter respect, it observes that, even though the courts several times issued compulsory summonses for witnesses who failed to appear, they also had at their disposal other mechanisms to ensure the witnesses\u2019 presence in the hearings (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no.\u00a07324/02, \u00a7 31, 4 April 2006). It was not suggested by the Government that the courts had ever considered applying them. Nor did the majority of the compulsory summonses seem to have any effect (see Kobtsev v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 71). In light of the above, the Court concludes that the main responsibility for the protracted duration of the proceedings rests with the State.",
