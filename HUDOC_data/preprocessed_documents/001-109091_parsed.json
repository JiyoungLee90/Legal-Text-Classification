The need for care is decided by the municipal council of the place of his or her residence in cooperation with the founder of the residential care institution (the county governor). Individuals are admitted to care institutions in the event that the provision of social services at their home or at a non-statutory care establishment is not possible. A guardian who wishes to have a person admitted to a residential care institution must submit a request in writing to the social services department of the relevant municipal council. The reasons for and motives behind admission must be indicated. An administrative panel of the municipal council, comprising at least three persons, is empowered to decide on the proposed admission.

As a result, he or she enjoys the rights of an interested party, including the right to be duly informed of the place and time of any hearing. The fact that the case had been heard in the absence of D.L. \u2013 the person whom the court had been asked to declare incapacitated \u2013 was assessed by the Supreme Court as a violation of her right to be duly informed of the place and time of court hearings, as well as of other substantive procedural rights safeguarding her right to a fair trial. The Supreme Court also found that by failing to hear the person concerned and without making sure that she had been aware of the proceedings, the firstinstance court had breached the principle of equality of arms, as well as D.L.\u2019s right to appeal against the decision to declare her incapacitated, because the decision had not been delivered to her. The Supreme Court also referred to Principle no. 13 of Recommendation No. R (99) 4 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (see paragraph 85 below), stating that the person concerned should have the right to be heard in any proceedings which could affect his or her legal capacity. This procedural guarantee should be applicable to the fullest extent possible, at the same time bearing in mind the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In this regard, the Supreme Court also referred to the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that a mental illness could result in appropriate restrictions of a person\u2019s right to a fair hearing. However, such measures should not affect the very essence of that right (Golder, Winterwerp, both cited below, and Lac\u00e1rcel Men\u00e9ndez v. , no. 41745/02, 15 June 2006).",

Taking into consideration the fact that the declaration of a person\u2019s incapacity is a very serious interference into his or her right to private life, one can only be declared incapacitated in exceptional cases.",

It considers, however, that in many cases the fact that an individual has to be placed under guardianship because he lacks the ability to administer his affairs does not mean that he is incapable of expressing a view on his situation and thus of coming into conflict with the guardian. In such cases, when the conflict potential has a major impact on the person\u2019s legal situation, such as when there is a proposed change of guardian, it is essential that the person concerned should have access to court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation. Mental illness may entail restricting or modifying the manner of exercise of such a right, but it cannot justify impairing the very essence of the right, except in very exceptional circumstances such as those mentioned above. Indeed, special procedural safeguards may prove called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental health issues, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see, mutatis mutandis, Winterwerp, cited above, \u00a7 60).",

The Court also recalls that there is the importance of ensuring the appearance of the fair administration of justice and a party to civil proceedings must be able to participate effectively, inter alia, by being able to put forward the matters in support of his or her claims. Here, as with other aspects of Article 6, the seriousness of what is at stake for the applicant will be of relevance to assessing the adequacy and fairness of the procedures (see P., C. and S. v. the , no. 56547/00, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2002-VI).",

Even so, the Court cannot overlook the fact that back in 2000 the applicant did not participate in the court proceedings for her incapacitation. In particular, nothing suggests that the court notified the applicant of its own accord of the hearing at which her personal autonomy in almost all areas of life was at issue, including the eventual limitation of her liberty (see paragraph 12 above). Furthermore, as transpires from the decision of the Kaunas City District Court of 15\u00a0September 2000, it ruled exclusively on the basis of the medical panel\u2019s report, without having summoned the medical experts who authored the report for questioning. Neither did the court call to testify any other witnesses who could have shed some light as to the personality of the applicant. Accordingly, the applicant was unable to participate in the proceedings before the Kaunas City District Court in any form. Given that the potential finding of the applicant being of unsound mind was, by its very nature, largely based on the applicant\u2019s personality, her statements would have been an important part of the applicant\u2019s presentation of her case, and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Kovalev v. , no. 78145/01, \u00a7\u00a7 35-37, 10 May 2007; also see Principle 13 of the Recommendation No. R (99) 4 by the Council of Europe).",

Although health care officials had considered that her involvement in the proceedings relating to her initial placement under guardianship in 2000 was unnecessary, as she had apparently been unable to provide them with an objective opinion (see paragraph 11 above), she did in fact participate in the hearing relating to the change of guardian on 7\u00a0November 2005. Indeed, she not only stated unequivocally that she maintained her request that the guardianship proceedings be reopened and asked to be assisted by a lawyer but also made a number of other submissions about the proceedings and expressed a clear view on various matters. In particular, the applicant emphasised that she had not been summoned to the hearing during which her adoptive father had been appointed her guardian. She also expressed her desire to leave the K\u0117dainiai Home. Taking into account the fact that the applicant was an individual with a history of psychiatric troubles, and the complexity of the legal issues at stake, the Court considers that it was necessary to provide the applicant with a lawyer.",

What is more, the social services had also noted disagreement between the applicant and her adoptive father (see paragraph 18 above). Lastly, on at least one occasion the applicant\u2019s adoptive father had himself acknowledged their strained relationship (see paragraph 14 above). Accordingly, the Court finds merit in the applicant\u2019s argument that, because of the conflicting interests of her and her legal guardian, her guardian\u2019s lawyer could in no way have represented her interests properly. In the view of the Court, the interests of a fair hearing required that the applicant be granted her own lawyer.",

In particular, and turning to the spirit in which the hearing of 7 November 2005 was held, the Court notes that the judge refused a request by D.G. that an audio recording be made. Be that as it may, the Court is not able to overlook the applicant\u2019s complaint, although denied by the Government, that the judge did not allow her to sit near D.G., the only person whom the applicant trusted. Neither can the Court ignore the allegation that during the break the applicant was forced to leave the hearing room and to go to the judge\u2019s office, after which measure the applicant declared herself content (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above).

Be that as it may, the fact whether she is physically locked in the K\u0117dainiai facility is not determinative of the issue. In this regard, the Court notes its case-law to the effect that a person could be considered to have been \u201cdetained\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 even during a period when he or she was in an open ward with regular unescorted access to unsecured hospital grounds and the possibility of unescorted leave outside the hospital (see H.L. v. the , no. 45508/99, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2004-IX). As concerns the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the key factor in determining whether Article 5 \u00a7 1 applies to the applicant\u2019s situation is that the K\u0117dainiai Home\u2019s management has exercised complete and effective control by medication and supervision over her assessment, treatment, care, residence and movement from 2 August 2004, when she was admitted to that institution, to this day (ibid., \u00a7 91). As transpires from the rules of the K\u0117dainiai Home, a patient therein is not free to leave the institution without the management\u2019s permission. In particular, and as the Government have themselves admitted in their observations on the admissibility and merits, on at least one occasion the applicant left the institution without informing its management, only to be brought back by the police (see paragraph 29 above). Moreover, the director of the K\u0117dainiai Home has full control over whom the applicant may see and from whom she may receive telephone calls (see paragraph 81 above). Accordingly, the specific situation in the present case is that the applicant is under continuous supervision and control and is not free to leave (see Storck v. Germany, no. 61603/00, \u00a7 73, ECHR\u00a02005-V). Any suggestion to the contrary would be stretching credulity to breaking point.",

However, each case has to be decided on its own particular \u201crange of factors\u201d and, while there may be similarities between the present case and H.M., there are also distinguishing features. In particular, it was not established that H.M. was legally incapable of expressing a view on her position. She had often stated that she was willing to enter the nursing home and, within weeks of being there, she had agreed to stay, in plain contrast to the applicant in the instant case. Further, a number of safeguards \u2013 including judicial scrutiny \u2013 were in place in order to ensure that the placement in the nursing home was justified under domestic and international law. This led to the conclusion that the facts in H.M. were not of a \u201cdegree\u201d or \u201cintensity\u201d sufficiently serious to justify a finding that H.M. was detained (see Guzzardi, cited above, \u00a7 93).

The Government argued that the applicant lacked de jure legal capacity to decide matters for herself. However, this does not necessarily mean that the applicant was de facto unable to understand her situation (see Shtukaturov v. , no. 44009/05, \u00a7 108, ECHR 2008). Whilst accepting that in certain circumstances, due to severity of his or her incapacity, an individual may be wholly incapable of expressing consent or objection to being confined in an institution for the mentally handicapped or other secure environment, the Court finds that that was not the applicant\u2019s case. As transpires from the documents presented to the Court, the applicant subjectively perceived her compulsory admission to the K\u0117dainiai Home as a deprivation of liberty. Contrary to what the Government suggested, she has never regarded her admission to the facility as consensual and has unequivocally objected to it throughout the entire duration of her stay in the institution. On a number of occasions the applicant requested her discharge from the K\u0117dainiai Home by submitting numerous pleas to State authorities and, once she was given the only possibility to address a judicial institution, to the Kaunas City District Court (see paragraphs 34 and 37 above). She even twice attempted to escape from the K\u0117dainiai facility (see, a fortiori, Storck, cited above, \u00a7 73). In sum, even though the applicant had been deprived of her legal capacity, she was still able to express an opinion on her situation, and in the present circumstances the Court finds that the applicant had never agreed to her continued residence at the K\u0117dainiai Home.",

A medical panel of that hospital concluded that at that time the applicant suffered from \u201ccontinuous paranoid schizophrenia\u201d. The doctors\u2019 commission deemed it appropriate for the applicant to live in a \u201csocial care institution for the mentally handicapped\u201d. The Court further observes that soon thereafter a social worker concluded that the applicant was not able to live on her own, as she could not take care of herself, did not understand the value of money, did not clean her apartment and wandered in the city hungry. The Court also notes the social worker\u2019s testimony as to the unpredictability of the applicant\u2019s behaviour, given that sometimes she would get angry at people and shout at them without a reason (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). That being so and recalling the fact that the applicant had a history of serious mental health problems since 1979, the Court is ready to find that the applicant has been reliably shown to have been suffering from a mental disorder of a kind and degree warranting compulsory confinement and the conditions as defined in Wintertwerp had thus been met in her case. Furthermore, the Court also considers that no other measures were available in the circumstances. As noted by the social worker, the applicant\u2019s adoptive father, who was her legal guardian, could not \u201cmanage\u201d her (see paragraph 23 above). On this point the Court also takes notice of the fact that even being removed from institutional care and taken to her adoptive father\u2019s apartment, the applicant escaped and was found by the police only three months later (see paragraph 29 above). In these circumstances the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s compulsory confinement was necessary (see Stanev, cited above, \u00a7 143) and no alternative measures had been appropriate in the circumstances of the case. The Court lastly observes, and it has not been disputed by the applicant, that in situations such as hers the domestic law did not provide that placement in a social care institution would be decided by a court (see, by converse implication, Gorobet v. , no. 30951/10, \u00a7 40, 11 October 2011).",

In any event, the applicant had filed a number of complaints with the prosecutor\u2019s office and other authorities, which had unanimously concluded that her hospitalisation in the K\u0117dainiai Home had been carried out in accordance with the domestic law, thus being disinclined to take any action to override the will of her adoptive father, acting as her legal guardian.

However, that remedy was not directly accessible to her: the applicant fully depended on her legal guardian, her adoptive father, who had requested her placement in the K\u0117dainiai Home in the first place. The Court also observes that the applicant\u2019s current legal guardian is the K\u0117dainiai Home \u2013 the same social care institution which is responsible for her treatment and, furthermore, the same institution which the applicant had complained against on many occasions, including in court proceedings. In this context the Court considers that where a person capable of expressing a view, despite having been deprived of legal capacity, is deprived of his liberty at the request of his guardian, he must be accorded an opportunity of contesting that confinement before a court, with separate legal representation. Lastly, as to the prospect of an inquiry carried out by the prosecuting authorities, the Court shares the applicant\u2019s observation that a prosecutorial inquiry cannot as such be regarded as judicial review satisfying the requirements of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see Shtukaturov, cited above, \u00a7 124).",

Although the exact length of time that the applicant had been tied up for was not clear, it could have lasted for only fifteen to thirty minutes and had not continued any longer than necessary. During the incident the applicant had been forcibly injected with 10 mg of Haloperidol, whilst the average therapeutic dosage of the said medication is 12 mg. Haloperidol is a common antipsychotic medicament prescribed for individuals suffering from schizophrenia in order to eliminate the symptoms of psychosis. According to the generally accepted principles of psychiatry, medical necessity had fully justified the treatment in issue. The Government also drew the Court\u2019s attention to the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 31 July 2006 to discontinue the pre-trial investigation in connection with the applicant\u2019s forced restraint. They also noted the absence of any other similar incidents at the K\u0117dainiai Home in respect of the applicant.

Moreover, a request to annul an incapacitation decision could also be lodged by a prosecutor in the public interest. Nonetheless, as regards the applicant, the circumstances warranting her incapacitation have never disappeared as no amelioration of her mental state has ever been established that would give her guardian, be it her adoptive father or the K\u0117dainiai Home, or the prosecutor grounds to apply to a court for the reinstatement of her legal capacity.",

It also reiterates that the requirements of Article 13 are less strict than, and are here absorbed by, those of Article 6 (see, among many authorities, Kamasinski v. Austria, 19\u00a0December 1989, \u00a7 110, Series A no. 168). The Court further notes that, in analysing the fairness of the civil proceedings concerning the applicant\u2019s guardianship and the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s involuntary placement in the K\u0117dainiai Home, it has already taken account of the fact that the applicant is deprived of legal capacity and thus is not able to initiate any legal proceedings before the domestic courts. When analysing the above complaints, the Court has also noted that the other remedies suggested by the Government, be it a possibility to act through her guardians or a request by the applicant to complain to a prosecutor or her complaints to the social care authorities, have not been proved to be feasible in the applicant\u2019s case. This being so, having regard to its conclusions under Articles 5 \u00a7 4 and 6 of the Convention, the Court does not consider it necessary to re-examine these aspects of the case separately through the prism of the \u201ceffective remedies\u201d requirement of Article 13.",
