Officers may resort to these means in three cases: (i) for curtailing assaults; (ii) for repressing mass disorders or group violations of public order; and (iii) for apprehending those who persistently disobey or resist the officers (see paragraph 65 above). As regards the first ground, there is no indication that any of the applicants attacked officers or other detainees. It transpires that the transgressions for which truncheon blows were administered had been individual, rather than collective, in nature, which rendered the second ground inapplicable. Finally, even though some applicants appear to have disobeyed or resisted the officers\u2019 orders, no attempt was made to apprehend or arrest them.

Thus, it follows from the reports on use of rubber truncheons that the applicant Mr Pazleev refused to leave the cell which was to be searched and that the applicant Mr Dedovskiy refused to spread his arms and legs wide apart for a body search (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above). The Court accepts that in these circumstances the officers may have needed to resort to physical force in order to take Mr Pazleev out of the cell or to search Mr Dedovskiy. However, it is obvious that hitting a detainee with a truncheon was not conducive to the desired result, that is, facilitating the search. In the Court\u2019s eyes, in that situation a truncheon blow was merely a form of reprisal or corporal punishment. The punitive nature of such treatment was even more salient in the situation where the applicant was beaten for not changing his clothes or for not stating his name (see paragraphs 35 and 37 above).",

Given that the reports on the use of rubber truncheons did not list the name of the officer who administered the blows, the Court finds that the domestic authorities deliberately created a situation of impunity in which any identification of the officers suspected of inflicting ill-treatment was impossible and an investigation inadequate.",

Whereas the District Court acquitted Mr B. because he had exercised appropriate control over the lawfulness of their actions, the  exonerated him on the ground that he had not been able, or obliged, to control the conduct of officers in his absence.

While the civil courts in theory have the capacity to make an independent assessment of fact, in practice the weight attached to a preceding criminal inquiry is so important that even the most convincing evidence to the contrary furnished by a plaintiff would be discarded and such a remedy would prove to be only theoretical and illusory (see Menesheva, cited above, \u00a7 77, and Corsacov v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 18944/02, \u00a7 82, 4 April 2006).

Since the case file contains no documents referring to the report or citing from it, it is hardly conceivable that it was indeed reviewed in the domestic proceedings. As to its evidential value, the Court reiterates that in the proceedings before it, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment and that the conclusions it adopts are supported by the free evaluation of all evidence (see Nachova and Others v.  [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005...). For the purposes of Article 38 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the States Parties agreed to furnish all necessary facilities. It is therefore sufficient that the Court regarded the evidence contained in that report as crucial to the establishment of the facts in the present case (compare Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v. , no. 40464/02, \u00a7\u00a0137, 10\u00a0May 2007). For these reasons the Court considers the Government\u2019s explanations insufficient to justify the withholding of the document requested by the Court.",
