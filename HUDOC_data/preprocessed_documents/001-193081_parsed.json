That said, the Court has recognised in its case-law that, as an exception to the principle of territoriality, a Contracting State\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 1 may extend to acts of its authorities which produce effects outside its own territory (see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 62, Series A no. 310; Loizidou v.

Thus, whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to the situation of that individual (see Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, \u00a7 137, ECHR 2011).",

However, this specific complaint was not considered wellfounded by the Court and was declared inadmissible (see paragraph 4 above).

That said, the Court observes that the question of the State\u2019s responsibility for the alleged failure to safeguard the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s right to life was not, and could not have been, objectively addressed within the framework of the domestic proceedings concerning H.G.\u2019s individual criminal liability.",

It is true that the internal investigation carried out by the Ministry of Defence and the resultant disciplinary penalties imposed on the commanding officers in question appear not to have conferred any rights on the applicant as the victim\u2019s legal heir to initiate a procedure whereby he could have obtained an official acknowledgement of the State\u2019s failure to protect the life of his son and claimed any compensation for the moral damage suffered. However, the Court considers that the imposition of disciplinary penalties in respect of those found liable for the incident could be considered to have constituted an admission by the State\u2019s superior military command of the failure to protect the life of the applicant\u2019s son and hence an acknowledgement of the breach. That said, the Court notes that, contrary to the Government\u2019s claim, there is nothing to indicate that the applicant has received any monetary compensation for nonpecuniary damage suffered as a result of the loss of his son (see paragraph 81 below). In these circumstances the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s claim that the authorities afforded redress for the breach and therefore considers that the second condition for an applicant\u2019s loss of victim status has not been met in the present case.",

However, the positive obligation is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct (see Keenan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, ECHR 2001III).",

Such rules must require the adoption of practical measures aimed at the effective protection of conscripts against the dangers inherent in military life and appropriate procedures for identifying shortcomings and errors liable to be committed in that regard by those in charge at different levels (see Mosendz, cited above, \u00a7 91; Perevedentsevy v. Russia, no. 39583/05, \u00a7 94, 24 April 2014). Furthermore, the States are required to secure high professional standards among regular soldiers, whose acts and omissions \u2013 particularly vis-\u00e0-vis conscripts \u2013 could, in certain circumstances, engage their responsibility, inter alia, under the substantive limb of Article 2 (see, in particular, Abdullah Y\u0131lmaz v.

In this sense the context of the present case differs from the majority of cases where the Court examined whether or not the State complied with its positive obligation to take operational measures to prevent a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from materialising (see, for example, Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 115-122, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII; Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, \u00a7 57-64, ECHR 2002II).

As noted above, the Court is prepared to accept that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the disciplinary proceedings against the commanders of the military unit constituted an admission by the domestic authorities and therefore an acknowledgment by them of the breach of the State\u2019s positive obligation to protect the right to life of the applicant\u2019s son (see paragraph 63 above).",
