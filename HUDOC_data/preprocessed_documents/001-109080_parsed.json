In its decision of 22\u00a0June\u00a02005, the Court of Appeal considered, as relevant to the case before the Court, that although the police could admittedly have proceeded more effectively with the investigation, too much time had passed (the events in issue, i.e. the malicious registration of motor vehicles, had taken place between November 1995 and March 1997) to expect any viable investigation to be conducted by the authorities concerned. The Court of Appeal therefore dismissed the appeal, but it nevertheless noted that it was in favour of the course of action as advised by the Advocate-General, namely a complete remission in a single administrative act (eenmalige sanering) of all (administrative) sanctions imposed on the applicant which were an effect of the malicious registrations. According to the applicant\u2019s representative, no such remission took place. Moreover, the Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) initially prevented the applicant from being eligible for debt rescheduling under the Debt Rescheduling (Natural Persons) Act (Wet Schuldsanering Natuurlijke Personen).",

In fact, he had only applied for a replacement driving license in 1997 and he had waited until 2004 before taking any demonstrable effective action on the vehicle registrations.
