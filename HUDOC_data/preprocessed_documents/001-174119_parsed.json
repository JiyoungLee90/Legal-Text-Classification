In those circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that the situation under scrutiny falls within the category of cases of incitement (see, mutatis mutandis, Trifontsov v. Russia (dec.), no. 12025/02, \u00a7 32, 9\u00a0October 2012, and Lyubchenko v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 34640/05, \u00a7 33, 31 May 2016). Furthermore, the summary nature of the applicant\u2019s line of defence did not prevent the courts from conducting scrutiny and assessing the facts of the case from the incitement angle in order to dismiss the said allegations on the basis of evidence contained in the criminal file (see paragraphs\u00a028, 29 and 34 above).",

However, it has also emphasised that the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State. Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim. They owe a general duty of obedience to the State\u2019s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, \u00a7\u00a056, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-III, and B\u00e1t\u011bk and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 54146/09, \u00a7\u00a046, 12 January 2017).",
