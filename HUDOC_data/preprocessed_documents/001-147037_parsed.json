Tension occurred again when the applicant resisted his handcuffing. His right arm might have been broken when his arms were twisted behind his back.

Furthermore, in assessment of the overall picture, the applicant\u2019s earlier improper behaviour towards his son and former wife cannot be overlooked. The Court attaches weight to the facts that the police had previously visited the applicant\u2019s flat to handle disputes between the applicant and his former wife (see paragraph 10 above), that the applicant had received an administrative fine for domestic violence (see paragraph 11 above); and that when the applicant\u2019s son was examined by a psychologist and interviewed at the juvenile department of the city council he gave negative information and opinions concerning the applicant, specifying dangerous behaviour of the latter (see paragraph 31 above).",
