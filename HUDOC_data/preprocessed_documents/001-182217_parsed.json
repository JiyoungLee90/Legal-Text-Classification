Chapter 25 of the CCP and the Judicial Review Act both provided that a citizen had a possibility to lodge a complaint before a court about an act or decision by any State or municipal authority or official if he considered that the act or decision had violated his rights and freedoms (Article 254 of the CCP and section 1 of the Judicial Review Act). The complaint might concern any decision, act or omission which had violated the citizen\u2019s rights or freedoms, had impeded the exercise of rights or freedoms, or had imposed a duty or liability on him (Article 255 of the CCP and section 2 of the Judicial Review Act).

He pointed out that Article 49 of the Constitution provided that everyone should be presumed innocent until his or her guilt had been proven by a final criminal judgment. That principle was applicable to the CAO, in particular having regard to the European Court\u2019s approach in applying the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention to the CAO or to similar cases. In this connection he referred to Mikhaylova v. Russia (no.\u00a046998/08, 19\u00a0November 2015). Noting that the Convention was an integral part of the Russian legal system and had \u201cpriority over national statutes when they conflict\u201d, he stressed that Russia\u2019s obligations under Article 6 of the Convention required strict compliance with the presumption of innocence, both in criminal cases and in cases under the CAO. In his view, the safeguards referred to by the majority of the court were not sufficient to ensure respect of the presumption of innocence and appeared to sit ill with the constitutional guarantee of judicial protection of rights and judicial protection against unfair prosecution and punishment. In fact, although it dealt with less serious cases, the CAO was stricter than the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which a sentence of imprisonment was only executed following an appeal judgment.",

It is also noted that the proceedings under the CAO, including recourse to the administrative-arrest procedure, concerned an offence under Article 20.1 of the CAO punishable by administrative detention. It appears that under Russian law the applicability of the special rules of Article 1070 \u00a7 1 and Article 1100 of the Civil Code concerning State liability in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by administrative arrest was connected to the question of whether the person was prosecuted for an offence punishable by administrative detention (see paragraph 75 above). At the same time, it is noted that Mr Bgantsev was convicted of the offence by a final judgment. This fact appeared to be an obstacle to bringing a case seeking compensation for the administrative arrest related to such a conviction (compare the civil courts\u2019 findings in paragraphs 31-33 above in respect of Mr\u00a0Andreyev who had been convicted and paragraphs 38-40 and 46-47 above in respect of Mr Torlopov and Mr Dragomirov, whose prosecution had been discontinued). The Government have not suggested that this approach, as demonstrated by Mr Andreyev\u2019s case, was taken as a result of an erroneous interpretation of Russian law. Thus, the respondent Government have not demonstrated that in 2010 Mr Bgantsev had any prospect of success in bringing a civil claim for compensation under Article\u00a01070 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Article 1100 of the Civil Code. The Court has no reason to consider that the general tort remedy under Article 1070 \u00a7 2 in conjunction with Article 1069 was available or appropriate in the circumstances of the case (compare Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a042525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0113-14 and 229, 10\u00a0January 2012). Lastly, as regards the judicial-review challenge under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it appears established that it was not available where a defendant had been convicted of an administrative offence (see paragraph\u00a074 above). Consequently, the Government have not convincingly demonstrated that Mr Bgantsev could bring such proceedings and has not complied with the exhaustion requirement.",

Thus, in the present case the Court is not prepared to dismiss the complaint for failure to exhaust domestic remedies. Furthermore, the Court is satisfied that the administrative arrest of the applicant was based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a traffic offence. The remaining submissions are not detailed. Accordingly, Mr\u00a0Svetlov\u2019s complaint concerning his administrative arrest is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

It was only in 2009 that the Constitutional Court first confirmed the availability of a compensatory remedy in respect of administrative arrest in cases where the penalty of detention had been incurred (see Makhmudov v.

For its part, the Court notes that Articles 127 and\u00a0301 of the Criminal Code proscribe the unlawful deprivation of liberty and the manifestly unlawful recourse to the arrest procedure or the procedure for remand in custody; Article 286 of the Code proscribes abuse of power by a public official (a statutory provision frequently used, for instance, in relation to complaints arising in the context of use of force by the police, with or without a related issue concerning deprivation of liberty, see Aleksandr Andreyev v. Russia, no.\u00a02281/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a034-45 and 47-51, 23\u00a0February 2016). Consequently, in the particular circumstances of the case (see paragraph 10 above), the Court does not find it unreasonable or devoid of any prospect of success that the applicant chose to lodge a criminal complaint (see, in the same vein, Annenkov and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a031475/10, \u00a7 106, 25 July 2017).

Russia (dec.), no. 17767/06, \u00a7\u00a060, 22\u00a0March 2016).",

Thus, it may be appropriate to take into account, for the purpose of the six-month rule, subsequent proceedings in 2012 and 2014 in which certain applicants sought compensation for allegedly unlawful or unjustified arrest or escorting to the police station. Therefore, even though the deprivations of liberty complained of by Mr\u00a0Andreyev and Mr Torlopov ended more than six months before the dates on which their applications were lodged, the Court concludes that they have complied with the six-month rule. In particular, Mr Andreyev cannot be reproached for having tried to obtain compensation in respect of his administrative arrest (despite his final conviction for an administrative offence) before bringing a case before the Court. At the time, the availability of that remedy was questionable but not clearly without any prospect of success and the applicant made a reasonable attempt to comply with the exhaustion requirement.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. The \u201cquality of the law\u201d implies that where a national law authorises a deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness. The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, as a recent authority, Del R\u00edo Prada v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a042750/09, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2013).

The Court considered in that case that the Government had not convincingly shown that the general ban on holding public events at certain locations was proportionate to the legitimate aim of ensuring public safety and preventing disorder. Taking into account the absolute nature of the ban, coupled with the local executive authorities\u2019 wide discretion in determining what was considered to be \u201cin the immediate vicinity\u201d of court buildings, the Court concluded that the general ban on holding public events in the vicinity of court buildings was so broadly drawn that it could not be accepted as compatible with Article 11 \u00a7 2.",

As clarified by the Constitutional Court in 2007 and the Supreme Court of Russia in 2009, and as confirmed by the reviewing court in the applicant\u2019s case, it was particularly pertinent to look at the actual borders of plots of land assigned to and actually used by a specific court (see paragraph 82 above).

The Court reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d, unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention. Redress so afforded must be appropriate and sufficient, failing which a party can continue to claim to be a victim of the violation (see Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 181, ECHR 2006V, and Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. , \u00a7 72, ECHR 2006V). The Court is not satisfied that this award constituted adequate and sufficient redress in respect of the impugned detention. The award was by no means comparable to what could be awarded under Article 41 of the Convention (see, for the approach, Scordino (no.\u00a01), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 181 and 202, and Rakhimberdiyev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 47837/06, \u00a7 42, 18 September 2014 in a comparable situation; see also paragraph 203 below). Thus, the applicant was a victim of the alleged violation concerning his administrative detention when he lodged the application before the Court (see, in the same vein, Novikova and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 217-18).",

A subsequent finding that the court erred under domestic law in making the order will not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention. For this reason, the Court has consistently refused to uphold applications from individuals convicted of criminal offences who complain that their convictions or sentences were found by the appellate courts to have been based on errors of fact or law (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 42, Reports 1996III).

Instead, he has argued that on 6 September 2015 he had been de facto placed in such conditions as to be unable to make his own arrangements for his defence at the trial, in particular by retaining a lawyer. The Court observes that the pre-trial and the trial proceedings spanned the period from 4 to 6\u00a0September 2015, when the applicant was deprived of his liberty. It is uncontested that his mobile telephone was seized after the arrest. At the same time, there is no allegation that the applicant was not aware or that he was not made aware of his right under Article\u00a027.3 \u00a7 3 of the CAO to request that his family or defence counsel be informed of his whereabouts; that he made such request or that any such request was refused. The respondent Government have not contested that the applicant had no access to mobile telephone during the trial and have not specified whether during a short adjournment at the trial, the applicant could have contacted a lawyer of his choice by other means. Thus, it has not been demonstrated that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for obstructing the defendant\u2019s wish as to his choice of legal representation (see Dvorski v. Croatia [GC], no.\u00a025703/11, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 2015). Therefore, it is appropriate to proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the proceedings (ibid.).",

While it is by no means decisive, it is noted that prior to the impugned proceedings the applicant had already been prosecuted for similar offences under the same type of procedure. In this particular context and in the absence of any allegation to the contrary, the Court is prepared to assume that he was aware of the possibility to remain silent and not to incriminate himself. In the context of the present case and the above considerations, this does not necessarily mean that he had \u201cadequate time and facilities\u201d and could properly defend himself, in view of the chosen line of defence. Nevertheless, it is significant that the applicant has not specified, and it does not follow from the available material, what specific elements of his defence were hindered in the circumstances of the case. In particular, there is no indication that he unsuccessfully applied to have witnesses heard or that he could not adduce evidence. It is also noted that he did not choose to retain counsel on appeal and did not lodge any motions or requests before the appeal court. In his statement of appeal he merely mentioned that he had had difficulties with legal assistance since no law firm would be open on a Sunday.",

One of the factors, which drove the Court to that conclusion, was the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime (no. 25498/94, \u00a7\u00a7 9496, ECHR\u00a02000X; see also Enea v.

Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011). Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 requires, inter alia, that the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and any doubt should benefit the accused (see Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v.\u00a0Spain, 6 December 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 67-68 and 77, Series A no. 146). Thus, the presumption of innocence will be infringed where the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 54, Reports 1996I, and Telfner v. Austria, no.\u00a033501/96, \u00a7 15, 20\u00a0March 2001). The Court made the following findings relating to Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02, albeit in the context of the alleged violation of the presumption of innocence on account of remarks by a public official (see Konstas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36):",

The question thus arises whether the principle of the presumption of innocence could have been prejudiced at that stage of the proceedings. The Court considers that Article\u00a06 \u00a7 2 of the Convention by no means prevented the competent authorities from referring to the applicant\u2019s existing conviction when the matter of his guilt had not been finally determined. Clearly, the applicant\u2019s conviction at first instance is the objective element at the centre of the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, regard being had to Article 10 of the Convention, Article 6 \u00a7 2 can neither prevent the authorities from informing the public about the criminal conviction concerned, nor prevent discussion of the subject by the media or the general public or, as in the present case, in the course of a parliamentary debate (see, mutatis mutandis, Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7 38, and Papon v.\u00a0France (no.\u00a02) (dec.), no. 54210/00, ECHR 2001XII).

Furthermore, in other cases where the domestic courts had not determined the question of guilt by a final judgment, the European Commission on Human Rights has explained that it is the essence of the principle of presumption of innocence that it can only be invalidated by a final conviction in accordance with the law (see Englert v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a010282/83, Commission\u2019s report of 9 October 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 31, p. 11, \u00a7\u00a049, and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff v.

Accordingly, and in the light of the foregoing, it considers that the presumption of innocence cannot cease to apply in appeal proceedings simply because the accused was convicted at first instance. To conclude otherwise would contradict the role of appeal proceedings, where the appellate court is required to re-examine the earlier decision submitted to it as to the facts and the law.

It is in relation to this period that the Court stated that continued detention could be justified in a given case only if there were actual indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighed the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention; the national judicial authorities must, with respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts militating for or against the existence of the above-mentioned requirement of public interest or justifying a departure from the rule in Article 5, and must set them out in their decisions on applications for release (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-91). It results from the above that once a charge has been determined, \u201ceven if only by a court of first instance\u201d and a sentence of detention \u201cimposed\u201d, a detained defendant is considered \u2013 in terms of Article 5 of the Convention \u2013 to be deprived of liberty within the meaning of its paragraph 1(a). It follows from the above that Article 5 of the Convention does not preclude that detention after a trial judgment may be considered as arising from the sentence consisting in a deprivation of liberty.",

Article 13 of the Convention does not compel Contracting States to set up a second level of appeal in this type of case. It is sufficient that there is at least one domestic remedy which fully satisfies the requirements of this Article, namely that it provides for independent and rigorous scrutiny for a complaint relating to Article 3 of the Convention and has automatic suspensive effect in respect of the impugned measure (see S.K. v.

In our view, the Court made an award for non-pecuniary damage that is too low in comparison with other cases. In Denisenko v.\u00a0Russia, for example, the applicant complained that his detention from 15 to 20 July 2004 was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention (no.\u00a018322/05, \u00a7\u00a09, 14\u00a0February 2017). The Government denied the allegation and claimed that the applicant, although arrested at 2 p.m. on 15 July, was released at 9\u00a0p.m. that same evening (ibid., \u00a7 11). The police failed to draw up a record of the applicant\u2019s arrest, without which it was impossible to tell whether or not the applicant had been detained until the time he claimed or released on the day he was arrested. Nevertheless, the Court noted that, although it remained unclear whether the applicant was indeed detained during the days he claimed, he had at the very least, based on the Government\u2019s version, been \u201cdeprived of his liberty from 2 p.m. until 9 p.m. for seven hours in total\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 14). Accordingly, the Court \u201cfound a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention and awarded the applicant EUR 7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage\u201d (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21).",

Russia (nos. 35919/05 and 3346/06, 14\u00a0June 2016), the Court\u2019s reason for making an award was the lack of a formal record of the arrest. These cases illustrate that, even where the Court has upheld a claim of non-pecuniary damage based on procedural shortcomings of otherwise seemingly lawful arrests, the awards have been larger than in the present case, where the Court has found a substantive violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1.",
