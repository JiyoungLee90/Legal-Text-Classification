In a partial judgment of 20 March 1996, the District Court ordered the plaintiffs to restore the applicant’s flat to its original state and to pay damages.

The couple’s request was dismissed by the first- and second-instance Land Registries.
On 8 December 1997 the applicant informed the Csongrád County Land Registry of her intention to exercise her right of pre-emption and buy the flat in issue.
