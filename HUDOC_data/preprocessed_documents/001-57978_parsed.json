The Government pointed out that the parties - the applicant and Petrogal - had exercised their procedural rights on an equal footing through their counsel.  In such proceedings the Deputy Attorney-General, one of the members of the Attorney-General\u2019s department in the highest grade, could not be equated with a party.  Given the special features of the system of intervention by the Attorney-General\u2019s department at the Supreme Court in employment cases, the considerations set out in the Borgers judgment were not applicable in the instant case. The member of the Attorney-General\u2019s department in its capacity as an institution of the judicial system had no other duty than to assist the court by giving a completely independent, objective and impartial written opinion super partes on the legal issues raised.  In this way he contributed to ensuring good administration of justice.  The objective function of amicus curiae discharged by the Deputy Attorney-General as a guarantor of the consistency of the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law and protector of the public interest in employment cases was known to the public and especially to lawyers.  It could not be said that because he drew up an opinion based strictly on the law, the Deputy Attorney-General became \"objectively speaking\" an \"ally\" or an \"opponent\" (see the Borgers judgment previously cited, p. 32, para. 26).  The fact that one of the parties was a State-owned concern that had subsequently become a public limited company in which the State was the majority shareholder had no bearing on the assessment of whether the principle of a fair trial had been complied with.  Petrogal had its own organs.  In cases such as the instant one, section 59 of the Institutional Law governing the Attorney-General\u2019s department (see paragraph 17 above), which had been cited by the applicant, did not authorise the Minister of Justice to give instructions concerning the task of the Attorney-General\u2019s department.",
