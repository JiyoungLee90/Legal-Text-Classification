Romania (no. 26082/05, \u00a7 30, 26 June 2012), the Court had the opportunity to examine the scope of the High Court\u2019s powers when examining appeals in cassation similar to the one lodged in the present case, namely after a first appeal had already been decided by a lower court. It found that proceedings before the High Court were full proceedings governed by the same rules as a trial on the merits, with the court being required to examine both the facts of the case and questions of law. The High Court could decide either to uphold the applicant\u2019s acquittal or convict him, after making a thorough assessment of the question of guilt or innocence. If the necessity to hear evidence directly arose from the circumstances of the case, the High Court could refer the case to a lower court in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time (see paragraph 14 above).",

The court was thus called upon to make a full assessment of the applicant\u2019s guilt or innocence regarding the charges against him since the same evidence directly heard by the lower courts had been used both to convict and to acquit him (see paragraphs 7 and 9 as well as 11 above). The court re-tried the case, reexamined the evidence and gave it a fresh interpretation (see paragraph 13 above).",
