The rest of the time they use a bucket to satisfy their physiological needs. Hygiene is rather poor: the prison premises, including the canteen and kitchen, are infested with cockroaches and rats. The food is of inadequate quality and insufficient quantity. The medical service in the prison lacks even the most basic medical supplies.

The cells used to accommodate those serving life sentences in the high-security units were small. Exceptions were two larger cells (approximately 9 m\u00b2 each) with a fully partitioned sanitary annex, which was in principle a far more satisfactory arrangement. The cells accommodating life-sentenced prisoners were in the same advanced state of dilapidation and insalubrity as the rest of the prisoner accommodation. The situation was compounded by damage in some cells resulting from leaking sewage pipes. On a positive note, cell windows at Burgas Prison had been replaced a few years earlier and access to natural light was adequate. That said, artificial lighting was kept on all night, obliging inmates to improvise lampshades to dim the light. Lifesentenced prisoners could shower twice a week and were released six times a day to go to the toilets. They had to use buckets the rest of the time. As for the common sanitary facilities, they were in an extremely poor state of repair and filthy.",

The Committee concluded that the situation demonstrated a persistent lack of action by the authorities to improve conditions in the prison system. Only a very small proportion of prisoners serving life sentences were allowed to associate with other prisoners. The material conditions of the high-security units were particularly poor and inadequate, as was the regime of activities. Prisoners serving life sentences could have TV and/or radio sets in their cells, as well as books, newspapers and (sometimes) DVD players and playstations. In several respects the conditions of detention at Burgas and two other prisons were so unacceptable that they could be considered as inhuman and degrading.",

Most were no longer handcuffed while moving within their units. However, they were usually handcuffed during medical examinations. The situation concerning healthcare was as dramatic as the one found during the 2012 visit: the healthcare team consisted only of a dentist, a feldsher and a nurse, while the two posts of general practitioner and psychiatrist had remained vacant.",

In the public statement, the CPT referred to its finding during an ad hoc visit it had made to Bulgaria in early 2015. In particular it noted that the vast majority of inmates still had no access to organised out-of-cell activities and were left in a state of idleness for up to 23\u00a0hours per day. In terms of material conditions, the CPT observed that, in Burgas Prison and the two other establishments visited in 2015, the conditions remained characterised by an ever-worsening state of dilapidation. Most of the sanitary facilities were totally decrepit and unhygienic, and the heating systems functioned for only a few hours a day. The kitchen remained filthy and unhygienic and infested with vermin, with leaking and overflowing sewage pipes, and walls and ceilings covered in mould. Most parts of the prison were unfit for human accommodation and represented a serious health risk to both inmates and staff. In the CPT\u2019s view, the material conditions alone could be seen as amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment. This state of affairs highlighted a persistent failure by the Bulgarian authorities to address most of the fundamental shortcomings in the treatment and conditions of detention of persons deprived of their liberty, despite the specific recommendations repeatedly made by the CPT. The CPT was of the view that action in this respect was long overdue and that the approach to the whole issue of deprivation of liberty in Bulgaria had to radically change.",

Also, the automatic segregation of life prisoners from the rest of the prison population and from each other, in particular where no comprehensive outof-cell activities or in-cell stimuli are available, may in itself raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Savi\u010ds v. Latvia, no. 17892/03, \u00a7\u00a0139, 27 November 2012). Furthermore, isolation must be justified by particular security reasons (see Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 204 with further references to soft-law instruments and the repeated emphasis in CPT reports on the need to assess life prisoners\u2019 dangerousness on a caseby-case basis as there is no justification for indiscriminately applying restrictions to all prisoners subject to a specific type of sentence).",

The point in dispute concerns the period during which they have been detained in isolation. While the applicants claimed that they had been locked up under the same restrictive conditions ever since they had been transferred to Burgas Prison in 2002, the authorities submitted that they had been imprisoned under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d as of 2008 when their sentences became final.",

The Court then observes that the first-instance domestic court sentenced the applicants to whole life imprisonment in December 2004 and that this sentence became final in 2008. The Court finds no reason to consider that the relevant applicable ordinance was not applied in respect of the applicants as of December 2004 when they had been first sentenced to whole life imprisonment; the authorities have not asserted otherwise. Consequently, even though the applicants may have been formally detained under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d only as of 2008, their being placed in permanently locked cells and separated from the rest of the inmates in practice represented isolation of a comparable nature and degree to that applied under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d. Therefore, the Court finds that as of December 2004 the applicants have been imprisoned under similar conditions to those under the \u201cspecial regime\u201d.",

While they stated that the applicants could take part in collective activities, apart from mentioning the library and the prison chapel, they did not specify what those activities were, or their frequency. The Court notes in this connection the CPT\u2019s findings in its reports on its 2012, 2014 and 2015 visits to Burgas Prison, namely that there appeared to be little or no structurally planned intervention on the part of staff to attempt to provide appropriate mental and physical stimulation to life prisoners and that the vast majority of inmates had no access to organised out-of-cell activities and were left idle for up to 23 hours a day. It appears that this situation is to a great extent a result of the automatic application of the legal provisions regulating the applicants\u2019 prison regime. In its recent judgment in Harakchiev and Tolumov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 203-09), the Court found that such automatic isolation, even in application of the relevant statutory provisions, was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention.

Even accepting that the two larger individual cells with separate sanitary annexes (mentioned in the CPT report on its 2012 visit, see paragraph 14 above) referred to the cells in which the two applicants have been held, the Court observes that the CPT reports of 2012 and 2014 support the applicants\u2019 submissions about the extremely poor hygiene and state of repair of the cells and other areas of Burgas Prison. Furthermore, the CPT found during its 2015 visit to Burgas Prison that the premises were decrepit, infested and filthy to the point of being unfit for human accommodation and that this represented a serious health risk for both inmates and staff; it concluded that the material conditions alone could be seen as amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment (see paragraph 19 above).",

The amount of time spent by the person concerned in these conditions is the most important factor for assessing the extent of this damage (see Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, \u00a7 172, 10 January 2012, and Torreggiani and Others v.

By contrast, the finding of a violation may in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction for a breach of Article 13 of the Convention flowing from the lack of effective domestic remedies in respect of such conditions (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 173).",
