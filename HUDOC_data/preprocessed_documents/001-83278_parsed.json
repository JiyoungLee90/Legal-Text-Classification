The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

In particular, the Court cannot but agree with the applicant's argument that despite the fact that a number of eyewitnesses, and above all officers Dzh. and G., whose statements were referred to by the Government, pointed out that Aslanbek Kukayev had been apprehended by federal servicemen and even indicated the military unit to which they had belonged and its location and emblem, it does not appear that any meaningful efforts were made to investigate the possible involvement of the aforementioned personnel in the abduction and murder of the applicant's son. Furthermore, it does not appear, and the Government did not submit any relevant information in this regard, that any examination was ever carried out either of the place where the applicant's son had been abducted, or of the place where his dead body was discovered, or that any expert tests or examinations were conducted. In this latter connection, the Court is sceptical about the Government's statement to the effect that on 23\u00a0April\u00a02001 the corpses of Aslanbek Kukayev and D. were examined by forensic experts, who drafted a report on its results in May 2001, as the Government did not produce this report or any other relevant documents on this subject.",

Even assuming that this allegation is true, the Court notes the Government's failure to explain such a considerable delay in taking one of the most essential steps in the investigation, which would have afforded minimum procedural guarantees to the applicant. It is also clear in this connection that before the decision to grant the status of victim was allegedly taken, he had been unable to study the case file as he had no procedural rights to participate in the investigation.

Moreover, the Government have not demonstrated that this remedy would have been capable of providing redress in the applicant's situation \u2013 in other words, that it would have rectified the shortcomings in the investigation and would have led to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the abduction and death of his son. The Court thus considers that in the circumstances of the case it has not been established with sufficient certainty that the remedy advanced by the Government would have been effective within the meaning of the Convention. The Court finds that the applicant was not obliged to pursue that remedy, and that this limb of the Government's preliminary objection should therefore be dismissed.",

[GC], no.\u00a023763/94, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR\u00a01999IV). This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. Failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

The Court further notes that the provisions of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to which the Government referred, do not preclude disclosure of the documents from a pending investigation file, but rather set out a procedure for and limits to such disclosure. The Government failed to specify the nature of the documents and the grounds on which they could not be disclosed (see, for similar conclusions, Mikheyev v. Russia, no.\u00a077617/01, \u00a7\u00a0104, 26 January 2006). The Court also notes that in a number of comparable cases that have been reviewed by or are pending before the Court, similar requests have been made to the Russian Government and the documents from the investigation files have been submitted without reference to Article 161 (see, for example, Khashiyev and Akayeva v.

                                        "content": "133.\u00a0\u00a0The Court reiterates that, in the context of the execution of judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation under that provision to put an end to the breach and to make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (restitutio in integrum). However, its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court's judgment (see, among other authorities, Scozzari and Giunta\u00a0v.  [GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a0249, ECHR 2000VIII; Brum\u0103rescu v.\u00a0Romania (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 28342/95, \u00a7 20, ECHR 2001-I; Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Article 50), judgment of 1 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, pp. 723-24, \u00a7 47; and Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13\u00a0June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 25, \u00a7 58). This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflects the freedom of choice attached to the primary obligation of the Contracting States under the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed (Article 1) (see, mutatis mutandis, Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece (Article 50), judgment of 31\u00a0October 1995, Series A no. 330-B, pp. 58-59, \u00a7 34).",

In particular, the Assanidze judgment ordered the respondent State to secure the applicant's release so as to put an end to the violations of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and Article 6 \u00a7 1, whereas in the Tahsin Acar\u00a0judgment the effective investigation was mentioned in the context of the Court's examination of the respondent Government's request for the application to be struck out on the basis of their unilateral declaration. The Court further notes its above finding that in the present case the effectiveness of the investigation had already been undermined at the early stages by the domestic authorities' failure to take essential investigative measures (see paragraphs 97 and 101 above). It is therefore very doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could be restored. In such circumstances, having regard to the established principles cited above and the Government's argument that the investigation is currently under way, the Court finds it most appropriate to leave it to the respondent Government to choose the means to be used in the domestic legal order in order to discharge their legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention.",
