The Government submitted excerpts from the remand prison population register in respect of fourteen and four days only as regards the first and third applicants respectively. No explanation as to how the samples had been chosen was provided. While the Court accepts that on some days the number of inmates in the aforementioned cells where the applicants were detained was indeed below the capacity they were designed for and that the cells were not overcrowded, it cannot accept the Government\u2019s assertion that there was no overcrowding in respect of the remaining period of almost twelve months which the applicants spent in detention. Furthermore, the Court cannot but notice that even the excerpts from the register show that on certain occasions the number of inmates sharing the cells with the first and third applicants exceeded the number of sleeping places available. Nor does the Court lose sight that for weeks the personal space afforded to the applicants were below three square metres (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).",

Accordingly, the Court agrees with the first and third applicants that the cells in the remand prison where they were detained were overcrowded. As a result of such overcrowding, the first and third applicants\u2019 detention did not meet the minimum requirement, as laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, among many other authorities, Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, \u00a7\u00a0113, 16 December 2010; Kozhokar v.\u00a0Russia, no. 33099/08, \u00a7\u00a096, 16 December 2010; and Svetlana\u00a0Kazmina v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a08609/04, \u00a7\u00a070, 2\u00a0December 2010). Having regard also to the fact that the first and third applicants were compelled to spend twenty-three hours per day in such overcrowded cells, the Court finds that, between 16 December 2004 and 8 December 2005, they were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention in remand prison no.\u00a0IZ-77/2 in .",

Indeed, the initial charge of the violent overthrow of State power, which was a particularly serious criminal offence according to the domestic classification, had been accepted by the District Court on 8, 9 and 11\u00a0February 2005 without any inquiry having been carried out, although this was later amended to a lesser charge of participation in mass disorder (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). Nevertheless, when the same court extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on 7\u00a0April 2005 (see paragraph 17 above), its reasoning remained unaffected by such re-classification (compare Dolgova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a042).",

The Court has already found that the practice of issuing collective detention orders without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each detainee is incompatible, in itself, with Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Shcheglyuk v. Russia, no.\u00a07649/02, \u00a7\u00a045, 14\u00a0December 2006; Korchuganova, cited above, \u00a7 76; and Dologova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049). By extending the applicants\u2019 detention by means of collective detention orders the domestic authorities gave no real consideration to their individual circumstances. It is even more striking that the extension order of 20\u00a0June 2005 only stated that all defendants should remain in custody without giving any grounds whatsoever for their continued detention.",
