When he arrived there at about 10 a.m. he was told that he would not be able to leave because he was going to be arrested. His mobile telephone was taken away and switched off. Two hours later police officers from the Volnovakha police arrived and took him to the Volnovakha police station, where at about 2\u00a0p.m. police officers G., P. and S. started threatening him and told him to confess to the murder of A. He refused and at about 9 p.m. they twisted his arms behind his back, put handcuffs on his wrists, pushed him down to the floor, put a plastic bag on his head blocking his airway, connected and switched on an electric shock device attached to his right wrist, and started hitting him in the head and body. After thirty minutes of ill-treatment he lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness, G. put the plastic bag on his head again. Afraid of further ill-treatment, he agreed to make written statements, dated 28 May 2008, concerning A.\u2019s murder.

Accordingly, it will consider it established that the applicant was taken to the police station at least at about 7 p.m. Since the applicant only complained of unlawful detention in that police station, the Court will only examine whether he was unlawfully detained there from 7\u00a0p.m. on 27 May until 7.52 p.m. on 28 May 2008.",

There is no evidence that, as alleged by the applicant, there were other signatures written in that book on his behalf which should have also been analysed. In particular, there is no proof that police visitors have to put their signatures both on arrival and departure. As regards the signatures analysed by S., the Court observes that the applicant did not deny that one of them had belonged to him: according to him, he had been forced to write it in an empty entry after his ill-treatment. As to the second signature, the Court notes that while it has no reason to doubt its authenticity, established by S., it observes that the applicant was not aware of the results of the analysis and was informed thereof in a letter from the prosecutor (see paragraph 26 above). Furthermore, it does not appear that the applicant, who had no formal status in the inquiry, could challenge those results. Lastly, the Government provided a copy of the visitors\u2019 book without a column with visitors\u2019 signatures (including those analysed by S.), which makes it impossible for the Court even to check the relevant signatures in the book against those analysed by S.

In this connection, it does not appear from the case file that the applicant could leave the Donetsk police station or refuse to go to the Volnovakha police station.

Moreover, the police visitors\u2019 book does not contain any entry indicating that the applicant attended the police station at that time as a visitor. The Government\u2019s argument that he was able at some point to talk with T. in the police station corridor is therefore immaterial.

Furthermore, according to the arrest report which Sh. started drawing up at 7.52 p.m. (see paragraph 11 above), the applicant\u2019s father was notified of the arrest.

In its view, the only explanation for that scenario would be the fact that the applicant\u2019s father was notified of the applicant\u2019s de facto detention much earlier than at the time of his formal arrest at 7.52 p.m.",

Nor did in the present case such inquiry ensure a thorough and expedient investigation of the circumstances in which the applicant sustained injuries. Notably, seven decisions not to open criminal proceedings were set aside on eight occasions. Repetition of such decisions usually discloses a serious deficiency in the proceedings (see, for instance, Drozd v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a012174/03, \u00a7 66, 30 July 2009). Indeed, in setting aside those decisions the courts stated that the inquiry was superficial, incomplete and one-sided and that the prosecutor had not complied with the court instructions and had not examined all the circumstances stated by the applicant (see paragraphs\u00a024, 30 and 34 above).",

Furthermore, in verifying the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the events on 27 May 2008, the prosecutor did not even attempt to establish information about the applicant\u2019s whereabouts, calls or visits or those with whom he had contact on 27 and 28 May 2008 (see paragraph 53 above), if he had actually not been at the police station for the entire period, and to question those concerned.

That detention left him completely at the mercy of those holding him, putting his personal security at stake and rendering him vulnerable to illtreatment by the police. This very fact weighs heavily in favour of the applicant\u2019s version of events (see, similarly, Olisov and Others v. Russia, nos. 10825/09 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a079, 2\u00a0May 2017).",

Indeed, the applicant\u2019s testimony about his ill-treatment was detailed, coherent and unchanged, both at the domestic level and before the Court (see paragraphs\u00a07, 16 and 23 above). The formation of the applicant\u2019s injuries is largely supported by the expert medical report of 8 October 2010 which was not disputed by the Government. In particular, that report did not exclude the formation of a number of haematomas and abrasions on the applicant as a result of the tightening up of a plastic bag, sharp raising by another person of his hands twisted behind his back and as a result of punches (see paragraph 29 above). Even though the expert medical reports did not establish that some of the applicant\u2019s injuries had been caused by electric shock treatment and that all of his injuries had been caused during his unrecorded detention, they still established that numerous injuries had been sustained during that detention. Those injuries, even though classified as \u201cminor\u201d in those reports, attest to the severity of the ill-treatment the applicant suffered. This treatment was administered behind closed doors at the police station, where the applicant had no means of resistance. In these circumstances the physical pain associated with the above injuries must have been exacerbated by feelings of helplessness, acute stress and anxiety. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment was intentional and was aimed at extracting evidence from him in relation to the crime of which he was suspected (see, similarly, Belousov, cited above, \u00a7 67). In these circumstances, the Court concludes that, taken as a whole and having regard to its purpose and severity, the ill-treatment at issue amounted to torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",
