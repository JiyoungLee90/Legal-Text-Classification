Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005).

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the applicant was arrested more than a year after the judicial proceedings had commenced. He remained in custody for more than two years during which the proceedings were pending before the court. It thus appears that the domestic authorities had sufficient time to take statements from the victims in a manner which could have excluded any doubt as to their veracity and would have eliminated the necessity to continue the applicant's deprivation of liberty on that ground. Furthermore, the Court notes that, apart from a blank reference to the threats which the applicant had allegedly made against the victims, the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts warranting the applicant's detention on that ground. The authorities did not indicate any circumstance suggesting that, if released, the applicant would abscond or evade justice, or that he would otherwise interfere with the course of the proceedings.",

At no point in the proceedings in the present case did the domestic courts explain in their decisions why alternatives to the deprivation of liberty would not have ensured that the trial would follow its proper course. This failure is made all the more inexplicable by the fact that the new Code of Criminal Procedure expressly requires the domestic courts to consider less restrictive measures as an alternative to custody (see paragraph 69 above).",
