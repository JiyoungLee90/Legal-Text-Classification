It is clear that the interests of the applicant company and the second applicant, as codefendants in the defamation proceedings, were fully aligned. Moreover, the statement of appeal lodged by counsel for the applicant company bore the second applicant\u2019s name as a second defendant (see paragraph 12 above). By virtue of the fact that counsel for the applicant company had appealed against the default judgment of 12\u00a0October 2007 in due form, the Regional Court was given an opportunity to rule on the complaint which the applicants have now referred to the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no.\u00a057325/00, \u00a7 120, ECHR 2007IV). The Court sees no reason to assume that the appeal proceedings would have taken a different course had the applicant company and the second applicant lodged separate appeals against the default judgment (see, mutatis mutandis, Mariya Alekhina and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no. 38004/12, \u00a7 247, 17 July 2018).

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 300/11, \u00a7 42, 6\u00a0September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v.

Romania, no. 27329/06, \u00a7 56, 24 June 2014). In cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the Court. This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media (see, with further references, Sylka v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 19219/07, \u00a7 28, 3 June 2014).",

Moreover, both defendants were held jointly liable to pay the amount awarded to Mr P. The second applicant had thus been facing an obligation to pay the amount awarded in full until such time as the applicant company paid the sum in question. That factor may have further affected his subjective perception of the alleged violation of his right to freedom of expression. Seen in the context of the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society (see, among many other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2007IV), the alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court\u2019s view, \u201cimportant questions of principle\u201d. The Court is thus satisfied that the second applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the defamation proceedings, regardless of pecuniary interests, and does not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v. San Marino, no.\u00a028005/12, \u00a7 39, 7 July 2015).",

The District and Regional Courts did not deem it necessary to examine whether the impugned statements could be regarded as an actual attack capable of causing prejudice to the claimant\u2019s honour or business reputation, let alone his dignity. Their reasoning appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of the honour and dignity of others, in particular of those vested with public powers, prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances. By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

The Court is mindful of the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention system (see Dubsk\u00e1 and Krejzov\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, \u00a7\u00a0175, ECHR 2016). Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perin\u00e7ek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, \u00a7 198, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). Faced, however, with the domestic courts\u2019 failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have \u201capplied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 of the Convention\u201d or to have \u201cbased themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts\u201d (see, with further references, Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, \u00a7 57).
