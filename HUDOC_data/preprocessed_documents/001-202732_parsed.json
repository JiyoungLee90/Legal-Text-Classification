Italy, no. 43134/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-70, 1\u00a0December 2009, concerning applicants suffering from a potentially lifethreatening disease, hepatitis; and Hristozov and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, nos.\u00a047039/11 and\u00a0358/12, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 106-08, ECHR 2012 (extracts), concerning applicants suffering from different forms of terminal cancer). In this regard, where the victim was not killed but survived and where he or she does not allege any intent to kill, the criteria for a complaint to be examined under this aspect of Article 2 are, firstly, whether the person was the victim of an activity, whether public or private, which by its very nature put his or her life at real and imminent risk and, secondly, whether he or she has suffered injuries that appear life-threatening as they occur. Other factors, such as whether escaping death was purely fortuitous, may also come into play. The Court\u2019s assessment depends on the circumstances. While there is no general rule, it appears that if the activity involved by its very nature is dangerous and puts a person\u2019s life at real and imminent risk, the level of injuries sustained may not be decisive and, in the absence of injuries, a complaint in such cases may still fall to be examined under Article\u00a02 (see Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase, cited above, \u00a7 140, with further references).",

However, it cannot but note that very high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a life threatening condition to be treated in the hospital.

There was already an imbalance in the applicant\u2019s blood glucose level when the first test was carried out by the ambulance team (see paragraph\u00a06 above). Moreover, the medical personnel were diligently informed that he was a diabetic in need of insulin (see paragraphs 6, 9, 10 and 14 above) and none of the doctors who saw the applicant on that day denied that he needed it. There is no evidence in the file supporting the Government\u2019s assertion that the doctors were unaware of his medical condition (see paragraph 59 above). However, if that was indeed the case, far from being imputable to the applicant, such an omission on the part of the medical personnel would amount to an admission of professional misconduct, which could have put the applicant\u2019s life at risk. At the least, these aspects should have called for a more thorough investigation by the authorities.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of that law (see Ilnseher v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 10211/12 and 27505/14, \u00a7 135, 4\u00a0December 2018, and S., V. and A. v.

However, these words do not merely refer back to domestic law. They also relate to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Khlaifia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a091-92, and Del R\u00edo Prada v.

In her statements to the police (see paragraph 28 above), M.E. hinted that the applicant had refused to state his identity, but her assertion remained unsupported by evidence. There is nothing in the domestic decisions leading the Court to believe that the applicant would have refused to state his identity. On the contrary, according to his statements, he informed the medical personnel of his medical condition and even asked the paramedics to accompany him to his home so that he could take his insulin (see paragraph 6 above). The Court considers that this is incompatible with any attempt to hide his identity or refusal to reveal it. Moreover, no legal actions seem to have been taken in this respect. It does not appear that the police asked for his identity papers. They simply accompanied the ambulance to the hospitals.",

However, it is to be noted that those allegations had been dismissed as unfounded by the Timi\u015foara District Court (see paragraph 22 above). As the District Court was the only court that examined the applicant\u2019s alleged transgressions, the Court cannot but follow its assessment and thus conclude that the applicant had not been aggressive on that day.

The only act which may pass as such a request is the decision of the doctor on duty to send the applicant to the TPH after his initial admission to the TMH (see paragraph\u00a011 above). However, even assuming that that would be sufficient for the purpose of the Mental Health Act, the Court reiterates that in order for deprivation of liberty to be considered free from arbitrariness, it does not suffice that this measure is executed in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see\u00a0the case-law cited in paragraph\u00a091 above).",

Throughout that time, he was suffering from an imbalance in his blood sugar level. A certain state of discomfort and agitation is thus understandable in those circumstances. However, there is no evidence that the medical professionals had considered his personal circumstances and the possible explanations for his behaviour before recommending admission to the psychiatric hospital. Consequently, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s alleged agitation was not sufficient to render the measure of confinement necessary. Finally, it has not been suggested by the Government that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty was justified under sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (d) or (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise.",
