Subsequently, another contract was made to the effect that the applicant and his wife would pay some of R.R.\u2019s debts and that R.R. would make a testament leaving to the applicant\u2019s wife the ground floor of a house in Dubrovnik with a garden. In 1993 the applicant and R.R. made two additional contracts whereby R.R. sold to the applicant a house in Dubrovnik. The contracts were not entered into the land registry. R.R. stayed in the house and denied the applicant\u2019s property rights. By his action the applicant sought a declaration concerning his property rights.

The Court notes that within the period to be taken into consideration, two hearings were adjourned because the applicant\u2019s counsel did not appear. Counsel informed the court that he had lost contact with the applicant. The applicant also failed to inform the court about his correct address and eventually the proceedings were terminated because the applicant did not appear at the hearing scheduled for 23 October 2001 and subsequently did not ask the court to resume the proceedings. In the Court\u2019s view such a behaviour indicates carelessness on behalf of the applicant concerning the resolution of his case. Furthermore, the applicant himself asked the court to adjourn the hearing scheduled for 19 May 1998 for an unspecified period of time because he did not want to travel to Dubrovnik too often. Thus, the applicant himself caused the delay in the proceedings from 19 May 1998 until 22 January 2002 when he again addressed the court to inform it that he had obtained Croatian citizenship.",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief (see, among many other authorities, Kudla v. Poland, no. 30210/96, pp. 238, 239, \u00a7\u00a0157, ECHR 2000-XI). Notwithstanding the terms of Article 13 read literally, the existence of an actual breach of another provision of the Convention (a \u201csubstantive\u201d provision) is not a prerequisite for the application of the Article 13 (see the Klass and Others v. Germany, judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no.\u00a028, p. 29, \u00a7 64 and Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27\u00a0April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, \u00a7 52).",
