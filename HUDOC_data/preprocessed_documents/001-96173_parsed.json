Moreover, most of the delays in these proceedings had been caused by the applicant. In particular, in proceedings D 33/99 he did not appear for one scheduled hearing and did not excuse his absence, he challenged the President of the Disciplinary Council for bias (D 33/99, D 102/99, D 165/99, D 15/01), he requested expert opinions in all sets of proceedings and he moved his practice from Vienna to Retz, all of which prolonged the proceedings. Moreover, the disciplinary authority had to wait with dealing with the disciplinary complaints whenever further proceedings were opened because, for reasons of expediency, it was preferable to deal with all cases at the same time. Taking all this into account, the length of the proceedings had complied with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
