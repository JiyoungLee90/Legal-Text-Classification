In addition, the Court finds that the number of hours claimed seems excessive and that a reduction is also necessary on that basis. Finally, it notes that no receipts have been presented as proof of the claimed postal expenses. Accordingly, having regard to all relevant factors, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a0750 covering costs and expenses for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
