The Government also noted that in line with the practice of the , an oral hearing is held in cases where the court decides that not enough evidence has been gathered, or that it is controversial, and thus that it is necessary to hear submissions from the parties in person.

Accordingly, this legal rule is directed towards all citizens and not towards a given group possessing a special status. The general character of the legal rule in question is further confirmed by Chapter 1 of the Code on Administrative Law Offences, which refers to the fact that all citizens must ensure respect for legal rules and the rights of other citizens, as well as by Article 9 of the Code, which defines an administrative offence as a wrongful act which causes danger to public order, citizens' rights and the established order of administration.

However, the use as evidence of statements obtained at the pre-trial stage is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 3 (d) and 1 of Article 6, provided the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings (see, among many authorities, Isgr\u00f2 v. Italy, judgment of 19 February 1991, Series A \nno. 194-A, p. 12, \u00a7 34, and L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland, judgment of 15 June 1992, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0238, p.\u00a021, \u00a7\u00a047). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the pre-trial stage or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see the following judgments: Unterpertinger v. Austria, 24 November 1986, Series A no. 110, \u00a7\u00a7 31-33, and Sa\u00efdi v. France, 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44). With respect to statements of witnesses who proved to be unavailable for questioning in the presence of the defendant, the Court recalls that paragraph 1 of Article 6 taken together with paragraph 3 requires the Contracting States to take positive steps, in particular to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey, nos. 29900/96, 29901/96, 29902/96 and 29903/96, \u00a7\u00a067, ECHR 2001-VIII).",

The Court draws particular attention to the fact that when finding the applicant guilty, the national courts of both instances extensively quoted the experts' conclusions. In particular, the Vilnius City Second District Court quoted the conclusions of the political science experts' report that a biased and one-sided portrayal of relations between the nations obstructed the consolidation of civil society and propagated national hatred. The first-instance court also directly relied on the bibliographical experts' report that \u201cLithuanian calendar 2000\u201d did not meet the generally applied bibliographical standards as to the sources and literature quoted. In determining guilt and coming to the conclusion that the administrative offence had been committed due to the applicant's negligence, \nthe first-instance court relied on the conclusion of psychological experts. From all the foregoing, the Court concludes that in the instant case the conclusions provided by the experts during the pre-trial stage had a key place in the proceedings against the applicant. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the applicant expressed a wish to have the experts examined in open court and, if so, whether she had such an opportunity.",

In this connection the applicant emphasised that \u201cLithuanian calendar\u201d had been edited and officially distributed by her for 6 years in the whole , attracting no great attention from the public or from State institutions. Similarly, the 2,000 edition of \u201cLithuanian calendar\u201d had been released in a very limited print run of 3,000 in the second half of the year 1999, and for the following five months had caused no significant interest or exaggerated reactions, up until the State authorities' intervention in January 2000 after they received a note from the embassy of the Russian Federation. The applicant likewise noted that the Prosecutor General had refused to start criminal proceedings against her as the publication had not had the elements of the criminal offence of instigation of ethnic or racial hatred. She also observed that the information published in \u201cLithuanian calendar 2000\u201d had already been made public in other historical documents. The applicant also relied on the fact that the publication had contained mainly the expression of her own opinions on and assessment of various historical events, and the State had presented no evidence proving the necessity of such a serious interference. As a result of the proceedings, she had not only received an administrative penalty in the form of a warning, but had also lost the main source of her income, in view of the confiscation and destruction of all the unsold items of \u201cLithuanian calendar 2000\u201d and her resultant inability to continue editing the publication she had created. The applicant further submitted that the authorities could have pursued means other than halting the distribution of the calendar, such as giving her the opportunity to make certain rectifications or announcements, if necessary, on the cover of the remaining, unsold, versions of the publication. Finally, the domestic courts' finding of a lack of intent on the part of the applicant, as well as the minor danger which the publication represented, were also to be taken into account in discarding the argument that the interference had been necessary in a democratic society.",

According to them it is of essential importance that the freedom of expression not only stipulates the right to hold opinions, but also imposes duties and responsibilities, and therefore cannot be interpreted as allowing the promotion or dissemination of the ideas of ethnic hatred, hostility and the superiority of one nation vis-\u00e0-vis other ethnic groups. The Government admitted that by imposing an administrative punishment there was interference with the applicant's freedom of expression; however it had been justified by the necessity to protect the democratic values on the basis of which Lithuanian society is based. Stressing the sensitivity of the questions related to national minorities and territorial integrity after the re-establishment of independence on 11\u00a0March 1990, the Government submitted that \u201cLithuanian calendar 2000\u201d was clearly promoting the extreme ideology of nationalism, which rejected the idea of the integration of civil society, incited ethnic hatred and intolerance, and questioned territorial integrity and promoted national superiority, which had been proved by the notes sent by the embassies of the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation. By withdrawing the publication from distribution and imposing an administrative warning on the applicant, the authorities had sought to prevent the spreading of ideas which might violate the rights of ethnic minorities living in Lithuania as well as endanger Lithuania's relations with its neighbouring countries. In view of the clear threat to these legitimate interests posed by the publication, as well as the minor nature of the penalty ordered against the applicant, the Government considered that the interference had been compatible with the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention.",

The courts agreed with the conclusion of the experts that a biased and one-sided portrayal of relations among nations hindered the consolidation of civil society and promoted national hatred. The national courts noted the negative reaction which the publication received from a certain part of Lithuanian society and some foreign embassies. They also took into consideration the experts' conclusions that the applicant's statements could be attributed to the \u201cideology of extreme nationalism\u201d, which promoted national hatred, xenophobia and territorial claims. Having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States in such circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic authorities, in the circumstances of the case, did not overstep their margin of appreciation when they considered that there was a pressing social need to take measures against the applicant.",

Personally, I fail to see what these expert opinions could reasonably contribute to the legal issues which had to be decided by the national court (did the calendar contain information material promoting national, racial or religious hatred?) and what could be the additional use of putting questions in open court to these experts. In that respect, I fully understand that apparently the Vilnius City Second District Court finally decided that there was no need for the experts to be present at the hearing to explain their written conclusions (as summarised by the Supreme Administrative Court, see paragraph 35).",
