In the alternative, the seizure was, on various grounds, wrongful in civil law (onrechtmatig). Finally, the fact that section 16 (3) prevented third parties from challenging a seizure affecting their own goods amounted to a denial of \"access to court\" as guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.",

Since Gasus sought to be protected against infringement by the Tax Collector of their ownership of the concrete-mixer, undoubtedly a \"civil\" right within the meaning of the provision (art. 6-1), Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applied; it had, moreover, been violated since section 16 (3) of the 1845 Act amounted to a limitation of access to court with respect to assets of the kind mentioned in it.",

That was clear from its wording. That also followed, incidentally, from Article 14 of the Constitution, which prohibited expropriation without compensation: if section 16 (3) were a provision concerning deprivation of property, it would contravene Article 14 of the Constitution. On the principle that a provision of  legislation could not be construed so as to be incompatible with the Constitution, section 16 (3) therefore had to be construed as merely barring access to court. The questions raised by section 16 (3) were thus of a \"procedural\", not a \"substantive\" nature, and therefore the more appropriate Convention provision was Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) and not Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).",

Whether, when judged by this condition, the seizure of his property was rightly effected is a matter which any affected third party can have reviewed by the ordinary civil courts in proper legal proceedings. In assessing the lawfulness of the seizure, the court may not take into account whether or not the relevant property is owned by the tax debtor, because precisely this point is not relevant - save for certain exceptions which are of no consequence here - in view of the scope of the subsection. This also reveals the meaning of the provision that third parties may \u2018never bring an action to challenge seizures for tax purposes\u2019. It means not that they may not bring an action before the courts but rather that, having brought an action in the courts, they may not successfully submit, as a basis for their action, that the seizure is unlawful because the goods seized belong to them and not to the tax debtor. Consequently, the provisions of section 456 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure are of no avail to them in this respect because section 16 (3) of the 1845 Act derogates from them as a lex specialis.",

In particular, it depended on domestic law to what extent retention of title protected the vendor\u2019s property against claims by other creditors. If these other creditors were entitled to have the property seized and sold in settlement of their claims, the result was that the vendor was deprived of his property right.

Like all other creditors, the tax authorities could recover unpaid tax debts against all the tax debtor\u2019s seizable assets; under section 16 (3) they were, moreover, empowered to seize and recover against all movable property found on the tax debtor\u2019s premises which qualified as \"furnishings\", irrespective of whether or not these goods belonged to the tax debtor (see paragraphs 29 to 31 above). It was in the exercise of this power that the tax authorities seized the concrete-mixer to which Gasus claimed title, in partial enforcement of Atlas\u2019s unpaid tax debts.",

That paragraph explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to pass such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes.

Under  law as it stood at the material time, landlords had a comparable power with respect to unpaid rent, as they did also under French and Belgian law; the Government have also cited several provisions in the tax laws of other member States that give similar powers to the tax authorities in special cases. Consequently, the fact that the Netherlands legislature has seen fit to strengthen the tax authorities\u2019 position in enforcement proceedings against tax debtors does not justify the conclusion that the 1845 Act, or section 16 (3) of it, is not aimed at \"securing the payment of taxes\", or that using the power conferred by that section constitutes a \"confiscation\", whether \"arbitrary\" or not, rather than a method of recovering a tax debt.",

Consequently, a legislature may in principle resort to that device to ensure, in the general interest, that taxation yields as much as possible and that tax debts are recovered as expeditiously as possible. Nonetheless, it cannot be overlooked that, quite apart from the dangers of abuse, the character of legislation by which the State creates such powers for itself is not the same as that of legislation granting similar powers to narrowly defined categories of private creditors.
