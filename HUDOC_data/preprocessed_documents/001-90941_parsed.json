In this regard, he challenged the PGO\u2019s failure to enquire as to when exactly the ventilation, lighting and the toilet partition had been installed in the punishment cell. The first applicant further complained that the PGO had inexplicably disregarded his assertions that none of the above-mentioned conditions had existed during his confinement and had arbitrarily endorsed those of the prison staff who, being potential suspects in the case, could not be said to have been impartial witnesses. He challenged the fact that, despite his statement that he had never been provided with medical care, the PGO had trusted the statements of the prison doctor, another potential suspect, without having examined any other source of information (i.e. the relevant prison logbook of medical visits). He further claimed that the second inmate, being under the complete control of the authorities who were wellknown for abuses in prisons, might easily have been threatened or forced to make false statements.

The fact that the investigation was terminated on 26 June 2006, that is shortly before the Government submitted their initial observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, on 30 June 2006, proved that the prosecution authorities had been guided not by the duty of due diligence to provide the first applicant with a reasonable possibility of redress, but rather to equip the Government with an additional argument in the proceedings before the Court.

For example, the administration might have built a partition wall between the toilet and the rest of the cell or fixed a water tap. Since neither he nor his advocates had been afforded an opportunity to visit the punishment cell after his confinement there, he was not in a position to provide any further comments.

Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia (dec), no. 1704/06, 26 June 2007). A measure of disciplinary confinement may not in itself be in breach of those requirements. It is rather the proportionality of its imposition and the conditions of the confinement which may be questionable under the above provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Rohde v.

The Court recalls in this connection that the proportionality of an additional punitive measure imposed upon a prisoner is of importance when assessing whether or not the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention has been exceeded (see, mutatis mutandis, Renolde v.

The Court notes in this connection that, as early as 2001, the CPT recommended the Georgian Government to aim at a minimum standard of 4 square metres per prisoner (see paragraph 71 above). It is to be recalled that the lack of personal space afforded to detainees can be so extreme as to justify, in itself, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. Thus, for example, in a number of cases, the Court has found violations of that provision solely on the basis of the fact that the applicants were afforded less than 3 square metres of personal space (see, for example, Lind v.
