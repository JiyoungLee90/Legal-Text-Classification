France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR\u00a01999-II). What is at stake for the applicant has also to be taken into consideration. In this respect the Court recalls that throughout the period under consideration the applicant was kept in custody \u2013 a fact which required particular diligence on the part of the authorities and courts dealing with the case to administer justice expeditiously (see Abdoella v. the Netherlands, 25 November 1992, \u00a7\u00a024, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0248A).",

It reiterates that a repetitive re-examination of the case within one set of proceedings can disclose a serious deficiency in the domestic judicial system (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003). Although the Court has previously rejected some cases concerning repeated remittals, having observed that the judicial authorities had acted diligently in handling a complex matter (see, for example, Zhurba\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine (dec.), no.\u00a011215/03, 19\u00a0June\u00a02007, and Bespalov\u00a0v.\u00a0 (dec.), no.\u00a011484/05, 15\u00a0January 2008), it cannot find a similar justification for remittals in the present case.",
