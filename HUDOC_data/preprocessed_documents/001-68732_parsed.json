Thus one inmate had been afforded only 2.5 square metres of space on average, the relevant domestic requirement being at least 5 m\u00b2. At the same time, the prison had enough sleeping facilities for every inmate, there being a difference in this respect from the Kalashnikov v. Russia case (no. 47095/99, 15.7.2002, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2002-VI). The Government emphasised that the competent authorities had regularly monitored the air and ventilation conditions at the prison, which had been proved to be compatible with the relevant norms established by the Ministry of Health. The present application was thus also different from the Peers v. Greece case, where the lack of space coupled with the faulty ventilation system had resulted in unbearable heat during the summer (no. 28524/95, 19.4.2001, \n\u00a7 72, ECHR 2001-III).

Similarly, various actions had been undertaken to eliminate rats and other pest from the cells.

The Government have not contested the applicant's statement that the possibility to have a stroll or outside exercise was limited to one hour per day. The Court considers it established that the applicant was thus confined to his cell for 23 hours daily. In these circumstances, the extreme lack of space weighs heavily as an aspect to be taken into account for the purpose of establishing whether the impugned detention conditions were \u201cdegrading\u201d from the point of view of Article 3. By contrast, in the Vala\u0161inas case cited above, no violation of Article 3 was found in view inter alia of the fact that the somewhat restricted space in the sleeping facilities was counterbalanced in the Court's assessment by the unlimited freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day (loc. cit., \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 107).",
