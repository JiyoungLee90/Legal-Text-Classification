Although primarily intended for the new Contracting States and without binding effect, especially in respect of the judicial authorities, this document seeks to facilitate the Convention\u2019s implementation by proposing numerous recommendations and clarifications. The Guide repeatedly emphasises the importance of the Explanatory Report to the 1980 Convention, known as the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report, in helping to interpret coherently and understand the 1980 Convention (see, for example, points 3.3.2 \u201cImplications of the transformation approach\u201d and 8.1 \u201cExplanatory Report on the Convention: the P\u00e9rez-Vera Report\u201d). In particular, it emphasises that the judicial and administrative authorities are under an obligation, inter alia, to process return applications expeditiously, including on appeal (point 1.5 \u201cExpeditious procedures\u201d). Expeditious procedures should be viewed as procedures which are both fast and efficient: prompt decision-making under the Convention serves the best interests of children (point 6.4 \u201cCase management\u201d).",

In this connection the Government referred to the Grand Chamber judgment in the case of X v. Latvia ([GC], no. 27853/09, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2013), in which the Court held that while Article 11 of the Hague Convention indeed provided that judicial authorities must act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children, that obligation did not exonerate them from the duty to undertake an effective examination of arguments relying on one of the exceptions to return expressly provided for in the said Convention (such as that in Article 13 paragraph 1 (b) in that case). What is more, the Court has found that in such situations Article 8 of the Convention imposed a procedural obligation requiring that arguable allegations of \u201cgrave risk\u201d to a child in the event of return be effectively examined by the courts and their findings set out in a reasoned decision (see X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 106-107 and 115). It had further held that in that context it was also necessary to establish whether it was possible for abducting parents to follow their children to the country to which the children were being returned and to maintain contact with them (see X v.

The arguable nature of those allegations was supported by the opinions of the local social welfare centre and the independent expert, which had both stated that return to the United States and separation from his mother would be traumatic for him (see paragraphs 15 and 39 above). Those, and the related allegations by the applicant\u2019s wife that she could no longer return to the United States (see paragraphs 31 above), had therefore required detailed and time-consuming examination by the domestic courts, which had been necessary in order to reach a decision achieving the requisite balance between all the competing interests at stake, the best interests of the child being a primary consideration.",

In that way the sensitive balance sought to be established between all the competing interests at stake, including the best interests of the child, had also been severely upset and tipped in his wife\u2019s favour. The applicant asserted that from the reasoning of the domestic courts it was evident that there was a direct link between the delay in and the negative outcome of the proceedings, as it was clear that the attachment of his son to his mother had become so strong over the years the proceedings had been pending that separating them would have been traumatic for him.

San Marino, no. 32250/08, \u00a7 177, 27\u00a0September 2011), ineffective, and in particular delayed, conduct of judicial proceedings may give rise to a breach of positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see Eberhard and M. v. Slovenia, no. 8673/05 and 9733/05, \u00a7\u00a0127, 1 December 2009, and S.I. v.

Therefore, in cases concerning a person\u2019s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence, in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. This duty, which is decisive in assessing whether a case has been heard within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, also forms part of the procedural requirements implicit in Article 8 (see, for example, S\u00fc\u00df v. Germany, no.\u00a040324/98, \u00a7 100, 10 November 2005, and Str\u00f6mblad v. Sweden, no.\u00a03684/07, \u00a7 80, 5 April 2012).",

Finland, 23\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 58, Series A no.\u00a0299A). In such cases, the adequacy of a measure is also to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation as they require urgent handling given that the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for the relations between the children and the parent who does not live with them (see, for example, Sylvester v. Austria, nos. 36812/97 and 40104/98, \u00a7 60, 24 April 2003).",

The Government\u2019s arguments to the contrary (see paragraphs 79-86 above, and in particular paragraphs 82-83), which would in view of the Court\u2019s case-law in different circumstances be capable of dispensing the courts of the duty to strictly observe the six-week time-limit (see X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7 118), cannot in the given circumstances sufficiently explain such a substantial delay. It follows that the time it took for the domestic courts to adopt the final decision in the present case failed to meet the urgency of the situation (see Iosub Caras v. Romania, no. 7198/04, \u00a7 39, 27 July 2006).",

In the present instance the applicant\u2019s appeal of 11\u00a0June 2014 was decided four months and eleven days after it had been lodged (see paragraphs 44-45 above). It is therefore evident that, by disregarding that specific time-limit in the applicant\u2019s case and not extending the application of the procedural rule contained in section 266 of the Family Act to the proceedings concerning the return of the child, the domestic courts did not use the most expeditious procedure (see Article 2 of the Hague Convention in paragraph 62, and the Explanatory Report thereto in paragraph 63 above).",

They took into account the fact that the wife had been completely dependent on the applicant in every way (financially, economically, and in terms of accommodation (see paragraph 13 of the judgment)); that, owing to the age of the child and his mother\u2019s constant care of him since birth, the child was emotionally primarily attached to her; and that separating them and returning and transferring the child to a different environment would be traumatising for the child for the purposes of Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention (see paragraphs 32, 39, 41 and 43 of the judgment). In general, the establishment of a risk of psychological harm under Article 13 prevails over the expeditious return requirement under Articles 11 and 12 of the Hague Convention.",

Time does not matter in the present case also because the boy was emotionally attached to his mother from birth. It is important to note that the Hague Convention does not satisfy the proportionality test as it makes no distinction between different stages of a minor\u2019s life. Children up to seven years old are usually emotionally attached to their mothers (as in the present case); the environment does not matter to them, and separation would lead to distress and trauma. This means that a \u201crisk\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 always exists for such children. Between the ages of seven and thirteen the environment becomes more important and a return therefore becomes more realistic, unless there is a \u201crisk\u201d which should be considered as really \u201cgrave\u201d. Hence, the threshold for a non-return decision should increase with the development of the child. And lastly, children older than, say, thirteen should have the right to decide for themselves and express their own opinion. The Hague Convention does not provide for any of the above options.",
