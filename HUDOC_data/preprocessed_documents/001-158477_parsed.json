It was further indicated that the injuries on the applicant\u2019s face and ear could have been caused by a blow with a blunt object during the applicant\u2019s arrest. The report further stated the applicant had not been subjected to an examination of his ear between 30\u00a0September and 10 October 2001 and that the red patches behind the applicant\u2019s left ear noted in the report of 30\u00a0September 2001 could have been caused by physical trauma which could have also led to the tympanic membrane perforation in his left ear.

The Court notes in this regard that the applicant suffered from a number of health problems at the material time and was receiving medical treatment (see paragraph 18 above). Moreover, when he was brought before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the State Security Court on 9 October 2001, he had visible injuries on his face and suffered from health problems serious enough to prevent him from speaking (see paragraph\u00a011 above). According to the document pertaining to the applicant\u2019s questioning by the investigating judge, the applicant explicitly stated that he had pain in his throat and his internal organs at the material time. Both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge failed to enquire as to the reasons for the applicant\u2019s injuries on his face and the cause of his health issues despite the fact that the applicant had been in police custody for the previous nine days. Thus, taking into account the applicant\u2019s state of health at the material time and given that the national authorities failed to fulfil their duty to initiate an investigation although they were aware that the applicant could have been subjected to ill-treatment, the Court considers that in the present case the applicant\u2019s delay in lodging a complaint is not decisive (see ibid. \u00a7\u00a0265).",

Subsequent to the lodging of his petition on 24\u00a0December 2001, the applicant made statements to the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor in person on 4\u00a0February 2002. Moreover, he was medically examined within the context of the investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment on 4\u00a0February and 19\u00a0December 2002, 1 July 2003 and 18 December 2005. As a result, although it cannot be concluded that there was meaningful contact between the applicant and the prosecuting authorities with regard to the former\u2019s complaint and his requests for information (compare, Mocanu and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0279), the applicant could legitimately have believed that there was an effective investigation and could reasonably have awaited its outcome, so long as there was a realistic possibility that the investigative measures were moving forward (see ibid. \u00a7\u00a7 268 and 280).",

In order to fall within the scope of Article 3, illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Anzhelo Georgiev and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 51284/09, \u00a7 65, 30 September 2014 and the cases cited therein, and Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 86, 28\u00a0September 2015).",

However, such force may be used only if it is indispensable and must not be excessive (see, among many others, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 68-78, ECHR 2000-XII; Ivan Vasilev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, \u00a7 63, 12 April 2007; and \u0130zci v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a042606/05, \u00a7 54, 23 July 2013). When a person is confronted by the police or other State agents, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by the person\u2019s own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the rights set forth in Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see Bouyid, cited above, \u00a7 88; see also Timtik v. Turkey, no.\u00a012503/06, \u00a7 47, 9\u00a0November 2010). Such a strict proportionality approach has been accepted by the Court also in respect of situations in which an individual was already under the full control of the police (see, among others, Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, \u00a7 59, 28\u00a0July 2009 and the cases cited therein). The Court attaches particular importance also to the type of injuries sustained and the circumstances in which force was used (see Anzhelo Georgiev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66 and the cases cited therein).",

[the] Convention\u201d, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation (see, among many others, Labita v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-IV; and G\u00e4fgen v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a022978/05, \u00a7 117, 1 June 2010). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. For the same reasons, there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure (see Bat\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, nos.\u00a033097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7\u00a7 136-137, ECHR 2004IV (extracts)). Lastly, the investigation must be thorough, which means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation (see Mocanu and Others, cited above, \u00a7 325).",

The dispute between them concerns the manner in which these injuries were sustained.

The report of 9\u00a0October 2001, issued at the end of the first phase of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody, referred to a widespread bruised area under the applicant\u2019s left eye and small scratches on his left wrist (see paragraph 10 above). On 10\u00a0October 2001 when the applicant was still in police custody, he was found to be suffering from a tympanic membrane perforation in his left ear after an examination by a doctor at the otolaryngology department of the Diyarbak\u0131r state hospital (see paragraph 14 above).

In this regard, the Court cannot but observe that although the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor took a number of steps with a view to establishing whether the applicant could have sustained the injuries noted in the medical reports during his arrest, he did not attempt to establish the circumstances in which the arresting officers had inflicted blunt trauma on the applicant\u2019s head. Nor did he inquire whether the force used during the applicant\u2019s arrest had been strictly necessary and proportionate. For example, he failed to obtain the arresting officers\u2019 statements with regard to the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s arrest. Thus, in the absence of a meaningful inquiry by the public prosecutor\u2019s office, the Government have failed to furnish convincing and credible arguments, information or documents which would provide a basis to explain or justify the degree of force used during the arrest operation (see Rehbock, cited above, \u00a7\u00a076; Karatepe and Ula\u015f v.

In the Court\u2019s view, infliction of blunt trauma on the applicant\u2019s face and ear does not appear to be a proportionate method to obtain the pieces of paper that the applicant had swallowed and to restrain him, even assuming that the use of force was strictly necessary.",

In this connection, the Court cannot but remark the attitude of the public prosecutor and the investigating judge who questioned the applicant on 9 October 2001 (see paragraph 11 above). Despite the fact that they became aware that the applicant was suffering from serious health issues at the end of the first phase of his detention in police custody, they ignored the applicant\u2019s state of health and failed to order or to initiate an investigation although they were under the duty to do so: according to Article 153 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time, a public prosecutor who had been informed of a situation that gave rise to a suspicion that an offence had been committed was obliged to investigate the facts by conducting the inquiries necessary to identify the perpetrators (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, and \u0130lhan v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2000VII). What is more, the investigating judge authorised the applicant\u2019s detention and questioning by police for a further period of ten days. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view the absence of any evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment in police custody is to a great extent due to the failure of the public prosecutor and the judge, who failed to proceed with a prompt investigation given that the evidence in the case file began to be collected more than two months after the end of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody. Nevertheless, in the absence of any evidence in support of the applicant\u2019s allegations, the Court considers that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention in its substantive aspect in respect of the ill-treatment to which the applicant was allegedly subjected during his detention in police custody (see G\u00fclbahar and Others v.
