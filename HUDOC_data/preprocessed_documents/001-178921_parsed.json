He found that whilst the police officers had been very quick to seek the assistance of the fire brigade and the emergency medical service, it was regrettable that the situation had been inaccurately described by the incident room to the firemen prior to their intervention (the latter had been informed of M.B.\u2019s \u201cwithdrawal symptoms\u201d). He considered that there had been no imminent danger to people or property in the pharmacy and thus no urgent need to remove M.B. as soon as possible. He stated that the immobilisation and compression procedures carried out in the van had been dangerous and disproportionate. He described as \u201camouting to a serious infringement of human dignity and to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3\u201d the techniques used by constables D. and M. to pin M.B. to the floor of the police van. The Ombudsman also noted conflicting statements by the police officers regarding whethere there had been physical violence other than the two diversionary blows and pointed out that no witnesses had been present throughout the entire incident. The Ombudsman concluded that the precipitation with which the police had acted had led them to make an erroneous assessment of M.B.\u2019s situation and to react in a stereotypical manner rather than adjust their conduct during the intervention, despite the fact that they knew that M.B. was receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders and that they had been able to observe abnormal behaviour on his part. He recommended reinforcing the initial and continuous training of police officers with regard to dealing with persons suffering from a mental disorder. Lastly, he recommended that disciplinary proceedings be brought against the four police officers who had arrested M.B. for \u201cdisproportionate use of force or failing to cease using such force\u201d.",

The Court notes, like the domestic courts, that all the forensic medical reports ruled out death by chest compression, while noting that M.B. had suffered, unbeknown to him, from atherosclerotic coronary heart disease with approximately 70% stenosis. According to the experts, M.B. died suddenly of cardiac rhythm disorders owing to a coronary spasm triggered by a context of intense and prolonged emotional and physical stress in a subject suffering from an atheromatous attack on an artery of the heart. The Court observes that whilst the police operation created additional tension, M.B. had already been highly overwrought on his arrival at the pharmacy, long before the police had intervened. The Court notes that, according to the psychiatric expert, the victim had suffered from a serious psychiatric pathology, that is to say, a delusional psychosis, which explained both the initial altercation with the pharmacist and his state of extreme agitation when the police officers attempted to induce him to leave the pharmacy, as their intervention could have been interpreted \u201cin a delusional manner\u201d, to quote the psychiatric expert.",

The fire brigade arrived at 5.07\u00a0p.m. At 5.20 p.m. their superiors were informed that M.B. was suffering from heart failure. Lastly, the emergency medical services\u2019 arrival was confirmed at 5.40 p.m. In the light of those factors, established by the domestic courts and undisputed by the parties, the Court considers that, having regard to the police officers\u2019 swift request for assistance and the rapid arrival of the emergency medical services on the scene (see paragraphs\u00a01619 above), the authorities cannot be found to have failed in their obligation to protect M.B.\u2019s life.",

It also observes that whilst the police officers did indeed ask him to leave the pharmacy a number of times, they subsequently \u2013 when he refused \u2013 decided to move directly to coercive mode by attempting to forcibly remove him from the pharmacy even there had been no obligation to restrain a person threatening the life or physical integrity of another or himself (see Tek\u0131n and Arslan v. Belgium, no.\u00a037795/13, \u00a7 101, 5 September 2017). Owing to the difficulties encountered in removing M.B. [from the pharmacy] and handcuffing him, the police officers punched him twice in the solar plexus. With regard to that action, the Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s explanation that the punches, which corresponded to a technique taught to police officers with the aim of creating a diversion and facilitating handcuffing, were necessary in the circumstances of the case. Indeed, it notes that the violence of that technique only intensified M.B.\u2019s agitation and resistance, reinforcing his feeling of exasperation and, at the very least, his incomprehension as to the course of events. The Court also notes the undisputed witness evidence that M.B. appealed for help, requesting the intervention of the police, which led one of the officers to show him his insignia. It notes the expert psychiatrist\u2019s explanation that M.B., who was suffering from a serious psychiatric disorder, could have interpreted those gestures as a form of persecution. In the circumstances of the instant case the Court considers that the punches, inflicted on a vulnerable person who clearly did not understand what the police officers were doing, amount to treatment that was neither justified nor strictly necessary.",

The police officers do not appear to have given careful thought to the best way to approach M.B. and potentially how to react if faced with a negative or aggressive reaction on his part, whereas it is clear from the case file that they knew about his psychiatric disorder (see Tekin and Arslan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0104). Furthermore, the Court considers that the repeated and inefficacious violent acts against a vulnerable person constitute an infringement of human dignity and attain a severity threshold rendering them incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention.",
