Nor is it necessary that the person detained should ultimately have been charged or brought before a court. The object of detention for questioning is to further a criminal investigation by confirming or dispelling the suspicions which provided the grounds for detention. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of the criminal investigation (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300A).",

In this connection, the Court notes at the outset that it has to take into account all the relevant circumstances in order to be satisfied that any objective information existed showing that the suspicion against the applicant was \u201creasonable\u201d. The Court thus considers it necessary to take into account the general context of the facts of this particular case. Having assessed the submissions by the third parties (see reference in paragraph 47 above) and the opinions of the Venice Commission (see reference in paragraph 40 above), the Court notes that in recent years the legislative environment regarding the operation of nongovernmental organisations, including the regulation of matters relating to their State registration, their funding and their reporting requirements, has, according to the submissions of the third parties, deteriorated. A\u00a0number of amendments to various legislative instruments introduced additional registration and reporting procedures as well as heavy penalties. There have been long-standing problems with the State registration of NGOs in Azerbaijan (in this connection, see also Ramazanova and Others v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a044363/02, 1 February 2007; Nasibova v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a04307/04, 18\u00a0October 2007; Ismayilov v. Azerbaijan, no. 4439/04, 17\u00a0January 2008; and Aliyev and Others v. Azerbaijan, no. 28736/05, 18\u00a0December 2008, in which cases the Court found violations of Article 11 of the Convention). Despite the reforms to the registration procedures regulated by the Law on State Registration, the Court has continued to receive new applications concerning allegedly arbitrary delays in State registration of NGOs. Indeed, two of those applications were lodged by NGOs founded by the applicant, and have been communicated to the respondent Government (see applications nos. 64733/09 and 70981/11). Furthermore, the above-mentioned sources were of the view that the onerous new regulations, coupled with the reportedly intransigent and arbitrary manner in which they were being applied by the authorities, made it increasingly difficult for NGOs to operate. While the Court is not called upon to give a judicial assessment of the general situation outlined above in the context of the present complaint, it nevertheless considers that this background information is relevant to the present case and calls for particularly close scrutiny of the facts giving rise to the charges brought against the applicant (see Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7 120).",

Likewise, the Government failed to demonstrate that any other witness statements, documents or other evidence or information existed which could serve as a basis for the suspicion that the applicant had engaged in criminal activities. In this connection, the Court observes that, although the Government referred to documents, dated 16 December 2013 and 19 March 2014, indicating that various expert opinions had been passed on to the applicant by the investigation, they failed to provide the Court with these expert opinions. In any event, it has not been demonstrated that any such evidence was ever presented by the prosecuting authorities to the domestic courts ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention (compare Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a096-99; Yagublu v. Azerbaijan, no.\u00a031709/13, \u00a7 60, 5 November 2015; and Rasul Jafarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0129). In this regard, the Court also takes note of the decision of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of 3 November 2009. That decision required domestic courts to subject prosecuting authorities\u2019 applications for remand in custody to close scrutiny and to verify the existence of a suspicion against the accused by making use of their power under Article 447.5 of the CCrP to request and review the \u201cinitial evidence\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s possession (see reference in paragraph 39 above). However, in the present case, the above directives were not taken into account (compare Ilgar Mammadov, cited above, \u00a7 97, and Yagublu, cited above, \u00a7 61).",

All previous decisions ordering and extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been based solely on the original charges under Articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the Criminal Code. The new charges were therefore of no significance as regards assessing the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the applicant\u2019s detention during the period falling within the scope of the present case.

Accordingly, during the period the Court is considering in the present case, the applicant was deprived of his liberty in the absence of a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d of his having committed a criminal offence.",

Conversely, if the prescribed purpose was the main one, the restriction does not run counter to Article 18 even if it also pursues another purpose (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7 305). Which purpose is predominant in a given case depends on all the circumstances. In assessing that point, the Court will have regard to the nature and degree of reprehensibility of the alleged ulterior purpose, and bear in mind that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the rule of law (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7 307).",
