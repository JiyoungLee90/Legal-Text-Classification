Nevertheless, it considers that the issue raised by the applicant before the Supreme Court did not immediately appear to be manifestly devoid of merit. Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s view, it was incumbent on the Supreme Court to check whether, as required by Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, the trial court was \u201can impartial tribunal\u201d within the meaning of that provision. It was the appellate court\u2019s duty to use all the means at its power to dispel any doubts as to the reality and nature of the applicant\u2019s allegations. The Supreme Court, however, did not perform any such check. The judgment it delivered remained silent as to why it had not been possible for it to question the jurors or to instruct law-enforcement authorities to conduct an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations pending the delivery of the appeal judgment.",
