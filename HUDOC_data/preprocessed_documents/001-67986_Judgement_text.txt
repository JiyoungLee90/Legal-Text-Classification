The case originated in an application (no. 16552/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Lazo Pikić (“the applicant”), on 15 March 2002.
The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Lukina-Karajković.
The applicant alleged that the enactment of the 1999 Amendments to the Civil Obligations Act had violated his right of access to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
On 12 May 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of that complaint at the same time as its admissibility.
On 8 June 2004 the Government filed additional observations on the admissibility of the application. Following a decision of the Chamber of 8 July 2004, these observations were included in the case file and sent to the applicant for comments (Rule 38 § 1). The applicant replied on 2 August 2004.

On 13 August 1992 the Croatian Military Police requisitioned the applicant's vehicle for use by the Croatian Army.
By a letter of 1 August 1996 the Dubrovnik Defence Office (Ured za obranu ) informed the applicant that the vehicle had been damaged beyond repair.
On 26 May 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Dubrovnik Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Dubrovniku) seeking compensation for the loss of his vehicle from the State.
On 6 November 1999 Parliament introduced amendments to the Civil Obligations Act (“the 1999 Amendments”). The amended legislation provided that all actions for damages against the State for the acts of members of the Croatian Army and the police in the performance of their official duties during the Homeland War in Croatia were to be stayed.
On 2 May 2000 the Dubrovnik Municipal Court stayed the proceedings pursuant to the above legislation.
On 1 September 2000 the  (Županijski sud u Dubrovniku) dismissed the applicant's appeal against that decision.
On 21 May 2003 the applicant lodged a motion with the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) seeking a review of the constitutionality of the 1999 Amendments. These proceedings are still pending.
On 14 July 2003 Parliament passed new legislation on the liability of the State for damage caused by members of the Croatian Army and police in the performance of their official duties during the Homeland War (“the 2003 Liability Act”).
In 2004 the applicant's proceedings resumed pursuant to the above legislation. The proceedings are still pending.
Section 184 (a) of the 1999 Amendments (Zakon o dopunama Zakona o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette no. 112/1999) provides that all proceedings instituted against the State for damage caused by members of the Croatian Army and police in the performance of their official duties during the Homeland War in Croatia from 7 August 1990 to 30 June 1996 are to be stayed.
The 1999 Amendments also imposed an obligation on the Government to submit special legislation to Parliament regulating liability for such damage within six months of the Act entering into force.
The 2003 Liability Act (Zakon o odgovornosti Republike Hrvatske za štetu uzrokovanu od pripadnika hrvatskih oružanih i redarstvenih snaga tijekom Domovinskog rata, Official Gazette no. 117/03) regulates the conditions under which the State is liable to pay compensation for damage caused by members of the army and the police during the Homeland War. It also provides that all proceedings stayed pursuant to the 1999 Amendments are to be resumed.
