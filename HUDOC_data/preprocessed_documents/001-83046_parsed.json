[GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2000IV).

Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which an issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v.

The Court notes that the information submitted by the Government was inconsistent. Thus, according to the Government, between 27 May and \n20 September 2002 the applicant was held in cell no. 3, between 21 and \n24 September 2002 in cell no. 5, and between 25 September and 10 October 2002 in cell no. 70. At the same time they submitted that between 9 and \n25 September 2002 he was held in cell no. 8, which is inconsistent with the above dates. Furthermore, according to the certificate issued by remand prison IZ-50/9, the applicant was held in cell no. 8 between 9 January and 25 February 2002. In any event, from the information submitted by the Government it can be seen that in cell no. 3 there was between 0.9 to 1.7 sq. m of space per inmate, in cell no.\u00a05, between 1.4 and 2 sq. m, in cell no. 70, between 4.5 and 9.8 sq. m, and in cell no. 8, 0.76 sq. m per inmate.
