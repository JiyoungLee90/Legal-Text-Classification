It clarified, however, that the term \u201cadministration of justice\u201d did not cover judicial proceedings in their entirety but extended only to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case. Other judicial acts \u2013 mainly of a procedural nature \u2013 fell outside the scope of the concept of \u201cadministration of justice\u201d. State liability for damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act could arise even in the absence of the final criminal conviction of a judge if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings. The Constitutional Court emphasised, moreover, that the constitutional right to compensation by the State for such damage should not be associated with the personal fault of a judge. The Constitutional Court held that Parliament should legislate on the grounds and procedure for compensation by the State for damage caused by the unlawful acts or failures to act of a court or a judge and should determine territorial and subject-matter jurisdiction over such claims.",

It notes that, in particular, a civil action for damages can also be lodged in cases where judicial acts have been done with malicious intent or corruptly and the judge\u2019s guilt has been established in a final criminal conviction (compare, Gryaznov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a080). The limitation in question cannot therefore be regarded as an arbitrary removal of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction to determine a whole range of civil claims.",

It is for the national authorities to determine the extent to which the individual\u2019s interests in full protection of his or her reputation should yield to the requirements of the public\u2019s interest in the normal functioning of the judicial system (compare, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, \u00a7\u00a081, Series A no.\u00a0294B). Domestic courts at two levels of jurisdiction found that Russian law did not impose any liability on the judge in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case, and declared the latter\u2019s claims inadmissible.",

The Court concludes, accordingly, that a reasonable relationship of proportionality can be said to have existed between the judicial immunity in the course of the administration of justice and the legitimate aim pursued in the public interest. Whereas, therefore, the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies does not arise in such circumstances the Court rejects the Government\u2019s objection in this respect and finds that there has been no violation of Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",
