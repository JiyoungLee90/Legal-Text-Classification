On the day after his release he had lodged an application for temporary asylum, which further confirmed his intention to remain in Russia. On 14 December 2012, immediately before his disappearance, he had told his landlady he would come to see her within the next half an hour but had never done so. The state of his flat and the personal belongings that were left there gave the impression that the applicant had left for a short time intending to return to the flat without delay. The facts outlined above made it clear that the applicant had no intention of running away, let alone of returning to Uzbekistan, and that, on the contrary, he was anxious to stay in Russia as long as he could. The hypothesis of a forcible removal to Uzbekistan was further strengthened by the fact that two days before his disappearance the applicant had been followed by two cars. Moreover, given that the applicant had no valid identity documents allowing him to cross the Russian border, his Uzbek passport having expired in 2009 when he had turned forty-five, it would not have been possible for him to pass through border control and to board the flight to Uzbekistan without the assistance of the authorities. Lastly, the applicant\u2019s representatives invited the Court to draw inferences from the authorities\u2019 failure to undertake a thorough investigation into the applicant\u2019s disappearance and to put forward an alternative version of the events.",

The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case. Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article\u00a03 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place (see, with further references, El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0155).",

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article\u00a019 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, with further references, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos.\u00a043577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2005VII; Iskandarov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a017185/05, \u00a7\u00a0107, 23\u00a0September 2010; and El Masri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0151).",

That position is supported by a substantial body of evidence attesting to the applicant\u2019s constant and unfaltering intention of remaining in Russia and his fear of being forcibly transferred to Uzbekistan. In particular, the Court finds it significant that the applicant faces serious charges in Uzbekistan, where an arrest warrant has been issued in respect of him (see paragraphs ,  and \u00a0above). He consistently raised the argument that he feared he would be subjected to ill-treatment in custody in the event of his return to Uzbekistan in the different sets of domestic proceedings (see paragraphs\u00a0, , ,  and  above). In July 2012 he submitted a request for an interim measure to this Court, requesting the suspension of his extradition (see paragraph\u00a0 above). Further, shortly before his release the applicant made a written statement to the effect that he had no intention of returning to Uzbekistan and that, fearing abduction, he wished his representatives to be present at the moment of his release (see paragraph  above). On 11 December 2014, the day after his release, he lodged an application for temporary asylum and rented a flat in the Moscow region where he intended to live while his application was being examined (see paragraphs  and  above). Finally, the Court finds no reason to distrust the applicant\u2019s representatives\u2019 statement that on 12\u00a0December\u00a02012, two days before his disappearance, the applicant, who was convinced that he had been followed by two cars, again expressed a fear of being apprehended and transferred to Uzbekistan (see paragraph  above). Against this background, the Court is not prepared to accept that he suddenly changed his mind and travelled voluntarily to Uzbekistan unless that is corroborated by other evidence.

He did not come as promised and has not been seen or heard of since (see paragraph  above). When his representatives visited his flat on the next day it looked as if the applicant had left it for a short time and intended to return without delay: the lights were on, the refrigerator was full of food and the applicant\u2019s personal belongings, including his clothes, personal documents and photographs, religious items and everyday necessities such as a razor, a wristwatch and a mobile phone charger, had been left in the flat (see paragraphs  and  above).

In the absence of any documents \u2013 such as an extract from the border control register \u2013 recording the crossing of the Russian border by the applicant, it may be presumed that the same passport was used by him to pass through the airport border control. It is significant that that passport \u2013 which the applicant had allegedly lost in 1998 \u2013 was not listed among the documents kept in his personal detention file or among the documents which were in his possession when he was released (see\u00a0paragraphs ,  and  above).

Indeed, it cannot be excluded that the applicant could have passed through border control with an invalid passport without a clear indication as to the date of validity owing to inattentiveness or error on the part of the agent responsible. However, the question of how the applicant could have crossed the border with an invalid passport does not appear to have been addressed by the investigators at the domestic level.

In these circumstances, the Court is struck by the Government\u2019s failure to provide any plausible explanation of how the applicant was able to pass freely through the airport border control without being stopped. Again, the Court draws strong inferences from the authorities\u2019 failure to elucidate the circumstances of the crossing of the Russian border by the applicant. Indeed, it finds nothing in the Government\u2019s submissions to rebut the applicant\u2019s representatives\u2019 assertion that the Russian authorities were implicated in his transfer through the airport passport and customs checks. The Court sees only two possible sequences of events that could have taken place at the airport border control: either the authorities knowingly let the applicant through the border formalities in defiance of the fact that his name was on the list of wanted persons, or he was taken on board a plane to Uzbekistan without complying with the normal formalities. While the Court is obviously unable to accept any of the above versions as being beyond reasonable doubt in the absence of any further information about the events which unfolded at the airport in the evening of 14 December 2012, it finds it impossible to accept that the applicant\u2019s transfer on board an aircraft through the Russian State border could have taken place without the authorisation, or at least acquiescence, of the State agents in charge of Moscow Domodedovo Airport.",

The Court emphasises that it draws strong inferences in support of this version from the Russian authorities\u2019 failure to conduct a meaningful investigation (see paragraphs\u00a0 to  below) and to refute the applicant\u2019s representatives\u2019 account or provide a plausible alternative explanation of the events of that day.",

When the file was ultimately accepted by the competent investigations committee on 9 January 2013, the investigator in charge of the case immediately, and without performing any new investigative measures, refused to open criminal proceedings for lack of evidence of a kidnapping or murder.",

Indeed, the only investigative measures carried out during that month were a request for information to the Department of the Interior of the Moscow Region about train or plane tickets bought by the applicant, which did not return any results, and a request for the same information to Uzbekistan Airways. The Court finds it particularly striking that on the same day the request for information was sent to Uzbekistan Airways, and without waiting for a reply, the investigator issued a new decision refusing to open criminal proceedings reiterating the exact reasons which had been earlier invalidated by his superior.",

The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties\u2019 compliance with the Court\u2019s indications in that regard (see, inter alia, the firm position on that point expressed by the States Parties in the Izmir Declaration and by the Committee of Ministers in Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)83 in the above-mentioned case of Ben Khemais). Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken the protection of the core rights in the Convention and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0July 1989,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a088, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0161); it would also be inconsistent with the fundamental importance of the right to individual petition and, more generally, undermine the authority and effectiveness of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0100 and 125, and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v.\u00a0Turkey (preliminary objections), 23\u00a0March 1995, \u00a7\u00a075, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0310).",

Indeed, as established in paragraph\u00a0110 above, the applicant\u2019s forced transfer to Uzbekistan would not have been possible without the authorisation, or at least acquiescence, of the Russian authorities. The Court cannot conceive of allowing the respondent State to circumvent an interim measure such as the one indicated in the present case by using another domestic procedure for the applicant\u2019s removal to the country of destination or, even more alarmingly, by allowing the applicant to be removed to the country of destination in a manifestly unlawful manner (see Savriddin Dzhurayev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0217).",

This leads the Court to conclude, for the same reasons, that given the positive obligations incumbent on them under Article 34 of the Convention in the special circumstances of the present case (see the case-law cited in paragraph  above), the Russian authorities were required to take measures to protect the applicant from a forced transfer to Uzbekistan in order to comply with the interim measure and to make possible a proper and effective examination of the present application.

In such circumstances, the Court\u2019s finding that the applicant would face a serious risk of ill-treatment in Uzbekistan (see paragraph 128 above) has been rendered nugatory as it can no longer effectively protect him against the risk of ill-treatment there.",
