However, the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and wellbeing are adequately secured (see Kud\u0142a v.

It further observes in this connection the conclusions of the CPT, which in its 2011 general report stated that the damaging effect of solitary confinement can be immediate, and increases the longer the measure lasts and the more indeterminate it is. Given the potentially very damaging effects of solitary confinement, it should be used as a disciplinary punishment only in exceptional cases and as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time (see paragraph 89 above).

It further observes that the domestic authorities continuously applied the measure in question, despite the applicant\u2019s psychiatric disorders and various other chronic conditions (see paragraphs 49-50 above). On nine occasions throughout the period under consideration the applicant was found fit for detention in the PKT punishment cells.

The State must ensure that given the practical demands of imprisonment, the health and well-being of a detainee are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical assistance (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a093-94; Kalashnikov v.

On the whole, the Court reserves sufficient flexibility in defining the required standard of health care, deciding it on a case-by-case basis. That standard should be \u201ccompatible with the human dignity\u201d of a detainee, but should also take into account \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d (see Aleksanyan v.

In this connection the Court points out that it has previously found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a number of Russian cases where the Russian courts refused leave to appear in court to prisoners who had wished to make oral submissions on their civil claims (largely based on their personal experience), having found that the applicants had not been afforded adequate opportunities to effectively argue their civil cases (see Kovalev v. Russia, no.\u00a078145/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-38, 10\u00a0May 2007; Khuzhin and Others v.

In those cases the Court pointed out the failure of the domestic courts to consider other possibilities for securing the applicants\u2019 participation in the hearing of their civil cases, one of which being holding a hearing at the location where the convicted person was serving the sentence (see also paragraph 87 above).",

All these factors cannot be said to have no implication on the public character of the proceedings. At the same time, the Court is of the opinion that for practical reasons one cannot expect the hearing of his or her civil case in an off-site court session taking place in a prison to have exactly the same public exposure as it would have in an ordinary courtroom.",

Such items were to be left with a junior inspector responsible for the meeting until the end of the visit (see paragraph 86 above). The Court considers that those restrictions cannot be said to have been insurmountable, and were certainly not such as to strip the applicant of the opportunity of receiving high quality legal advice. It finds therefore that the applicant\u2019s lawyer should bear the responsibility for not respecting the colony\u2019s internal rules and leaving the applicant to represent himself.",
