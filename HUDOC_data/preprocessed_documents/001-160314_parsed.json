Notwithstanding that, the owner of the website concerned was liable for them. According to the court\u2019s reasoning, Act no. CVIII of 2001, transposing Directive 2000/31/EC on Electronic Commerce into Hungarian law, did not apply to the applicants\u2019 case since it only related to electronic services of commercial nature, in particular to purchases through the Internet. Under section 2(3) of the Act, electronic commercial services were information society-related services whose purpose was the sale, purchase or exchange of a tangible and moveable property, which was not the situation in the applicants\u2019 case. In any event, pursuant to its section 1(4), the scope of the Act did not extend to expressions made by persons acting outside the sphere of economic or professional activities or public duties, even if uttered in connection with a purchase through the Internet. For the Court of Appeal, the comments were private utterances which did not fall under Act\u00a0no.\u00a0CVIII of 2001 on Electronic Commercial Services. Thus, there was no reason to assess the meaning of the terms of \u2018hosting service providers\u2019 and \u2018intermediaries\u2019 under that Act. Nonetheless, the comments attracted the applicability of the Civil Code rules on personality rights, notably Article\u00a078. Since the comments were injurious for the plaintiff, the applicants bore objective liability for their publication, irrespectively of the subsequent removal, which was only relevant for the assessment of any compensation.",

The K\u00faria held that the applicants were not intermediaries in terms of section 2(lc) of Act no. CVIII and they could not invoke the limited liability of hosting service providers.

As they stated, an expression damaging reputation might also be committed by imparting and disseminating information obtained from other persons. The expressions published had contained unduly injurious, insulting and humiliating statements of facts which were contrary to the rules governing the expression of opinions. The publication of a fact might also amount to an opinion since the circumstances of the publication might reflect an opinion. Honour and reputation, however, did constitute an outer limit even to opinions or value judgments. Under Articles 75(1) and 78(1)-(2) of the Civil Code, the statement or dissemination of an injurious and untrue fact concerning another person, or the presentation with untrue implications of a true fact relating to another person constituted defamation.",

The Court also reiterates that it is not for it to express a view on the appropriateness of methods chosen by the legislature of a respondent State to regulate a given field. Its task is confined to determining whether the methods adopted and the effects they entail are in conformity with the Convention (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2004I). Thus, the Court confines itself to examining whether the K\u00faria\u2019s application of the relevant provisions of the Civil Code to the applicants\u2019 situation was foreseeable for the purposes of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. As the Court has previously held, the level of precision required of domestic legislation \u2013 which cannot provide for every eventuality \u2013 depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a038433/09, \u00a7 142, ECHR 2012). The Court has found that persons carrying on a professional activity, who are used to having to proceed with a high degree of caution when pursuing their occupation, can on this account be expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos.\u00a021279/02 and 36448/02, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2007IV).",

Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both cases (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 87, and Von Hannover v.

Where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, \u00a7 88, and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 107, with further references to MGN Limited, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0150 and 155; and Palomo S\u00e1nchez and Others v.

Moreover, the Court reiterates that there is an interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies, for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good.

Indeed, it cannot be excluded that the impugned comments were injurious towards the natural person behind the company and that, in this sense, the decisions of the domestic courts intended to protect, in an indirect manner, that person from defamatory statements.

It identified a number of relevant criteria, out of which the particularly pertinent in the present case, to which the Court will revert below, are: contribution to a debate of public interest, the subject of the report, the prior conduct of the person concerned, the content, form and consequences of the publication, and the gravity of the penalty imposed on the journalists or publishers (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v.\u00a0France [GC], cited above, \u00a7 93; Von Hannover v.

This is essentially what distinguishes these comments from the hate speech dealt with in Delfi AS. This decisive difference is rightly noted in, inter alia, paragraph 64 of the judgment.
