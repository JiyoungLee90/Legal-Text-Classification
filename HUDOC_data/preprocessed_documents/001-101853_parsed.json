Over and above that, it was necessary to recognise the complexity of the issues which had been opened up by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Hirst, and the extensive consultation which would have to be undertaken before the Government could form a view as to the appropriate way forward. Since the Convention rights conferred by Article 3 of the First Protocol were in no way absolute, there were many possible levels at which the line might be drawn for the enfranchisement or disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners in different categories, and it could be no part of this Court's function to make an uninformed choice among such alternatives.\u201d",

The consequence of this is that not only is Mr Sweeney [Deputy Director, Rights and International Relations in the Political Directorate at the Northern Ireland Office] entitled to say ... that the Government is unlikely to propose that prisoners serving sentences as long as those of the applicants should become entitled to vote whilst detained, but I am left singularly unconvinced that the applicants are currently or will ever be able to lay claim to a right to vote. I reject the argument of Mr Larkin [for the applicants] that because a blanket prohibition on prisoners is incompatible with the Convention that somehow converts into the proposition that all prisoners are currently entitled to vote until the vacuum is filled. In my view that conforms neither with principle nor logic and certainly does not find any authority in Hirst which expressly recognises that restraints on Article 3 Protocol 1 are justifiable provided they pursue a legitimate aim and are proportionate.\u201d",

As for the alternative, selection of one particular category of prisoner simply because one of that category happens to be the Claimant, to effect what would in fact be a substantial amendment of the legislation, but only as to one category of convicted prisoner, cannot be an appropriate exercise of this jurisdiction.

He submits that I can and should make a declaration that s3 of the 1983 Act is incompatible with the ECHR, and do so by reference to the fact that it excludes (together with all other convicted prisoners) post-tariff lifers. Then there would be some point in making the declaration, given that the Government's proposed legislation seems, subject to what may have emerged from the second consultation, to be intended not to make any change in their position. Hence, it would be a declaration as to the incompatibility with regard to the present legislation, but to be made because it does not appear as if there is going to be any amelioration of his client's position by reference to the proposed legislation. This would effectively simply amount to the declaration of incompatibility being a peg upon which Mr Southey can hang his substantive submissions, to which I shall come in a moment.

He therefore sought to argue that he was entitled to rely directly upon his right to vote and stand as a candidate in European Parliament elections in his country of residence, as guaranteed by Article 20(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (see paragraph 48 above). Mr Beggs' position was therefore to be distinguished from that of the applicants, who were both British nationals and were not exercising their free movement rights under EU law. Further, no right derived from EU law existed in respect of national elections. In any event, the judges of the Court of Session, sitting as the Registration Appeals Court in Smith v. Scott, had already stated unequivocally that the ERO had acted lawfully in refusing to enrol serving prisoners on the electoral register (see paragraph 29 above). The only possible relief which the applicants could have obtained had they sought to appeal the decision of the Sheriff in their cases was another declaration of incompatibility, which the applicants contended was not a remedy which they were required to exhaust before bringing their complaints to .",

Second, the applicants considered the Government's contention fanciful in light of the observations made by the judges of the Court of Session in Smith v. Scott (see paragraph 29 above). These observations made it clear that courts in  would not even consider, let alone uphold, any further argument based on a sympathetic interpretation of unequivocal legislation banning prisoners from voting in any election. Any suggestion that the proceedings in  should be viewed as evidence that there remained an effective remedy which had not been exhausted was, the applicants contended, simply wrong given that the Scottish legal system remained distinct from the English legal system and that decisions of the English courts were not binding on the Court of Session. The Court of Session had made its own views on the matter clear and the fact that English courts might adopt more sympathetic views was irrelevant.",

No further appeal from the , which is composed of three judges of the Court of Session, is possible. Even if a declaration of incompatibility were to be considered an effective remedy, and the Court recalls in this regard that it has recently reiterated that the practice of giving effect to the national courts' declarations of incompatibility by amending offending legislation is not yet sufficiently certain for this to be so (see Kennedy, cited above, \u00a7 109), the Court emphasises that the Registration Appeal Court in Smith v. Scott had already made such a declaration. There was no advantage in obtaining a second one, a point made by the Court of Session in Traynor and another and by the High Court in  (see paragraphs 32 and 37 above). In the circumstances, there was nothing to be achieved by the applicants in pursuing their legal challenges to the decision of the ERO in the hope of obtaining a further declaration of incompatibility.",

Section 4 of the 1983 Act provides that a person is entitled to be registered in the register of parliamentary electors if, inter alia, he is not subject to any legal incapacity to vote. Section 3(1) of the same Act stipulates that a convicted person is legally incapable of voting during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence. It is clear that, as Burton J said in Chester, a challenge to section 8 of the 2002 Act is \u201cpurely parasitic\u201d to the real challenge which is to section 3 of the 1983 Act (see paragraph 38 above). Given the findings of the  in Smith v. Scott as regards the possibility of reading down section 3 of the 1983 Act (see paragraph 29 above) and the approach of the Outer House to an argument based on the Scotland Act 1998 in Traynor and another (see paragraph 31 above), the Court is of the view that the possibility of seeking to circumvent the ban on prisoners voting in European elections by lodging a \u201cparasitic\u201d challenge to section 8 of the 2002 Act did not offer to the applicants reasonable prospects of success. In reaching this conclusion, the Court further refers to, although does not depend on, the opinion of Burton J in the High Court (see paragraphs 35-36 above) and the findings of Gillen J in the High Court of Northern Ireland as to the scope for domestic courts to extend the right to vote to prisoners pending amending legislation (see paragraph 33 above).",

In any event, the granting of leave in  occurred well after the elections to the European Parliament of June 2009 and almost two years after the applicants had lodged their applications with this Court. To the extent that the grant of leave can now be considered to indicate the availability of a potential remedy, it was not foreseeable prior to the 2009 elections that such an argument could offer reasonable prospects of success and was therefore not a remedy that the applicants in the present case were required to exhaust.",

The provision imposes a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners in prison. It applies automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances.

The Italian cases could be distinguished as the restrictions on bankrupts in those cases were far-reaching and gave rise to serious breaches of the Convention.

The Government concluded that there was no material difference between the present cases and Hirst and invited the Court to conclude that the forthcoming amendment of section 3 of the 1983 Act constituted sufficient just satisfaction.

However, as regards non-pecuniary damage, the Court recalls that it has in the past examined claims by applicants for punitive damages to reflect the particular character of the violations suffered by them and to serve as a deterrent in respect of violations of a similar nature by the respondent State, and for aggravated damages to reflect the fact that they were victims of an administrative practice. It has declined to make any such awards (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Article 50), 1 April 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 35-38, Reports 1998II; Sel\u00e7uk and Asker v.

The Government submitted that features of the present applications made the effective operation of the pilot judgment procedure difficult. The first difficulty arose as a result of the wide margin of appreciation which, the Government submitted, the Grand Chamber had afforded to the State in Hirst. The second difficulty resulted from the recent judgment of the Court in Frodl, which the Government considered departed significantly from the principles set out in Hirst and which, at the time of the Government's submission, was pending before the panel of the Grand Chamber.",

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant's position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court's findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

While the respondent State's action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements.

One of the fundamental implications of the pilot judgment procedure is that the Court's assessment of the situation complained of in a \u201cpilot\u201d case necessarily extends beyond the sole interests of the individual applicant and requires it to examine that case also from the perspective of the general measures that need to be taken in the interest of other potentially affected persons (see Broniowski (friendly settlement), cited above, \u00a7 36; and Hutten-Czapska (friendly settlement), cited above, \u00a7 33). As the Court has already indicated, the prevailing situation has given rise to the lodging of numerous subsequent well-founded applications. There are currently approximately 2,500 applications in which a similar complaint is made, around 1,500 of which have been registered and are awaiting a decision. The number continues to grow, and with each relevant election which passes in the absence of amended legislation there is the potential for numerous new cases to be lodged: according to statistics submitted by EHRC, there are approximately 70,000 serving prisoners in the  at any one time (see paragraph 75 above), all of whom are potential applicants. The failure of the respondent State to introduce legislative proposals to put an end to the current incompatibility of the electoral law with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is not only an aggravating factor as regards the State's responsibility under the Convention for an existing or past state of affairs, but also represents a threat to the future effectiveness of the Convention machinery (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0193).",

It is not disputed by the Government that general measures at national level are called for in order to ensure the proper execution of the Hirst judgment. It is further clear that legislative amendment is required in order to render the electoral law compatible with the requirements of the Convention (see, inter alia, paragraphs 42-43 above). In light of the lengthy delay which has already occurred and the results of the delay in terms of follow-up applications, the Court, like the Committee of Ministers, is anxious to encourage the speediest and most effective resolution of the situation in a manner which complies with the Convention's guarantees. The question therefore arises whether it is now appropriate for the Court to provide the respondent Government with some guidance as to what is required for the proper execution of the present judgment.",

On that basis, there was a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in that case. However, the Court recalls that the Grand Chamber in Hirst declined to provide any detailed guidance as to the steps which the United Kingdom should take to render its regime compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, despite the Government's contention in that case that such guidance was necessary (see Hirst, \u00a7 52). As the Court emphasised in Hirst, there are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe which it is for each Contracting State to mould into their own democratic vision (see \u00a7 61 of its judgment). The Court recalls that its role in this area is a subsidiary one: the national authorities are, in principle, better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions and, as a result, in matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2003-VIII; and Sukhovetskyy v.

In this regard, the Court observes that the Government of the respondent State have carried out consultations regarding proposed legislative change and are currently actively working on draft proposals (see paragraphs 42-44 and 47 above). Emphasising the wide margin of appreciation in this area (see Hirst, \u00a7 61), the Court is of the view that it is for the Government, following appropriate consultation, to decide in the first instance how to achieve compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 when introducing legislative proposals. Such legislative proposals will be examined in due course by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of the execution of the Hirst judgment. Further, it may fall to the Court at some future point, in the exercise of its supervisory role and in the context of any new application under Article 34 of the Convention, to assess the compatibility of the new regime with the requirements of the Convention.",

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the respondent State must introduce legislative proposals to amend section 3 of the 1983 Act and, if appropriate, section 8 of the 2002 Act, within six months of the date on which the present judgment becomes final, with a view to the enactment of an electoral law to achieve compliance with the Court's judgment in Hirst according to any time-scale determined by the Committee of Ministers.",

In the meantime, all pending applications before the Court were adjourned (see, for example, the approach in Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0198; Burdov, cited above, \u00a7 146; and Olaru, cited above, \u00a7 61). However, those cases involved property complaints or complaints regarding non-enforcement of domestic judgments. In those circumstances, the benefits of requiring the domestic authorities to introduce a remedy or to offer specific redress in all pending cases were clear. In the present cases, the violation is of an entirely different nature. No individual examination of specific cases is required in order to assess the appropriate redress. Further, no financial compensation is payable: the relief available from this Court is of a declaratory nature. The only relevant remedy is a change in the law, which while no doubt affording satisfaction to all those who have been or may be affected by the current blanket ban is unable to undo past violations of the Convention in respect of particular individuals.",

Such applications can be distinguished from cases where some form of individual measure might be necessary in order for any future judgment to be implemented. Examples of the latter type of case include applications complaining of non-enforcement of domestic judgments or length of domestic proceedings, where financial recompense is usually required. The Court emphasises that it has clearly established, both in the present judgment and in its judgment in Hirst, that the prevailing situation has given rise and continues to give rise to a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of every prisoner who is unable to vote in an election to the legislature and whose ineligibility arises solely by virtue of his status of prisoner. It has further declined to award non-pecuniary damages in respect of this violation. The award made in respect of costs in the present cases was limited to the proceedings before this Court and reflected the fact that extensive written submissions were lodged. In future follow-up cases, in light of the above considerations, the Court would be likely to consider that legal costs were not reasonably and necessarily incurred and would not, therefore, be likely to award costs under Article 41. As a consequence of the Court's approach to just satisfaction outlined above, an amendment to the electoral law to achieve compliance with the Court's judgment in Hirst will also result in compliance with the judgment in the present cases and with any future judgment handed down in any of the comparable cases currently pending before the Court. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it has discharged its obligation under Article 19 of the Convention, \u201cto ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto\u201d and concludes that nothing is to be gained, nor will justice be best served, by the repetition of its findings in a lengthy series of comparable cases, at a significant burden on its own resources and with the resulting impact on its considerable caseload. In particular, such an exercise would not contribute usefully or in any meaningful way to the strengthening of human rights protection under the Convention.",
