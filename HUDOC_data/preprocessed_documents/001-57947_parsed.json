You do not deal in Mickey Mouse money just reeling off noughts because they sound good, I know you will not. You have got to consider money in real terms.  Sometimes it is said 'Well, how much would a house cost of a certain kind', and if you are giving a plaintiff as compensation so much money how many houses is he going to buy?  I do not mean to suggest that Lord Aldington or any other plaintiff would take his damages and go and buy a house or a row of houses, but that relates it to the sort of thing, if you will allow me to say, you and I do know something about, because most of us have a pretty good idea how much houses are worth.

He added that, with some hesitation, he found that on several specific points the appeal had just enough strength to lead him to conclude that security for costs should not be awarded in this case.  There was a possibility that if the applicant succeeded in convincing the Court of Appeal that he had not had a fair trial, and his case had not been fairly and clearly put to the jury, the Court of Appeal would conclude that a new trial had to be ordered, notwithstanding the fact that the chances of his succeeding on the new trial were slim.

In the meantime the jury should be invited to consider the purchasing power of any award which they might make and to ensure that any award they made was proportionate to the damage which the plaintiff had suffered and was a sum which it was necessary to award him to provide adequate compensation and to re-establish his reputation (see paragraph 28 above).

The subject-matter of the applicant's appeal on damages was evidently the award of \u00a31.5 million and not the sum of \u00a3300,000.  Indeed, as also noted by the Court of Appeal, the offer \"was not a concession by the plaintiff's solicitors that the award was too high ...\"  So, the fact that the applicant declined to accept the offer cannot be taken to mean that he was disinterested in the issue of damages.  On the contrary, it suggests that he was aware of the fact that under English libel law the questions of liability and damages are interlinked.  As stated by Lord Hailsham in Broome v. Cassell & Co. Ltd, the purpose of damages in the law of libel is that someone \"must be able to point to a sum ... sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge\" (see paragraph 23 of the judgment).

In this connection, I attach importance not only to the limited scope of judicial control of jury awards but also to the absence of reasoning for such awards and the resultant difficulty in challenging their reasonableness.  These factors, in my view, militate strongly in favour of the conclusion that the restrictions placed on the applicant's access to the Court of Appeal were disproportionate for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6).

Also, I respectfully disagree with the majority that \"there is nothing to suggest ... that the applicant would have been able to raise the money had he been given more time\" (see paragraph 64 of the judgment).  It was implicit in his request for an extension that he was willing to furnish the security or at least make efforts to do so, but the Court of Appeal gave the applicant no realistic opportunity to show that he would be able to raise the required sum if given more time.

Notwithstanding the fact that the case had been extensively heard in the High Court, the conditions set for the applicant to pursue his appeal to the Court of Appeal exceeded the respondent's State's margin of appreciation; they impaired the very essence of the applicant's right of access to court and were disproportionate for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). Consequently, I find that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).    ",
