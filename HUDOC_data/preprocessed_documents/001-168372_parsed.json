The Court considers that, in certain circumstances, the timeliness of a parliamentary interpellation is of comparable importance. Moreover, interpellation in the Hungarian system is a right of each Member of Parliament. It constitutes an important minority right that needs special protection in the parliamentary activity of a democracy (see Kar\u00e1csony and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 157).",

The disciplinary supervision by the Speaker of Parliament is \u2013 in principle \u2013 an important counterweight to the Member of Parliament\u2019s privileges. By contrast, States have very limited latitude in regulating the content of parliamentary speech. However, some regulation may be considered necessary in order to prevent forms of expression such as direct or indirect calls for violence. In verifying that the freedom of expression remains secured, the Court\u2019s scrutiny in this context should be stricter. In any case, through the generally recognised rule of parliamentary immunity the States provide an increased level of protection to speech in Parliament, with the consequence that the need for the Court\u2019s intervention could nonetheless be expected to be rare. The Court attaches importance to protection of the parliamentary minority from abuse by the majority. It will therefore examine with particular care any measure which appears to operate solely, or principally, to the disadvantage of the opposition.

That said, the obscene references in the second interpellation remain highly problematic, even in the face of the fact that it was written in response to the ban on the first one.

There is no need to enlarge on what that gesture meant and to argue that it was vulgar and outrageous. That \u201cnon-verbal expression\u201d was a barefaced, ostentatious manifestation of unparliamentary speech (for further convenience, in this opinion I use the word \u201cspeech\u201d in its broader sense, which encompasses also symbolic speech, that is to say body language). Unparliamentary speech, verbal or non-verbal (that is, symbolic expressions), is by definition grossly inappropriate and unacceptable in all parliaments of the civilised world. Vulgar, obscene expressions may be and indeed are tolerated in many other fields of life (for instance in fiction, theatre, the cinema, etc.). In parliaments, however, they are malum in se, not merely malum prohibitum (even if a prohibitum element often is also there). In a parliament, unparliamentary speech can and must be censured, and an MP who resorts to it can and must be sanctioned, as a rule, by the respective parliament itself and without undue delay. The fact that certain manifestations of unparliamentary speech may at the same time constitute political speech, which is protected inter alia by the Convention, does not prevent those expressions from being unacceptable in a parliament, and therefore constituting an actionable activity. This goes without saying. These are the rudiments of parliamentarianism, but also of civic culture, and not only civic culture, but culture per se.",

But that gesture was noticed (and, as the minutes of the Parliament session of that day reveal, even applauded) by some other MPs and caught by the Parliament TV camera and the media. At some later point, having become aware of Mr Szanyi\u2019s \u201cnon-verbal expression\u201d, the Speaker proposed to impose on him the sanction provided for in section 48 of the Parliament Act. Had the sanction been not applied, it would have been most surprising \u2013 not because Mr Szanyi was a member of opposition, but because of the very nature of his \u201cnon-verbal expression\u201d and its connotations.",

The first presumption is that all speech in a parliament is political speech and that all political speech, irrespective of its contents, enjoys high procedural protection under Article\u00a010; even if an MP clearly, blatantly, cynically misuses and abuses his or her freedom of expression, all procedural guarantees (or \u201csafeguards\u201d, as the two words are used interchangeably in this judgment, but also in Kar\u00e1csony and Others [cited above], on which, as already mentioned, this judgment claims to rely so heavily) must be available to the abuser, otherwise no sanction can be imposed on him or her for that \u201cpolitical\u201d speech. The second presumption is that an MP may be a person so unintelligent and/or irresponsible that he or she is unable to understand what actions are not tolerated per se in a cultured society and, like a small child, has to be explicitly informed that a no-no is a no-no and that if he or she commits a no-no, a sanction will follow; that information must be provided to him or her under a competitive, quasi-judicial procedure which should satisfy the strict requirements of due process; where such information was not provided to him or her or was provided in some simpler way (orally, for example), that MP is absolved from responsibility. The third presumption is that if an MP resorts to unparliamentary speech, he or she can still not only defend the expression used, in a parliamentary debate, but also legitimately expect that that debate may be used as (that is to say, be converted into) a forum for justifying the respective manifestation of unparliamentary speech, with the result that no sanction will be imposed for even the most obscene \u201cpolitical\u201d expression and that the use of that expression may be forgiven or even encouraged.",

Another hypothetical, but no less unrealistic answer would have been that the applicant pleaded that he did not know that the gesture was not unacceptable, at least in the parliamentary chamber. Come on. This is the Parliament, not a kindergarten, and Mr Szanyi was an elected member of that Parliament. Moreover, as one could infer from his public statements available urbi et orbi on internet, he even seems to be proud of his show. Or (one more hypothetical answer to the principal question not addressed in the judgment) perhaps the Parliament had to debate whether, under any specific circumstances, Mr Szanyi\u2019s vulgar gesture could be considered forgivable and thus permissible? This, again, is not serious. In a parliament, unparliamentary speech is unacceptable and therefore actionable by definition.",

After all, it was he who made the vulgar gesture in Parliament, so arguably he owed at least some kind of explanation to that Parliament (or its Speaker)? On the web, one can find several explanations by Mr Szanyi, which I consider rather inconsistent and contradictory, none of them cogently setting out why, or even to whom, he made that gesture, although it seems that the applicant uttered no apology or regret for having done so. Be that as it may, no explanation in the media or in any other non-parliamentary forum can replace an official motion, which has to take place in Parliament. For such an official explanation, the applicant had ample time between 18 March 2013, when he so blatantly misbehaved, and 25 March 2013, when the Speaker initiated disciplinary proceedings against him, and even more time until 28 March 2013, when the plenary voted on imposing the sanction on him.",

Parliament is by definition a venue where its members may speak freely and this is an indispensable element of a deliberative democracy. Speech in parliament is matter of the MP\u2019s individual choice. It cannot be imputed to the State and a single MP cannot speak for the whole parliament. Adequate guarantees that the opposition\u2019s voice can be heard in parliament are essential in a constitutional democracy. Issues placed on the parliamentary agenda may more easily attract the attention of the press and of citizens, and thus the ability to raise issues for discussion in parliament enables the opposition to trigger a broader public debate. It also forces the majority to engage in the debate and to take a stance on the issues under discussion. Furthermore, there is a fundamental difference between the situation of judges, whose freedom of speech is limited in many ways and, in particular, by the duty to speak in defence of judicial independence, and the situation of members of parliaments who enjoy the guarantees of a free mandate.",

Freedom of the parliamentary mandate is an essential element of the legal framework delimiting the scope of MPs\u2019 powers. The mandate granted to an MP by the people is very wide-ranging and encompasses broad discretion with regard to parliamentary speech. At the same time, speech in parliament is part of an MP\u2019s official functions. In speaking, MPs take part in the exercise of State power within a legally regulated decision-making process. Free speech in parliament has its source not in the inalienable human dignity of the MP but in the (extensive but nonetheless not unlimited) delegation of power by the sovereign people. It does not serve the personal self-fulfillment of the MP, but rather the common good. In other words: free speech in parliament is granted by the citizens for the benefit of the citizens and not for the benefit of the parliamentarians. Speech by a citizen exercising his or her fundamental human right and speech by an elected representative in the decision-making process, undertaken in the name of the people and for the people, are two different things. The latter is not a human right but a matter of the proper organisation of State institutions and decision-making processes in a representative democracy.",

The majority considers that an interpellation is a way of exercising a legally protected freedom and assesses the applicant\u2019s interpellation with the conceptual apparatus of limitations on freedom. Such an approach is difficult to accept from the viewpoint of legal theory. An interpellation is not only a channel for expressing views, but is first and foremost a way of doing things with words (compare J.L. Austin, How To Do Things With Words, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963). The capacity to lodge an interpellation is not a freedom but a power in the Hohfeldian sense (see W.N. Hohfeld, \u201cSome fundamental legal conceptions as applied in judicial reasoning\u201d, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 23, no. 1, November 1913, pp.\u00a01659, and \u201cFundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning\u201d, The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 26, no. 8, June, 1917, pp.\u00a0710770), or a competence as understood by A. Ross (The Theory of Directives and Norms, London: Routledge and Kegan, 1968, pp. 130-133). The notion of power (competence) presupposes a precise determination of the power holder, the procedure for the exercise of the power, the possible content of the act to be performed, the scope of its addressees and the legal consequences. An act performed by the power holder can produce its intended effects only if it remains within the substantive and formal limits of the empowerment. Even assuming that the power of an MP to lodge interpellations is a human right protected under the Convention, it cannot be adequately assessed with the conceptual apparatus designed for the evaluation of restrictions on freedom.",
