The journal contained no record of his subsequent departure, apparently as a result of the fact that the door guard forgot to make the relevant entry. On that date the applicant was questioned by investigator I.S. about Mr\u00a0O.S.\u2019s disappearance. After the questioning, the applicant felt ill and was offered to stay in a police cell to recuperate. On 20\u00a0March\u00a02004 at 3\u00a0a.m. an ambulance arrived to treat the applicant for blood-pressure complaints. Subsequently he felt better and left the cell by 8\u00a0a.m. on 20\u00a0March\u00a02004. At about 4\u00a0p.m. on 20\u00a0March\u00a02004 members of the voluntary citizens\u2019 guard (\u0413\u0424 \u00ab\u0413\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u043a\u00bb) spotted the applicant who, apparently under the influence of alcohol, was swearing in a public street. As the applicant refused to cease his disorderly conduct in response to their demands, the guards took him to the Police Department. A report of an administrative offence was drafted and the applicant was detained in the ITT. According to applicable regulations, the staff of the ITT should have organised a medical examination of the applicant to detect any injuries or sickness before placing him in the ITT. No injuries were recorded on his body. However, since the applicant lodged no health-related complaints, the examination could have been cursory. In this connection it was not possible to rule out that the applicant\u2019s bruises could have been sustained by a fall on 20\u00a0March\u00a02004, shortly before he had been taken to the police, as at the time he was apparently under the influence of alcohol. At the same time, the applicant\u2019s alcohol level was not checked, as he was not charged with being drunk in a public place. Between 22 and 27\u00a0March\u00a02004 the applicant was daily checked out from his cell by officer I.S. for several hours at a time. These check-outs were for the purposes of the applicant\u2019s engagement in community service or for discussions on public morale. On 27\u00a0March\u00a02004 the applicant voluntarily confessed to having killed Mr\u00a0O.S. The same day at 7\u00a0p.m. the applicant was released.",

What the State must do under this provision is to ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (Vala\u0161inas v.

The second treatment (for adenoma) was administered to the applicant some six months after his release. Further, as regards the complaint about smoking in the cells, the applicant provided no evidence that he was in fact held with smokers, that he requested to be moved to another cell on this basis, or that he suffered any health problems associated with passive smoking (see, a contrario, Ostrovar v.
