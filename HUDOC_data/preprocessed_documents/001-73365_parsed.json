In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999I).",

Moreover, concerning the submissions of 22 June 2000, the Court is satisfied that the mere fact that the applicant\u2019s lawyer could react to the respondent\u2019s appeal brief only at the review stage does not render unfair those proceedings viewed as a whole. Furthermore, it considers that the submissions of the applicant in this connection do not raise any issue under Article 6 \u00a7 2.",
