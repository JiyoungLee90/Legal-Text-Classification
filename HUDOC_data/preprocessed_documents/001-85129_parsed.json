The sole purpose of those proceedings was to challenge the legality of the disputed administrative decisions. Nevertheless, according to the applicants' own evaluation, the value of their property which remained blocked amounted to about EUR 24,000,000.

Nor can we identify in this situation any link or similarity with the area of class actions and the criteria which are used in such cases to calculate the amounts to be awarded to each of the successful parties (in respect of pecuniary damage). We consider that, whatever the number of victims, each of them must be compensated, \u201cif necessary\u201d, for the consequences which he or she must have suffered as a result of the violation in question. Just satisfaction is rightly provided for in Article 41 to compensate the victim of a violation in so far as possible. What was at stake in the domestic proceedings and its effects on the person of the applicant are, we believe, the decisive factors to be taken into consideration.",

In our opinion, however, this is the inevitable consequence of several questionable aspects of the Court's practice with regard to the application of Article 41 in the event of a violation of the right to a reasonable length of proceedings. These range from an almost automatic assumption that non-pecuniary damage has been sustained, without the requirement of any evidence or argument, and the use of mathematical calculation criteria which take into account the entire length of the proceedings, even the period recognised as justified, to the use in this area of scales which are unrelated to the Court's practice concerning violations which cause considerably greater suffering to the victims (Articles 2, 3, 8, 10, etc.).",
