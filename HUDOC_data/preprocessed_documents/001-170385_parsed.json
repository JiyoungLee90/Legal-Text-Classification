Such an utterance was capable of attaining a sufficient level of seriousness in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life. The domestic authorities were thus faced with the difficult task of balancing two conflicting values, namely freedom of expression for the applicant on the one hand and A.M.\u2019s right to respect for his reputation on the other (see\u00a0Axel\u00a0Springer AG [GC], cited above, \u00a7 83, \u00a7 84). In such cases one factor the Court has taken into account is the position of the person concerned by the publication: whether or not he or she was a \u201cpublic figure\u201d or had otherwise \u201centered the public scene\u201d. Another important factor is whether the statement in question contributed to a debate of general interest (see\u00a0Krone\u00a0Verlag GmbH v. Austria, no. 27306/07, \u00a7 53, 19 June 2012).",

The Court has already held that journalists and publicists, like other persons actively involved in public life, should display a greater degree of tolerance for criticism against them (see Kurski v. Poland, no. 26115/10, \u00a7 50, 5 July 2016).",

Such a matter could, and in the present case did, give rise to a public debate. In this respect the Court reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on freedom of expression when a matter of public interest is at stake (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associ\u00e9s v. France [GC], no.\u00a040454/07, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). The Court further observes that the domestic courts correctly recognised the context in which the applicant\u2019s allegation had been made. They expressly referred to the ongoing public debate in Poland about the necessity of lustration (see paragraph 22 above) and even noted that had the applicant used a more general formulation his statement would have fallen within the limits of acceptable criticism (see\u00a0paragraph 16 above).",

The domestic courts, referring to expert opinions, considered that the phrase in question had been a statement of fact (see paragraphs 13 and 23 above). There is no reason to depart from this assessment. Even statements made in the context of a wider debate on an issue of public concern should have a solid factual basis on which to base that allegation (see \u00c4rztekammer f\u00fcr Wien and Dorner v. Austria, no. 8895/10, \u00a7\u00a069, 16 February 2016). However, the domestic courts, after carefully examining examples of public statements made by A.M., concluded that there had been no such factual basis. While A.M. had indeed been critical towards the lustration law he had never defended the two persons named as \u201cagents\u201d by the applicant (see paragraphs 17 and 23 above). The Court does not see a reason to find the domestic courts\u2019 conclusion unreasonable or arbitrary.",

The Court further notes that in deciding on the amount to be paid to charity the domestic courts carefully weighed the possibilities and determined the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant in the light of his financial situation (see paragraph 24 above). It has not been argued, let alone shown, that the amounts the applicant was obliged to pay had a disproportionate impact on him. Therefore, the sanction imposed cannot be found to have been disproportionate (see, mutatis mutandis, Genner v. Austria, no.\u00a055495/08, \u00a7 49, 12 January 2016).",
