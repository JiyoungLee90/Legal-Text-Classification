N. and G. were accused of acting on the orders of X. together with seven other people. The court indicated numerous shortcomings in the investigation. In particular, G.\u2019s complaints that he had been ill-treated by police with the aim of extracting a confession from him had to be checked; it was not established who had taken part in the arson attack and what each person\u2019s role was; others allegedly involved in arson attacks were wanted, but nothing had been done to search for them. The court noted in particular that the investigation should check \u2019s alibi and establish why and on what grounds, when arresting Z.F. and searching the first applicant\u2019s house, he had been working outside his area of territorial jurisdiction. The applicants also testified in a court hearing that  had threatened them with reprisal. The court, however, did not specify in its decision what the reason for the alleged reprisal was. The court noted that  himself admitted that he had visited the first applicant\u2019s house several times in 2001. The first applicant was also not informed about the decision not to institute criminal proceedings against Major I. The documents from the internal investigation were not joined to the criminal case file and the applicants\u2019 representative\u2019s request of May 2002 was not answered. The court noted that \u2019s former wife, the ambulance doctors, the firemen and the first applicant\u2019s neighbours should be questioned. Finally, the court indicated a large number of various investigative actions which were to be performed by investigation authorities.",

In this respect, ECRI notes with concern frequent reports of excessive use of force, ill-treatment, verbal abuse and destruction of property by law enforcement personnel. Discriminatory practices are also reported to be widespread and include arbitrary checks, unwarranted searches, confiscation of documents and, as noted in ECRI\u2019s first report, discriminatory enforcement of crime prevention policies targeting persons with criminal records. ECRI urges that action be taken to address manifestations of unlawful behaviour on the part of law enforcement officials generally, including through a more effective institutional response to such manifestations and through training and awareness raising measures. In addition, noting reports that the response of the police to crimes committed by the general population against Roma/Gypsies is often inadequate, ECRI recommends that the Ukrainian authorities take measures to ensure that the police react promptly and effectively to all crimes, including those committed against Roma/Gypsies and, in line with its recommendations formulated above, to ensure that the racist element of such offences is duly taken into account.\u201d",
