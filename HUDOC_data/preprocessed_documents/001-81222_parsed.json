It is true that the cases of Mr Pridatchenko, Mr Sychev and Mr Frolov were examined by military courts, i.e. the courts composed of military personnel and attached not to a particular administrative territorial unit, but to a garrison. However, nothing suggests that the military courts are not \u201ctribunals\u201d within the meaning of Article 6. Therefore, the applicants, despite their special status, were not excluded by the domestic law from the \u201caccess to a court\u201d within the meaning of Article 6. Basing on the test developed in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others, the Court concludes that Article 6 is applicable to the domestic proceedings at issue.",
