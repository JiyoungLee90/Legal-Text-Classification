It considered, in favour of the applicant, that this was his first criminal conviction, that the first delivery had failed (the drugs did not actually enter the distribution system), and that the applicant had been detained on remand since July 2001. The Regional Court held against the applicant that he had used as drugs runners two young women who were adolescents at the time the offences were committed, and who ran the risk of a lengthy prison sentence in South America; that he had exploited the naivety of his daughter\u2019s mother; that a large amount of cocaine was meant to be smuggled in the first case and that four kilograms of cocaine were smuggled into Europe in the second case; and that the entire undertaking had been handled very professionally. In addition, the Regional Court considered that a conviction for a third case of drug smuggling could not be envisaged for the sole reason that the precise amount of cocaine transported in a suitcase from Peru to Spain could not be determined.",

It held that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was mandatory pursuant to Section 47 \u00a7 1 of the Aliens Act (Ausl\u00e4ndergesetz; since 2004: Section 53 of the Residence Act) which foresaw the mandatory expulsion of an alien if he or she were sentenced to either at least three years\u2019 imprisonment for a criminal offence, or to any period of imprisonment (not on probation) for an offence under the Narcotics Act. The authority examined whether the applicant enjoyed special protection against expulsion because he was the father of a German child. It found that the applicant had lived with his daughter only for a short time prior to his imprisonment, she had thus experienced separation from the applicant and that, in the light of the applicant\u2019s very serious criminal offences, the State\u2019s interest in removing the applicant prevailed over his interest in enjoying family life with his daughter. He could remain in contact with her by letter or telephone and could apply for permission to enter Germany for specific periods of time (Betretenserlaubnis). It considered that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was in conformity with Article 8\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. This decision, which also contained an unlimited re-entry ban and notice that he would be deported to Nigeria if he did not leave Germany voluntarily within four weeks after being released from prison, became final on 26 August 2003.",

The exception to this rule, foreseen in the third sentence of this paragraph, was not applicable because the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of that provision (see paragraph 34 below).",

Second, a claim to a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Section 25 \u00a7 5 of the Residence Act was proscribed because the applicant did not have a valid passport, which was a general requirement for the granting of a residence permit (see paragraph 32 below). As the decision to waive this requirement in cases concerning residence permits on humanitarian grounds was a discretionary one, the applicant did not have a claim to a residence permit within the meaning of Section 10 \u00a7 3, third sentence, of the Residence Act, not even if the margin of appreciation were reduced to zero (see paragraph 34 below). Third, the court found that the applicant could not base a claim to a residence permit on impediments to his return to his country of origin either, referring to the outcome of the asylum proceedings in 2008 and 2009 (see paragraph 18 above). The Court of Appeal concluded that, under these circumstances, it was not decisive whether the ties between the applicant and his daughter were such that the requirements for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under Section\u00a025 \u00a7 5 of the Residence Act were met, if the applicant\u2019s asylum application had not been dismissed, and refrained from elaborating on this aspect.",

The purpose of Section 10 \u00a7 3 of the Residence Act was to sanction abuse of the asylum procedure, but an abusive asylum application should not bear negative consequences where the foreigner had a claim, within the meaning of that provision, to a residence permit. In that regard, it should be decisive whether or not the substantive requirements of the respective provision for a residence permit were met, as in his case with regard to the permit based on family ties, and that the reason for the claim not being realised, in his case the final expulsion order against him, should not be relevant.",

A residence permit based on family ties was precluded because of the final expulsion order against the applicant.

In that regard, it had to be borne in mind that the duration of the applicant\u2019s re-entry ban was limited to five years by the decision of the Authority of the City of Munich of 9 February 2010 and that, starting one year after his actual expulsion, he could apply for permission to enter Germany twice a year for a total of four weeks.

Against this background, the Court is satisfied that the relationship between the applicant and his daughter, at the time the decision denying him a residence permit became final on 16 February 2012 (see paragraph 26 above and Trabelsi v.\u00a0Germany, no. 41548/06, \u00a7 47, 13 October 2011), constituted \u201cfamily life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Latvia (dec.), no. 66729/01, 29 April 2003). Nevertheless, in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State\u2019s obligations will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest (Jeunesse, cited above, \u00a7 107). The applicable principles are similar in respect of positive and negative obligations under this provision. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (ibid., \u00a7 106).",

Another important consideration is whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved were aware, due to the immigration status of one of them, that the persistence of that family life within the host State would from the outset be precarious (ibid., \u00a7 108). The Court has further held that where children are involved, their best interests must be taken into account. Whilst alone they cannot be decisive, such interests certainly must be accorded significant weight. Accordingly, national decision-making bodies should, in principle, advert to and assess evidence in respect of the practicality, feasibility and proportionality of any removal of a non-national parent in order to give effective protection and sufficient weight to the best interests of the children directly affected by it (ibid., \u00a7 109).",

While he successfully completed professional re-training in 2012, he has not been allowed to engage in gainful employment since his release from prison. Moreover, the drugrelated offences committed by the applicant prior to the birth of his daughter were very serious and he had committed further offences, albeit of a less serious nature, since his release from prison, weighing in favour of his exclusion from Germany (compare and contrast Jeunesse, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116; Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

Also, the applicant\u2019s exclusion from Germany was not permanent, but limited to five years (see paragraph 20 above).",

Second, the Court notes that the authorities have not deported the applicant while the proceedings have been pending before it. In the light of the length of these proceedings, if the applicant were eventually deported to Nigeria, there would have been a significant lapse of time between the final decision denying him a residence permit on 16 February 2012 and the actual deportation, allowing the Court to have regard to the developments during that time (see, mutatis mutandis, Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, \u00a7\u00a7 92-95, ECHR 2008). By the time the present judgment becomes final, the applicant\u2019s daughter will have almost reached the age of eighteen. The argument that she would be deprived of a \u201clived\u201d relationship with the applicant for the remainder of her childhood if he were not allowed to remain in Germany loses considerable weight when it is considered that the failure to execute the deportation order for the period of time outlined above has ensured that the applicant has been able to enjoy family life with his daughter for most of her life, barring the period spent in prison.",

It notes that the authorities had last engaged in a balancing exercise regarding the relationship between the applicant and his daughter and her best interests when they issued the expulsion order against the applicant in 2003 (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above). The relationship between the applicant and his daughter cannot reasonably be considered to have been the same in 2012 as it had been in 2003. Nonetheless, again having regard to developments that occurred after the final decision on a residence permit was taken, the Court observes that the immigration authorities sought to reach an agreement with the applicant on 1 August 2012 which would have allowed him to return to Germany two and a half years after his proposed expulsion (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above). This agreement can be understood as a subsequent balancing exercise that had regard to the individual circumstances of the case.",
