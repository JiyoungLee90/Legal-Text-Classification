Turning to the present case, they noted that the applicant\u2019s complaints had been mainly directed at the probative value of the evidence and the conduct of the proceedings before the first-instance court. Therefore, the Court of Appeal by its decision of 17\u00a0December 2007 had duly decided on the merits of the case and the probative value of the evidence.

Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a019867/12, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2017; see also Marini v. Albania, no. 3783/02, \u00a7\u00a0105, 18 December 2007). The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 26, ECHR 1999I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings (see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 29-30, Series A no. 303A, and Higgins and Others\u00a0v.\u00a0France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I). Moreover, in cases relating to interference with rights secured under the Convention, the Court seeks to establish whether the reasons provided for decisions given by the domestic courts are automatic or stereotypical (see, mutatis mutandis, Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a025358/12, \u00a7 210, ECHR 2017 (extracts).",

The Court observes that where a Supreme Court refuses to accept a case on the basis of the legal grounds for such a case not having been made out, very limited reasoning may satisfy the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see Marini, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0106).",
