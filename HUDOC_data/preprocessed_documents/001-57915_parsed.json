The reprinting and distribution of the issue in dispute after the seizure was no bar either, since the fact of making information public, covered by Article 98, did not necessarily have the consequence that secrecy should not be preserved. Articles 98 and 98a contained statutory provisions envisaged in Article 7 of the Constitution and Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention; since the seizure and withdrawal from circulation were designed to safeguard the interests protected by Articles 98 and 98a, they fell within the permitted restrictions on the right to freedom of expression. In referring to national security, the court below had clearly shown that what was in issue in the instant case was information whose secrecy was necessary in the interests of the State. Lastly, the seizure and withdrawal from circulation could not be equated with imposing a condition of \"prior authorisation\", even though the public could not acquaint itself with the opinions and ideas contained in the printed matter.",
