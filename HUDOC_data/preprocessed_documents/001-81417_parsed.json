Moreover, it found that there had been no instruction by the employer for the undertaking of the relevant action. It ruled therefore, that the applicant shared the responsibility with the employer for the injuries sustained: it consequently reduced the award by 50% together with statutory interest (\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0430).
