The Government quoted the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area which recognised the special status accorded in Contracting States to public servants and, in particular, their right to maintain the procedures necessary to ensure the integrity of those recruited into the civil service (see, amongst others, the Glasenapp v.\u00a0Germany judgment of 28 August 1986, Series A no. 104; the Vogt v.\u00a0Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and the Commission\u2019s decision in Quinn v. the United Kingdom, no. 33694/96, 23\u00a0October 1997, unpublished). In the more recent case of Pellegrin v.\u00a0France ([GC] no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999-II), disputes concerning posts involving the exercise of state authority were still excluded, and this applicant would have been working in a position of trust in a Department which wielded a portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power. In their view, Tinnelly case (Tinnelly & Sons Limited and Others, and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1633) was not relevant to the present case which concerned, in their view, a dispute about recruitment to the civil service which fell outside the scope of the Convention.",

Under this test the only disputes excluded from Article 6 \u00a7 1 are those which are raised by public servants \u201cwhose duties typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter is acting as the depository of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities\u201d (see \u00a7 66).

Even if such a postholder were part of a Department which did have such influence and could, potentially, apply for higher post, the Court does not find that an administrative assistant of this kind falls within the category of public servant described in the Pellegrin case.

The right is not however absolute. It may be subject to legitimate restrictions, for example, statutory limitation periods, security for costs orders, regulations concerning minors and persons of unsound mind (see the Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, pp. 1502-3, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a051-52; the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13\u00a0July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 80-81, \u00a7\u00a7 62-67; the Golder judgment, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 39).

No evidence as to why the applicant was considered a security risk was ever presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, nor was there any scrutiny of the factual basis of the Secretary of State\u2019s decision in the proceedings for judicial review brought in the High Court.

The Court observes however that the Government have failed to identify any new elements which could lead it to depart from its conclusion in the Tinnelly case that the severity of the restriction imposed by the conclusive section 42 certificate, which was tantamount to removal of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction by executive ipse dixit, was not mitigated by other available mechanisms of complaints, and that the situation in Northern Ireland did not exclude the introduction of special judicial procedures more apt to provide the individual with procedural justice.
