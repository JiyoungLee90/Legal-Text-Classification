The Act does not require the Secretary of State to refer the case to the Board unless the prisoner applies for that to happen, but the reality is that the Secretary of State routinely does refer post-tariff lifers to the Parole Board. The reason behind that is that it is common ground that Article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights requires there to be a speedy hearing an independent judicial body, and the Parole Board it is accepted is the equivalent for the purposes of the Convention, to determine whether the continued detention is lawful. In fact it is the practice of the Secretary of State, in cases where the tariff exceeds 3 years, to provide a dossier to notify the Parole Board 6 months before the end of the tariff. The purpose behind that being the obvious one, to enable the Board to put in train steps to ensure that there is a hearing as soon as reasonably possible after the tariff is served.",

In this case the cause has been the lack of man power in the Parole Board which has meant that it has been unable to provide the necessary panel, which in the case of a lifer and in deciding questions of possible release because it is said that the individual is no longer dangerous, has to be a panel headed by a judicial member.

The evidence before me, from a number of solicitors who have experience in dealing with these cases, makes it clear that the delays continue and the backlog has not improved, and indeed that latter point is made clear by evidence produced by the Secretary of State and by the Parole Board. But, as I say, one has to recognise that the changes can not be expected to take place overnight. I do not doubt that the authorities will now appreciate the need to get on top of this problem and to ensure that the hearings that are required are provided, and that the requirements of Article 5(4) are met. While, as I say, in the circumstances of this case, it does not particularly avail the claimant because he will not have achieved release, there may well be cases where that is not the case, and I am glad to see that one of the measures put in place is a more flexible approach by the Board to consideration of cases which do need priority. Obviously, if it has been made clear, perhaps in a pre-tariff hearing, that a particular prisoner, once he has served his tariff, is a real candidate for immediate release, then the sooner that particular individual has a hearing the better.",

It will not be helpful, either to the prisoner or to the court, if claims are brought which in reality, because of the existing situation, are not likely to achieve any sensible redress and merely add to costs. Of\u00a0course, one has sympathy with those who may stay in prison longer than they perhaps, on one view, ought to. That is a thoroughly unsatisfactory state of affairs. But, equally, the court cannot do the impossible. We cannot make orders which are only going to create difficulties for others and are not in any way desirable, because, as I have already said, it is not helpful that prisoner A gets relief which may advance him in the queue but which inevitably means that prisoner B has a longer wait. As I repeat, absent special circumstances, claims of this nature should now be discouraged. But, this has at least brought home to the court, and enabled the court to make the point, that the situation that existed was unsatisfactory, potentially contrary to law, and the court welcomes the steps that are clearly being taken now to ensure that that situation does not continue.\u201d",

Thus, as far as securing the applicant a speedy review before the Parole Board was concerned, in finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4, the judge in the High Court did all that could be expected of him in the circumstances of the systemic problem with which he was confronted. The Court further acknowledges that by the time of the High Court\u2019s judgment, steps were being taken by the authorities to try and address the systemic delay. However, the fact remains that the situation of delay which arose at the relevant time was the direct result of the failure of the authorities to anticipate the demands which would be placed on the prison system as a result of the introduction of the IPP sentence. These demands were not unforeseeable (see, generally, the judgments of the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords summarised in the Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee, cited above, and \u00a7\u00a7 203, 206-210, 215-216 and 218 of that judgment). It was for the State to organise its judicial system in such a way as to enable its courts to comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (R.M.D. v. Switzerland, 26\u00a0September 1997, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VI; Hutchison Reid v. the , no. 50272/99, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2003IV; and Abidov v. , no. 52805/10, \u00a7 61, 12 June 2012). The belated steps taken by the authorities to address the systemic problem did not relieve them of their obligation to ensure that the applicant enjoyed a speedy review as required by that Article. The failure to implement the applicant\u2019s entitlement under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention continued for some good while after the ruling by the High Court.",

The Court notes that it has already found that the outcome of the judicial review proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case did not provide him with redress for the violation of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 4. It further refers to the comments of the High Court judge to the effect that in light of what was being done, it was no longer appropriate for any prisoner to take proceedings against the Parole Board alleging breaches of Article 5 \u00a7 4 unless there were very special circumstances (see paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint about the post-September 2009 delay does not appear to give rise to any such circumstances: it concerned the continuation of the same delay which had led to the High Court judgment in the first place. The Court is therefore satisfied that it was not necessary for the applicant to commence further judicial review proceedings for the period of delay from September 2009 to January 2010.",

The Court observes in this regard that the applicant was advised by senior counsel, who was an experienced specialist in the public law and human rights field, that an appeal would be unsuccessful. The advice was based on the view that, like the High Court, the Court of Appeal would not be prepared to prioritise any individual case when the evidence demonstrated that there was a systemic lack of resources (see paragraph 19 above). The Government have failed to identify any similar case where judicial review proceedings resulted in the prioritisation of the prisoner\u2019s case. It is also noteworthy that the High Court in Alcock followed the reasoning set out in the applicant\u2019s case (see paragraphs 30-31 above). The Court is accordingly persuaded that any appeal to the Court of Appeal did not offer to the applicant reasonable prospects of success (contrast Fox v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 61319/09, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, 20\u00a0March 2012).",

The Government have not drawn the Court\u2019s attention to any similar case where damages were awarded. It cannot be regarded as unreasonable for the applicant not to have sought an award of damages under the Human Rights Act. Furthermore, at the time of the applicant\u2019s judicial proceedings and when he lodged his application with this Court, the alleged breach was a continuing one in respect of which, in view of the reasons set out above regarding the adequacy of the redress provided to the applicant (see paragraph 40 above), the effectiveness of a remedy seeking an award of damages in the absence of means ensuring a prompt review by the Parole Board is to be doubted. The Government\u2019s objection is therefore dismissed.",
