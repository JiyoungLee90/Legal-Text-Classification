The case originated in an application (no. 33930/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Sergey Nikolayevich Krutko (“the applicant”), on 7 July 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev, of the Ministry of Justice.
On 13 December 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Kharkiv.
In August 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Moskovskyy District Court of Kharkiv against the State-owned company Kharkivskyi Elektromekhanichnyi Zavod, seeking compensation for loss of a part of his salary due to its delayed payment, and compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the respondent’s failure to pay his salary in due time.
On 3 November 2003 the court awarded the applicant 634.03 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) in compensation for loss of a part of his salary due to the delay in its payment.
On 25 December 2003 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal partially modified that judgment and awarded the applicant an additional UAH 1,072.62 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On the same date the judgment became enforceable.
In January 2004 the applicant and the respondent company appealed in cassation.
In December 2004 the applicant requested the Moskovskyy District Court to issue a writ of execution in his favour.
The court refused to issue a writ of execution on the ground that the case file had been sent to the Supreme Court.
On 7 April 2006 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the court of appeal.
On 20 July 2006 the applicant received the writ of execution.
On 27 July 2006 the applicant submitted it to the Bailiffs.
On 12 September 2006 the applicant received the amount awarded.
