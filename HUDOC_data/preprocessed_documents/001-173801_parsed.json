On both occasions the court held that the grounds relied on by the court when applying the custodial measure still persisted, and that the applicant was charged with eight counts of a serious crime, committed between December 2007 and February 2009 and punishable by three to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. He was further suspected of having committed another fifteen similar offences, in respect of which he had refused to testify. He had confessed only in part and had refused to testify as either a suspect or an accused. Although the applicant had been dismissed from his post, he remained on good terms with his colleagues from the pharmacology department, including its acting head. He could therefore have access to information and documents which might be of interest to him. All of the above, as well as the position which the applicant had taken in the proceedings, gave the court grounds to believe that, if released, he might exert pressure on witnesses (the students at the Medical Academy), destroy evidence or otherwise interfere with the proceedings. In particular, according to the investigator\u2019s submissions made before the court, two more witnesses in the case had explained that they had had problems passing their pharmacology exams and that they believed it to be a means of making them change their position in the case in respect of the applicant. Lastly, the court held that, in view of the above circumstances, the custodial measure could not be replaced by a more lenient preventive measure.",

The court held that some of the grounds on which it had relied when extending the applicant\u2019s detention were no longer valid. However, it noted the gravity of the charges against the applicant, the fact that he was suspected of having committed a further fifteen similar offences and that three more criminal cases had been opened against him in that connection in February-March 2009, and the fact that on 29\u00a0July 2009 seventeen other criminal cases had been opened against him on suspicion of twenty-nine criminal offences. The court further relied on the applicant\u2019s refusal to give evidence as either a suspect or an accused and the potential for him to influence the witnesses (the Academy\u2019s students), destroy evidence and otherwise obstruct the course of justice. The court found unconvincing the applicant\u2019s argument to the effect that the students had already taken their pharmacology exams and were on summer holidays, since this did not exclude the risk of the applicant\u2019s meeting them outside the Academy. The court therefore found that it would not be appropriate to apply a more lenient preventive measure.",

They submitted that the length of his detention was due to the complexity of the case and the discovery, in the course of the pre-trial investigation, of further criminal activity by the applicant, which required the carrying out of additional investigative measures. Thirty-two witnesses were questioned during the investigation and the case file comprised twelve volumes. The domestic court assessed all the pertinent circumstances relating to the applicant\u2019s personality and his family situation. The investigating authority provided the court with information on the applicant\u2019s official position and on the newly discovered criminal activity revealed during the investigation. The court took into consideration that the witnesses were students who were in some ways dependent on the professors of the pharmacology department managed by the applicant before his dismissal and the fact that they could face difficulties in this connection when taking their exams. During the active stage of the investigation and the gathering of evidence it was therefore necessary to isolate the applicant from society. Once all the facts of the applicant\u2019s criminal activity had been established and the evidence gathered, it was no longer necessary to keep him in detention and the custodial measure was therefore lifted. The proceedings against the applicant were conducted diligently, and there was therefore no violation of his rights under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.",

The gravity of the charges against him and the discovery of new criminal activities could not justify his continued detention. Nor could his continued detention be justified by his refusal to testify, a right which, along with the presumption of innocence, was guaranteed by the Constitution. The courts ignored the fact that he had no criminal record, had positive references from his workplace and outstanding professional achievements, that he had a permanent place of residence and a family, and suffered from a number of chronic health conditions which required qualified medical assistance. All of those factors made it clear that there had been no risk of his absconding, resuming criminal activity and exerting pressure on witnesses. The domestic court had not indicated one single instance of his putting pressure on witnesses or otherwise interfering with the investigation. His state of health had considerably deteriorated in detention, and on 11\u00a0October 2009 he had been designated as having a third-category disability.",

France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7\u00a036, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, and Dalban v. Romania [GC], no.\u00a028114/95, \u00a7\u00a044, ECHR 1999VI). Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the breach of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life was acknowledged by the domestic authorities (see\u00a0paragraphs 22, 23 and 26 above). As regards the issue of redress, the Court notes that the decision of 27\u00a0August 2009 granting the applicant\u2019s application for a family visit could have been regarded as adequate redress for the alleged breach of his rights under Article 8 of the Convention, had it actually been enforced. However, it transpires from the applicant\u2019s submissions, which were not contested by the Government, that regardless of the above-mentioned decision, he was never afforded an opportunity to have a family visit while in pre-trial detention (see paragraph\u00a027 above). In such circumstances, the Court concludes that the applicant has not lost his victim status in relation to the alleged violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",
