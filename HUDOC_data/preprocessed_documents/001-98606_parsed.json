Finland the Court qualified tax surcharge proceedings against the applicant as falling under the criminal law limb of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (cited above \u00a7 38). However, as regards compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1, the Court found no breach of that provision on account of a lack of an oral hearing. It emphasised that the obligation to hold a hearing was not absolute and, in particular, acknowledged that the national authorities may have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy in deciding whether or not to hold an oral hearing (cited above \u00a7 42). Even though requirements of a fair hearing under Article 6 \u00a7 1 for the sphere of criminal law were stricter than civil law, the Court did not exclude that in the criminal sphere the nature of the issues to be dealt with before the tribunal or court may not require an oral hearing. Notwithstanding the consideration that a certain gravity attaches to criminal proceedings, which are concerned with the allocation of criminal responsibility and the imposition of a punitive and deterrent sanction, it was self-evident that there were criminal cases which did not carry any significant degree of stigma. There were clearly \u201ccriminal charges\u201d of differing weight and, consequently, the criminal-head guarantees did not necessarily apply with their full stringency (cited above \u00a7\u00a043). The Court concluded that the requirements of fairness were complied with and did not necessitate an oral hearing, since no issue of credibility arose in the proceedings which required oral presentation of evidence or cross-examination of witnesses. Further, a minor sum of money was at stake and the applicant was given ample opportunity to put forward his case in writing, (cited above \u00a7\u00a7 46-49).",
