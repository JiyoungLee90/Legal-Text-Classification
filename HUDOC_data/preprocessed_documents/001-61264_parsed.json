On receipt of this petition, the Malazgirt Public Prosecutor's office instigated an investigation into the applicant's allegations. However, there were striking defects and omissions in the investigation. The Court would observe that the applicant's fellow villagers denied the content and veracity of the statements taken by the gendarmes, stating that they had been asked to sign blank sheets of paper and statements which had been written in advance and which had not been read out to them (see paragraph 57 above). The Court, having found these three witnesses' evidence credible, considers this practice totally incompatible with the notion of an investigation required by Article 13 of the Convention. The Court also points to its earlier finding that the statements taken from fifteen village guards were of a stereotyped nature - giving the impression that they had been prepared by the public prosecutor - and that therefore no particular weight can be attached to them (see paragraph 63 above).

However, it should be borne in mind that, following the destruction of his family home, the applicant had no permanent address to give to the authorities since he was moving from one city to another in order to find a shelter for himself and his family.
