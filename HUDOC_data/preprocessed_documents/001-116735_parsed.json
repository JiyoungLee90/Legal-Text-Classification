They noted that the second applicant\u2019s father had not consented to the adoption, without giving any reasons for his position. Furthermore, they alleged that he had displayed the utmost antagonism towards the family and that the court should therefore override his refusal to consent under Article 181 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Code, as the adoption was in the best interests of the second applicant. In support of their submissions, the applicants attached a report from the Youth Welfare Office which confirmed that the first and third applicants shared the day-to-day tasks involved in caring for the second applicant and the overall responsibility for his upbringing, and which concluded, while expressing doubts as to the legal position, that the award of joint custody would be desirable.",

Austria (no.\u00a040016/98, ECHR 2003IX), the difference in treatment between unmarried heterosexual couples and same-sex couples was particularly problematic. Only a few European States allowed second-parent adoption in same-sex couples; the majority of States reserved second-parent adoption to married couples, and there was a consensus that unmarried different-sex couples and same-sex couples should not be treated differently. The difference complained of did not serve a legitimate aim: in particular, it was not necessary in order to protect the child\u2019s interests. There was research to show that children developed just as well in families with homosexual parents as in families with heterosexual parents. What was important was not the parents\u2019 sexual orientation but their ability to provide a stable and caring family.

The legislation therefore provided first and foremost for the biological parents to have custody, or the biological mother in the case of a child born outside marriage. Only where this was not possible did the law provide for other persons to be awarded custody of a child. If the biological parents (father and mother) were present, it was unnecessary to award custody to another person, even if, from a purely factual viewpoint, that person had a close relationship with the child (compare OGH, 7 Ob 144/02 f).

Accordingly, the legislation goes so far as to confer a right on the child to have personal contact with the parent not living in the same household (see, inter alia, OGH, 3 Ob 254/03 z). It is likewise beyond dispute that, for a minor child to thrive, it is highly desirable that he or she should have a personal relationship with both \u2013 opposite-sex \u2013 parents, in other words, with both a female (mother) and a male (father) caregiver, and that efforts should be made to that end (compare, inter alia, EFSlg 89.668).

However, the first-instance court also correctly pointed out that national legal systems must be afforded a margin of appreciation in enacting legislation, a margin which is correspondingly broader where there is no clear consensus between member States\u2019 legal systems in the sphere in question. While noting that the margin of appreciation must not be interpreted as giving States carte blanche to make arbitrary decisions, the first-instance court observed that it must be construed very generously in the sphere of the right of homosexuals to adopt, as these were issues which were subject to societal change. In the context of this assessment, the Austrian legal system made no provision for the adoption of a child by the same-sex partner of one of the parents.",

In such cases the child therefore continues to have two opposite-sex parents and caregivers. This state of affairs, which is important for the child\u2019s development, does not however apply in the event of his or her adoption by the same-sex partner of one of the parents; there is therefore no evidence of an unjustified difference in treatment in this regard. Furthermore, in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights cited by the appellants (see Karner v. Austria, [cited above]), the Court reiterated that a difference in treatment of people living in a same-sex relationship was to be considered discriminatory only if it had no objective and reasonable justification, that is if it did not pursue a legitimate aim, or if there was not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Court would thus regard a difference in treatment as compatible with the Convention only where very weighty reasons had been put forward. Particularly compelling reasons therefore had to be advanced to justify any difference in treatment based on sexual orientation. However, the Court also explicitly acknowledged in this regard that protection of the \u2018traditional family\u2019 was, in principle, a weighty and legitimate reason which might justify a difference in treatment by the national legislature. At the same time, it found that the aim of protecting the family in the traditional sense was rather abstract and that a broad variety of concrete measures could be used to implement it. Compelling reasons had to be given for excluding people living in homosexual relationships from the scope of application of certain legal provisions. In the case in question, which concerned the right of a deceased person\u2019s same-sex partner to succeed to a tenancy, the Court found that no such reasons had been given.",

Hence, in the view of this court, the decision by the legislature not to provide for a child to be adopted by the same-sex partner of one of the parents, with the result that the relationship with the opposite-sex parent is severed, unquestionably pursues a \u2018legitimate aim\u2019. Likewise, it cannot be said that \u2018no reasonable relationship of proportionality\u2019 exists between this aim and the means employed. This legal situation is not based \u2013 contrary to the appellants\u2019 assertions \u2013 on \u2018the prejudice of the heterosexual majority towards the homosexual minority\u2019, but is merely designed to ensure that minor children have regular contact with both a female and a male parent while they are growing up. This aim must be respected in just the same way as the decision of the child\u2019s mother to live in a same-sex partnership. Thus, there is no apparent justification for depriving the child of his family-law relationship with his parent of the other sex.

While heterosexual couples (including unmarried ones) could establish an additional parent-child relationship between the child and its parent\u2019s partner, this was impossible for same-sex couples, as the same-sex partner would replace the biological parent. Thus, any meaningful kind of second-parent adoption was excluded.

However, the  had not shown that the exclusion of same-sex families from second-parent adoption was necessary to achieve that aim. Recent studies showed that same-sex couples were just as capable of raising children as different-sex couples. Moreover, the present case did not concern the question whether the second applicant should or should not grow up in a same-sex family. He was already part of a de facto same-sex family. The question therefore was whether it was justified to deny legal recognition to the relationship between him and the first applicant. It had not been shown to be necessary to distinguish between unmarried heterosexual and same-sex couples. Finally, the applicants maintained that in many European States second-parent adoption was reserved to married couples. They asserted that where a State chose, as  had, to allow second-parent adoption in unmarried couples, it was not free to make a distinction on the basis of sexual orientation.",

This interpretation was in conformity with the Constitution and in particular with Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, member States had a particularly wide margin of appreciation in the sphere of adoption by homosexuals, as these issues were subject to societal change and were in a state of transition.

Where both the opposite-sex parents were present, there was no need for a provision enabling one of the parents to be replaced by the same-sex partner of the other; this did not reflect any wish to discriminate against same-sex partners.

In the case of Frett\u00e9 [cited above], the European Court of Human Rights was called upon to examine whether the authorities\u2019 refusal to authorise the adoption of a child by a homosexual man amounted to discrimination. In its judgment of 26 February 2002, the Court found that adoption meant \u2018providing a child with a family, not a family with a child\u2019. According to the Court, it was the State\u2019s task to ensure that the persons chosen to adopt were those who could offer the child the most suitable home in every respect. Not least in view of the wide differences in national and international opinion concerning the possible consequences of a child being adopted by one or more homosexual parents, and bearing in mind the fact that there were not enough children to adopt to satisfy demand, States had to be allowed a broad margin of appreciation in this sphere. A refusal to authorise adoption by a homosexual would not be in breach of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 8 if it pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the child\u2019s best interests, and did not infringe the principle of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.",

These are so called \u2018second-parent adoptions\u2019 and give the child two legal guardians. Second-parent adoptions also protect the parents by giving both of them legally recognised parental status. The lack of second-parent adoption deprives the child and the non-biological parent of rights if the biological parent dies or in the case of divorce, separation, or other circumstances that would bar the parent from carrying out parental responsibilities. The child also has no right to inherit from the non-biological parent. Moreover, at an everyday level, the lack of second-parent adoption rules out parental leave, which can be harmful financially for LGBT families. The third procedure is joint adoption of a child by a same sex couple.",

The Court, examining the case under Article\u00a014 taken in conjunction with Article 8, noted that French law authorised any unmarried person, man or woman, to apply to adopt, and that the French authorities had refused the applicant\u2019s request for prior authorisation on the ground \u2013 albeit implicit \u2013 of his sexual orientation. Thus there had been a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation (see Frett\u00e9, cited above, \u00a7\u00a032). The Court found that the domestic authorities\u2019 decisions had pursued a legitimate aim, namely to protect the health and rights of children who could be involved in an adoption procedure. With regard to whether a difference in treatment was justified, the Court noted in particular that there was little common ground between member States of the Council of Europe, where the law appeared to be going through a transitional phase, and that national authorities should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when ruling on such matters. In respect of the competing interests of the applicant and children eligible for adoption, the Court noted that the scientific community was divided over the possible consequences of children being brought up by one or more homosexual parents, regard being had in particular to the limited number of scientific studies on the subject published at the material time. In conclusion, the Court considered that the refusal to authorise the adoption had not infringed the principle of proportionality and that, accordingly, the difference in treatment complained of was not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 37-43).",

France (cited above), the Court, again examining the case under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article\u00a08, reversed its position. It analysed in detail the reasons given by the French authorities for refusing the applicant, who was living with another woman in a stable same-sex relationship, authorisation to adopt. The Court noted that the domestic authorities had based their decisions on two main grounds, the lack of a \u201cpaternal referent\u201d in the applicant\u2019s household or immediate circle of family and friends, and the lack of commitment on the part of her partner. It added that the two grounds formed part of an overall assessment of the applicant\u2019s situation, with the result that the illegitimacy of one ground contaminated the entire decision. While the second ground was not unreasonable, the first ground was implicitly linked to the applicant\u2019s homosexuality and the authorities\u2019 reference to it was excessive in the context of a single person\u2019s request for authorisation to adopt. In sum, the applicant\u2019s sexual orientation had been consistently at the centre of deliberations in her regard and had been decisive for the decision to refuse her authorisation to adopt (see E.B. v. France, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-89). The Court went on to say that if the reasons advanced for a difference in treatment were based solely on considerations regarding the applicant\u2019s sexual orientation, this would amount to discrimination under the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 93). It observed that, under French law, a single person was allowed to adopt and that it was undisputed that this opened up the possibility of adoption by a single homosexual. Having regard to its analysis of the reasons advanced by the French authorities, it concluded that in refusing the applicant authorisation to adopt, they had made a distinction on the basis of her sexual orientation which was not acceptable under the Convention. The Court consequently found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article\u00a08 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a094-98).",

One of them was the mother of a child conceived by means of assisted reproduction. Under French law she was the sole parent of the child. The applicants complained under Article\u00a014 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 that one partner could not adopt the other\u2019s child. More specifically, they wished to obtain a simple adoption order (adoption simple) under French law in order to create a parent-child relationship between the child and her mother\u2019s partner with the possibility of sharing parental responsibility. The domestic courts had refused the adoption request on the ground that it would transfer parental rights from the child\u2019s mother to her partner, which was not in the child\u2019s interests (see Gas and Dubois, cited above, \u00a7 62). The Court examined the applicants\u2019 situation in comparison with that of a married couple. It noted that, in cases of adoption simple, French law allowed only married couples to share parental rights. As Contracting States were not obliged to grant access to marriage to same-sex couples, and having regard to the special status conferred by marriage, the applicants\u2019 legal situation was not comparable to that of a married couple (ibid., \u00a7\u00a068). As to the situation of unmarried different-sex couples living together \u2013 like the applicants \u2013 in a civil partnership, the Court noted that second-parent adoption was not open to them either (ibid., \u00a7\u00a069). Thus, there had been no difference in treatment based on sexual orientation.

Nor can a right to same-sex marriage be derived from Article\u00a014 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (ibid., \u00a7 101). Where a State chooses to provide same-sex couples with an alternative means of legal recognition, it enjoys a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred (ibid., \u00a7 108; see also Gas and Dubois, cited above, \u00a7 66). Furthermore, the Court has repeatedly held that marriage confers a special status on those who enter into it. The exercise of the right to marry is protected by Article 12 of the Convention and gives rise to social, personal and legal consequences (see, among other authorities, Gas and Dubois, cited above, \u00a7\u00a068, and Burden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a063).",

Thus the decision not to provide for a child to be adopted by the same-sex partner of one of the parents, with the result of severing the relationship with the opposite-sex parent, served a legitimate aim. Similarly, the Supreme Court, in its judgment of 27 September 2006, noted that the primary aim of adoption was to provide children who had no parents or whose parents were not able to care for them with responsible caregivers. That aim could only be achieved by recreating the situation of a biological family as far as possible.

The legislature therefore accepts that a child may grow up in a family based on a same-sex couple, thus accepting that this is not detrimental to the child.

The Court itself has often stressed the importance of granting legal recognition to de facto family life (see Wagner and J.M.W.L. v. , no. 76240/01, \u00a7 119, 28 June 2007; see also, in the context of second-parent adoption, Eski, cited above, \u00a7 39, and Emonet and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64).",

Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see, as recent examples, S.H. and Others v.

Consequently, only those ten Council of Europe member States which allow second-parent adoption in unmarried couples may be regarded as a basis for comparison. Within that group, six States treat heterosexual couples and same-sex couples in the same manner, while four adopt the same position as  (see the comparative-law information at paragraph 57 above).

Firstly, it notes that this Convention has not been ratified by . Secondly, given the low number of ratifications so far, it may be open to doubt whether the Convention reflects common ground among European States at present. In any event, the Court notes that Article\u00a07 \u00a7 1 of the 2008 Convention on the Adoption of Children provides that States are to permit adoption by two persons of different sex (who are married or, where that institution exists, are registered partners) or by one person. Under Article 7 \u00a7 2, States are free to extend the scope of the Convention to same-sex couples who are married or have entered into a registered partnership, as well as \u201cto different-sex couples and same-sex couples who are living together in a stable relationship\u201d. This indicates that Article 7 \u00a7 2 does not mean that States are free to treat heterosexual and same-sex couples who live in a stable relationship differently. The Committee of Ministers\u2019 Recommendation of 31 March 2010 (CM/Rec\u00a0(2010)5) appears to point in the same direction: paragraph 23 calls on member States to ensure that the rights and obligations conferred on unmarried couples apply in a non-discriminatory way to both same-sex and different-sex couples. In any event, even if the interpretation of Article 7 \u00a7\u00a02 of the 2008 Convention were to lead to another result, the Court reiterates that States retain Convention liability in respect of treaty commitments subsequent to the entry into force of the Convention (see Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom, no. 61498/08, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2010).",

However, having regard to the considerations set out above, the Court finds that the Government have failed to adduce particularly weighty and convincing reasons to show that excluding second-parent adoption in a same-sex couple, while allowing that possibility in an unmarried different-sex couple, was necessary for the protection of the family in the traditional sense or for the protection of the interests of the child.

Although his mother had parental responsibility, the child had maintained strong emotional ties with his father, whom he saw regularly and who, according to the case file, paid maintenance for his son with equal regularity. The father, as he was entitled to do, had refused to consent to the adoption. It was not disputed that the child was receiving a proper upbringing within the family home provided by his mother and her partner.

The first applicant, who is the mother\u2019s partner, could not assert a right to adopt the latter\u2019s child. The second applicant, assuming that he wished to be adopted, could not claim such a right either; moreover, he already had a father and a mother. The rights of the third applicant, the child\u2019s mother, were not infringed in any way. On the contrary, the impugned legislation simply preserved her parental rights, which she did not intend to waive.

A given legislative provision may produce different effects depending on the situation to which it is applied. \u201cA mere difference in effect does not amount to and does not imply a difference in treatment, where one and the same rule produces these various effects\u201d (see the observations of third-party intervener the European Centre for Law and Justice). The effects arising out of application of the relevant provisions of Austrian law (severing of the legal tie between the adopted child and his or her biological father or mother), which are the legal and logical consequence of adoption, are echoed in the legislation of many other Council of Europe member States (see, among other examples, Articles 360 et seq. of the French Civil Code). Our Court has previously acknowledged \u201cthat the logic behind this approach to adoption, which entails the severing of the existing parental tie between the adopted person and his or her biological parent, is valid for minors\u201d and that \u201cin view of the background to and purpose of Article 365 of the [French] Civil Code ..., there is no justification, on the sole basis of a challenge to the application of that provision, for authorising the creation of a dual legal parent-child relationship ...\u201d (see Gas and Dubois v. France, no.\u00a025951/07, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2012). That assertion is valid, mutatis mutandis, in the present case. The fact that different stakeholders are involved has no bearing on the effects produced, which will always remain the same: the child cannot be adopted without the express consent of the father or mother with whom the parental tie remains. Accordingly, whether the person seeking to adopt is a man or a woman, heterosexual or homosexual, the adoption will be impossible as a matter of principle in each case.",

In doing so they overlooked the father\u2019s legitimate right to respect for his private and family life, also protected by Article 8. Notwithstanding the position of the majority on this point (see paragraphs 120 and 124 of the judgment), we believe that the option of overriding the father\u2019s wishes, available to the courts under the Civil Code, constitutes an exceptional measure which should only be imposed in serious and established cases of a flagrant breach of parental obligations; this does not appear to be the situation here. A father should not have to justify his wish to continue to be a father to his son, still less when, as in the present case, he assumes his parental responsibilities in full.",

He was aged between eleven and twelve at the time of the domestic proceedings, and is now approaching majority. He has a mother and a father: what best interests would have been served had his father been replaced by his mother\u2019s partner?

At first, it seems to want to dismiss the 2008 Convention from the outset because it \u201chas not been ratified by \u201d. This argument seems strange bearing in mind that it is the Court\u2019s usual practice to take inspiration from a number of international instruments, whether or not they have been ratified by the respondent State, on the basis that they reflect the current state of general international law (see, among many other authorities, Cudak v.  [GC], no. 15869/02, \u00a7\u00a066, ECHR 2010). In order to justify this change of tack, the Court hastens to state, precisely, that \u201cgiven the low number of ratifications so far, it may be open to doubt whether the [2008] Convention reflects common ground among European States at present\u201d. This argument, while it may at first glance appear pertinent from an international-law perspective, amounts in reality to a sort of petitio principii. In fact, the only provision of the 2008 Convention which might be relevant in the context of the present case is Article\u00a07 \u00a7 2 (cited above). However, this provision simply brings into sharper focus, we would repeat, the lack of \u201ccommon ground among European States at present\u201d. In other words, the drafters of the 2008 Convention sought, by means of this provision, to express implicitly but clearly their disagreement on the subject of second-parent adoption outside marriage and to leave themselves completely free when it came to enacting legislation on the subject. Rather than acknowledge this situation \u2013 and, hence, the Austrian Government\u2019s argument concerning the lack of consensus \u2013 the Court chose instead to cast doubt on the relevance of the 2008 Convention overall.",

The words in italics indicate clearly the complete freedom enjoyed by States when it comes to enacting legislation in this sphere.

Paragraph 23 of the Recommendation states that \u201c[w]here national legislation confers rights and obligations on unmarried couples, member states should ensure that it applies in a non-discriminatory way to both same-sex and different-sex couples\u201d. The same paragraph adds the words \u201cincluding with respect to survivor\u2019s pension benefits and tenancy rights\u201d. The last part of the sentence \u2013 which is omitted from the citation in paragraph 150 of the judgment \u2013 is clearly inspired by the Court\u2019s judgment in Karner v. Austria (no. 40016/98, in particular \u00a7\u00a7 34 et seq., ECHR 2003IX), and appears to be an attempt to place paragraph 23 of the above-mentioned Recommendation in the sphere of property \u2013 and even inheritance \u2013 rather than that of adoption. That view is corroborated by the fact that the Recommendation contains a paragraph (paragraph 27) devoted specifically to adoption. This provision \u2013 which is omitted from paragraph\u00a0150 of the judgment \u2013 reads as follows: \u201cTaking into account that the child\u2019s best interests should be the primary consideration in decisions regarding adoption of a child, member states whose national legislation permits single individuals to adopt children should ensure that the law is applied without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d This paragraph echoes the situation examined by the Grand Chamber of the Court in its judgment in E.B. v. France, cited above (see, in particular, \u00a7\u00a7 70 et seq.). It does not concern second-parent adoption.",

This is undoubtedly correct from the standpoint of States\u2019 international responsibility. However, Article\u00a07 \u00a7 2 of the 2008 Convention does not give rise to any commitments. On the contrary, it leaves States free to legislate as they see fit. Consequently, the passage cited above does not appear to be relevant in the present case. It should also be pointed out that in its recent judgment in Nada v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 10593/08, \u00a7 170, ECHR 2012) the Grand Chamber reaffirmed its previous approach, according to which, where \u201ca number of apparently contradictory instruments are simultaneously applicable, international case-law and academic opinion endeavour to construe them in such a way as to coordinate their effects and avoid any opposition between them. Two diverging commitments must therefore be harmonised as far as possible so that they produce effects that are fully in accordance with existing law (see, to this effect, Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi, cited above, \u00a7 126; Al-Adsani [v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97], \u00a7 55, [ECHR 2001-XI] and Bankovi\u0107 and Others [v.

This approach based on harmonisation \u2013 rather than opposition \u2013 between the relevant treaty instruments seems to us all the more preferable in the instant case given that the 2008 Convention on the Adoption of Children is a recent Council of Europe instrument.",

In other words, the point of the evolutive interpretation, as conceived by the Court, is to accompany and even channel change (see C.\u00a0Rozakis, \u201cThe Particular Role of the Strasbourg Case-Law in the Development of Human Rights in Europe\u201d, in European Court of Human Rights \u2013 50 Years, Nomiko Vima, Athens Bar Association, Athens, 2010, pp.\u00a020-30, and especially pp. 25 et seq.); it is not to anticipate change, still less to try to impose it. Without in any way ruling out the possibility that the situation in Europe in the future will evolve in the direction apparently wished for by the majority, this does not seem to be the case, as we have seen, at present.
