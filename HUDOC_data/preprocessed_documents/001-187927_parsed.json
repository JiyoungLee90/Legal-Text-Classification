The Court considers that given the dispute over the key facts underlying the charges, where the only evidence against the applicants came from the police officers who had played an active role in the contested events, it was indispensable for the courts to use every reasonable opportunity to check their incriminating statements, namely whether the applicants had participated in breaking through the police cordon (see Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, \u00a7 64, 3 October 2013). Failure to do so ran contrary to the fundamental principles of criminal law, namely in dubio pro reo (see Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7 166, and the cases cited therein).

As regards breaking through the police cordon imputed to the applicants, they denied having pushed through the cordon, and even if the applicants found themselves beyond the cordon, there is no evidence that it had been the result of their deliberate effort. According to the material in the case-file, the police cordon had collapsed because of the pressure of the crowd which had built up owing to the unexpected and unannounced change by the authorities of the venue layout (see also Frumkin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113-16 and \u00a7132). Apart from that, the applicants\u2019 behaviour remained strictly peaceful. The Court therefore considers that the applicants enjoyed the protection of Article 11 in the present case.",
