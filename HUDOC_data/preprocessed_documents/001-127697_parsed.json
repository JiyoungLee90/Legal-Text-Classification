It added that under Article\u00a0100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 a prisoner who had served two days of his sentence was irrevocably considered to have served three days. The application of this rule gave the beneficiary an acquired right. The Spanish courts, which had to apply this criterion to compare the terms to be served respectively under the new and the old Criminal Code, took into account the remissions of sentence granted under the old Code. They accordingly considered that where the remainder of the sentence to be served after deduction of the remissions granted prior to the entry into force of the new Code did not exceed the length of the sentence provided for in the new Code, the latter could not be considered more lenient than the old Code. That approach was confirmed by the Supreme Court in various decisions, including judgments nos. 557/1996 of 18 July 1996 and 1323/1997 of 29 October 1997.",

The case concerned a terrorist member of ETA (H.\u00a0Parot) who had been convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973. The plenary Criminal Division of the Supreme Court ruled that the remissions of sentence granted to prisoners were henceforth to be applied to each of the sentences imposed and not to the maximum term of thirty years provided for in Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The court\u2019s ruling was based in particular on a literal interpretation of Articles\u00a070.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 according to which that maximum term of imprisonment was not to be treated as a new sentence distinct from those imposed, or a distinct sentence resulting from those imposed, but rather as the maximum term a convicted person should spend in prison. This reasoning made a distinction between the \u201csentence\u201d (pena) and the \u201cterm to be served\u201d (condena); the former referred to the sentences imposed taken individually, to which remissions of sentence should be applied, while the latter referred to the maximum term of imprisonment to be served.

The reasons that lead us to this interpretation are: (a) first, a literal analysis of the relevant provisions leads us to conclude that the Criminal Code by no means considers the maximum term of thirty years to amount to a new sentence to which any reductions to which the prisoner is entitled should apply, for the simple reason that it says no such thing; (b) on the contrary, the sentence [pena] and the resulting term of imprisonment to be served [condena] are two different things; the wording used in the Criminal Code refers to the resulting limit as the \u2018term to be served\u2019 [condena], and fixes the different lengths of that maximum \u2018term to be served\u2019 [condena] in relation to the \u2018sentences\u2019 imposed. According to the first rule, that maximum is arrived at in one of two ways: the different sentences are served in descending order of severity until one of the two limits set by the system is attained (three times the length of the heaviest sentence imposed or, in any event, no more than thirty years); (c) this interpretation is also suggested by the wording of the Code, since after having served the successive sentences as mentioned, the prisoner will no longer have to discharge [i.e. serve] the remaining ones [in the prescribed order] once the sentences already served reach the maximum length, which may not exceed thirty years ...; (e) and from a teleological point of view, it would not be rational for the combination of sentences to reduce a long string of convictions to a single new sentence of thirty years, with the effect that an individual who has committed a single offence would be treated, without any justification, in the same way as someone convicted of multiple offences, as in the present case. Indeed, there is no logic in applying this rule in such a way that committing one murder is punished in the same way as committing two hundred murders; (f) were application for a pardon to be made, it could not apply to the resulting total term to be served [condena], but rather to one, several or all of the different sentences imposed; in such a case it is for the sentencing court to decide, and not the judicial body responsible for setting the limit (the last one), which shows that the sentences are not combined into one. Besides, the first rule of Article 70 of the Criminal Code of 1973 explains how, in such a case, the sentences must be served successively \u2018the convicted person going on to serve the next sentence when the previous one has been extinguished by pardon\u2019; (g) lastly, from a procedural point of view section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act clearly states that it is a matter of setting the maximum limit of the sentences imposed (in the plural, in keeping with the wording of the law), \u2018fixing the maximum term to be served in respect of all the sentences\u2019 (the wording is very clear).",

This means that the prisoner serves the different sentences, with their respective specificities and with all the corresponding entitlements. That being so, the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 may be applied to the sentences successively served by the prisoner.",

It explained that remissions of sentence which had already been approved had to be taken into account by the trial court required to rule on the discharge (liquidaci\u00f3n) of the term of imprisonment to be served (condena), and that remissions already accrued in application of the law could not subsequently be revoked to correct any errors or permit the application of a new interpretation.

It considered that the new method of applying remissions of sentence as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s departure from its case-law in 2006 had challenged final judicial decisions concerning the interested parties. It noted that the Audiencia Nacional which had adopted the decisions in question had considered that the Criminal Code of 1973 (which provided for a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years) was more favourable to the persons concerned than the Criminal Code of 1995 (where the limit was twenty-five years) because they would have lost the right to remissions of sentence from the time the Criminal Code of 1995 entered into force had it been applied to them. Observing that the Audiencia Nacional had based its finding on the principle that the remissions of sentence provided for under the old Code should be deducted from the legal maximum term of imprisonment (namely thirty years), it held that final judicial decisions could not be altered by a new judicial decision applying another method. It concluded that there had been a violation of the right to effective judicial protection, and more specifically of the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled (the \u201cintangibility\u201d of final judicial decisions, or the principle of res judicata). Concerning the right to liberty, it considered that, regard being had to the Criminal Code of 1973 and the method of applying remissions of sentence adopted in the judicial decisions cited above, the prisoners concerned had completed their sentences, which meant that their continued detention after the release date proposed by the prison authorities (in conformity with the formerly applicable rules) had no legal basis.

It must first be observed that the question under examination does not fall within the scope of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 25 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution \u2013 namely the interpretation and application of criminal charges, the classification of the facts established in respect of the offences concerned and the application of the corresponding penalties ... \u2013 but rather concerns the execution of custodial sentences, that is to say the application of remissions of sentence for work done in detention, and the interpretation we are required to examine cannot lead to the serving of sentences heavier than those provided for in respect of the criminal offences concerned, or to imprisonment in excess of the legal limit. In a similar manner, contrary to what the prosecution have argued, the European Court of Human Rights also considers that, even when they have an impact on the right to liberty, measures concerning the execution of the sentence \u2013 rather than the sentence itself \u2013 do not fall within the scope of the principle of no punishment without law enshrined in Article\u00a07 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention provided that they do not result in the imposition of a penalty harsher than that provided for by law. In its judgment in the case of Grava v. Italy (\u00a7\u00a051) of 10\u00a0July 2003, the European Court of Human Rights reached this conclusion in a case concerning remission of sentence, citing mutatis mutandis Hogben v. the United Kingdom (no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3 March 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 46, pp. 231, 242, relating to release on licence). More recently, in its judgment of 15 December 2009 in the case of Gurguchiani v. Spain (\u00a7\u00a031), the Court stated: \u2018both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a \u2018penalty\u2019 and a measure that concerns the \u2018execution\u2019 or \u2018enforcement\u2019 of the \u2018penalty\u2019. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relate to a remission of sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the \u2018penalty\u2019 within the meaning of Article 7.\u2019",

The law obliges the courts to take into account all the sentences in cases where particularly heavy multiple sentences were imposed. There are certain exceptions to this obligation, however (Article 78 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Criminal Code currently in force). That said, the impugned decisions and the Supreme Court decision cited in them did not involve any retroactive application of that rule (which in any event is not applicable to remissions of sentence for work done in detention, as the Criminal Code of 1995 did away with such remissions). They simply applied the provisions that were in force at the time the offences of which the applicant was convicted were committed (Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973), but with a new interpretation which, although based on the method of calculation expressly provided for in Article 78 of the Criminal Code of 1995, was possible, they explained, in view of the wording of Articles 70.2 and 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. That being so, if one follows the reasoning of the judicial bodies and the applicable rules, the appellant\u2019s complaint lacks any factual basis as the principle of the non-retroactive application of a harsher criminal law enshrined in Article 25 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution is breached only where a criminal law has been applied retroactively to acts committed before its entry into force ...\u201d",

In the dissenting opinion she appended to judgment no. 40/2012, Judge A. Asua Batarrita stated that the fact that the new interpretation of the rule for calculating the term of imprisonment to be served had been applied while the sentence was already under way shed doubt on an established legal situation and distorted projections based on the consistent interpretation of the applicable rules. She described the arrangements for remissions of sentence introduced by the Criminal Code of 1973 and the distinction traditionally made between the \u201cnominal duration\u201d and the \u201cactual duration\u201d of the sentence, which the courts took into account when fixing sentences. She pointed out that remissions of sentence for work done in detention differed from other measures entailing adjustment of sentences, such as release on licence, and that the granting of such remissions was not left to the discretion of the courts, which were not bound by criteria such as the prisoner\u2019s good conduct or how dangerous he or she was considered to be. The judge concluded that remissions of sentence for work done in detention were mandatory by law. She stated that, under the Criminal Code of 1973, the principle of legality should apply not only to offences but also to the punitive consequences of their commission, that is to say the nominal limit of the prison sentences and their actual limit after deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention as provided for in Article\u00a0100 of the Criminal Code of 1973. Noting that the limits set under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the remissions of sentence for work done in detention, had effectively reduced the maximum nominal sentence (thirty years) to a shorter actual term of imprisonment (twenty years), except in the event of misconduct or attempted escape, she expressed the view that the \u201cParot doctrine\u201d had established an artificial distinction between the \u201csentence\u201d (pena) and the \u201cterm of imprisonment to be served\u201d (condena) that had no basis in the Criminal Code, and had subjected the application of the thirty-year limit to a new condition \u2013 not provided for by Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 \u2013 according to which, during that period, the sentence was to be served \u201cin a prison\u201d, thereby preventing the application of the rules on remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In her view that was tantamount to imposing a nominal maximum term of forty-five years (that is, thirty years\u2019 actual imprisonment plus fifteen years corresponding to work done in detention).",

In view of all these considerations she concluded that the interpretation by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 2006 had not been foreseeable and that there had been a violation of Article 25 \u00a7 1 (principle of legality), Article\u00a017 \u00a7\u00a01 (right to liberty) and Article 24 \u00a7 1 (right to effective judicial protection) of the Constitution.",

Germany, no. 19359/04, \u00a7 90, ECHR 2009). He specified that this requirement should apply to the real and effective duration of the deprivation of liberty. Having noted that the legislation interpreted by the Supreme Court \u2013 the Criminal Code of 1973 \u2013 was no longer in force in 2006 and could therefore be brought into play only if it worked in the convicted person\u2019s favour, he concluded that a sudden, unforeseeable departure from the case-law was incompatible with the right to liberty.

The present case should be distinguished from cases concerning discretionary measures of early release or measures that did not result in a redefinition of the penalty (the applicant referred to Hogben, cited above, Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996; Grava, cited above; and Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a036946/03, 29 November 2005). In the alternative, from the point of view of the quality of the law the present case was more like the above-cited Kafkaris judgment in terms of the uncertainty as to the scope and substance of the penalty, due in part to the way in which the rules on remissions of sentence had been interpreted and applied. In any event, it was clear from Kafkaris that the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement applied both to the scope of the penalty and to the manner of its execution, particularly when the substance and the execution of the penalty were closely linked.",

The sole purpose of combining and placing an upper limit on the sentences had been to fix the duration of the actual term to be served as a result of all the sentences imposed in the different sets of proceedings.

Furthermore, that practice had no basis in the case-law of the Supreme Court in the absence of any established principle as to the manner of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. The sole judgment delivered on this issue by the Supreme Court in 1994 did not suffice to set an authoritative precedent under Spanish law. The Supreme Court\u2019s case-law in the matter had not been settled until its Criminal Division had adopted judgment no.\u00a0197/2006. What is more, the Government argued, that case-law had been endorsed by the full Constitutional Court in several judgments delivered on 29 March 2012, containing numerous references to the Court\u2019s case-law concerning the distinction between a \u201cpenalty\u201d and its \u201cexecution\u201d.",

Remissions of sentence continued to be applied, but to each of the sentences individually, until the maximum term had been reached. Only in the case of the most serious crimes, such as those committed by the applicant, would the thirty-year limit be reached before the remissions of sentence granted for work done in detention had significantly reduced the sentences imposed. Similarly, the Chamber had mistakenly considered that the Supreme Court had retroactively applied the policy behind the legislative reforms of 1995 and 2003. It was plain to see that the reforms in question made no mention of the means of applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention, the Criminal Code of 1995 having done away with them.

Under that case-law a measure concerning remission of sentence or a change in the system of release on licence was not an integral part of the \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 (the Government referred to Grava, \u00a7 51; Uttley; Kafkaris, \u00a7 142; and Hogben, all cited above). In Kafkaris, the Court had acknowledged that a prison-law reform which was applied retroactively, excluding prisoners serving life sentences from earning remissions of sentence for work done in detention, concerned the execution of the sentence as opposed to the \u201cpenalty\u201d imposed (\u00a7 151). In the present case the Government submitted that there had been no change in prison law.

Remissions of sentence for work done in detention did not pursue the same aims as the penalty as such, but were measures relating to its execution in so far as they allowed prisoners to be released before all their sentences had been served, provided that they demonstrated a willingness to return to the social mainstream through work or other paid activities. That being so, remissions of sentence for work done in detention could not be likened to measures imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d; instead, they were measures relating to the prisoner\u2019s conduct while serving the sentence.

As remissions of sentence for work done in detention were purely a prison matter, the Supreme Court could not be criticised for having departed from previous practice with regard to the application of remissions of sentence, as the change had had no effect on the rights enshrined in Article 7. The Court had never held that the foreseeability requirement extended to the exact length of the sentence to be served taking into account sentence adjustments, remissions, pardons or any other factors affecting the execution of the sentence.

When that happens, the Court considers that the measures concerned should fall within the scope of the prohibition of the retroactive application of penalties enshrined in Article\u00a07 \u00a7\u00a01 in fine of the Convention. Otherwise, States would be free \u2013 by amending the law or reinterpreting the established regulations, for example \u2013 to adopt measures which retroactively redefined the scope of the penalty imposed, to the convicted person\u2019s detriment, when the latter could not have imagined such a development at the time when the offence was committed or the sentence was imposed.

However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation.

Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 36; C.R. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050; K.-H.W. v.

The Court notes in this connection that, by a decision adopted on 30 November 2000 on the basis of section\u00a0988 of the Criminal Procedure Act and Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, the Audiencia Nacional fixed the maximum term of imprisonment the applicant should serve in respect of all her prison sentences at thirty years (see paragraph 14 above).

There thus seems to have been a distinction between the concept of the \u201cterm to be served\u201d (condena) and the individual sentences (penas) actually pronounced or imposed in the various judgments convicting the applicant. At the same time, Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973, on remission of sentence for work done, established that in discharging the \u201csentence imposed\u201d the detainee was entitled to one day\u2019s remission for every two days\u2019 work done (see paragraph 24 above). However, that Article contained no specific guidance on how to apply remissions of sentence when multiple sentences were combined as provided for under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code and a maximum total term of imprisonment was fixed, as in the applicant\u2019s case, where sentences totalling 3,000 years\u2019 imprisonment were reduced to thirty years in application of that provision. The Court observes that it was not until Article 78 of the new Criminal Code of 1995 was introduced that the law expressly stated, with regard to the application of sentence adjustments, that in exceptional cases the total duration of the sentences imposed could be taken into account, rather than the maximum term provided for by law (see paragraph 32 above).",

It notes that, as the Government have acknowledged, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment no. 197/2006, when a person was given several prison sentences and it was decided to combine them and fix a maximum term to be served, the prison authorities and the Spanish courts applied the remissions of sentence for work done in detention to the maximum term to be served under Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973. The prison and judicial authorities thus took into account the maximum legal term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment when applying remissions of sentence for work done in detention. In a judgment of 8 March 1994 (its first ruling on this question \u2013 see paragraph 36 above), the Supreme Court referred to the maximum legal term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment as a \u201cnew, independent sentence\u201d to which the possibilities of adjustment provided for by law, such as release on licence and remission of sentence, should be applied. The Spanish courts, including the Supreme Court, took the same approach when comparing the sentences to be served respectively under the Criminal Code of 1995 and the previous Code, taking into account any remissions of sentence already granted under the previous Code, in order to determine which was the most lenient criminal law (see paragraphs 37, 41 and 48 above). Lastly, until the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment no. 197/2006 this approach was applied to numerous prisoners convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973, whose remissions for work done in detention were deducted from the maximum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 41 above).",

Indeed, in its last judgment convicting the applicant, on 8 May 2000, delivered before the decision to combine the sentences was taken, the Audiencia Nacional took into account the maximum term of imprisonment provided for in the Criminal Code of 1973, combined with the system of remissions of sentence for work done in detention provided for in Article 100 of the same Code, in determining which Criminal Code \u2013 the one in force at the material time or the Criminal Code of 1995 \u2013 was the more favourable to the applicant (see paragraph 11 above).

Moreover, it was in the same Code that the sentences were prescribed and the remissions of sentence were provided for. The Court also notes that such remissions of sentence gave rise to substantial reductions of the term to be served \u2013 up to a third of the total sentence \u2013 unlike release on licence, which simply provided for improved or more lenient conditions of execution of the sentence (see, for example, Hogben and Uttley, both cited above; see also the dissenting opinion of Judge A.\u00a0Asua Batarrita appended to judgment no. 40/2012 of the Constitutional Court, paragraph 53 above). After deduction of the remissions of sentence for work done in detention periodically approved by the judge responsible for the execution of sentences (Juez de Vigilancia Penitenciaria), the sentence was fully and finally discharged on the date of release approved by the sentencing court. Furthermore, unlike other measures that affected the execution of the sentence, the right to remissions of sentence for work done in detention was not subject to the discretion of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences: the latter\u2019s task was to fix the remissions of sentence by simply applying the law, on the basis of proposals made by the prison authorities, without considering such criteria as how dangerous the prisoner was considered to be, or his or her prospects of reintegration (see paragraph 53 above; compare Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a098-99, ECHR 2012, and Macedo da Costa v. Luxembourg (dec.), no.\u00a026619/07, 5\u00a0June 2012). It should be noted in this connection that Article 100 of the Criminal Code of 1973 provided for the automatic reduction of the term of imprisonment for work done in detention, except in two specific cases: when the prisoner escaped or attempted to escape, and when the prisoner misbehaved (which, according to Article 65 of the 1956 Prison Regulations, meant committing two or more serious or very serious breaches of discipline; see paragraph 26 above). Even in these two cases, remissions of sentence already allowed by the judge could not be taken away retroactively, as days of remission of sentence already granted were deemed to have been served and formed part of the prisoner\u2019s legally acquired rights (see paragraphs 26 and 45 above). The present case should be distinguished in this respect from Kafkaris, where the five years\u2019 remission of sentence granted to life prisoners at the beginning of their incarceration was conditional on their good conduct (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016 and 65).",

Law no. 7/2003, on the other hand, introduced harsher conditions of release on licence, even for prisoners convicted before its entry into force (see paragraph 34 above). The Court infers from this that in opting, as a transitional measure, to maintain the effects of the rules concerning remissions of sentence for work done in detention and for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law, the Spanish legislature considered those rules to be part of substantive criminal law, that is to say of the provisions which affected the actual fixing of the sentence, not just its execution.",

In the Court\u2019s view, the fact that a single judgment does not serve as an authority under Spanish law (see paragraph 40 above) cannot be decisive. What is more, as the dissenting judges observed in the judgment of 28 February 2006, an agreement adopted by the plenary Supreme Court on 18 July 1996 had established that remissions of sentence granted under the Criminal Code of 1973 were to be taken into account when comparing the sentences to be served under the new and the old Criminal Codes respectively (see paragraphs 37 and 41 above).

However, the Supreme Court\u2019s new interpretation, which rendered ineffective any remissions of sentence already granted, led in practice to the applicant and other people in similar situations being deprived of the benefits of the remission system.",

The Court reiterates that its task is not to determine how the provisions of that Code should be interpreted in the domestic law, but rather to examine whether the new interpretation was reasonably foreseeable for the applicant under the \u201claw\u201d applicable at the material time. That \u201claw\u201d \u2013 in the substantive sense in which the term is used in the Convention, which includes unwritten law or case-law \u2013 had been applied consistently by the prison and judicial authorities for many years, until the \u201cParot doctrine\u201d set a new course. Unlike the judicial interpretations involved in S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom (both cited above), the departure from case-law in the present case did not amount to an interpretation of criminal law pursuing a perceptible line of case-law development.",

While the Court accepts that the Supreme Court did not retroactively apply Law no.\u00a07/2003 amending the Criminal Code of 1995, it is clear from the reasoning given by the Supreme Court that its aim was the same as that of the above-mentioned law, namely to guarantee the full and effective execution of the maximum legal term of imprisonment by people serving several long sentences (see paragraph 33 above). In this connection, while the Court accepts that the States are free to determine their own criminal policy, for example by increasing the penalties applicable to criminal offences (see Achour, cited above, \u00a7 44), they must comply with the requirements of Article 7 in doing so (Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107 v.

The applicant therefore had no reason to believe that the Supreme Court would depart from its previous case-law and that the Audiencia Nacional, as a result, would apply the remissions of sentence granted to her not in relation to the maximum thirty-year term of imprisonment to be served, but successively to each of the sentences she had received.

Having regard to the French text, the word \u201cconviction\u201d, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), has to be understood as signifying both a finding of guilt after it has been established in accordance with the law that there has been an offence (see Guzzardi v.

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the two (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2\u00a0March 1987, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7\u00a064, ECHR 2002IV; Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 117; and M.\u00a0v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 88). However, with the passage of time the link between the initial conviction and the extension of the deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (see Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7 40). The causal link required under sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release, or to redetain a person, was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court, or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. Where that was the case a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (see Weeks, cited above, \u00a7\u00a049, and Grosskopf v. Germany, no.\u00a024478/03, \u00a7 44, 21 October 2010).",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0116, and M. v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 90). The \u201cquality of the law\u201d implies that where a national law authorises a deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25\u00a0June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996III). The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2000III; M. v. Germany, cited above, \u00a7 90; and Oshurko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a033108/05, \u00a7 98, 8 September 2011). Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is essential that the domestic law define clearly the conditions for detention (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 120, 23 February 2012).",

Measures relating to the execution of a sentence or to its adjustment can affect the right to liberty protected by Article 5 \u00a7 1, as the actual duration of deprivation of liberty depends on their application, among other things (see, for example, Grava, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45 and 51, and, concerning the transfer of prisoners between States, Szab\u00f3 v. Sweden (dec.), no. 28578/03, ECHR 2006-VIII). While Article\u00a07 applies to the \u201cpenalty\u201d as imposed by the sentencing court, Article 5 applies to the resulting detention.",

Indeed, the applicant did not dispute that her detention was legal until 2\u00a0July 2008, the date initially proposed by the prison authorities for her final release. The Court must therefore establish whether the applicant\u2019s continued detention after that date was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

In application of the Criminal Code in force at the time when the offences were committed, the applicant was given prison sentences totalling over 3,000 years (see paragraphs 11-12 above). In most of those judgments, as well as in its decision of 30\u00a0November 2000 to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, the Audiencia Nacional indicated that the applicant was to serve a maximum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment in accordance with Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above). The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s detention has not yet attained that maximum term. There is clearly a causal link between the applicant\u2019s convictions and her continuing detention after 2 July 2008, which resulted respectively from the guilty verdicts and the maximum thirty-year term of imprisonment fixed on 30 November 2000 (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris, \u00a7\u00a0120).",

Compliance with the foreseeability requirement must be examined with regard to the \u201claw\u201d in force at the time of the initial conviction and throughout the subsequent period of detention. In the light of the considerations that led it to find a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, the Court considers that at the time when the applicant was convicted, when she worked in detention and when she was notified of the decision to combine the sentences and set a maximum term of imprisonment, she could not have foreseen to a reasonable degree that the method used to apply remissions of sentence for work done in detention would change as a result of a departure from case-law by the Supreme Court in 2006, and that the new approach would be applied to her.",

Italy (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a010249/03, 17 September 2009); and, on the other hand, provisions which regulate the subsequent manner of enforcement or execution of the sentence, principally those relating to remission.

According to Article\u00a0100 of that Code (as amended by Law no. 8/1983), a convicted person was entitled to one day\u2019s remission for every two days of work in detention; and although this was subject to the approval of the judge supervising the execution of sentence, approval was certain in the absence of fault on the prisoner\u2019s part. In the present case, in each of the last five sets of criminal proceedings, the Audiencia Nacional, as the trial court, directed its attention to how the various sentences should be approached and, following established judicial practice, concluded that the sentence was finally to be one of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. When all eight sets of proceedings had been concluded, the Audiencia Nacional, acting under the power given to it by section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Act, examined, in the light of the totality of the sentences, what the final unified sentence should be under the provisions of Article 70.2 of the 1973 Criminal Code. By a decision of 30\u00a0November 2000 it fixed the maximum term of imprisonment at thirty years, to which, inter alia, the rules on remission of sentence based on work done in prison would apply.",

It explained that this was so because the matter concerned the fixing of the sentence and not its execution, responsibility for which lay with another judge specifically assigned to that task. The high-water mark was reached when the existing judicial practice was upheld by the Supreme Court in a judgment handed down on 8 March 1994. The Supreme Court affirmed, after having specifically reviewed the matter in question, that the maximum thirty-year term provided for by Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code was a \u201cnew sentence \u2013 resulting from but independent of the others \u2013 to which the sentence adjustments (beneficios) provided for by the law, such as release on licence and remission of sentence, apply\u201d; and it pointed out that this understanding of the law was also reflected in Article\u00a059 of the Prison Regulations of 1981. The judicial conclusion that any sentence adjustments (beneficios) should take as a starting-point the \u201cnew sentence\u201d meant, of course, that the most severe penalty a convicted person could face was imprisonment for thirty years minus any possible remission. In two subsequent judgments, one delivered on 15 September 2005 and the other on 14\u00a0October 2005, although the Supreme Court did not specifically revisit the point, it reiterated, using essentially the same language in both, that the length of imprisonment arrived at by converting the sentences originally imposed constituted a new and independent sentence resulting from them and that sentence adjustments (beneficios), provided for by the law, were to be applied to the new sentence, not to the original ones.",

What is significant is that, for persons within the State\u2019s jurisdiction, the criminal law was authoritatively defined by a judicial decision whose temporal effect reached back in time to when Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973 came into force. The Supreme Court judgment of 8 March 1994 affirmed the interpretation that had already been given to that provision and the resulting clear and constant judicial practice which pre-dates the commission of the offences in the present case. There was never any hint of uncertainty. Whatever the number of infringements of the criminal law and whatever their gravity and the respective penalties provided for in respect of each, the real penalty to be incurred would in no case exceed a maximum imprisonment of thirty years, this being the uppermost limit of the final new and independent sentence, to which the remission system would then be applied in the execution of the sentence, thereby leading to a reduction of that limit as well. This is the crucial point in the present case. Any subsequent change that introduced retrospectively a higher penalty, whether by statute or by case-law, could not but fall foul of the protection afforded by Article 7 of the Convention.",

But the situation had by then changed. Statute law introduced stricter provisions for serious crime; and then came the judicial reversal of the previous case-law already described. The new Criminal Code of 1995, with effect from 1996, provided for higher conversion penalties and abolished the remission of sentence for work done in prison. However, it also contained transitional provisions predicated on the most lenient law for persons already convicted under the Criminal Code of 1973. More stringent provisions were subsequently added by Law no.7/2003, intended to ensure that in the most serious cases the prisoner served the whole of the term fixed as a result of converting the sentences originally imposed. A short time later, in the context of the provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973 on remission entitlement that were still applicable, the Supreme Court adopted a new interpretative approach regarding the meaning and purpose of the sentence that resulted from conversion. By a judgment handed down on 28 February 2006, it reversed the previous case-law on the interpretation of Article 70.2 of the Criminal Code of 1973, by reading that provision as meaning that \u201cthe thirty-year limit does not become a new sentence, distinct from those successively imposed on the convict, or another sentence resulting from all the previous ones, but is the maximum term of imprisonment [m\u00e1ximo de cumplimiento] a prisoner should serve in prison\u201d.",

Consequently, the sentence which resulted from Article 70.2 was no longer the real maximum penalty for the totality of the offences but merely the limit of the period to be actually served when the remission system was applied successively to the original sentences, as part of the manner of execution. In enunciating this new judicial position \u2013 the \u201cParot doctrine\u201d \u2013 the Supreme Court felt unfettered by previous authority. It gave detailed reasons for the new interpretation. It derived support from, inter alia, the wording of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 1973, paying particular attention to the term pena (the sentence imposed) and condena (the sentence to be served), and it drew conclusions on the basis of the difference between them. As I have already stated, this Court should refrain from expressing anything resembling a choice between domestic interpretations. It is in fact quite irrelevant whether that interpretation was sound or, in any event, warranted. It is also irrelevant whether the Supreme Court was, as it explained, free to depart from its previous judgment of 8\u00a0March 1994 and justified in doing so.",

The first is whether there was, at the time of the commission of the offences, a judicial approach creating a firm and constant practice that gave statute law a meaning that was both tangible and certain. The answer to this must be in the affirmative, particularly when the matter is seen in the light of the interpretation given, at a certain point in time, by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 8 March 1994. The Supreme Court\u2019s new interpretation of 28 February 2006 was quite obviously not the result of a gradual and foreseeable clarification of case-law in the sense of S.W. v. the United Kingdom (22 November 1995, Series A no. 335B), C.R. v. the United Kingdom (22 November 1995, Series A no. 335\u2013C), and later case-law (cited in paragraph\u00a093 of the present judgment). The second question is whether it was, in any event, possible to change that view of the law with retroactive effect. The former view of the law could, indeed, be changed; but the retroactive operation of the judgment, a feature also found in other jurisdictions, is not compatible with Article 7 of the Convention, in the same way that it would not be compatible in the case of statutory retroactivity as, for example, in Welch v. the United Kingdom (9 February 1995, Series A no. 307-A).",

The analysis of this matter focuses on the way the sentence in question was defined and, although the object of arriving at such a definition concerned the effect that it would have on how the remission system was applied, that system did not itself acquire any intrinsic Article 7 significance.

Changes within the general prison regime, that is to say those that affect the manner in which the sentence is executed, may adversely affect the person in detention, as for example in Hogben v. the United Kingdom, (no. 11653/85, Commission decision of 3\u00a0March 1986, Decisions and Reports 46, p.\u00a0231), and Uttley v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005), but they will not be inconsistent with either Article 7 or Article 5 \u00a7 1. There may nevertheless be changes which go beyond that. A problem will then arise under one or both of those Articles. A change subsequent to the passing of a final lawful sentence \u2013 the one effectively imposed \u2013 does not, in my view, raise an Article 7 issue.

I am unable to follow that reasoning. In my respectful opinion, the change in the application of the remission system after the Article 70.2 sentence had been fixed goes only to the Article 5 \u00a71 issue; what is relevant in so far as Article 7 is concerned is, subject to the lex mitior rule, the change in the real maximum penalty which existed at the time the offences were committed.

Although the result is that her \u201cimprisonment is effectively harsher\u201d (to quote from Hogben, cited above) than if she had benefited from the previously existing interpretative case-law and practice regarding implementation of the relevant 1973 legal provision, the detriment suffered by her relates to the execution of the sentence as opposed to the \u201cpenalty\u201d, which remains one of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the \u201cpenalty\u201d has become heavier than it was when initially imposed. The impugned decision concerns exclusively the way in which the lawfully prescribed sentence is to be executed; it does not raise issues under the principle nulla poena sine lege, the basic principle at the core of Article\u00a07. The applicable criminal legislation remains the same, as does the prison sentence imposed, even though, as a result of the Spanish courts correcting what they deemed to be a mistaken interpretation and, thus, a mistaken implementation of that criminal legislation over previous years, a different method for calculating the reduction of the applicant\u2019s prison sentence was applied. It is in this crucial respect that the circumstances of the present case are clearly distinguishable from those of other cases that have been held by the Court to come within the ambit of Article 7.",

The second sentence of Article 7 \u00a7 1 is not applicable to the measures concerning the execution of the sentence and the method by which days of remission are to be calculated or allocated. Our concern is that the majority appear to have stretched the concept of a \u201cpenalty\u201d, even understood as being \u201cthe scope of a penalty\u201d, beyond its natural and legitimate meaning in order to bring a perceived instance of unfair treatment of convicted prisoners within the ambit of Article 7.",
