Even if the right to die had existed, its very personal character would not allow third persons to infer from Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law or Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention a right to facilitate another person\u2019s suicide.

However, such violations were not at stake in respect of the applicant\u2019s wife.

In particular, it was not possible to lodge a constitutional complaint to assert another person\u2019s human dignity or other non-transferable rights.

In the Pretty judgment, the Court established that the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the guarantees of Article 8 of the Convention (see Pretty, ibid.). Without in any way negating the principle of sanctity of life protected under the Convention, the Court considered that, in an era of growing medical sophistication combined with longer life expectancies, many people were concerned that they should not be forced to linger on in old age or in states of advanced physical or mental decrepitude which conflicted with strongly held ideas of self and personal identity (Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 65). By way of conclusion, the Court was \u201cnot prepared to exclude\u201d that preventing the applicant by law from exercising her choice to avoid what she considered would be an undignified and distressing end to her life constituted an interference with her right to respect for private life as guaranteed under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Pretty, cited above, \u00a7 67).",
