On 14 June 2011 the applicant gave notarised consent for her daughter to obtain travel documents and to cross the border into Romania. On 29 August 2011 R.E.N. informed the applicant that the said notarised consent was not sufficient for the Bulgarian authorities. The applicant offered to travel to Bulgaria to assist in the formalities necessary to obtain a passport. On 9 September 2011 the County Court acknowledged the situation and ordered the applicant to travel to Bulgaria. It also ordered R.E.N. to allow contact between the mother and the child for the purposes of making travel arrangements. After the applicant\u2019s visit to Bulgaria, the child was brought before the court on 17\u00a0October\u00a02011.

The enforcement officer also directed the social services to help to ensure for the child a smooth transition to life with the applicant by, inter\u00a0alia, arranging a meeting with a psychologist. On 15 March 2011 the social services drew up a report on the child, which concluded that abruptly removing the child from her usual environment \u2013 and thus separating her from the adults who provided her with emotional and physical security \u2013 would be detrimental to her development.

In the present case, the Court cannot but note that while the courts did their utmost to secure respect for the father\u2019s procedural rights, they failed nevertheless to address in any manner that which was at issue not only for the mother but also for her child, who had been separated from her primary caregiver during the proceedings. In particular, the Court notes that save for the first three months of the proceedings, the applicant and her child were deprived of any contact because of the child\u2019s abduction by the paternal parents and her removal from Romanian territory. Although notified by the applicant in a timely manner about this situation (see paragraph\u00a010 above), no action seems to have been taken by the Romanian authorities either to address the matter or, at least, to speed up the proceedings in order to provide a solution to the dispute.

Assuming that the case of the applicant\u2019s child fell within the scope of those exceptions, the Bulgarian courts would have had jurisdiction to decide on the applicant\u2019s request for the return of her child and they would have had a maximum of six\u00a0weeks in which to deliver such a decision (Article 11 (3) \u2013 see paragraph\u00a045 above). However, on 7 February 2012 the Bulgarian authorities, in reply to the request for the return of the child under the Regulation, stated that the Regulation was not applicable in Bulgaria in and of itself as it was rather a supplementary instrument to the Hague Convention, whose provisions governed questions regarding the return of wrongfully removed children (see paragraph 34 above).",

The Romanian judgment granting custody to the applicant became final on 9\u00a0January\u00a02012; she sought its recognition and enforcement in Bulgaria after that date. The courts examined her request under the provisions of the 2007 Bulgarian Code of Civil Procedure, which did not stipulate time-limits for deciding on such a request (see paragraph 40 above).",

Poland, cited above, \u00a7 69). It notes that the applicant made her different requests largely around the same time: in December 2011 for the return of the child (see paragraph 34 above) and in early 2012 for the recognition of the custody judgment (see paragraph\u00a025 above). The Court finds that the relevant Bulgarian authorities had to take a decision \u2013 in respect of the child\u2019s return or in respect of the request for recognition and enforcement of the final Romanian custody judgment \u2013 swiftly, in order to ensure effective respect for the applicant\u2019s Convention rights (see paragraph 63 above). In either of the scenarios discussed above, enforcement of the courts\u2019 decision would have occurred subsequent to that decision being made and would have followed the national law (Article 47 \u2013 see paragraph 46 above).",

Following three subsequent decisions, the matter was finally decided and recognition and enforcement granted to the applicant. However, this only happened on 15 May 2014 (see paragraph 26 above). While this decision allowed the applicant to start enforcement proceedings seeking the handover of the child to her, in line with the Romanian custody judgment, it was taken well over two years after the judgment had become enforceable. In view of the circumstances \u2013 namely that the proceedings concerned the conduct of a relationship between a parent and a minor child who had been separated for a number of years \u2013 the Court considers that the Bulgarian courts should have acted with exceptional diligence (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, \u00a7 102, in which the Court referred to the need for \u201curgent handling\u201d). The Court finds that, in order to prevent a situation in which the passage of time determines a matter rather than, or despite, the competent judicial authorities, the recognition proceedings in Bulgaria should have been conducted much more rapidly than they were.",

The delay that occurred as a result of the time it took the Bulgarian courts to decide on the request for recognition and enforcement of the final Romanian custody judgment is sufficient for the Court to conclude that there has been a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention in respect of the applicant\u2019s ability to effectively enjoy her right to family life. The Court emphasises in this connection that this conclusion is without prejudice to any potential subsequent decision of the competent Bulgarian courts as to what the best interests of the child may be, bearing in mind the time that has elapsed since the child started living in Bulgaria (see, mutatis mutandis, Maire v. Portugal, no. 48206/99, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR 2003VII). Importantly, and for the avoidance of doubt, in view of the fact that the child lost contact with her mother at the age of four and has uninterruptedly lived with her paternal grandparents in Bulgaria for almost eight years since then, the Court underscores that the present judgment should in no way be interpreted as suggesting that the Bulgarian authorities should take steps to order the child\u2019s return to Romania.",

Some of the delays in that procedure were caused by the applicant (improper authorisation to bring the child to a hearing from Bulgaria to Romania), and translation needs added to some extent to the length of the proceedings. The litigation concerned full custody: the mother already had custody and was entitled, in principle, to maintain relations with her child. Moreover, she failed to use the appropriate legal means to have her rights effectively protected (she did not avail herself of the recourse available under the Hague Convention). Given these considerations I see no reason for special celerity in this case. Otherwise, proceedings lasting slightly less than two years at two levels of jurisdiction cannot be considered excessive, especially given that the child and the father were abroad and some of documents needed translation.",

That case does not lend much support to the conclusions of the present judgment. First, the stake (the intensity of the interference by a private party in parental rights) was higher: it concerned an application for custody and a denial of contact. In the present case the applicant had custody (shared) and there was no issue of denial of contact (except that the applicant should have attempted that in Bulgaria). The Slovenian court proceedings at issue lasted for more than four\u00a0years and six months and this cannot be considered comparable to a period of less than two years.
