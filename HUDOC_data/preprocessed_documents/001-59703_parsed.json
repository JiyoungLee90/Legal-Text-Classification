That designation had not been changed by any subsequent decision, as was certified by a letter of 19\u00a0August 1993 from the Director of the Land Administration Department of the Warsaw District Office.

The palace had been rebuilt in the late 1940s by the Ministry of Culture and Arts.

The applicants emphasised that the authorities had disregarded their argument that they did not plan to alter the public nature of the palace.

The applicants emphasised in particular that the letter from the Regional Conservator of Historical Monuments of 28 November 1991 could not reasonably be regarded as credible, as the conservator operated under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and thus could not be expected to act against the ministry\u2019s interests.
