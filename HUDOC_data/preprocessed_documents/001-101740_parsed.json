In this case, however, the Chamber considered it more appropriate to examine the situation complained of in the light of the rule set forth in the first sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which was a general rule guaranteeing the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. It noted that the applicants disputed neither the lawfulness of the expropriation as such nor that of the regulations governing court fees as applied to them. Nor was there anything to indicate that the impugned interference was at all arbitrary, the applicants having had the opportunity, inter alia, to put their arguments to the domestic courts. Unlike the Government, the Chamber considered that the applicants could not be blamed for trying, by the procedural means available to them, to persuade the court to include in the compensation figure elements they considered essential. It considered that it was not the Chamber's role to examine, generally, 's method of calculating and fixing court fees, but noted that in the instant case the concrete application of that method had led to a complete lack of compensation for the expropriation of the applicants' property. It found that, in the circumstances, the compensation conditions \u2013 or more precisely the lack of compensation \u2013 had placed an excessive burden on the applicants, upsetting the fair balance which must be struck between the general interest of the community and the fundamental rights of the individual.",

This has a definite effect on the way in which the alleged interference with the applicants' right must be analysed: the Court's case-law requires that in the event of deprivation of property in the public interest, the owners be paid compensation bearing a reasonable relation to the value of the expropriated property (see Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, \u00a7 48, ECHR 1999II). The Court reiterates in this connection that when it examines whether there has been a violation of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, it must look beyond appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of, since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are \u201cpractical and effective\u201d (see Depalle, cited above, \u00a7 78).",

Indeed, charging litigants court fees pursues various aims, including financing the judicial system and increasing public revenue. And although collecting these fees in  is not the role of the tax authorities, the obligation to pay them is clearly one of a fiscal nature (see paragraph 41 above).\u00a0According to the information available to the Court, that also seems to be the case in other Council of Europe member States. So, the obligation to pay court fees \u2013 and the corresponding regulations \u2013 is covered by the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as the fees are \u201ccontributions\u201d within the meaning of that provision. In the circumstances of the instant case this raises the question whether and to what extent the order to pay the court fees concerned can be considered to have amounted to an interference with the applicants' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions (see, mutatis mutandis, Aires, cited above), as the money the applicants were required to pay in court fees absorbed fully the compensation awarded for the expropriation,\u00a0which amounted to a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01.",

Indeed, the Court takes this difference into account when it classifies court fees as \u201ccontributions\u201d within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 61 above). It notes, however, that in the present case the applicants were parties to legal proceedings against the State concerning the fixing of compensation for an expropriation carried out by the State in the exercise of its public-authority functions. The Court considers that this case is to be distinguished, when examining the question of proportionality, from those where court fees are charged in private-law disputes. In the particular circumstances of the case it might appear paradoxical that the State should take away with one hand \u2013 in court fees \u2013 more than it has awarded with the other.

However, the Court points out that the question was, inter alia, whether the potential profits from the economic exploitation of the quarry located on the property should be taken into account in the compensation for the expropriation. When the applicants put the question to the domestic courts it was given in-depth consideration, the Evora court going as far as to order a third expert report of its own motion, after the reports required by law had already been produced.

Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 32, ECHR 2000-XI). If domestic law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as it deems appropriate. The Court enjoys a certain discretion in the exercise of that power, as the adjective \u201cjust\u201d and the phrase \u201cif necessary\u201d attest. Among the matters which the Court takes into account when assessing compensation are pecuniary damage, that is the loss actually suffered as a direct result of the alleged violation, and non-pecuniary damage, that is reparation for the anxiety, inconvenience and uncertainty caused by the violation. In addition, if one or more heads of damage cannot be calculated precisely or if the distinction between pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage proves difficult, the Court may decide to make a global assessment (see Comingersoll S.A. v.

Portugal case (no.\u00a021775/93, Commission decision of 25 May 1995, Decisions and Reports no. 81, p. 48) that the costs of judicial proceedings are 'contributions' within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and the question may arise 'whether and to what extent the order to pay the court fees concerned can be considered to have amounted to an interference with the applicants' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions' (paragraphs 60-61). Taking into consideration that the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 cannot be applied in isolation from the whole Article, and having regard in particular to the general principle enunciated in the first sentence, i.e., the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, the question whether the amount of court fees as determined in this particular case was disproportionate can be answered only by having due regard to all the circumstances of the case. For us, it was decisive that the dispute over the sum charged in court fees arose in the context of expropriation proceedings between a State and the applicants in which the State not only expropriated the property but also ended up paying no compensation, as the full amount awarded in compensation plus EUR 15,000 was paid by the applicants in court fees. This is not to say that from now on States cannot have systems in which court fees exceed the level of damages claimed. We do not think that this particular judgment deals with that issue. It is, however, established case-law that expropriation requires adequate compensation (Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no.\u00a025701/94, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2000XII; Platakou v. , no. 38460/97, \u00a7\u00a055, ECHR 2001), and this is something the structure of Article\u00a01 requires the Court to take into account also when assessing claims about court fees.",

Shortly after the proceedings were initiated, they were informed by the court that the court fees would amount to a little more than EUR 158,000. During the proceedings various expert opinions were commissioned, and if the quarry was to be taken into account the expertise most favourable to the applicants concluded that the maximum amount the exploitation of the quarry could be expected to yield was some EUR 9,700,000. The expert appointed by the applicants estimated that the compensation should be fixed at approximately EUR 4,000,000. The Portuguese courts all found that the potential gain from the quarry should not be taken into account, and fixed the compensation at a little more than EUR 197,000.",

Poland, no. 28249/95, ECHR 2001-II, followed by many later judgments). It was also on that ground that the Portuguese Constitutional Court considered it necessary to reduce the amount of the court fees the applicants had been ordered to pay (\u00a7 16 of the judgment).

In our opinion this conclusion is not obvious \u2013 at least not as a general one. It can be argued that the obligation to pay court fees is linked to the voluntary use of a public service \u2013 the court system \u2013 and that this distinguishes it from the obligation to pay taxes and various other charges. We have noted that court fees under Portuguese law are of a fiscal nature (\u00a7 41 of the judgment), but the majority seems not to have limited the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No 1 to situations where this is the case. The judgment leaves it open to what extent other payments for public services must similarly be considered as \u201ccontributions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and thus gives rise to uncertainty about its scope. Furthermore, the judgment does not clearly indicate whether the applicability of that Article is limited to court fees in expropriation proceedings or whether such fees in all kinds of proceedings may now give rise to complaints about an interference with property rights.",

As the comparative study shows, the revenue from court fees is used for a variety of purposes, and it must in our opinion be left to each State to decide how it chooses to finance its court system, as long as it does not become a hindrance to access to court, or put an unacceptable burden on a specific category of litigants, in which case it would become discriminatory. Such situations must, however, as stated above, be assessed under Article 6 of the Convention or Article 14 combined with Article 6. This judgment can therefore be interpreted as a first step towards abandoning a principle which has so far been followed constantly in our case-law, namely that the imposition of taxes and contributions cannot as a rule be challenged under Article 1 of Protocol No 1. In our opinion such a development is not recommendable.",

Article 6 \u00a7 1.s) taken together with Article 13 of the former Court Fees Code thus gave precise guidelines on how court fees in expropriation cases were to be calculated. The applicants have not disputed that. The only reason they had to pay court fees that exceeded the compensation they had been awarded was that they claimed an exorbitant amount in the court proceedings which was not supported by any of the expert opinions commissioned. Furthermore the applicants were informed by the first-instance court at an early stage in the proceedings that the court fees would be close to the amount awarded by the arbitration committee. Their situation was in no way different from that of any other litigant claiming an amount largely exceeding what is found justified. We fail to see that litigants in expropriation proceedings should be treated more favourably than, for example, litigants claiming excessive compensation for an accident or a breach of contract \u2013 be it against the State or a private defendant.",
