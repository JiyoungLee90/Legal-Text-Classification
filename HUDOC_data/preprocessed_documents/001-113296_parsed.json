The Court of Appeal failed to take into account any of the factors established in the Court\u2019s case-law (see paragraph 86 above), including the fact that the applicant had resided on a permanent basis in Armenia since 1992 and had a family and property and apparently strong social links with the country. The fact that his passport had been seized was also overlooked, although it significantly minimised the risk of flight.",

In that case, the Court held that it was of little relevance whether the domestic court decided on an application for release lodged by the defence or a request for detention introduced by the prosecution (see ibid., \u00a7 72). In reaching this conclusion the Court referred to a number of cases in which it had decided that the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand by a court at the request of the prosecution also attracted the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Grau\u017einis v. , no. 37975/97, \u00a7 33, 10 October 2000; W\u0142och v.\u00a0Poland, no. 27785/95, \u00a7\u00a7 125 et seq., ECHR 2000XI; and Telecki v\u00a0Poland (dec.) no. 56552/00, 3 July 2003). The Court went on to conclude that Article 5 \u00a7 4 was applicable to the proceedings determining questions of extension of the applicant\u2019s detention (see Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7 74). The Court therefore concludes that the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 4 are applicable to the detention hearing of 7 February 2007 and decides to dismiss the Government\u2019s objection.",

Germany, no.\u00a023541/94, \u00a7 39, 13 February 2001).

In support of this motion the investigator submitted certain evidence contained in the case file which was not revealed to the applicant\u2019s lawyers and they were not able to comment on or challenge that evidence. This fact was admitted by the District Court at its next detention hearing (see paragraph 31 above). The Government also admitted this but tried to justify it with the fact that the domestic law precluded revealing the materials of the case to the defence before the completion of the investigation. The Court considers that the domestic law imposes an excessive restriction in this respect. As it already stated in the preceding paragraph, in order to be able to challenge effectively the basis of the allegations against his client and the lawfulness of his client\u2019s detention, at least the materials of the case-file which are essential for the defence to do so - among which the exculpating evidence - must be disclosed to the defence. In this respect the Court draws a distinction between all the materials of a criminal case - which generally should be disclosed for the proceedings under Article 6 for the determination of one\u2019s guilt (see, however, ibid., \u00a7 205) - and the materials which should be disclosed in connection with a foreseen procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4. This, however, did not happen in the present case. The Court therefore concludes that the manner in which the proceedings before the District Court were conducted on 7 February 2007 failed to ensure an adversarial procedure and equality of arms between the parties.",

It was only in this Law that certain legislative safeguards were introduced for the protection of the rights to private life and correspondence. Article 68 \u00a7 4 of the Law on Legal Acts precluded a legal norm from being applied if its implementation was dependent on the adoption of another legal act.

The applicant alleged that Article 281 of the CCP was not effective at the material time, since its application depended on the adoption of another legal act. The Court reiterates in this respect that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Kruslin v. , 24 April 1990, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 176A, and Kopp v.

Bearing this in mind and having regard to the impugned legal provisions, it does not discern sufficient grounds to agree with the applicant\u2019s allegation.
