The Government, therefore, pointed out that the range of measures that the State could have used in this situation, in particular coercive and repressive ones was restricted in the best interests of the child. Moreover, all the above-mentioned actions had increased the child\u2019s resistance towards his father and the efforts of the competent authorities to establish contact between them.",

However, once it was clear that those sanctions had produced no results and the applicant had requested the court to order the authorities to intervene (see paragraphs 21 and 26 above), the domestic courts should have adopted further measures with a view to enforcement. The Government argued that the imposition of coercive and repressive measures on the mother in the present case had been restricted in the best interests of the child. The Court cannot accept that argument. Although coercive measures in cases involving children are not desirable in view of the sensitivity of the matter, the Court has previously held that entrenched positions often taken by the parents in custody and contact cases may make it necessary to have recourse to proportionate coercive measures (see\u00a0Vyshnyakov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a025612/12, \u00a7 43, 24 July 2018). Therefore, the Court has difficulty accepting the fact that during the two sets of enforcement proceedings lasting in total over nine years, not a single enforcement attempt through the court enforcement officer has ever been considered by the relevant authorities (see, by contrast, Gruji\u0107 v. Serbia, no.\u00a0203/07, \u00a7 69, 28 August 2018).",

As regards the second set of criminal proceeding, the Court considers that the inordinate amount of time it took the authorities to conduct those proceedings (five years; see paragraph 40 above) could not be seen to serve as an adequate response to the urgency of the situation.",

Although the mother maintained before the domestic courts that it was in fact the child who was refusing to see his father (see paragraph 37 above), the Court considers that the child had been in an obvious conflict of loyalties and reiterates that the likelihood of family reunification will be progressively diminished and eventually destroyed if the biological father and the child are not allowed to see each other at all, or only so rarely that no natural bonding between them is likely to occur (see Ribi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a099).",
