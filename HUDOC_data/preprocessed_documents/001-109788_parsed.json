In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2002IV; Waite v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, \u00a7 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.\u00a0Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 117, ECHR 2008...). However, with the passage of time, the link between the initial conviction and a further deprivation of liberty gradually becomes less strong (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7 40, and Eriksen, cited above, \u00a7 78). The causal link required by sub-paragraph (a) might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release or to re-detain was based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the initial decision (by a sentencing court) or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (compare Van Droogenbroeck, cited above, \u00a7 40; Eriksen, cited above, \u00a7 78; and Weeks, cited above, \u00a7 49).\u201d",

That causal link may be broken, in particular, if the domestic courts\u2019 decision not to release the applicant were based on grounds that were inconsistent with the objectives of the decision of the sentencing court to order preventive detention (see paragraph 65 above). The Court observes in this respect that the order for the applicant\u2019s preventive detention by the sentencing Munich I Regional Court in June 1991 and the decision of the Regensburg Regional Court in May 2003, confirmed on appeal, not to release the applicant, were, in principle, based on the same grounds. Both aimed at preventing the applicant from committing further violent sexual offences such as those he had been previously convicted of.",

The applicant therefore has not been refused this therapy, considered as a suitable first step by the medical expert and the domestic courts, and neither his age nor his foreign nationality played a role in his not completing that therapy. In view of the applicant\u2019s failure to participate in that first therapy, the availability of social therapeutic treatment to the applicant in a different prison or in Straubing Prison itself was not, at that stage, decisive for the question whether the applicant had been offered the treatment necessary for him to prove that he was no longer dangerous to the public.",

However, there was a wider range of suitable therapies which could be offered to the applicant as a sexual offender following a first therapy in prison to test his readiness to change his personality, such as a therapy for sexual offenders in a psychiatric hospital (see paragraphs 11-12 above). Furthermore, it appears that, despite the above-mentioned administrative rules, the applicant was considered eligible for social therapeutic treatment at least in Straubing Prison itself (see paragraph 24 above). The Court also notes in that context that at the relevant time, the applicant did not make a \u2013 necessary \u2013 request to be transferred to Austria for the further execution of his preventive detention, where a social therapy would have had more prospects of success (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).",
