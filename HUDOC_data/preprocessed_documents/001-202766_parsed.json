Moreover, there had been no other option than to rent the property under title of temporary emphyteusis, in order to avoid it being requisitioned as was common at the time.

While it was true that there was a possibility, from the evidence it appeared likely that he chose that option as he had not managed to sell the property. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant, who was aware of the law at the time when he decided to rent the property, had demanded a higher rent together with other conditions, namely the payment of approximately EUR 6,988 and that the tenants were to refurbish the property which had not been in a good state.

The Constitutional Court did not find a violation of the applicant\u2019s property rights given that the applicant was aware of the applicable regime when he rented the property in 1985. However, the Court notes that it has already held, in similar circumstances, that, at the time, the owners (ancestors of the applicants) could not reasonably have had a clear idea of the extent of inflation in property prices in the decades to come, and that the decisions of the domestic courts regarding their request challenging such laws constituted interference in the applicants\u2019 (heirs) respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Zammit and Attard\u00a0Cassar, v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a01046/12, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05051, 30 July 2015). In such cases the Court proceeded to examine the merits and found a violation (see, for example, Zammit and Attard\u00a0Cassar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66). There is no reason to make different conclusions in the present case. While it is true that the applicant knowingly entered into the rent agreement and set his own conditions to the extent possible, the Court considers that in 1985 he could not reasonably have foreseen the extent of inflation in property prices in the decades that followed (see Zammit and Attard Cassar, cited above, \u00a7 50). In 2006, on the expiry of the contract of temporary emphyteusis, at which point the discrepancy in the rent imposed and that on the market became evident, he was unable to do anything other than attempt to use the available remedies, which he did but which were to no avail. The decisions of the domestic courts thus constituted interference with the peaceful enjoyment of his property (compare Cassar v. Malta, no.\u00a050570/13, \u00a7 48, 30 January 2018). Accordingly, the Court finds that the rent-control regulations and their application in the present case constituted an interference with the applicant\u2019s right (as landlord) to use his property (ibid., \u00a7 49).",

As to the amount of the rent, the Court cannot ignore that the court-appointed expert\u2019s valuation in the present case was based on its potential in case of full refurbishment in 2016 (see paragraph 9 above). Nevertheless, those valuations show that after 2006 the applicant was receiving in rent only 10% of the rental potential of the refurbished property. In 2019 the rent was significantly raised by the RRB, in virtue of the 2018 amendments (see paragraph 14 above); that decision is pending before an appeal instance. The above is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the rent received by the applicant was disproportionally low in the period between 2006 and until at least 2019. The Court reiterates that State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of chargeable rent. Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit (ibid., \u00a7 62).",
