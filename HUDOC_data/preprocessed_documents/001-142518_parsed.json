It reiterates that an applicant who has exhausted a remedy that is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no.\u00a025642/94, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999-III). When a remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, \u00a7\u00a058, 15 October 2009). Moreover, when the domestic courts examined the applicants\u2019 pleas of entrapment they did not suggest that the applicants had somehow undermined their entrapment arguments by not having previously raised them before the prosecutor\u2019s office. The Court therefore considers that the applicants have complied with the exhaustion requirement and that it has not been shown that a complaint to the prosecutor would have offered better prospects of success (see Veselov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

The procedure in the cases in question was as follows: the public-interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 \u00a7 4, but also of Article\u00a06) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national-security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial (see A. and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 205 et seq.).",

They dismissed the entrapment plea in breach of their procedural obligations set out in the Court\u2019s case-law (see, in particular, paragraph 118 above).

It was also at odds with the fundamental guarantees of a fair hearing, in particular the principles of adversarial proceedings and the equality of arms. The courts did not ensure that the prosecution had discharged the burden of proof by establishing that there had been no incitement and thus unduly placed the burden of adducing evidence of entrapment on the applicants.

The novelty of the case lies in the lack of judicial review of the existence of incriminating evidence forming the basis for the undercover operation order, and consequently the extent of the police\u2019s involvement in the offence. Quite rightly, the Court found a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) and strongly criticised the shortcomings of the applicable Russian law, namely the Operational-Search Activities Act of 12 August 1995, but it could and should have gone further, and given proper guidance to the Russian authorities on introducing appropriate legislation on special investigation techniques (\u201coperational-search activities\u201d). In view of the systemic failure of the Russian legal order previously noted by the Court, and repeated in the present case, the time was ripe for the Court to establish the requirements of Convention-compliant legislation on special investigation techniques, and to impose on the respondent State the obligation to review its legislation in accordance with those requirements. In addition, the cases at hand contain some particularly serious features which should have merited the attention of the Court, such as the long duration of the police investigation of one of the suspected persons, the audio- and video-recording of the undercover operations and the performance of one undercover operation while the suspected person was in a state of intoxication. The purpose of this opinion is to address these particular issues along with the general problem raised by the Article 46 obligation.",

In the case against the Lagutin brothers, the second and third operations breached the principle of necessity, since the collection of evidence in the first operation had been sufficient to support the prosecution\u2019s case, as the Presidium of the Stavropol Regional Court rightly decided. The subsequent evidence was therefore tainted by the violation of the principle of necessity. Furthermore, the first and second undercover operations regarding the brothers were video-recorded. Video-recording of the operation has a twofold consequence. On the one hand, it increases the degree of interference of the operation with the suspected person\u2019s rights, in so far as his or her voice and image are captured without consent. But on the other hand, it also ensures an enhanced review by the judge and the parties of the legality and reliability of the evidence gathered. Hence, the video-recording must be authorised by a judge, in accordance with the nature of the right to protection of one\u2019s own image and voice as a Convention right. Since no judicial authorisation was obtained in the case of the Lagutin brothers, the evidence gathered against them based on the covert operation, or resulting from it in any way, should have been excluded by the domestic courts. This conclusion is all the more forceful since no report was ever made by the undercover agent to his superiors about the manner of his communications with the suspected persons prior to, and between, the test purchases.",

Although cross-examined in court, the agent \u201cIvanov\u201d did not answer any of the relevant questions put to him. Moreover, the Government acknowledged that the police had kept a file on the suspected person for a year and a half prior to the test purchase, but this file was not provided to the court or submitted to the parties for examination. Even more extraordinary is the fact that such covert surveillance lasted for so long without the supervision of a judge. Indeed, according to the current legal framework, the surveillance could have gone on and on for years, since there is nothing to prevent the police from closely following, monitoring and scrutinising the life of a person for an unlimited period of time, without ever disclosing such long-term observation to a judge or prosecutor. To conclude, there was no real cross-examination of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, and worse still, the bulk of the police\u2019s investigating activities, including the audio-recording of the undercover operation, were performed without any effective supervision by a judge. Here again, the evidence gathered by the police falls short of the international human rights standard.",

The principle of proportionality at least, if not the basic principle of human solidarity, requires that State agents should not start or continue an action detrimental to the rights and interests of citizens when the latter are gravely ill or intoxicated. The particular state of vulnerability of the suspected person should have led the undercover agent to suspend the operation. More gravely, the defendant alleged that her state of intoxication had been caused by the undercover agent himself. Such an allegation should have been accorded the utmost care and attention by the domestic courts. Yet the domestic courts did not investigate this allegation seriously, having omitted to include any consideration of it in their judgments. In fact, the judgments did not take into consideration the defendant\u2019s state of intoxication at all. Furthermore, the domestic courts did not make the slightest attempt to clarify the flagrant contradiction between the public prosecutor and the police officers during the trial hearing. In conclusion, even assuming that the undercover agent did not intoxicate the defendant, which is uncertain, the evidence resulting from the undercover operation was tainted and should have been excluded by the domestic courts, because the undercover agent in any event acted in breach of the principle of proportionality by continuing his operation when the suspected person was seriously intoxicated. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the decisions authorising the test purchases were taken by the same operational officer who organised the test purchases and drew up the documents pertaining to them, which nullified ab\u00a0initio the entire procedure of authorisation.",

This line of argument is not convincing, for two reasons. First, there was no discussion during the domestic proceedings about whether the police investigations constituted a State secret, this allegation being submitted for the first time before the Court. Second, there is nothing in the files to support the conclusion that, at the time the decisions on the validity of the special investigation techniques were taken, the evidence available to the various domestic courts was sufficient to determine whether there had been any provocation. Contrary to the Government\u2019s statement, it appears from the files that the domestic courts assumed, without any hesitation, that there was sufficient incriminating evidence to form a basis for the undercover operation order, and consequently that there had been no police provocation. The lack of judicial review of the undercover operations involving audio- or video-recording was aggravated by the circumstance that no effective and regular supervision of the police investigation was carried out by the prosecution. Indeed, the existing practice reflects the shortcomings of the legal framework of \u201coperational-search activities\u201d, which lacks basic human rights guarantees, and the possibility for the applicant to bring court proceedings seeking to declare an \u201coperative experiment\u201d unlawful and to request the exclusion of its results as unlawfully obtained evidence is evidently not sufficient.",

And these limits were seriously overstepped in the cases before the Court, as in other similar ones. In order to tackle this systemic problem, the respondent State must not only reform its legislation on special investigation techniques in accordance with the above-mentioned international human rights standards, but must also take the additional administrative measures to achieve effective implementation of the new legislation in the practice of all law-enforcement agencies, and especially the police. In addition, in the specific cases before the Court, the domestic courts must necessarily quash the unfair convictions delivered on the basis of the impugned undercover operations, and consequently clear the defendants of the accusations against them, since the unfair convictions of the applicants are still severely affecting them.
