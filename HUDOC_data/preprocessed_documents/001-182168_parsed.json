In particular, the Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies available to him for a violation of his rights guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in view of the fact that he had been acquitted and had thus had a right to claim compensation for his detention via the \u201crehabilitation\u201d proceedings, which he had not made use of. In this respect the Court reiterates that it has already examined a similar issue in other cases against Russia, having noted, in particular, that the state of Russian law precludes any legal possibility for the applicant to receive compensation for the detention which was effected in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Govorushko v. Russia, no.\u00a042940/06, \u00a7 60, 25 October 2007, and Korshunov v. Russia, no.\u00a038971/06, \u00a7 62, 25 October 2007). The Court does not consider that it can reach a different conclusion in the present case and dismisses the Government\u2019s non-exhaustion objection raised in respect of application no.\u00a065253/11 (for similar reasoning, see Poltoratskiy and Others v.\u00a0Russia (dec.) [Committee], nos. 4622/09 and 9 others, 30\u00a0November 2017).",

In this respect, the Court observes that is has already dealt with a similar argument by the Government in other cases (see, for instance, Naimdzhon Yakubov v. Russia, no. 40288/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06062, 12 November 2015). For the same reasons as stated in the Naimdzhon Yakubov case (cited above), the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention in application no. 75524/11 constitutes a continuing situation and the six-month period only starts running from the date of the applicant\u2019s conviction on 24 August 2011. The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 5 December 2011 and has therefore complied with the six-month time-limit.
