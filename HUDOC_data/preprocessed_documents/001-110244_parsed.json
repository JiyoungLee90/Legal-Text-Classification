In this context, the Court reiterates that it is the role of the domestic courts to manage their proceedings so that they are expeditious and effective (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7 183, ECHR 2006V). In particular, there is nothing to suggest that the courts could not have considered the case in the respondents\u2019 absence (see Golovko v. , no. 39161/02, \u00a7 59, 1 February 2007).",
