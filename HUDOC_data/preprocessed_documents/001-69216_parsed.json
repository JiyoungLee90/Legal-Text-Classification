A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI).

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-147).",

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (ibid., p. 46, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0148149).",

In disagreement with the Government's submission, the Court finds that this and the ensuing events amounted to a deprivation of liberty of the applicant's son. Although the lack of an entry in the custody ledgers of the name of the applicant's son may indicate that he might not have been placed in an actual place of detention such as a police station, the applicant's son was under the continuous supervision and control of the arresting officers from the moment of his arrest, and was not free to leave (see H.L. v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2004; Guzzardi v. Italy, judgment of 6\u00a0November 1980, Series A no. 39, \u00a7 92). It follows that he was deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

It has reiterated in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article\u00a05, namely, to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and to secure the accountability of the authorities for that measure (see Tanl\u0131, cited above, \u00a7164).",

This, if true, would have constituted one of the permissible grounds set out in Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (c) of the Convention to deprive the applicant's son of his liberty, because such a measure would arguably have been \u201cnecessary to prevent his committing an offence\u201d.
