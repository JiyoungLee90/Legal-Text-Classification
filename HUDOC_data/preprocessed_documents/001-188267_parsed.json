There, he started working in the State security system, where he participated in counter-terrorism operations and provided security to the highest officials of Chechnya. He quit that job in October 2015, but before that he and his mother were asked if he was planning to join illegal armed groups in Syria. In February\u00a02017 he was taken to the headquarters of the department at which he worked and asked to become an informer; he refused. In March\u00a02017 two police officers came to his home and forcefully took him to a police station, where he was again asked to become an informer and again he refused.

It considers the applicants\u2019 behaviour consistent with their claim that the purpose of their presence at the Lithuanian border was to ask for asylum (compare and contrast R.H. v.

However, it is not disputed that they also wrote \u201cazul\u2019\u201d in Cyrillic \u2013 a word often used by Chechen asylum seekers to mean \u201casylum\u201d \u2013 on all the seven decisions refusing them entry into Lithuania (see paragraphs 11 and 88 above). The Government argued that the border guards had not been required to know the Russian language or understand Cyrillic script, nor had they been obliged to verify what had been written in the place of the signature (see paragraph 93 above). The Court firstly observes that the Government have not provided any information on whether any of the border guards who were on duty at the Medininkai border checkpoint on that day could actually speak Russian or read Cyrillic. It also observes that the Medininkai checkpoint is located on the border with Belarus, where Russian is one of the official languages, and that according to the Schengen Borders Code, member States shall encourage border guards to learn the languages necessary for carrying out their tasks (see Article 16 \u00a7 1 of the Code, cited in paragraph 57 above). In any event, assuming that none of the border guards at the Medininkai checkpoint spoke Russian, the Court then cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicants \u201chad not in any way expressed willingness to seek asylum\u201d (see paragraph 93 above), as those border guards would not have been able to understand the applicants\u2019 oral requests made in Russian. In this connection, the Court underlines the importance of interpretation in order to ensure access to the asylum procedure (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, \u00a7 301). It also refers to the requirement under the Asylum Procedures Directive for the authorities to make arrangements for interpretation (see paragraph 60 above), and the UNHCR recommendations to the same effect (see paragraph 52 above). The Government did not argue that finding a Russian to Lithuanian interpreter would have been particularly difficult.",

Similarly, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has recommended that member States provide border officers with training to enable them to detect and understand asylum requests, even in cases where asylum seekers are not in a position to clearly communicate their intention to seek asylum (see paragraph 55 above). In the light of these factors, the Court considers that the word \u201cazul\u2019\u201d being written on the seven decisions refusing the applicants entry into Lithuania should have been sufficient indication for the border guards at the Medininkai checkpoint that the applicants were seeking asylum.",

The Government also pointed out that on that occasion the applicants had not written \u201cazul\u2019\u201d or anything similar on the decisions refusing them entry (see paragraph 93 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the applicants cannot be reproached for not writing down their asylum request on the decisions refusing them entry, as they had previously done so at the Medininkai border checkpoint but to no avail (see paragraphs 9-12 above). It further observes that the details provided by the applicants, such as the date and time of their arrival at the Kena border checkpoint, corresponded to those contained in the border guards\u2019 official reports (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above), and the applicants\u2019 account of their attempt to submit an asylum application at that checkpoint was consistent with their accounts of the other two attempts, which the Court has found to be credible on the basis of the available documents (see paragraphs\u00a0108-110 above). In such circumstances, the Court also accepts as credible the applicants\u2019 submission that on 11 May 2017 they orally informed the border guards at the Kena border checkpoint that they were seeking asylum (compare and contrast M.O. v.\u00a0Switzerland, no.\u00a041282/16, \u00a7\u00a075, 20 June 2017).",

However, border guards did not accept those applications and did not forward them to a competent authority for examination and status determination, as required by domestic law (see paragraph 30 above; see also the Asylum Procedures Directive cited in paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, border guards\u2019 reports to their senior officers did not make any mention of the applicants\u2019 wish to seek asylum on any of the three occasions (see paragraphs 12, 16 and 20 above) \u2013 there were no references to the writing of \u201cazul\u2019\u201d on the decisions, nor to the written asylum application. There was also no indication either in those reports or in any other documents submitted to the Court that the border guards had attempted to clarify what was the reason \u2013 if not seeking asylum \u2013 for the applicants\u2019 presence at the border without valid travel documents. Nor does it appear that there was any assessment at all of whether it was safe to return the applicants \u2013 a family with five very young children \u2013 to Belarus, which is not a Contracting Party to the European Convention on Human Rights and, according to publicly available information, cannot be assumed to be a safe third country for Chechen asylum seekers (see paragraphs 64-65 above).",

The Court concluded that in the period between boarding the ships of the Italian armed forces and being handed over to the Libyan authorities, the applicants were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the Italian authorities. Remarkably, the Court considered that Italy could not circumvent its jurisdiction under the Convention by describing the events in issue as rescue operations on the high seas. To be clearer, the Hirsi Jamaa and Others case-law to the effect that Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 is not limited to territorial removal, but also includes the extraterritorial removal of migrants, aims at closing any gap in protection: for the Court there is no \u201carea outside the law where individuals are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction.\u201d",

Any other interpretation, which would limit jurisdiction by artificially moving the border inwards and creating a gap in protection, would breach the obligation to interpret the Convention and its additional protocols in good faith, in the light of their object and purpose and in accordance with the principle of effectiveness. As I have argued elsewhere, the \u201cexcision\u201d of a part of a State\u2019s territory from the migration zone in order to avoid the application of general legal guarantees to people arriving in that part of the \u201cexcised\u201d territory represents a blatant circumvention of a State\u2019s obligations under international law.

The crucial point for the Court was that Spanish jurisdiction is also exercised on the land between the fences at the Melilla border crossing, and not just beyond the protective structures of that crossing. From the point at which the applicants climbed down from the border fences they were under the continuous and exclusive control, at least de facto, of the Spanish authorities.

The Court merely decided, and did so in perfect coherence with the Hirsi Jamaa and Others judgment, that when migrants come under the Contracting Parties\u2019 jurisdiction, as they did when they were apprehended, handcuffed and returned by the Guardia Civil, they have a right not to be removed or, to use again the words of the drafters of Protocol No. 4, not to be \u201cdriven away\u201d without an individual assessment of their claims.

Under this perspective, the following two principles are to be retained in the Court\u2019s case-law on border control. On the one hand, it is indisputable that no person under the authority and control of a State, regardless of the circumstances, is devoid of legal protection for his or her fundamental and non-derogable human rights\u201d. On the other hand, \u201cStates shall respect, promote and fulfil human rights wherever they exercise jurisdiction or effective control, including where they exercise authority or control extraterritorially\u201d and, to be more precise, \u201cStates shall ensure that all border governance measures taken at international borders, including those aimed at addressing irregular migration ..., are in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of arbitrary and collective expulsions. Therefore, \u201cState jurisdiction over immigration and border control naturally implies State liability for any human rights violations occurring during the performance of this control\u201d. In other words, recognition of a State\u2019s jurisdiction at its borders goes hand-in-hand with the applicability of human-rights treaties, which includes \u201caffirmative measures to guarantee that individuals subject to their jurisdiction can exercise and enjoy [their] rights\u201d. The acknowledgment of the applicability of the principle of non-refoulement and, more broadly, human rights at a State\u2019s borders, is recognised at the European and international level.",

They benefited from the full array of human rights protected by the Convention and the Additional Protocols. Had the applicants complained of a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, a finding of a violation would have been inevitable, because their situation was not individually assessed by the domestic authorities. In addition, when there is \u201ca real risk\u201d for the individuals involved \u201cof being subjected to torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country ..., Article 3 implies an obligation not to expel the individual to that country\u201d. Thus, States have a fundamental obligation to \u201censure that no one shall be subjected to refusal of admission at the frontier, rejection, expulsion or any other measure which would have the result of compelling him to return to, or remain in, a territory where he would be in danger of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\u201d. To prevent such a risk of irreparable harm from materialising, the State has indeed to assess not only \u201cthe situation in the receiving country\u201d, but also the individual situation of the person seeking asylum. Therefore, it is particularly important that the prohibition of refoulement is applicable to any form of non-admission at borders and that the effective protection of the asylum-seeker\u2019s rights is ensured.

Considering that, by definition, the materialisation of a risk of irreparable harm leads to a situation that the State can no longer rectify, it is essential to ensure access to the asylum procedure. In order to do so, the States must firstly provide education and raise awareness among border-control authorities, since the fact that the persons concerned did not expressly apply for asylum does not relieve the State of its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. The border-control authorities should be able to identify an asylum request as such and subsequently to act according to their function, which involves relevant language skills. Furthermore, the State should ensure that asylum-seekers are guaranteed access to interpreters. Finally, the Court as well as the Court of Justice not only require that every asylum-seeker be entitled to appeal against a decision refusing international protection, but also that, where a return decision is issued, such a remedy must have an automatic suspensive effect.",

In such cases indeed, the Contracting States are bound by the requirements, both substantive and procedural, stemming from Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention and must ensure that an applicant\u2019s request is duly examined before he or she is removed from their territory. In the judgments in M.S.S. v.\u00a0Belgium and Greece [GC], no.\u00a030696/09, ECHR 2011, and L.M. and Others v. Russia, nos.\u00a040081/14 and 2 others, 15\u00a0October 2015, the Court examined situations where the applicants had entered the territory of the respective respondent States but had later been the subject of expulsion orders. In the present case, the applicants were refused entry to Lithuanian territory. The Convention system makes a clear distinction between expulsion and the right to enter a territory\u00a0(compare\u00a0the first and second paragraphs of Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a04 to the Convention). While the right of entry is reserved for the nationals of each High Contracting Party (see Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a04), there are a number of Convention guarantees applicable in the area of expulsion of aliens, either expressly provided for by the Convention (see Article 4 of Protocol No. 4) or developed through the case-law of the Court. The distinction between \u201cexpulsion\u201d on one hand and \u201crefusal of entry\u201d or \u201cnon-admission\u201d on the other is also well-grounded in international law, according to which the term \u201cexpulsion\u201d applies only to aliens present on a territory of or inside a returning State. For example, Article 2 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on the Expulsion of Aliens distinguishes between \u201cexpulsion\u201d and \u201cnonadmission\u201d. The term \u201cexpulsion\u201d, used in this sense, does not encompass rejection at the border or other refusal to allow entry to the national territory.",

It must be underlined that it has not even been established by the Court that the applicants ever submitted a claim to the authorities of the respondent State alleging that, in the event of refusal to grant entry, they would run the risk of being returned to Russia, where in turn they would face the risk of ill-treatment. Furthermore, it appears that the applicants themselves do not assert that they have ever presented such a claim to the Lithuanian authorities.",

We believe that in the absence of any other indications, and taking into account the fact that the Russian language and the Cyrillic script are not in official or even widespread use in Lithuania, the border guards cannot be expected to master colloquial terms from a region within a third country. Given that the applicants\u2019 surnames begin with the letter A, the border authorities had no reason to doubt that the word written by the applicants was not their signature.",

They provided the Court with a photograph of that application, together with the train tickets, which they claim was taken at the premises of the border checkpoint. However, the photograph shows nothing conclusive apart from the train tickets and the application. It cannot be regarded as evidence that the request was actually remitted to the authorities. In sum, similarly to the situation of 16 April 2017, there is no indication that the applicants actually presented any claim to the Lithuanian authorities referring to the risk of ill-treatment in the event of refusal of entry.",
