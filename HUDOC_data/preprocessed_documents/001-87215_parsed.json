It further reiterates that the word \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not mean a remedy which is bound to succeed, but simply an accessible remedy before an authority competent to examine the merits of a complaint (see, e.g., \u0160idlov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 50224/99, \u00a7 77, 26 September 2006). In the light thereof, the Court finds that the fact that the Supreme Administrative Court did not find that the applicant\u2019s complaints about the length of the administrative proceedings well-founded (see paragraphs 17 and 24 above) does not render this remedy, in the circumstances of the present case, incompatible with Article 13 of the Convention (see also Sol\u00e1rov\u00e1 and Others v. , no. 77690/01, \u00a7 56, 5 December 2006, with further reference).",
