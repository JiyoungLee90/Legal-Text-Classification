Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0111 \u2013 131, ECHR 2015) in which the Grand Chamber confirmed that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness could not, of itself, be conclusive of the lack of fairness of a trial, although it remained a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness, and one which might tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d). Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant\u2019s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, \u00a7\u00a7 58 and 59, 31 March 2016).",

These individuals, namely Kh.H., K.H., G.T., O.D., V.H. and G.A., when questioned during the criminal proceedings in Kazakhstan, had pointed to the applicant as the person who, together with B.M., had stabbed the victim.

However, the Court is not convinced that this could be considered a good reason justifying the failure to have these witnesses examined and for admitting their evidence. Notably, the fact that the domestic courts were unable to locate the witness concerned or the fact that a witness was absent from the country in which the proceedings were conducted was found not to be sufficient in itself to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), which require the Contracting States to take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Gabrielyan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. 8088/05, \u00a7 81, 10 April 2012; Lu\u010di\u0107 v.

Such measures form part of the diligence which the Contracting States have to exercise in order to ensure that the rights guaranteed by Article 6 are enjoyed in an effective manner (see Gabrielyan, cited above, \u00a7 81, with further references). Otherwise, the witness\u2019s absence is imputable to the domestic authorities (see Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a046203/08, \u00a7 48, 22 November 2012, and Lu\u010di\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 79).",

However, only witnesses L.T., O.D. and Kh.H received one or more of their summonses. The Court notes that eight out of the eleven witnesses submitted to the trial court written declarations certified by a notary in Kazakhstan stating various reasons for their inability to attend the trial and requesting the courts to accept their statements made during the investigation. In particular, witnesses V.H. and E.B. stated that they were unable to attend the trial due to lack of financial means; witness O.D. referred to family issues while witnesses A.G., G.T., V.K., L.T. and K.H. stated that they could not appear because of work. In addition to work issues, witnesses L.T. and K.H. also referred to the lack of financial means. It is not entirely clear how some of the witnesses, who had not received their summonses, were notified about the applicant\u2019s trial so that they submitted the relevant declarations.

The trial court could have resorted to international legal assistance in accordance with the Minsk Convention of 22 January 1993 (see paragraph 37 above) to which both Armenia and Kazakhstan are parties. Furthermore, the courts in Armenia readily accepted the reasons advanced in the declarations submitted by eight witnesses, namely that they were unable to attend the applicant\u2019s trial due to lack of financial means, family or work, without even considering the possibility of reimbursing the costs of their travel and subsistence which possibility existed under the above-mentioned Minsk Convention (ibid.). Thus, it cannot be said that there were good reasons for the failure to have witnesses Kh.H., K.H., G.T., O.D., V.H., G.A., A.O., A.G., V.K., L.T. and E.B. examined. However, the absence of a good reason for their nonattendance at the trial of the applicant is not the end of the matter. This is a consideration which is not of itself conclusive of the lack of fairness of a criminal trial, although it constitutes a very important factor to be weighed in the overall balance together with the other relevant considerations (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, \u00a7 113).",
