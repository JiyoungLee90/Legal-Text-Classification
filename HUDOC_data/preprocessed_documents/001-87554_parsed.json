He drew up an inspection report dated 2 September 1999 and two inspection letters dated 6 September 1999. He found that there were deficiencies in the company\u2019s book-keeping and that it had failed to enter as income part of the retail sales during the tax years 1996, 1997 and 1998. Basing himself on the company\u2019s turnover, books and the remaining cash register printouts, he estimated the amounts at 140,000 Finnish marks (FIM), FIM 100,000 and FIM 130,000 respectively. He considered that the missing sales should be treated as disguised payments of dividends for the purposes of assessing the tax liability of both the company and the applicant and therefore the applicant\u2019s estimated income should be increased by the above amounts.",

In addition, he took care of the company\u2019s purchases, payment of salaries and all money transactions. Therefore, and as there is no suggestion to the contrary, the sales which have not been entered in the books can be considered to have been used by the applicant for his own benefit. As the applicant, for reasons referred to in section 57 of the Taxation Procedure Act, has failed to declare part of the income for the tax years 1996 to 1998, which has consequently not been subject to taxation, the payment of the taxes not claimed has had to be ordered in a reassessment procedure. The increase in the applicant\u2019s income by way of disguised payments of dividends to FIM 85,000, FIM 60,000 and FIM 85,000 respectively for the tax years 1996-1998 cannot be considered too high. As the applicant must be considered to have produced, knowingly or through gross negligence, false tax returns concerning the afore-mentioned years, tax surcharges have also had to be imposed. The tax surcharges concerning 1996 and 1997 cannot be considered excessive. There is no reason to alter the Rectification Board\u2019s decision on the basis of the appeal.\u201d",

The , which took the measure of inviting written observations from the tax inspector and a statement from an expert chosen by the applicant, found in the circumstances that an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary as the information provided by the applicant himself formed a sufficient factual basis for the consideration of the case. For those reasons, the Court in the Jussila case found that the lack of an oral hearing did not give rise to a breach of Article 6.",
