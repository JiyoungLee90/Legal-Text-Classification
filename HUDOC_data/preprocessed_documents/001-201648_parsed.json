Nor did it question in any way that he had experienced major somatic complaints and significant anxiety about his own health. A had however difficulty concentrating on anything other than EDS, and he held in that context a number of beliefs that originated with his mother. Those included beliefs that he could die from the disease and that he could not go to school or outdoors if he found it cold. He had only very limited or no social interaction and had been unable to name any friends. All in all, his life was almost totally centred around his experience of pain and health complaints, which he believed stemmed from EDS; it was centred around his dependence on vital precautionary measures, particularly in the form of protection, rest and passivity. His level of functioning was significantly lower than would be expected owing to EDS. The Board stated that A\u2019s condition made him \u201ca heavily disabled child\u201d.",

This manifested itself primarily in respect of the applicant\u2019s wife in her relationship with A. She had inflicted psychosomatic problems on him and significant anxiety about his own life and future, regardless of whether he had EDS or not. The applicant was assessed as less outgoing and dominant than his wife. The Board found that he had the ability to provide practical care, and that he interacted and played well with B and C. However, both B and C had been described before the Board as having been clearly marked by a lack of stimulation, training and practical experience and the applicant had also focused on illness in relation to all three children. Before the Board he had said that he had an open mind about whether A had EDS. Yet, in other contexts he had clearly expressed his view that he had seen symptoms of the syndrome and wanted B and C to be assessed for the disease. In any event, for the Board the key factor was that the applicant was incapable of seeing what a burden the family\u2019s way of life and his wife were placing on A directly, and on B and C indirectly. The applicant was incapable of creating change or setting boundaries in this connection.",

The applicant and his wife had not had the necessary insight into his needs and had not managed to give him adequate help and developmental support.

On this basis, the Board assessed that it would not be possible to create a satisfactory care situation for the children by implementing assistance measures in the home.

On the basis of the facts at that time, the Board believed that the placements in care would last for a prolonged period. Following an overall assessment, it concluded that exceptional and strong reasons did not exist that could lead to a total denial of contact. In respect of supervision, the Board stated that the supervisor should play an active role and facilitate managed contact between A and his parents; a Scandinavian language had to be spoken.",

The judges\u2019 conversation with A (dommersamtalen) had given the District Court the strong impression that the Board\u2019s description of him as a child in need of help was correct. It had also given the strong impression that the child welfare service was right in stating that he was preoccupied with the issue of illness, and that his entire life centred around this question. This had had very serious consequences in the form of impaired functionality caused by psychologically abnormal development that had prevented him from developing his potential, or \u201cmaking the best of his situation\u201d.",

They had not been absent from school due to illness. They had also shown progress in relation to their personal hygiene and learning to dress themselves.

According to the expert, the parents could not meet these needs, partly due to what had most likely been unsatisfactory care which had contributed to the boys\u2019 considerable functional and developmental difficulties, and partly because the parents did not show insight into the boys\u2019 problems, insisting instead that these were exclusively caused by the presumed somatic illness and by the placement in care itself.

She further stated that when he had been placed in care, A had been described as a boy with considerable motor difficulties, anxiety about the consequences of the illness and pain, dependence on his mother and his mother\u2019s understanding of reality, and rigidity in relation to routines and behavioural patterns underpinned by the parents. When assessed by the expert, he had still lacked the skills, knowledge and preferences normally seen in boys of his age and, based on the situation at the time, she considered that he would not be able to manage by himself in society in the way expected of a boy of his age for a long time. In the expert\u2019s view, A should undergo as soon as possible a thorough assessment to determine whether he had a serious child psychiatric disorder. This would entail having a care situation in which the main care providers cooperated in the assessment, followed up the professional recommendations that were made, and established a relationship with A that made it possible for him to trust them, while at the same time challenging him to cope with and explore the world around him.",

This applied to B\u2019s \u201cphysical reactions in emotionally challenging situations, his language difficulties, his inability in relation to selfachievement and selfassertion, and his lack of understanding of social codes\u201d. In the expert\u2019s view, B\u2019s difficulties, as with A, were primarily connected to his previous care situation and early relationships. They could also be related to biological or genetic factors, in which case they were amplified. As a result, B needed a predictable care situation that facilitated further positive development, and treatment of the developmental difficulties described above. His care providers would have to cooperate with health personnel, accept guidance and follow up the advice given, so that his development would be ensured as far as possible.",

He appeared to be the one who functioned \u201cclosest to the normal range, despite having difficulties in relation to language and conceptual understanding, as well as emotional regulation, although he seems to be more prone to being uninhibited than withdrawn [(selv om ogs\u00e5 han har vanskeligheter i forhold til spr\u00e5k- og begrepsapparat, samt emosjonell regulering \u2013 om enn mer ut- enn innag[]erende)]\u201d. It was possible that some of his behavioural problems were less related to his care situation and more to the uncertainty about the duration of the placement and where he would live in the future. With regard to his future care needs, like his brothers, he was seen as needing a stable and predictable care situation where his development was supported within a framework of cooperation with an ordinary school and the health services.

The High Court noted, moreover, that the child welfare service had previously disagreed with the parents that A had EDS and had created the suspicion that they suffered from Munchausen\u2019s syndrome by proxy, which could have had an impact on the decisions that had been made in the case and how the case had been dealt with. It went on to state that it had mainly been A\u2019s, and not B\u2019s and C\u2019s, personal circumstances that had formed the basis for the child welfare authorities\u2019 concern and investigations in 2013. From the decisions of the lower instances, it appeared that the care order for A had been primarily based on the applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s neglect in relation to A\u2019s personal and significant functional impairment \u2013 which the authorities had ascribed to circumstances on the part of the applicant and his wife \u2013 and that the care orders for B and C seemed to be more an effect or a consequence of this, without there being considerably more specific information about them (uten noe vesentlig mer konkret om dem). To the High Court it seemed, all in all, that A\u2019s health had been unusually challenging for both him and his parents. This could explain why the applicant and his wife had been very preoccupied with illness in relation to A, and also their anxiety about B and C. The lack of understanding about the illness displayed by the support services and health services could also have been very stressful.",

In the High Court\u2019s view, the care order for him was not necessary as satisfactory conditions could be created for him using assistance measures. Implementation of such measures should have been attempted to a greater extent before A had been taken into care; at the time of the High Court\u2019s judgment, the parents had stated that they were both willing and able to cooperate with the support services. The High Court was of the view that, at that time, there had been a better basis for cooperation, as A\u2019s diagnoses had been clarified and everyone had been in a better position to attend to his needs relating to his health and functional impairment. The High Court also emphasised that A was very unhappy at the youth care home and that he had expressed a clear and strong wish to move back in with his parents. In the circumstances, there did not seem to be any suitable alternative other than A\u2019s living with his parents, with extensive assistance measures implemented in the home to ensure that his care needs were attended to, before the recommended psychiatric treatment or care was initiated following a more thorough assessment.

The applicant and his wife would have the important task of caring for A, who was a teenager with special needs that demanded extensive assistance measures. The overall burden on them of providing care for all three children, each with their special needs, was thought to be too difficult and demanding for them at the time of the High Court\u2019s judgment.

Norway [GC], cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 202-213, to which reference is made. For the purpose of the present analysis, the Court reiterates that regard to family unity and for family reunification in the event of separation are inherent considerations in the right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention. Accordingly, in the case of imposition of public care restricting family life, a positive duty lies on the authorities to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible. Moreover, any measure implementing such temporary care should be consistent with the ultimate aim of reuniting the natural parents and the child. The positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification as soon as reasonably feasible will begin to weigh on the competent authorities with progressively increasing force as from the commencement of the period of care, subject always to its being balanced against the duty to consider the best interests of the child. The ties between members of a family, and the prospect of their successful reunification will perforce be weakened if impediments are placed in the way their having easy and regular access to each other (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 205 and 208).",

The Court thus recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of taking a child into care. A \u201cstricter scrutiny\u201d is called for in any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by the authorities on parental rights of access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between the parents and a young child are effectively curtailed (ibid., \u00a7 211).",
