The Court finds that in view of their background the actions of 19\u00a0April and 20 December 1996 must be considered together for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and that, to the extent the applicant received redress from the Constitutional Court in respect of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time in his action of 19 April 1996, he can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of this right in the action of 20 December 1996.
