Furthermore it ought to protect the authorities and other persons concerned from being under any uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. The rule also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised (see, for example, Worm v. , 29 August 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997V). The rule should ensure that it is possible to ascertain the facts of the case before that possibility fades away, making a fair examination of the question at issue next to impossible (see Kelly v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a010626/83, Commission decision of 7\u00a0May 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 42, p.\u00a0205, and Baybora and Others v.

Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 cannot be interpreted however in a manner which would require an applicant to bring a complaint before Court before his position in connection with the matter has been finally determined at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 to calculate the six-month time-limit from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see, among others, Zenin v.

The latter's purpose is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). The rule in Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13, that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual's Convention rights (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000XI). The only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and are both available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Scordino v.

In any event, it does not appear that the trial court, the primary mission of which was the determination of criminal charges against the applicant, was empowered to examine the substance of the applicant's grievance concerning the material conditions of detention, in particular on account of the overpopulation problem, and to afford him redress. The Court reiterates in that connection that where an applicant has tried a remedy that the Court considers inappropriate, the time taken to do so will normally not interrupt the running of the six-month time-limit, which may lead to the application being rejected as out of time (see Rezgui v.  (dec.), no. 49859/99, ECHR 2000XI, and the Zenin decision, cited above). Thus, the Court dismisses the applicant's argument.",

Moreover, the Court does not consider that an action for damages had any prospect of success, in particular as regards the applicant's detention in June 2002, which did not relate to the problem of prison overpopulation but rather concerned the other material conditions, in particular the allegedly insufficient access of natural air and light to the cell in view of the use of shutters on the cell window. It is noted that the presence of such shutters was considered at the time to be lawful (see, in a similar context, Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a076-81 and \u00a7\u00a7 86-89).

The Court accepts that the applicant could have sustained certain inconveniencies on account of the small size of the window and the presence of shutters on it. At the same time, the Court was unable to determine whether the apparent lack of natural light affected him in any significant way. Nor is there any evidence that the internal light or ventilation system were deficient. In addition, it is noted that the applicant could participate in the daily outdoor exercise sessions alongside other detainees and communicate with the outside world, including his counsel or family, during that period.

In the Court's view, despite some positive outcome for the applicant, the decisive question in assessing the effectiveness of a remedy concerning a complaint of inhuman and degrading treatment is whether the applicant could have raised that complaint before a prosecutor in order to obtain direct and timely redress, and not merely an indirect protection of the rights guaranteed in Article 3 of the Convention. The remedy can be either preventive or compensatory in nature (see, among other authorities, Koval v. Ukraine, no.\u00a065550/01, \u00a7\u00a094, 19 October 2006).

Investigator A. had misled the applicant's mother by stating that the applicant was satisfied with counsel D. and needed no other counsel. The applicant's objection notwithstanding, D. continued to act as counsel but refused any private consultations with the applicant. The applicant was beaten up and threatened during the \u201ctalks\u201d with the police officers who operated on a regular basis in relay. Counsel had not been present at those interviews, and had merely signed the record of the interviews by the investigator(s). Duress was proven by the time-span between the hours when the investigator(s) or officers were present in the temporary detention centre and the interview time in the presence of counsel. Being without any advice and worn out by threats and ill-treatment at the hands of officers, the applicant saw no choice but confess. On each occasion the applicant was then taken to the investigator, who recorded the confessions. The applicant's inordinate stay in the temporary detention centre was intended to provide the officers with an opportunity to extract confessions. None of the officers was authorised to deal with the case and the only reason for their visits was to put pressure on him.",

In order to advance the investigation, the investigator appointed legal-aid counsel D. On 13, 20 and 26\u00a0February 2001 the applicant admitted to several crimes; his confessions were put in writing by the investigator. No counsel was present since a confession was not considered as an investigative measure requiring legal assistance.

The applicant confirmed his confessions at interviews on 13, 15, 18, 21 and 27 February 2001 in the presence of counsel D. There was no indication that counsel was inefficient. No injuries were recorded in February 2001. From 6 March 2001 the applicant was represented by privately-retained counsel S. The applicant chose to remain silent. However, on 15 March 2001 the applicant actively participated at the visit to the crime scene and testified in relation to the double murder in the presence of counsel S. On 23 March 2001 the applicant formally refused the services of counsel D. The injuries recorded on 21\u00a0April 2001 were unrelated to the confessions made in February 2001, and were caused by cellmates during the period when the applicant already retained counsel.

[GC], no. 4378/02, \u00a7 92, with further references). The right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent and presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resorting to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (ibid.).",

At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2006-..., and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, \u00a7 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7 101).",

While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see\u00a0Jalloh, cited above, \u00a7\u00a094, and Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9\u00a0June 1998, \u00a7\u00a034, Reports\u00a01998-IV). It is therefore not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence \u2013 for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law \u2013 may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair.",

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (ibid.).
