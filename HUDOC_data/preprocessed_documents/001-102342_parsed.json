As to the complexity of the case, the Government pointed out that the amount of the alleged damage was approximately 12,200,000 euros (EUR), complex expert evidence had been required, the investigated transactions had a sophisticated corporate background, there were more than 700 victims, more than eighty witnesses had needed to be heard, and the evidence was scattered all over the country.

The\u00a0applicants further argued that even after the setting up of the special investigative team there had been several periods of inactivity on the part of the authorities.

Once injured parties opt for claiming damages in the context of criminal proceedings, they are entitled to have their claims determined within a reasonable time (see Krumpel and Krumpelov\u00e1, cited above, \u00a7 48). The Court further notes that lodging such a claim in the context of criminal proceedings not only constitutes a litis pendens but also stays the statute of limitations. It is true that the criminal courts are, in certain circumstances, entitled to decide whether or not an injured party should be allowed to participate in criminal proceedings, and they may refer a party claiming damages to a civil court. Only once the injured parties' participation in criminal proceedings is excluded can they lodge claims for damages with civil courts, when the statute of limitations starts to run again.",
