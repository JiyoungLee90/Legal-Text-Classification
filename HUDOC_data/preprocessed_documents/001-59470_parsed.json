Admittedly, in many cases the withdrawal of a person's passport (which is hardly an anodyne measure) has the effect (and generally the aim) of restricting their freedom of movement. In such cases it has to be determined whether the restriction is compatible with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4.",

                        "content": "That was the situation in a case giving rise to a decision of the Commission, to which the majority of the Court refer in paragraph 61 of the judgment (Peltonen v. Finland, application no. 19583/92, Commission decision of 20 February 1995, DR 80-A, p. 38), in which the applicant, who was a Finnish national living in Sweden, was refused a passport by the Finnish authorities on the ground that he had not attended the call-up for military service. The Commission considered that the refusal to issue him with a passport constituted an interference with the right guaranteed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 even though the refusal in question had not prevented the applicant from leaving  or from leaving one Nordic country for another. However, it is clear from the circumstances of that case that the restriction on the applicant's freedom of movement was intended not only to penalise his refusal to do military service, but also materially and continuously affected his freedom to leave the region for the purposes, among other things, of seeking employment. Nothing of that kind was in issue here, which is why we really do not see any way, other than a contrived one, of linking the seizure with the applicant's actual freedom.",
