It noted that the following types of illtreatment had been alleged time and time again - inter alia, Palestinian hanging, electric shocks, beating of the soles of the feet (falaka), hosing with pressurised cold water and incarceration in very small, dark, unventilated cells. It emphasised that its medical examinations had disclosed clear medical signs consistent with very recent torture and other severe ill-treatment of both a physical and a psychological nature. The on-site observations in police establishments had revealed extremely poor material conditions of detention. It stated that on its second visit in 1991 it had found that no progress had been made in eliminating torture and ill-treatment by the police. Many persons had made complaints of similar types of ill-treatment. An increasing number of allegations had been heard of forcible penetration of bodily orifices with a stick or truncheon. Once again, a number of the persons making such claims had been found on examination to display marks or conditions consistent with their allegations. The CPT stated that on its third visit (a periodic visit) from 22 November to 3 December 1992 its delegation had been inundated with allegations of torture and ill-treatment. Numerous persons examined by its doctors displayed marks or conditions consistent with their allegations. It listed a number of these cases. In  police headquarters and  police headquarters, it found equipment which was consistent with use for torture and the presence of which had no other credible explanation. The CPT concluded in its statement that \u201cthe practice of torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in \u201d.",

In the course of visits in 1996, CPT delegations once again found clear evidence of the practice of torture and other forms of severe illtreatment by the police. A considerable number of persons examined by the delegations' forensic doctors displayed marks or conditions consistent with their allegations of recent ill-treatment by the police, and in particular of beating of the soles of the feet, blows to the palms of the hands and suspension by the arms. It noted the cases of seven persons who had been very recently detained at the Anti-Terror Department at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters, cases which ranked among the most flagrant examples of torture encountered by CPT delegations in . The persons examined showed signs of prolonged suspension by the arms, with impairments in motor function and sensation which, in two persons, who had lost the use of both arms, threatened to be irreversible.

Further, in recent times, senior political figures had openly recognised the realities of the situation. During the CPT's visit in October 1997, a considerable number of allegations were once again heard of torture and ill-treatment by law-enforcement officials.

It noted that blindfolds were usually applied at the \u201cpreliminary questioning\u201d stage prior to the taking of a formal statement, i.e. at the time when ill-treatment was most likely to occur. It could further not be ruled out that blindfolds were also applied at later stages. The CPT had been told by certain persons that they had been obliged to sign statements attributed to them whilst blindfolded. After the CPT delegation had discovered a blindfold in an interrogation room inspected, the delegation was informed by a senior officer that it would be applied to certain suspects undergoing questioning in order to prevent them from seeing the interrogating officers. In its report the CPT stated that it was clear from the information gathered by it over the years that in many, if not most, cases, persons were blindfolded in order to prevent them from being able to identify law-enforcement officials who inflicted ill-treatment upon them. As a result of this practice, legal proceedings against those who tortured and illtreated could be severely hampered.",

The CPT delegation that carried out the visit in September 2001 found that there remained much room for progress as regards both these issues, in particular in the eastern part of Turkey, where interviews with detained persons suggested that it was very rare for lawenforcement officials not to be present during medical examinations. Numerous persons stated that they had been warned prior to the examination not to say anything to the doctor about the treatment they had received, and that the presence of law-enforcement officials during the examination had ensured that they heeded that warning. Some persons interviewed stated that when the doctor had inquired as to the origin of injuries they bore the law-enforcement official present had protested. Doctors at the Primary Health Care Centre in Elaz\u0131\u011f acknowledged that the examination always took place in the presence of police officers or members of the gendarmerie. In discussion with doctors at Van State Hospital, it was indicated that it was common for two or more persons to be examined simultaneously and that lesions observed might not be recorded \u201cin order to avoid problems with the police\u201d. The CPT further concluded that it was clear that, instead of using the \u201cGeneral Judicial Medical Examination Form\u201d approved by the Turkish authorities, the old practice of very brief findings set out on a piece of paper without any headings, and often covering several detained persons, remained common.",

It appeared that the trigger for making an entry in the book of admissions was the fact of placing someone in a cell. As a person could be deprived of his liberty for several hours in a lawenforcement establishment before being placed in a cell, this initial period of detention often appeared to go unrecorded.",

Various photographs taken in Ormani\u00e7i show that the village was built on the slope of a hill. The lower side of the village lies to the south where there is a dry riverbed descending slightly towards the east along the lower side of the village and subsequently into a deep valley. The upper side of the village lies to the north. A footpath from the north-western side of the village leads to a small pond. In the absence of any roads, Ormani\u00e7i cannot be reached by vehicles. The walking distance between Ormani\u00e7i and G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak, which are separated by the riverbed, is about 810 kilometres and this walk would normally take about two hours.",

This impression is confirmed by the applicants themselves, who \u2013 in their final observations filed on 16 March 1998 \u2013 submitted that most of the villager witnesses had been naturally cautious concerning questions relating to whether or not the village had been visited by the PKK.

The Court considers improbable the claim that the duties of the security forces were of an administrative or judicial nature. In this connection it notes that six gendarme teams, consisting in total of 102 gendarmes and including 85 commandos, participated in the operation, that both the quantity and quality of the ammunition apparently brought along on this operation can only be described as impressive and that the documentary and oral evidence given has not elucidated the nature of the alleged administrative or judicial duties.",

In so far as specific details of individual accounts do not tally with other evidence, the Court considers that this might be explained by an attempt to recall details of events that had taken place more than five years ago, by the difficulty of some witnesses in distinguishing with certainty between events witnessed personally and learned through hearsay, and, in some cases, by a degree of exaggeration deriving from a wish to present an individual account as favourable as possible or from apparent feelings of anger, frustration and helplessness.

The Court is, however, less convinced by their accounts as to specific details of the security forces' activities on 20 February 1993 once these forces had arrived in the village.

As to the question when Mevl\u00fcde Ekin brought her injured daughter to the house of Mehmet and Kumri Aslan, the Court considers it highly unlikely that this would have happened during the various rounds of firing at the village when the security forces were approaching Ormani\u00e7i. The Court accepts as plausible the accounts of Mehmet and Kumri Aslan that Mevl\u00fcde Ekin brought Abide to their house when the soldiers first entered the village. As Mevl\u00fcde Ekin must have been profoundly shocked at that point in time, the Court cannot exclude the possibility that her sole concern was for her injured daughter and that she failed to notice the presence of anyone else but Mehmet and Kumri Aslan.",

It does, however, appear that none of the soldiers present paid any attention to the physical condition of Abide at that moment and that, consequently, Hasan Ye\u015filyurt and Celal \u00c7\u00fcrek remained unaware of the fact that a child had been injured.",

Although he did not exclude the possibility that \u0130brahim Ekinci had contracted frostbite by having been made to walk through the snow to G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak, it would have been impossible for him to say so for certain. Furthermore, being a medical layman, he was unable to say whether the frostbite marks on \u0130brahim Ekinci's feet could be linked to the pneumonia that the latter developed.",

Although Abdullah Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m denied this, the Court is persuaded that his decision not to make any further enquiries in relation to the circumstances of \u0130brahim Ekinci's death was in fact directly influenced by the information allegedly given to him by the police that \u0130brahim Ekinci was a terrorist who had contracted frostbite during a lengthy stay in caves, and that on the basis of this information he assumed that \u0130brahim Ekinci had also contracted pneumonia in that way and therefore did not find it necessary to seek any further explanation.",

Although the Court cannot rule out the possibility that the bruise found on Abdullah El\u00e7i\u00e7ek resulted from the manner in which he was treated by the security forces on 20 February 1993, the possibility can equally not be excluded that this injury was caused by one or more blows received by him during his detention in G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak.",

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, \u00a7\u00a7 146-147; and Av\u015far v.

The use of the term \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d suggests that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraph 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2. In keeping with the importance of this provision in a democratic society, the Court must, in making its assessment, subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination. Furthermore, under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 1, the State may be required to take certain measures in order to \u201csecure\u201d the effective enjoyment of the right to life. The responsibility of the State is not confined to circumstances where there is significant evidence that misdirected fire from State agents has killed a civilian. It may also be engaged where they fail to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of a security operation mounted against an opposing group with a view to avoiding and, in any event, to minimising incidental loss of civilian life (see Ergi v. Turkey, judgment of 28 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, p.\u00a01776, \u00a7 79).",

It was intended that three teams would search an area in the vicinity of Ormani\u00e7i and that the three other teams would approach the village from the south-west, north and south respectively. After having spotted two men running towards Ormani\u00e7i during its approach of the village from the south, two warning shots were fired by the 2nd Commando Team, which were met by some shots fired from the village. The security forces' tactical response to these shots from the village consisted of intensive firing, including the use of RPG-7 missiles and various grenades that were fired at perceived points of fire in the village. In the course of the security forces' intensive firing, as it was believed that shots had been fired from the house of Mevl\u00fcde Ekin, a rifle or other grenade was fired at a window of that house, the explosion of which seriously injured Abide Ekin.",

It is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered in custody, an obligation which is particularly stringent where an individual dies. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their supervision in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during the detention.

Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible even under Article 15 of the Convention in time of war or other national emergency (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1855, \u00a7 79; and Sel\u00e7uk and Asker v.

The Court has considered treatment to be \u201cinhuman\u201d because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in the victims feeling of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kud\u0142a v.

In this connection the Court emphasises that Article 3 of the Convention imposes an obligation on the State to protect the physical well-being of persons deprived of their liberty. The State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured by, among other things, providing him with the requisite medical care. When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of the cumulative effects of those conditions, as well as the specific allegations made by the applicant (see Kalashnikov v.

It has reiterated in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that mesure (see Tanl\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 26129/95, \u00a7 164, ECHR 2001-III).",

By the use of these terms the Convention essentially refers back to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. However, it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in conformity with the purpose of Article 5, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since under Article 5 \u00a7 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see Laumont v.

This requires the existence of some facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence, though what may be regarded as reasonable will depend on all the circumstances of the case. The standard imposed by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) does not presuppose that the police have sufficient evidence to bring charges at the time of arrest. The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction, or even the bringing of a charge which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see O'Hara v. the United Kingdom, no. 37555/97, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 36, ECHR 2001-X).",

The detention of ten persons who had been taken directly to \u015e\u0131rnak on 20 February 1993 was only registered in these records on 4 March 1993, twelve days later. It was also not until 4\u00a0March 1993 that five other detainees, who had already been transferred from G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak to \u015e\u0131rnak on 25 February 1993 at the latest, were registered in the \u015e\u0131rnak custody records.

Adequately kept custody records are of crucial importance for the administrative or judicial determination of any question or claim in relation to a person taken into detention, including a claim that a person has been ill-treated or killed, or has disappeared after having been apprehended by the authorities. The Court considers that a failure to record accurate holding data concerning the date, time and location of detainees, as well as the grounds for their detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Orhan v.

Traceability of detainees, which goes hand in hand with effective accountability of the authorities for the persons under their responsibility, is an indispensable safeguard. In the circumstances of this case, where the detainees were in a highly vulnerable position (see the Court's above findings under Articles 2 and 3 and its findings under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 below), the Court finds that the lack of proper records infringed the prohibition of arbitrariness implicit in Article 5 of the Convention.

It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and of the facts established by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\u00a0\u00a0The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to continue to justify the deprivation of liberty (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34548/97, \u00a7 93, ECHR 2000-IX).",

In April [1993] \u015e\u0131rnak HEP deputy Selim Sadak submitted an interrogatory motion to the office of the speaker of Parliament, demanding that the Interior Minister investigate allegations by the people of Ormani\u00e7i, a village in \u015e\u0131rnak's G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak township, that security forces had burned down the village, killed a 5-year-old child, and taken into custody and tortured for prolonged periods 43 villagers, one of whom, \u0130brahim Ekinci, allegedly died under police torture ...

Other purported reasons for the evacuations included the difficulty in protecting the villages against terrorist attacks; the inhabitants' fear of being caught in the cross-fire; and the refusal of village men to participate in the paramilitary village guard system. In February [1993], the state minister responsible for human rights categorically denied allegations that security forces were following a scorched earth policy in order to force inhabitants to leave their homes.

Some lost all their belongings when their houses were burned. In May [1994] the Interior Minister, in reply to a question in Parliament, stated that 871 villages and hamlets in the state of emergency region had become empty since July 1987. The Interior Minister asserted that the villages and hamlets were emptied because of PKK pressure or economic reasons. The Minister of Defence that same month stated that to control PKK activity in the region, 50 settlement centers, displacing approximately 10,000 persons around Mount Ararat and Tenduruk would be evacuated ... These statements were the first official confirmations of village evacuations in the southeast, including evacuations at government behest. In October [1994], 17 village evacuations in Tunceli Province finally brought the issue into the national spotlight ... According to a Government report, to date approximately [US]$227,000 in compensation has been paid to villagers displaced in the southeast, largely as a result of PKK activity, and $545,000 was to be spent in 1994 to construct housing for displaced villagers in \u015e\u0131rnak and Bing\u00f6l provinces. ... The Government organizes, arms, and pays for a civil defense force in the southeast known as the village guards. Participation in paramilitary militia by local villagers is theoretically voluntary, but villagers are caught between the two sides.

Harun had been carrying out armed PKK activities for three years. He himself had longstanding relation with the PKK. Many Ormani\u00e7i villagers were PKK members. They regularly came to the village. He himself was deputy head of the village committee and the armed militia. Nobody could carry out any activity without his knowledge or that of the committee. He further stated that all villagers helped the PKK. A villager who did not do so would be punished by the others. The villagers received information from the PKK via Ali Erbek, who had spent some time with the PKK and who had been assigned to Ormani\u00e7i by the PKK, and Ali's brother \u015eehabettin Erbek. Ali had taught the villagers how to act against the soldiers and how not to allow them in the village. He knew a person with the codename \u201cLokman\u201d, who used to come to Ormani\u00e7i when he was a PKK member. But \u201cLokman\u201d had betrayed the PKK by surrendering to the authorities.

Mehmet Sezgin further stated that the villagers had been very afraid of the PKK as, about two years earlier, they had murdered the previous muhtar, who had been related to him. Ali Erbek and other PKK supporters had taken Fahrettin \u00d6zkan (son of Mehmet) and Mehmet Ekinci (son of Hac\u0131) who were both about 15 or 16\u00a0years old, Halide \u00d6zkan (daugher of Mehmet Nuri) who was about 13 or 14 years old, and Mulkiye Kaya (daughter of Mehmet) who was 10 years old to the PKK. One year ago, [illegible] Erbek, who aided and abetted the PKK, had taken his 11-year-old sister Firuze and his 12-year-old nephew Hasan Sezgin to the PKK. He had had an argument about that with Ali Erbek and they were not on speaking terms with each other. Ali Erbek had complained about Mehmet Sezgin's father and uncle to the PKK. About three months ago, five or six PKK members, whom he had not known, had come to Ormani\u00e7i and had assembled all the men in the mosque. These persons had shouted at his father and uncle, who had been told by them to obey Ali Erbek. Those villagers supporting the PKK had, four months previously, collected funds from the villagers according to the villagers' financial circumstances. He himself had given money too. About one month earlier, three PKK members had come to the houses of Feke Ali \u00c7etin, \u0130brahim \u00d6zkan and Mehmet Kaya, who had been given instructions. For the last four or five months, both armed and unarmed Ormani\u00e7i villagers had carried out watch duty. He had also kept watch sometimes. At other times his brother had done so. His brother Abdullah had bought a weapon in Cizre for 3,000,000 Turkish Liras (TRL). As they had been poor, he had been angry with his brother for spending that money on a weapon.

He had stayed in the Gabar region for about eight months. He later stated that, after having attended a PKK meeting in A\u015fa\u011fidere in July 1991, he had told PKK members that he wished to join the PKK. He knew the person with the codename \u201cLokman\u201d, who had left the PKK and surrendered to the authorities. He had carried out PKK activities in the Gabar region for one year. He had participated in the raid on the Damlarca gendarmerie station in September 1992. Ali Erbek gave the codenames of a number of others who had also participated in that raid. In 1992 the person with the codename \u201cCelal\u201d had instructed him to return to Ormani\u00e7i, where he had then organised PKK activities. He identified by name the members of the Ormani\u00e7i men's village committee and the PKK militia members in Ormani\u00e7i. His brother \u015eehabettin Erbek was also a PKK member and had been his assistant in Ormani\u00e7i. He further identified by name the persons from Ormani\u00e7i who had joined the PKK upon his initiative. He had told the Ormani\u00e7i villagers how to act against the security forces, that a watch duty should be kept and what needed to be done in order to prevent the security forces from entering the village. When, on 20 February 1993, the soldiers had entered the village, the villagers had acted in the manner in which he had told them to act. They had resisted with arms and had killed one soldier. As Ormani\u00e7i had been close to the Gabar region, PKK provisions had been stored in the house of Ali \u00c7etin, who had been trusted as he was an imam and as he was a member of the committee. Those were the provisions which he had indicated on 21 February 1993 in Ormani\u00e7i. These provisions would be loaded onto mules and taken to PKK members in the districts of Cizre and G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak. He identified by name and/or codename the PKK members who used to come to Ormani\u00e7i. He indicated two shelters where these persons had stayed and which were now destroyed. Ali Erbek lastly indicated four locations in the region where PKK groups were to be found and which persons were in command of these groups.",

Being poor, he had helped the PKK and, at the same time, had been making a living by selling weapons to Mehmet Nuri \u00d6zkan and other members of the Ormani\u00e7i militia. He had tried several times to set up a PKK committee in G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak, but without success as the G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fckonak residents had been frightened. He had met a PKK group led by a person with the codename \u201cBahos\u201d, who had given him a Kalashnikov and for whom he had acted as an armed guide.

During the search of the toilet area in the mosque, where Zeki \u00c7etin had been apprehended, one Kalashnikov automatic rifle, one Kalashnikov cartridge clip, and nine rounds of Kalashnikov empty cartridges were found.

At some point in time, the commander, a captain from the F\u0131nd\u0131k battalion, asked him whether Ahmet Erbek was in the village. He told him that Ahmet Erbek, an old man, had gone to Akdizgin that day. The captain then contacted Akdizgin. When Ahmet Erbek was found there, it turned out that Ahmet Erbek was not the person the soldiers were looking for. In reply to the captain's observation that there were a large number of persons in the gardens of Ormani\u00e7i that day, he replied that all the villagers, including his father, had gone down to the gardens to work there. Between 1 and 1.30 p.m., he heard gunfire, which lasted for 1\u00bd-2 hours. During the firing, he went home. Once the firing stopped, he went to the soldiers and asked the commander what had happened. The commander told him that seven\u00a0PKK men had been killed in the area below the village. According to the commander, all seven\u00a0persons were terrorists and none of the villagers had been killed. When he thought that all the soldiers had left the gardens, he went there.

He remained blindfolded during these interrogations. He was ill-treated. This happened immediately after his interrogation. It happened in another room. It could have been on the same floor, but there were 2-3 steps to take. Hot iron bars were applied to his body. Traces of that could still be seen on his buttocks. They also subjected him to electric shocks and one of his ribs was broken. On two or three occasions, in the course of an interrogation, he was forced to put his thumbprint on a piece of paper. As he had been blindfolded, he did not know whether it was on a blank piece of paper or whether something was written on it. He could have signed a statement, as he was literate.",

When he arrived he saw the muhtar and the NCO. The private was lying on the floor. He himself did not see who had killed the private. In reply to his question as to what had happened, the Team Commander said that Private Uslu had approached the window and had then been shot. He himself went to the window to verify from where the shot could possibly have come. The window faced the mosque. There were houses at a distance of 80-100 metres from where the shot could have been fired. The gendarme forces had not yet secured that area at that stage. It was only the second or third house searched in the village. The gendarmes started to search the village from one side and advanced into the village. Nobody had mentioned to him at that time that another soldier had fired the shot. If he had heard that, he would have initiated an administrative investigation.",
