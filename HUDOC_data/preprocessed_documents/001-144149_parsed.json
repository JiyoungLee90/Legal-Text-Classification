As it had become difficult to find a job there, in July 1996 he went to Russia for the first time to look for a job. For three months he lived in the Moscow Region unofficially, and he then returned to Uzbekistan. Between 1996 and 2010 he went to Russia every year for several months, during which he worked unofficially on construction sites in the Moscow Region. He never applied for authorisation in respect of his temporary stays in Russia. In October 2010 he went again to Russia. He went to the village of Poyarkovo, in the Moscow Region, where he found lodgings in a mobile home with three other builders. In October-November 2010 he worked at a construction site in the town of Himki. During 2011 he had occasional jobs in Poyarkovo, including some building work for its residents, and cleaning the streets. On 17\u00a0March\u00a02012 the applicant went to the Kazanskiy railway station in Moscow as he wanted to return to Uzbekistan. He bought a ticket to Kazan, where he planned to buy tickets for the remainder of the journey. However, before he could board the train he was approached by three men in civilian clothes who told him they were police officers and presented their badges. They informed him that he was on a wanted list in Uzbekistan and asked him to go with them to the police station located near the railway station, which he did. According to the applicant, when he spoke on the telephone with his wife in spring 2011, she had said that police officers had asked her about his whereabouts, but they had not explained why they were looking for him. In Uzbekistan he had not been persecuted for political reasons or convicted of any criminal offences, and he did not apply for asylum in Russia. The applicant stated that he did not know in relation to what imputed offence he had been placed on the wanted list.",

However, he feared that if he returned there the Uzbek law-enforcement agencies would extract from him under torture a confession to crimes he had not committed. It further analysed at length the applicable Uzbek laws on the prohibition of torture and freedom of religion, as well as information on the co-existence of various religions in Uzbekistan. The FMS noted that the applicant had not left Uzbekistan on any of the grounds listed in section 1 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Refugees Act. Moreover, it appeared that his wish to not return to Uzbekistan was based not on a fear of being persecuted on grounds of religion, nationality, ethnic origin, belonging to a particular social group, or political convictions, but rather on his fear of being subjected to punishment for the offences he was charged with in Uzbekistan. Therefore, he did not meet the criteria set out in section 1 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(1) of the Refugees Act.",

In its view, the absence of any specific regulation of detention matters in Article 466 \u00a7 1 did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with the Constitution. Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention provided that in executing a request for legal assistance, the requested party should apply its domestic law, that is, the procedure laid down in the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Plenary reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings, or other person whose rights or freedoms were affected by the actions or inaction of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could use Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them. The Plenary stated that whilst the bulk of decisions amenable to judicial review under Article 125 also included decisions to institute criminal proceedings or refusals to admit a defence counsel or to grant victim status, and a person could not rely on Article\u00a0125 to challenge a court\u2019s decision to apply bail or house arrest or to place a person in detention. It was further stressed that in declaring a\u00a0specific action or failure to act of a law enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to quash the impugned decision or to order the official responsible to revoke it but could only ask him or her to rectify the shortcomings indicated. Should the authority concerned fail to comply with the court\u2019s instructions, an interested party could complain to a court about the authority\u2019s failure to act and the court could issue a special ruling (\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) drawing the authority\u2019s attention to the situation. Lastly, the decision stated that a prosecutor\u2019s decision to place a person under house arrest or in detention with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

The Government also pointed out that the decision did not specify that the applicant was to be expelled to Uzbekistan, but merely stated that he was to be removed from the territory of the Russian Federation. The Government were sceptical about the NGO reports concerning the situation in Uzbekistan referred to by the applicant; in the Government\u2019s view, they contained general allegations uncorroborated by specific factual information. In particular, when describing the applicant\u2019s situation in its report, Amnesty International had not referred to a single piece of evidence (see paragraph 111 above).

Having regard to his submissions, the Court is satisfied that they remained consistent and that he advanced a number of specific and detailed arguments in support of his grievance. Among other things, he claimed that the Uzbek law-enforcement authorities systematically resorted to the use of torture and ill-treatment against detainees, and stressed that persons accused of participation in a banned religious activity, as well as those suspected of crimes against State security, ran an increased risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3. In support of his allegations the applicant relied on reports by various reputable international organisations and the findings of this Court in a number of cases concerning similar situations where applicants had faced return or had been removed to Uzbekistan in connection with criminal proceedings on charges connected to religious extremism or attempted overthrow of the constitutional order (see paragraphs 106-111 above).",

Although the Moscow FMS in its decision of 28 August 2012 did analyse the applicable Uzbek laws on prohibition of torture and freedom of religion, it did not examine the information stemming from various international organisations and the judgments of this Court submitted by the applicant in support of his detailed submissions concerning his risk of being subjected to ill-treatment if he was returned to his home country. The Basmanniy District Court of Moscow, which on 1 April 2013 upheld the FMS\u2019s decision refusing the applicant\u2019s application for refugee status, stated that the human rights situation in Uzbekistan was \u201cambiguous\u201d. Yet, despite noting that a decision concerning refugee status should be taken not on the basis of the general situation in the country but in view of the applicant\u2019s specific circumstances, it remained silent on the specific arguments raised by the applicant in the present case, such as the nature of the charges brought against him in Uzbekistan (see paragraph 58 above).

In its decisions of 19 September and 10 October 2012, the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow and the Moscow City Court, respectively, dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations briefly and without any detailed analysis of his specific arguments (see paragraphs 39, 40 and 48 above). The Moscow City Court, in particular, relied on the fact that the applicant had applied for asylum only after being arrested. In this connection, the Court observes that the main thrust of the applicant\u2019s grievance was that he risked persecution by the Uzbek authorities in connection with charges of serious criminal offences punishable by long prison terms, of which he had become aware only upon his arrest, and consequently illtreatment in custody. The Court reiterates that, whilst a person\u2019s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey, no. 30471/08, \u00a7 91, 22 September 2009). Therefore, the domestic courts\u2019 findings as regards the applicant\u2019s failure to apply for refugee status in due time do not, as such, refute his allegations under Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

He further maintained that his detention between 17 and 25 April 2012 had been unlawful because Uzbekistan had not ratified the Protocol of 28 March 1997 to the Minsk Convention, which modified Article 62 of that Convention and extended to forty days the period during which a person could be detained pending receipt of an extradition request. Therefore, it had been permissible to detain him without a court order only for up to thirty days, and thus his detention between 17 and 25 April 2012 had had no legal basis. The applicant also argued that his detention on the basis of the detention order of 25 April 2012 had been unlawful because that order had been based solely on Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which neither provided a clear procedure for the extension of detention, nor set time-limits. The order of 25 April 2012 had also not specified a time-limit for the applicant\u2019s detention. Furthermore, it was questionable whether the prosecutor of the Meshchanskiy District of Moscow had competence to order the applicant\u2019s detention, as the decision did not specify which legal instrument vested him with such competence. Finally, the applicant averred that the entire term of his detention pending extradition had been in breach of the \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement set forth by the Court in relation to detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). In particular, Uzbekistan\u2019s request for extradition had been refused on 17 September 2012, when the applicant had already spent six months in detention. However, given the grounds for the refusal \u2013 the absence of corpus delicti as regards one count of charges and that the other count did not constitute a criminal offence under Russian law \u2013 it must have been clear to the authorities from the outset that the extradition request should be refused.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, \u00a7 50, Reports 1996-III, and Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, \u00a7 70, 11 October 2007).",

In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d, Article 5 \u00a7 1 does not merely refer back to domestic law; like the expressions \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d and \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11, it also relates to the \u201cquality of the law\u201d, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention. \u201cQuality of law\u201d in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7 71, 11\u00a0October 2007, with further references).",

The Court notes that it has recently dealt with a similar issue in the case of Zokhidov, cited above. It found in that case that before the receipt of the extradition request the applicant\u2019s detention appeared to be based on Article 61 of the Minsk Convention, which did no more than refer back to domestic law and did not establish by itself any procedural rules for the detention of a person prior to the receipt of an extradition request. Therefore, it could only serve as a legal basis for detention in conjunction with corresponding domestic provisions establishing the grounds and the procedure for ordering detention, as well as the applicable time-limits (see Zokhidov, cited above, \u00a7 154). However, like in Zokhidov, in the case at hand neither the prosecutor in his decision nor the Government in their observations referred to any provision in domestic law authorising the former authority to place the applicant in custody pending receipt of an extradition request. Accordingly, from 19 March to 24\u00a0April 2012, when the extradition request was received, the applicant was in a legal vacuum that was not covered by any domestic legal provision clearly establishing the grounds for his detention or the procedure and timelimits applicable to that detention pending receipt of the extradition request.",

However, as the Court has found in Zokhidov, cited above, \u00a7 154, Article\u00a0466 \u00a7 2 is silent on the procedure to be followed when ordering or extending the detention of a person whose extradition is sought. Nor does it set any time-limits for detention pending extradition. Furthermore, in its decision of 19\u00a0March 2009 specifically concerning Article 466 \u00a7 2 the Constitutional Court, whilst finding that the impugned provision did not violate a person\u2019s constitutional rights by not establishing any grounds or procedure for ordering detention pending extradition or time-limits for such detention, did not explain which legal provisions in fact governed such a procedure or what time-limits were to be applied in situations covered by Article 466 \u00a7 2 (see paragraph 84 above).",

The Court notes, however, that that ruling was adopted after the period of the applicant\u2019s detention in question had expired. It cannot therefore affect the conclusion that at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention the Russian legal provisions governing detention pending receipt of an extradition request, and any eventual extension of detention following the receipt of such a request, were neither precise nor foreseeable in their application. However, it is clear from the ruling that the applicant\u2019s detention should have been ordered and extended by a Russian court rather than by a prosecutor (see Zokhidov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0161).",

The deprivation of liberty to which the applicant was subjected during that period was thus not circumscribed by adequate safeguards against arbitrariness. Russian law at the material time therefore fell short of the \u201cquality of law\u201d standard required under the Convention.

The Government also noted that according to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision no. 6-R of 17\u00a0February 1998, a person subject to administrative-removal proceedings could be detained without a court order for up to forty-eight hours. As on 17\u00a0September 2012 the applicant had been arrested on the ground of having committed an administrative offence punishable by administrative removal, and on 19 September 2012 the Meshchanskiy District of Moscow had found him guilty of that offence and ordered his administrative removal and detention in a special facility pending the execution of the decision, the applicant\u2019s detention had fully complied with the domestic law.

He argued, however, that as the authorities had taken no measures in this regard while he was in custody pending extradition, they had then abused their powers by ordering his detention within the framework of administrative proceedings solely with a view to ensuring his return to Uzbekistan notwithstanding the refusal of the extradition request. The applicant considered that his detention pending administrative removal had in any event been unlawful, as the Code of Administrative Offences set no time-limits for such detention. Even though the execution of the decision on his administrative removal had been suspended on account of the application of Rule 39 by the Court, in the applicant\u2019s view this did not remedy the absence of clear provisions in domestic law governing such detention. With reference to Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 172-73, the applicant argued that detention pending expulsion must not exceed the maximum term for detention as an administrative penalty, as otherwise it constituted a punitive rather than preventive measure.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7 164, ECHR 2009, with further references). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still be arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention must be appropriate; and the length of the detention must not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Rustamov, cited above, \u00a7 150, with further references).",

Therefore, the simultaneous institution of expulsion proceedings would have led to duplicated results and entailed a waste of administrative and judicial resources.

Thus, after the expiry of such period an applicant should be released. This may happen in the present case; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences for the applicant\u2019s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting the duration of the detention of an illegal alien is not set out clearly in the law. It is also unclear what will happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0171).",

Similarly to Azimov, the applicant in the present case complained under Article 5 \u00a7 4 not about the initial decision on his placement in custody, but about his inability to obtain a judicial review of his detention after a certain lapse of time. As the Court further noted in Azimov (ibid), detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) lasts, as a rule, for a significant period and depends on circumstances which are subject to change over time. Given that after the delivery of the appeal decision of 10 October 2012 the applicant has so far spent in custody about seventeen months, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen during that period. Under such circumstances the Court considers that the requirement under Article 5 \u00a7 4 was neither incorporated in the initial detention order of 19 September 2012 nor fulfilled by the appeal court.",
