Switzerland judgment of 24\u00a0November 1993, Series A no.\u00a0275, p. 13, \u00a7 36). The manner in which Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case. The question is whether the lack of legal representation during the preliminary investigation, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, has deprived the accused of a fair hearing (John Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996I, \u00a7\u00a063).",

However, even assuming that the authorities refused to assign him a lawyer, despite his explicit request, the Court is of the opinion that the lack of legal assistance at the early stage of the proceedings did not deprive the applicant of a fair hearing. In reaching this conclusion, the Court has taken into account the entirety of the proceedings, in particular the fact that the applicant had a lawyer throughout the proceedings before the  and the Court of Cassation. Moreover, the Court notes that the \u0130zmir State Security Court based its final decision, not only on his statements given in police custody but also on his statements given during the hearings, his confessions made before the public prosecutor and the statements of the other accused (see, mutatis mutandis, Mama\u00e7 and Others v.
