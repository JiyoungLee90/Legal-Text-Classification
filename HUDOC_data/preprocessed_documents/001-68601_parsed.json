No thought was given by Dr T\u00fcrkan, who performed the examination, to the possibility that traces of bullets or other evidence might still be lodged in the body. No attempts were made to establish either the distance from which the bullets had been fired or the type of weapon or weapons that had been used. The finding that the death had been caused by gunshot wounds was sufficient for Dr T\u00fcrkan and the public prosecutor \u0130brahim Engin to conclude that a full autopsy was not necessary (see paragraph 50 above). This report, therefore, is not capable of throwing up any leads that could have assisted in the establishment of the authors of the killing.",

Rabia Karako\u00e7, G\u00fcll\u00fc G\u00fczel-Karako\u00e7, Zeliha Karako\u00e7 and Hayriye Karaman told the delegates how they had set off early in the morning and had come across the two women shepherds, Hacire Ceylan and Hediye Akodun, who had warned them not to proceed further as there was an operation in progress. Furthermore, Rabia Karako\u00e7 explained how she had heard a single shot from a pistol, followed by continuous firing. This version of events was confirmed by Hacire Ceylan \u2013 herself also an eyewitness to the events \u2013 in her testimony to the delegates. Moreover, in her statement of 17 May 1995 to the Elaz\u0131\u011f Assize Court Ms Ceylan also confirmed that an operation had taken place on 10\u00a0November 1992 and that soldiers had told her to return home (see paragraph 83 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court attaches little relevance to Hediye Akodun\u2019s statement to the  that no operation had taken place (see paragraph 84 above).

In the latter proceedings, Mr Arpac\u0131 declared that he had personally found the three bodies and that he had recorded this discovery in the operation report.

In view of Mr Arpac\u0131\u2019s precise and detailed description to the Military Court of the three bodies and the locations where they had been found, the Court is wholly unconvinced by the explanation proffered by him for the contradictions in his statements, namely that he had been mistaken in the account he had given to the Military Court (see paragraph 165 above).

It is even less prepared to believe that he would have been unaware of the fact that seven gendarmes who had taken part in an operation under his command had been prosecuted for killings which had taken place in the course of that operation (see paragraph 123 above).

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (ibid., p. 46, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0148149).",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy v.
