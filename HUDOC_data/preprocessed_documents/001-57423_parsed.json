Unlike the situation in the above-mentioned Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth case, Mr Jacobsson\u2019s right of property was never rendered precarious by the issuing of any expropriation permit. Moreover, it does not emerge from the evidence before the Court that any other steps have been taken with the aim or the effect of depriving him of his right of property over Salem 23:1 during the relevant period; thus the municipality has not adopted any plan giving it the right to purchase the property compulsorily ( see paragraph 32 above) and it does not appear from the file that the municipality\u2019s projects for the applicant\u2019s property were ever so firm that the applicant could reasonably have feared the application of Chapter 2, section 1 of the 1972 Act. The present case is thus clearly distinguishable from the Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth case and is only concerned with the control of the use of the applicant\u2019s property pending the elaboration of a town plan (see paragraphs 8 and 35 above).",

In addition, the Parliamentary Ombudsman\u2019s criticism referred to by the applicant did not relate to the legality of the protracted use of building prohibitions as a matter of Swedish law, but only questioned the acceptability of such use, without any provisions for the compensation of affected land-owners, in a State abiding by the rule of law (see the above-mentioned Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth judgment, Series A no. 52, p. 17, para. 42).

However, the Court does not find it established that he had acquired any unconditional rights to build a second house. It has not been shown that during the relevant period the authorities would have been obliged to grant him the permit necessary for that purpose. Firstly, no absolute right to erect a second house could be deduced from the subdivision plan (see paragraph 8 above), although the plan did not rule out such a possibility. Furthermore, it does not appear from the evidence that the regulations for non-planned areas did not apply and that the applicant\u2019s property was exempted from the general requirement of suitability (see paragraphs 25, 33 and 38 above). In the Government\u2019s view this requirement made the granting of a second permit highly unlikely as a result of the ongoing planning procedure. This finds support in the preliminary results of the planning process available both at the time of purchase and subsequently (see paragraphs 8, 14, 18 and 21 above).",
