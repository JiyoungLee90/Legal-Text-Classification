As to the complexity, the Government maintained that the applicant's case had been a complex one, concerning economic crime. The evidence presented before the District Court had been extensive and the court had taken testimony from various witnesses. The court had delivered its judgment in respect of 27 other defendants of the case already on 15 October 2004.

The applicant had not been aware of the oral hearing of 16 June 2009 and he could thus not be considered as abusing his right of individual application. As the charges against the applicant had been dismissed, his sentence could not have been mitigated and thus there had been no effective remedy for excessive length available to him. Since 1997 it had been possible to hear witnesses outside the courtroom but the national authorities had failed to hear M.T. in this manner.",

Thus, the Court is unable to assess whether the national authorities, in fact, resorted to all available measures, to a sufficient degree, in their attempts to find the applicant's co-defendants and the witnesses. The same applies also to the summonsing of the applicant for the oral hearing of 16\u00a0June 2009. Even assuming that the applicant had deliberately evaded the oral hearing set for 16 June 2009, that could not have delayed the proceedings to a significant degree as the criminal proceedings against the applicant had already been pending for more than five years and eleven months before 27 May 2009, that is, the date of issuing the summons. Therefore, the Court cannot but conclude that no major delay was attributable to the applicant. On the contrary, the Court notes that there was a considerably long period of inactivity attributable to the Government as the District Court had decided to stay the proceedings from 8 May 2005 to 16 June 2009. The applicant's case thus remained dormant for more than four years.",
