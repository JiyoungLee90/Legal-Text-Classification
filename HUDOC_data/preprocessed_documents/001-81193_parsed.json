Moreover, the President of the panel had read out at the beginning of the proceedings both the first name and surname of Judge V.B., which should have enabled the head teacher of the school to realise who it was.

To that end Article\u00a06 requires a tribunal falling within its scope to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see Piersack v. Belgium, judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, \u00a7 30 and Grieves v.\u00a0the United Kingdom [GC], no. 57067/00, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2003XII). As to the second test, when applied to a body sitting as a bench, it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of the members of that body, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to its impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of some importance (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, judgment of 28\u00a0October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3116, \u00a7 45 and Morel v. France, no.\u00a034130/96, \u00a7 42, ECHR 2000VI). When it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 951-52, \u00a7\u00a058, and Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, \u00a7 44, CEDH 2000-XII).",

The Court considers that it can reasonably be inferred that Judge V.B. was aware of his past relations with the school. It was incumbent on him under Article 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure to inform the parties of a possible incompatibility. The Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes an obligation on every domestic court to check whether, as constituted, it is an \u201cimpartial tribunal\u201d within the meaning of that provision (see Remli v.
