More specifically, the Court reiterates that a certain degree of access to the case-file, if only to such an extent as to afford the detainee an opportunity of effectively challenging evidence on which his detention was based, may in certain instances be envisaged in proceedings concerning review of the lawfulness of detention on remand (see Lamy v. Belgium, judgment of 30 March 1989, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0151, pp. 16-17, \u00a7 29). These requirements are derived from the right to an adversarial trial as laid down in Article 6 of the Convention, which means, in a criminal case, that both the prosecution and the defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. According to the Court's case-law, it follows from the wording of Article 6 \u2013 and particularly from the autonomous meaning to be given to the notion of \u201ccriminal charge\u201d \u2013 that this provision can be applied to pre-trial proceedings (see Imbrioscia\u00a0v. Switzerland, judgment of 24\u00a0November 1993, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0275, p. 13, \u00a7 36). It thus follows that, in view of the dramatic impact of deprivation of liberty on the fundamental rights of the person concerned, proceedings conducted under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a04 of the Convention should in principle also meet, to the largest extent possible under the circumstances of an ongoing investigation, the basic requirements of a fair trial, such as the right to adversarial procedure (see Schops v.\u00a0, no. 25116/94, 13 February 2001, \u00a7 44; Lietzow v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a024479/94, 13 February 2001, \u00a7 44).",
