The Court further reiterates that a person cannot complain about a violation of his or her rights in proceedings to which he or she was not a party, even if he or she was a shareholder and/or executive director of the company which was party to the proceedings (see, among other authorities, F. Santos Lda. and Fachadas v. Portugal (dec.), no. 49020/99, 19 September 2000, and Nosov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30877/02, 20 October 2005). Furthermore, while in certain circumstances the sole owner of a company can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in so far as the impugned measures taken with regard to his or her company are concerned (see, among other authorities, Ankarcrona v.

The Court further notes that the second applicant did not produce any evidence to show that he was indeed a shareholder of the applicant company, let alone its sole owner. Nor did he even submit any argumentation in support of the application on his behalf. All the materials in the Court's possession, however, indicate that it was the applicant company alone, as a legal entity, which applied for and was denied a licence, and was later a party to the relevant court proceedings. All the decisions of the NTRC and the domestic courts were delivered in respect of the applicant company and not the second applicant, who did not even represent the applicant company in the domestic proceedings. Consequently, all the materials indicate that the refusals of a licence and the ensuing court proceedings directly affected only the interests of the applicant company and there is no material before the Court which would prompt it to regard the second applicant as a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34.",

Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Rotaru v.

As regards licensing procedures in particular, the Court reiterates that the manner in which the licensing criteria are applied in the licensing process must provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness, including the proper reasoning by the licensing authority of its decisions denying a broadcasting licence (see Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Anatoliy Elenkov v.

Section 50 of that Act defined the criteria on which the NTRC was to base its choice in granting a broadcasting licence. These included \u201cthe predominance of programmes produced in-house\u201d, \u201cthe predominance of programmes produced in \u201d, \u201cthe technical and financial capacity of the applicant\u201d and \u201cthe professional level of the staff\u201d. While these criteria in themselves appear to be sufficiently precise, the Broadcasting Act did not explicitly require at the material time that any reasons be given by the licensing authority in applying these criteria. Thus, the licensing authority, in the instant case the NTRC, gave no reasons whatsoever for its decisions repeatedly denying the applicant company a broadcasting licence. On each occasion the NTRC simply announced the winner of each call for tenders, providing no reasons as to why this or that company's bid met the requisite criteria more than those of the applicant company. Even though the NTRC held public hearings, no decisions containing reasons for the grant or the denial of a licence were announced at such hearings. The competing companies simply presented their bids, following which a points-based vote was taken with no reasoning being given. The applicant company and the public were thus not made aware on what basis the NTRC had exercised its discretion to deny broadcasting licences.",

The Court considers that the failure of the NTRC to apply the licensing criteria on each occasion in a manner compatible with Article 10, in particular its failure to give any reasons for its repeated denials of the applicant company's bids, must have caused frustration and uncertainty to the company's management team which cannot be compensated by a finding of a violation alone (see, mutatis mutandis, ibid., \u00a7 36; and Freedom and Democracy Party (\u00d6ZDEP), cited above, \u00a7 57).
