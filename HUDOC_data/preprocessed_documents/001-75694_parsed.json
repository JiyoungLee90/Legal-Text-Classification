The Court further notes that the applicant appealed against the decision of 21 May 2002 and that it did not come into force until 30 September 2002, when that appeal was declared inadmissible.

However, this does not justify the overall duration of the proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Goc, cited above, \u00a7 36), as the States have a general obligation to organise their legal systems so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of that provision, including that of trial within a reasonable time (see, as recent authorities, Kitov v.

In total, these accounted for approximately nine months of delay. On the other hand, the Court considers that even if the proceedings lasted longer because of the applicant\u2019s appeals (see paragraphs 11, 14, 26, 31, 35 and 37 above), this delay resulted from the justified exercise of his procedural rights rather than from any desire on his part to thwart the speedy determination of the dispute.

A hearing listed by the same court for 15 May 1998 had to be adjourned due to the need to replace two judges to avoid impartiality concerns. During the second proceedings for review the Supreme Court of Cassation held a hearing more than nine months after the petition had been lodged. The unjustified refusal of the Plovdiv District and Regional courts to examine the applicant\u2019s appeal against the former\u2019s judgment of 2 June 2000 consumed another fifteen months (see paragraphs 20, 21, 27 and 31 above).",

It follows that Article 13 is applicable. It notes that in several cases (see Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, \u00a7 51, 8 July 2004, Rachevi v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a047877/99, \u00a7 65, 23 September 2004; and Dimitrov v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a047829/99, \u00a7 77, 23 September 2004) it found that until July 1999 \u2013 more than five years after the commencement of the proceedings at issue \u2013 Bulgarian law did not provide any remedies against the excessive length of civil proceedings. The Court does not consider it necessary to examine whether a \u201ccomplaint about delays\u201d under Article 217a of the Code of Civil Procedure, enacted in July 1999 (see paragraph 41 above), is an effective remedy in principle. Even assuming that it is one, any decision given under this provision which might have speeded up the examination of the case could not have made up for the delays which had occurred prior to its introduction and had already had a significant impact on the overall duration of the proceedings (see Djangozov, \u00a7 52; Rachevi, \u00a7 67; and Dimitrov, \u00a7 78, all cited above). The Court also notes that under Bulgarian law there exists no possibility to obtain compensation for excessively lengthy civil proceedings (see Djangozov, \u00a7 58; Rachevi, \u00a7 103; and Dimitrov, \u00a7 82, all cited above).",
