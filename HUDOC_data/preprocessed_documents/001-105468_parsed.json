The guest was presented as a businessman who alleged that he had bribed the second applicant to secure the publication of material. He also described his and the applicants\u2019 evening in the sauna on 31\u00a0January 2003, and stated that one of the applicants had stolen money from the pocket of his trousers and that the applicants intended to kidnap his child for ransom. S.D. also alleged that the newspaper employing the applicants belonged to an opposition leader. The programme continued with footage from a black and white video filmed in the sauna. The applicants were seen in their underwear, apparently intoxicated, using obscene language. Two of the applicants were kissing and touching one of the men, and one of them was performing an erotic dance. The face of the male was covered in the video, whereas those of the applicants were not and the video was paused from time to time in order to allow them to be recognised more easily. The video appears to have been shot from a static camera and at least one of the male participants appears to have been aware of the filming, since he gave the \u201cthumbs up\u201d sign to the camera when none of the applicants was looking. A copy of the receipt issued to the Ministry of Internal Affairs was also shown in the programme and offensive terms with meanings such as \u201clow class prostitutes\u201d were employed when images of the applicants were shown.

The court also found that the disclosure by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of one of the applicants\u2019 collaboration with the police by way of disclosing a receipt written by her had breached her right to respect for her private life. A similar breach with regard to all the applicants was found in respect of the broadcasting of the video of the sauna scene on national television without their consent and in the absence of a public interest justification. The court also found that the secret filming in the sauna constituted an unjustified interference with the applicants\u2019 right to privacy as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. However, relying on the outcome of the criminal investigation, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the secret filming of the sauna scene had been carried out by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. At the same time the court concluded that the Ministry of Internal Affairs was responsible for unlawfully transmitting to the national television service secret video material from a criminal case file, namely, a video of the arrest of the editor in chief of the newspaper employing the first and second applicants.",

The Court shares this opinion and does not consider it necessary to re-examine the compatibility of that interference with the requirements of the Convention. The Court also notes that the domestic courts awarded the applicants compensation for non-pecuniary damage and considers that the principal issue is whether the awards made were proportionate to the damage the applicants sustained and whether, in applying the provisions of Article 7/1 of the old Civil Code, which limited the amount of compensation payable to victims of defamation, the Supreme Court of Justice fulfilled its positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention.",

Moreover, there is strong prima facie evidence that the applicants\u2019 secret filming in the sauna was organised by agents of the State. The video was later broadcast on national television in a programme presented by the president of the national television service and remarks about the opposition being behind the newspaper employing the applicants were made. The facts clearly suggest that the authorities were directly involved in this case and that they not only failed to investigate the applicants\u2019 allegations but, on the contrary, created obstacles and hindered the investigation in every possible way.",
