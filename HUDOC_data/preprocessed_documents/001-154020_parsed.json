The domestic courts did not examine the essential arguments of the applicants\u2019 complaints, namely, that the police had had no valid reasons to mount each of the undercover operations and that they had impermissibly incited the applicants to sell drugs. They did not request any materials concerning the substance of incriminating operational information and accepted just the uncorroborated statements of police officers to that effect (see Yeremtsov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19).",

The re-examination of their criminal cases by the domestic courts was conducted in an exact same manner as the reexamination of the applicants\u2019 cases in the case of Yeremtsov and Others, and it did not appear to be effective. The domestic courts in the present case did not consider the arguments which lied at the heart of the applicants\u2019 complaints about entrapment and as such, similarly to the domestic courts in the case of Yeremtsov and Others, they were not in the position to assess whether violation, if any, of the applicants\u2019 Article 6 rights took place in the course of undercover operation. Thus, albeit favourable for the applicants in the outcome, the re-examination of their cases nevertheless fell short of the standards developed in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in the light of Article 6 of the Convention (see Yeremtsov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01216).",
