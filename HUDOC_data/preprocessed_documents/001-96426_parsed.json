For example, the fact that one of the parties was the next of kin of any of the judges of a court in question was, in principle, assessed to be an important reason for transfer of jurisdiction. However, the Supreme Court had rejected requests for transfer of jurisdiction in situations when a party would refer to this fact only after becoming dissatisfied with court decisions (case no. Gr1 386/06). Neither was a subjective belief that judges were biased considered to be an important reason for transfer of jurisdiction, because judges were generally presumed to be objective and to follow the law when hearing cases (case no. Gr1 180/04). For the same reason, a request for transfer of jurisdiction alleging that one of the parties to the proceedings had been a judge acquainted with the judges of the court in question had been rejected (case no. Gr1-111/05). Furthermore, although the Supreme Court had granted many requests for transfer of jurisdiction when court employees were parties to the proceedings, it had rejected such requests in situations when the court at issue had been a large court with a large number of judges (case no. Gr1-804/03). Also, the Supreme Court had held in several cases that the fact that a party to the proceedings had filed a criminal complaint against one or all of the judges of the court in question or against its president was not a reason for transfer of jurisdiction (cases nos. Gr1-919/03, Gr1-851/03 and Gr7/1999).",

Ukraine, no. 7577/02, \u00a7 68, 3\u00a0May 2007). As regards the issue of \u201cindependence\u201d, the Court further reiterates that in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered \u201cindependent\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of safeguards against outside pressures and the question whether it presents an appearance of independence (see, among many other authorities, Findlay, loc. cit.). However, judicial independence demands that individual judges be free not only from undue influences outside the judiciary, but also from within. This internal judicial independence requires that they be free from directives or pressures from the fellow judges or those who have administrative responsibilities in the court such as the president of the court or the president of a division in the court (see, by implication, Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, ECHR 2000X; Bochan, cited above; and Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, \u00a7 182, 9 October 2008). The absence of sufficient safeguards securing the independence of judges within the judiciary and, in particular, vis-\u00e0-vis their judicial superiors, may lead the Court to conclude that an applicant's doubts as to the (independence and) impartiality of a court may be said to have been objectively justified (see, for example, Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 38; Bochan, cited above, \u00a7 74; and Moiseyev, cited above, \u00a7 184).",

As it transpires from the information submitted by the Government (see paragraph 23 above) and the Court Rules (see paragraph 40 above), in the Zlatar County Court civil cases were first listed in chronological order and then assigned by the president of the court to one of the two panel presidents in alphabetical order of their last names, who further assigned them, also in alphabetical order, to one of the judges within the panels. The only exception to this rule was envisaged for situations where a judge to whom the case was to be assigned had participated in the first-instance proceedings in the same case and therefore was not allowed to examine it. While it is true that the president of the court could reassign cases for important reasons such as a longer illness or a judge's particularly high workload, such reassignment was also subject to objective criteria set forth in Rule 34 of the Court Rules. The Court further notes that under section 73g(1) of the Courts Act, a breach by the president of the court of the above rules on assignment of cases was one of the grounds for his or her removal from the office (see paragraph 36 above). The Court therefore concludes that Croatian law in force at the material time provided for adequate safeguards against arbitrary exercise of court presidents' duty to (re)assign cases to judges (see, by converse implication, Moiseyev v. Russia, no. 62936/00, \u00a7 182, 9 October 2008).",

Nor, in contrast to the Moiseyev case (cited above), is there any evidence that judge M.M. reassigned the applicant's case. Furthermore, in the Daktaras case, the proceedings before the Supreme Court, of which the applicant complained about, were instituted by the petition of the president of that court's criminal division whereas in the instant case judge M.M. played no role in bringing the civil action for unjust enrichment or in the ensuing proceedings against the applicant.",

However, in neither of these areas the court presidents had exclusive powers or unfettered discretion. In particular, a judge who received an unfavourable appraisal from the president of the court in which he or she was working could have appealed against it to the president of the immediately higher court (see paragraph 30 above). The appraisal of judges in sensitive situations of their permanent appointment or career advancement was within the purview of judicial panels composed of their peers, which were only required to take into consideration the final opinion of the president of the court on the performance of the judge in question (see paragraph 33 above). What is more, these panels were only giving opinions on candidates for judicial office to the Minister of Justice. He or she was the one submitting the list of candidates to the National Judicial Council, which was the only authority competent to finally decide on the appointment of judges (see paragraph 38 above). As regards the power to discipline judges, the court presidents could only institute disciplinary proceedings against judges (see paragraph 39 above) whereas the authority to conduct disciplinary proceedings and acquit or impose a penalty lay exclusively with the National Judicial Council (see paragraph 37 above). While the court presidents had the authority to temporarily suspend the judges, they could have done so only if criminal proceedings were instituted against a judge or if he or she was in detention (see paragraph 39 above).",
