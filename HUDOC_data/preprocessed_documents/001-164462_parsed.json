Such interference was undoubtedly prescribed by law, namely under Articles 23 and 24 of the Civil Code. The Court further accepts that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others \u2013 namely, the good name, reputation and credibility of Agora S.A., the publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza \u2013 within the meaning of Article\u00a010\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. \u00a0Accordingly, the only outstanding issue is whether the interference with the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.",

In this respect the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society must be emphasized. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, its duty is nevertheless to impart \u2013 in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities \u2013 information and ideas on all matters of public interest. In addition journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Prager and Oberschlick v.\u00a0Austria, 26\u00a0April 1995, \u00a7 38, Series A no. 313). These considerations play a particularly important role, given the influence wielded by the media in contemporary society: not only do they inform, they can also suggest by the way in which they present the information how it is to be assessed (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, \u00a7\u00a0104,\u00a0 ECHR\u00a02007 V). In this context the Court considers journalists and publicists like other persons actively involved in public life should display a greater degree of tolerance for criticism against them\u00a0 (see, mutatis mutandis, I Avgi Publishing and Press Agency S.A. and Karis v. Greece, no.\u00a015909/06, \u00a7 34, 5 June 2008; Seleckis v. Latvia (dec.), no. 41486/04, \u00a7 32, 2\u00a0March 2010).\u00a0 Therefore, in a democratic system the limits of permissible criticism are much wider with regard to newspapers than in relation to a private citizen (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00c4rztekammer f\u00fcr Wien and Dorner v. Austria, no.\u00a08895/10, \u00a7 65, 16 February 2016).",

The Court finds that the publication of an apology entailed considerable costs for the applicant and that the combined total came to about eighteen times the average monthly wage at the material time. In those circumstances, the Court finds that the pecuniary sanctions imposed on the applicant were excessive (see\u00a0Kwiecie\u0144 v. Poland, no. 51744/99, \u00a7\u00a056, 9 January 2007).",

I argued that \u201cawarding substantial financial \u2018satisfaction\u2019 to the applicants for the non-pecuniary damage which they [had] allegedly sustained encourage[d], even if indirectly, political conduct of such a kind that should normally be avoided in a parliamentary democracy\u201d. Having regard to the political nature of that case, I maintained that \u201c[f]or members of Parliament ..., winning such a case before the Court is, in itself, a satisfaction far greater than the money awarded ... for whatever nonpecuniary damage [they] might have sustained\u201d, so the \u201cnon-pecuniary damage allegedly sustained ... is already more than sufficiently compensated for by the findings of violations\u201d of the Convention.",

It also found that \u201cthe impugned disciplinary sanctions which were imposed on the applicants were supported by reasons that were relevant for the legitimate aims pursued\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 151). Thus, the applicants were criticised for their actions. However, the \u201cinterference with [their] right to freedom of expression\u201d was found by the Grand Chamber to be \u201cnot proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 161).",
