However, a State may also be held responsible even where its agents are acting ultra vires or contrary to instructions (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 159, Series A no. 25, and Moldovan and Others v.

In order to establish whether a State can be held responsible for the unlawful actions of its agents taken outside their official duties, the Court needs to assess the totality of the circumstances and consider the nature and circumstances of the conduct in question (see, mutatis mutandis, Sa\u0161o Gorgiev v. \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, no. 49382/06, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR\u00a02012 (extracts)).",

In the Court\u2019s view, the exercise of State powers which affects Convention rights and freedoms raises an issue of State responsibility regardless of the form in which those powers happen to be exercised, including, for instance, by a body to which the State delegates those powers (see, mutatis mutandis, Wo\u015b v.

It is not clear whether those volunteer citizen guards were on duty during the impugned incident, in so far as their principal function of maintaining public order is concerned. Nevertheless, having regard to the findings at the domestic level, there is a sufficient basis to suggest that they used force against the applicant at least in part with a view to exercising their powers under the relevant regulations (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 13 above). Accordingly, their actions were imputable to the respondent State (compare with Basenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a024213/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060 and 90, 26\u00a0November 2015). It also transpires from the domestic findings that the applicant\u2019s injuries were caused by the volunteer citizen guards in the course of those events (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). As the domestic investigation fell short of the requirements of Article\u00a03 of the Convention, it remains unclear in what way the injuries were inflicted on the applicant and whether force was used lawfully and in a proportionate manner (see paragraph 24 above). However, the Court is not precluded from finding a breach of Article 3 of the Convention in such circumstances, that is to say when no exact course of events has been established (see, for instance, Sylenok and TekhnoservisPlus v. Ukraine, no. 20988/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a06970, 9\u00a0December 2010). Accordingly, there has been a violation of that provision in that the applicant was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the volunteer citizen guards on 1\u00a0August 2004.",
