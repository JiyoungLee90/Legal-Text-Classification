Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a083, 26 October 2006; that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 115, and Melnik\u00a0v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a072286/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0104-106, 28 March 2006); and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy that seeks, to the extent possible, to cure the detainee\u2019s diseases or to avoid aggravating them, rather than to address them on a symptomatic basis (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; Sarban, cited above, \u00a7\u00a079; and Popo v.

At the same time the Court notes that in assessing the adequacy of the treatment it must be guided by the due diligence test, since the State\u2019s obligation to cure a seriously ill detainee is one as to means, not as to result (see Goginashvili v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 47729/08, \u00a7 71, 4 October 2011).",

As the Court has earlier held in its case-law, the absence or inadequacy of tuberculosis treatment, particularly when the disease has been contracted or reactivated in detention, is most certainly a subject of concern. The Court is therefore bound to assess the quality of medical services offered to the applicant in the present case (see Pakhomov v. Russia, no.\u00a044917/08, \u00a7\u00a065, 30 September 2010).",

Later on, his left lung was found to have been affected too. Further on, the diagnosis again referred only to the right-lung post-tuberculosis changes. Then the applicant was found to be in good health. However, just a few months later he was diagnosed with infiltrative tuberculosis of the left lung. Finally, he was found to have suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis in both lungs (see, in particular, paragraphs 56, 62, 65, 69, 71, 72 and 78 above).",

The absence of any record of such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee, the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it must be seen as incompatible with the requirement of lawfulness and with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Fedotov v.
