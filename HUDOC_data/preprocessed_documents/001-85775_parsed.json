Nevertheless, although Article\u00a06 \u00a7\u00a01 obliges courts to give reasons for their decisions, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument (see Van de Hurk v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands, judgment of 19\u00a0April 1994, Series A no.\u00a0288, p. 20, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059 and 61, and Burg v. France (dec.), no.\u00a034763/02, ECHR\u00a02003-II). The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Ruiz Torija v. Spain and Hiro Balani v.\u00a0Spain, judgments of 9\u00a0December 1994, Series A nos. 303-A and 303-B, p.\u00a012, \u00a7 29, and pp.\u00a02930, \u00a7\u00a027, respectively, and Helle v.

Nor, since G. had died before any application was lodged with the Court, can the applicant claim to be pursuing on behalf of her husband proceedings already commenced by him.

It is true that the Court went on to state that, even though the applicant, as a sibling of the deceased victim, was not entitled to any financial reparation as a result of any acquittal, his civil rights were affected since an acquittal allowed him \u201cto clear his brother\u2019s name\u201d and \u201cto restore the honour and reputation of his family which was for a long time inevitably disgraced and brought into disrepute by his brother\u2019s wrongful conviction\u201d.

I share the doubts of Judges Garlicki and \u0160ikuta in their Joint Concurring Opinion as to whether the proceedings against G. can, on any view, be regarded as rehabilitation proceedings, which as they correctly point out, apply only where there has been a prior conviction. There is, moreover, nothing in the judgments of the domestic courts to suggest that the proceedings against G. were viewed as rehabilitation proceedings and the fact that the Court of Appeal invoked section 5 (8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to discontinue the proceedings against D. on the grounds that he had died, indeed suggests the contrary.

The applicants were the heirs of members of a crew who had died in a shipwreck and the proceedings in question took place before the maritime chambers, administrative bodies whose role, inter alia, was to establish the cause of the accident. The applicants took part in the proceedings in which members of the crew were criticised by the maritime chambers and found to have been partly to blame for the accident. As heirs of the deceased crew members, the applicants were held by the Court to have victim status under Article 6 to claim that the maritime chambers were not independent and impartial tribunals. Although, in reaching this conclusion, the Court again founded on the civil right of the applicants to defend their reputation and that of their deceased relatives, I do not consider that the Court\u2019s reasoning can be extended beyond the particular context to cover criminal proceedings resulting in the conviction of the applicant\u2019s relative.",

Although the judgment of the Chamber in the present case seems to assimilate the two by asserting that the applicant was seeking to protect her husband\u2019s good name \u201cin line with the presumption of innocence\u201d (\u00a7 101), Article 6 \u00a7 2 is not raised in the present case. The applicant\u2019s complaint is not that the presumption of G.\u2019s innocence was violated without his guilt having been proved but, on the contrary, that his guilt had been proved in a trial which was unfair, a complaint which was found to be inadmissible in the N\u00f6lkenbockhoff case itself. I have similar doubts as to the majority\u2019s reliance on the applicant\u2019s \u201clegitimate material interest\u201d as G.\u2019s heir in proving the innocence of her husband, the argument being that in such an event she would have been entitled to claim compensation from the prosecution\u2019s office for G.\u2019s unlawful detention and conviction. Although, as noted above, the Government appear to concede that, if G. had been acquitted, this would have had \u201cimportant effects for any civil law claim\u201d, I remain sceptical whether this is so. In the N\u00f6lkenbockhoff case the final acquittal of the applicant\u2019s husband would have entitled her to recover the costs and expenses incurred by her husband in defending the proceedings; in the present case, it is far from clear to me that the acquittal of G. on his retrial would have entitled him or his heirs to pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage under Act No. 1545, such award being confined to cases where the detention or conviction was \u201cunlawful\u201d.",
