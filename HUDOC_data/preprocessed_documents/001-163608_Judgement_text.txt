The case originated in an application (no. 11984/06) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Tatyana Igorevna Kuzmina (“the applicant”), on 11 March 2006.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented, most recently, by their Acting Agent, Ms O. Davydchuk.
On 13 January 2011 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Kyiv.
On 30 June 2004 the Darnytskyy District Court of Kyiv found that the applicant had committed the following crimes: appropriation of private property by means of fraud or abuse of trust, theft of property and theft of official documents. The court sentenced her to five years’ imprisonment suspended for three years with probation.
On 23 December 2004 the applicant’s conviction was upheld by the Kyiv Court of Appeal. She appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court.
On 31 May 2005 a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court considered the applicant’s appeal on points of law in accordance with Article 394 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (by virtue of which it could either dismiss the appeal or assign the case for further consideration with the participation of all the parties). The Supreme Court did not notify the applicant or her lawyer of that hearing. The prosecutor was present and made oral representations during the hearing. Having regard to his opinion and the material in the case file, the panel dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated.
In a letter dated 12 September 2005 the Supreme Court notified the applicant, enclosing a copy of its decision. She received the letter on 16 September 2005.
The relevant provisions of the domestic law, applicable at the material time, can be found in the judgment in the case of Zhuk v. Ukraine (no. 45783/05, §§ 18-20, 21 October 2010).
