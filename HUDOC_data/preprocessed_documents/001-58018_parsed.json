He maintained that the trial judge, who had not been trained in how to deal with race issues, underestimated the seriousness of the allegation in the note (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). He pointed to what he claimed to be the conclusion of the Court of Appeal, namely that the note clearly indicated that the jury as a whole were displaying racial prejudice and that one juror wished therefore to be discharged from further consideration of the case (see paragraph 17 above). A redirection was an entirely inadequate safeguard to counteract the proven pernicious effects of racism on a jury, and especially in the case at issue since it was given at such a late and crucial stage in the proceedings.",

Having regard to the judge\u2019s choice of words it could be reasonably concluded that there was little difference between the redirection and the enquiry which the applicant argued should have been conducted as an alternative to a discharge (see paragraphs 29 and 40 above). Following the redirection there was no further suggestion that any of the jurors was concerned about an element of racial bias.

As an experienced judge who had observed the jury throughout the trial, he was no doubt aware of the possibility of either discharging the jury at that stage or asking the jury in open court whether they were capable of continuing and returning a verdict on the evidence alone. He chose neither of these courses of action, and it is significant that defence counsel did not in fact press for them (see paragraph 11 above). It may be reasonably inferred that defence counsel himself did not consider that either was warranted in the circumstances. At the most defence counsel would appear to have asked the judge to investigate the circumstances which motivated the writing of the note. However, such an investigation would not have been possible under English law (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above).",

It is significant that on no subsequent occasion was there any further suggestion of racial comment.

While the guarantee of a fair trial may in certain circumstances require a judge to discharge a jury it must also be acknowledged that this may not always be the only means to achieve this aim. In circumstances such as those in issue, other safeguards, including a carefully worded redirection to the jury, may be sufficient. The Court considers that it is confirmed in this conclusion by the view taken of the judge\u2019s handling of the note by the judges on appeal in application of legal principles which corresponded closely to its own case-law on the objective requirements of impartiality (see paragraphs 16, 17 and 32 above).",

The members of the jury are given no advance warning on how they are to address an unexpected occurrence of racism within the jury. Their only point of reference is their own personal experience in their daily lives. This leads me to stress that it is of the utmost importance that remedies should be in place to enable a trial judge to ensure that the decision of the jury is not tainted with any objective suspicion of bias. This is especially true when, as in the instant case, the suspicion of bias is brought directly to the attention of the judge.",

The only safeguard which could have been offered by the trial judge in this case was to discharge part or the whole of the jury, or at least to have conducted a more probing enquiry into the effect of the note on the jury\u2019s deliberations and decision-making by asking the jury in open court whether they were still capable of continuing and returning a verdict in the circumstances. The jury\u2019s answer to that question would have enabled the judge either to exercise his powers of discharge or to cedes himself that the note was inconsequential. He took none of these courses of action and no other effective means were available since domestic law prevented the trial judge from questioning the jury members about the origin and nature of the note.",
