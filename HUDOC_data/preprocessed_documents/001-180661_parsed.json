Nonetheless, even if there are no such circumstances on the part of the injured person, it is not possible to wholly ignore the fact that the plaintiff has initiated a large number of judicial disputes. It puts him in a different position as regards the perception of the degree of damage caused by the excessive length of one of the disputes compared to the position of a person participating in only one or only a few judicial proceedings (compare, in similar terms, the European Court of Human Rights inadmissibility decision in the case of Havelka v. the Czech Republic, of 20 September 2011, applications nos. 7332/10, 42666/10 and 61523/10, and the decision of the Supreme Court of 4\u00a0June\u00a02013, no. 30 Cdo 1042/2013).",

Cpjn 206/2010 ...). However, in its judgment of 14\u00a0November 2011, no. 30 Cdo 3340/2011, the Supreme Court added that if in the proceedings concerned the procedure under Article 118 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) has been followed, the application of the possibility to increase compensation is limited by the rules for submitting new facts and modifying the initial action in the proceedings before the court of first instance; the same applies in similar fashion to appeal proceedings (see Article 205a \u00a7 1 and Article 2016 \u00a7 2 of the CCP). Thus, an injured person has to raise an objection about the length of compensation proceedings pending the effects of concentration in the particular proceedings. In the present case, the appellant raised a claim for compensation for the length of the compensation proceedings only in the course of the proceedings before the appellate court, in a submission of 11 April 2012 (file page 128) ... so it was an inadmissible new claim.\u201d",

Inspired by the general principle of de minimis non curat praetor, this admissibility criterion is based on the idea that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative, and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above).",

In such cases, the Court has emphasized that the pure financial loss or the amount of the initial claim involved cannot be taken as the sole indication of a \u201csignificant disadvantage\u201d but the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what was objectively at stake for him ought to be assessed rather in a much more general way, by having regard to all particular circumstances of the given case (see Havelka v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 7332/10, 20\u00a0September 2011, or Shefer v. Russia (dec.), no. 45175/04, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 23, 13 March 2012). In the context of the length-of-proceedings cases, the Court has further considered, that in ascertaining whether the violation of a right attains the minimum level of severity, the following factors, inter alia, should be taken into account: the nature of the right allegedly violated, the seriousness of the impact of the alleged violation on the exercise of a right and/or the possible effects of the violation on the applicant\u2019s personal situation. In assessing these effects, the Court examines, in particular, what was at stake in the proceedings or their outcome (see Giusti v. Italy, no.\u00a013175/03, \u00a7 34, 18 October 2011,and Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a056).",

In the main proceedings no. 18 C 84/2006 (application no.\u00a020708/13), the applicant claimed compensation for an alleged incorrect house search on the grounds that the order for the search had given a different house number than the applicant\u2019s. Moreover, the same complaint has already been examined by the Court, which found it manifestly illfounded on 5 October 2010 (see \u017dirovnick\u00fd v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 7022/06). In the main proceedings no. 5 Ca 176/2004 and 5 Ca 329/2006 (application no. 61245/13) the applicant sought the annulment of imprisonment and prison rules, while in the main proceedings nos.\u00a010\u00a0Ca\u00a010/2005 and 10 Ca 400/2006 (application no. 61482/13) he mainly challenged a reprimand he had been given for taking his cell window out of its frame. In the main proceedings no. 10 C 49/2008 (application no.\u00a022520/14) he complained about the taking of DNA by a cheek swab, but not about storing his DNA profile. His claim was considered as being outside the statutory time-limit and, moreover, the applicant did not then pursue his appeal on points of law and constitutional complaint properly.",

The applicant can therefore still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in the instant case and the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.",

At the same time, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the domestic courts have recently significantly limited the application of that possibility in practice by only allowing for it if plaintiffs raise such a complaint early enough during the proceedings before the court of first instance (see paragraphs 97-99). Having regard to the fact that undue delays in compensation proceedings may well occur only later during proceedings before courts of first instance, or even in the later stages of proceedings, the Court notes that the approach adopted in the most recent Czech cases thwarts the application of such a remedy in many cases.",

That is why, whenever any delays occur in such proceedings, the court determining the amount of compensation should, if the domestic law makes it possible, as Czech law does according to earlier case-law of the Czech superior courts (see paragraphs 94-96), acknowledge its own delays and accordingly award a particularly high amount of compensation. That avoids prolonging the whole case unnecessarily and avoids the applicant having to claim compensation for the length of compensation proceedings in a chain manner, thus burdening the domestic judicial system even more (compare also the Municipal Court\u2019s intention in proceedings no. 27 C 325/2007, at issue in application no.\u00a022455/13, see paragraph 39).",

Unlike the first two amounts, which were supported by evidence, the applicant only explained how the last amount was calculated (on the basis of the number of hours spent by the applicant\u2019s representative on studying the case file and documents, consultations with the applicant and the preparation of observations). The applicant noted that he had no financial resources and that his legal representative had been assigned to him free of charge by a court and the Czech Bar Association with respect to another case; that is why the applicant did not present any invoice or similar document proving the amount of legal costs.",

In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 470 covering the postage and translation expanses. As it has not been provided with any documents to justify the amount claimed by the applicant for legal costs or to elucidate the scope and nature of the applicant\u2019s agreement with his legal representative concerning the proceedings before the Court (see Loboda v. Ukraine, no. 8865/06, \u00a7 62, 17\u00a0November 2016), the Court is unable to establish an amount for those costs and expenses. The claim for legal expenses should therefore be rejected.",
