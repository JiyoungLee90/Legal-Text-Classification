Meetings took place between the parents, social workers, professionals (doctors, police and lawyers) and the directors of the relevant agency. Finally, on the recommendation of the Director of Social Welfare, on 14 July 2005 the Social Policy Minister issued a care order under Article 4 (1) of the Children and Young Persons (Care Orders) Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) placing the two minors, R.D. and A.D., in an institution run by nuns. By a decision of 17\u00a0August 2005, after having heard the first applicant\u2019s objections, the Juvenile Court confirmed the care order. It further solicited the social services to complete the fostering assessment of the maternal grandparents to enable the children to reside with them if it was found to be in their best interest.",

It observed that the care order issued was a permanent one (valid until the minors reached 18 years of age). The Act provided for an objection to the care order to be lodged within twenty-one days of the order being issued, and that such an objection would be dealt with by the Juvenile Court. However, the applicant complained that it was not possible for an individual to request a revision of the order subsequently. The court considered that termination of custody fell under the concept of civil rights, particularly because a care order did not imply the end of natural ties between children and their parents. Consequently, a parent\u2019s right of access to court and to the possibility to regain custody of his or her children was a living right. The court considered that the remedy relied on by the State, namely judicial review proceedings, would not be appropriate in the circumstances. Judicial review was concerned with assessing the decision-making process, but not the merits of a decision itself, as the court would not act as a court of appeal from the body involved. In the event that an administrative decision was quashed the court could only remit the case to the authority for reconsideration, at most requesting the authority to bear in mind the reasons for the quashing. Moreover, the Children and Young Persons Advisory Board (Article 11 of the Act)\u00a0was simply an advisory board subject to the authority and discretion of the Minister. Therefore, it could not be considered an impartial and independent tribunal.\u00a0\u00a0It followed, from an analysis of Maltese law, that there was no remedy granting access\u00a0to court\u00a0for the applicant or anyone in her position seeking re-examination of the merits of a care order.

Moreover, following her conviction, M.D. had lost all authority and rights over her children in view of the automatic application of Article 197 (4) of the Criminal Code and therefore, in the absence of any request to the court for representation of the minors, she could not act on their behalf according to Maltese law (see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below), notwithstanding any different procedure which might be applicable before the European Court of Human Rights. In this light, in relation to the merits of the complaints under Articles 6 and 13, the court considered that in the present case, M.D. having lost all her parental rights as a result of her conviction, could not exercise any right in respect of which she was deprived of access to court. It followed therefore that no violation of Article 6 could ensue. The situation would have been different had the applicant been affected only by the care order (which solely took away the rights relating to care and custody) and not the subsequent conviction. Neither could it be said that any rights under Article 8 came into play, since the applicant had regular contact with her children. However, the first-instance judgment in relation to whether the Act contravened the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights had become final, as no appeal had been lodged in this connection.",

In particular, minors can apply to the Court even, or indeed especially, if they are represented by a mother who is in conflict with the authorities and who criticises their decisions and conduct as not consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the event of a conflict over a minor\u2019s interests between a natural parent and a person appointed by the authorities to act as the child\u2019s guardian, there is a danger that some of those interests will never be brought to the Court\u2019s attention and that the minor will be deprived of effective protection of his or her rights under the Convention. Consequently, even where a mother has been deprived of parental rights - and indeed that is one of the causes of the dispute which she has referred to the Court - her standing as the natural mother suffices to afford her the necessary power to apply to the Court on the child\u2019s behalf too, in order to protect his or her interests. Moreover, the conditions governing individual applications are not necessarily the same as national criteria relating to locus standi. National rules in this respect may serve purposes different from those contemplated by Article 34 of the Convention and, whilst those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be so (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a7 138-39, ECHR 2000-VIII).

The purpose of this rule is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. However, the rule\u00a0of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (Micallef v.  [GC], no.\u00a017056/06, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2009). The Court would emphasise that the application of the rule of exhaustion must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that this rule is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Sammut and Visa Investments v.\u00a0Malta (dec.), no.\u00a027023/03, 28 June 2005, and Saliba and Others v. , no. 20287/10, \u00a7 37, 22 November 2011).",

In this light, the Court considers that even the applicants\u2019 lawyer could have made that request, as could the Minister or the social worker appointed to follow the children, or any other family member or lay person willing to give assistance. However, in the present case, none of these persons made such a request. The mother and the lawyer insisted that the first applicant could indeed represent the children. Given the facts, it is unlikely that the father had the best interests of the children in mind, and in any event he was in prison when the proceedings were instituted. As to the Minister and the social worker, it would not have been realistic to expect them to facilitate the children\u2019s bringing of a complaint which was essentially against the system they represented. Lastly, little is known as to the existence of any other family member. In those circumstances, the domestic courts limited themselves to highlighting that no curator or representative had been appointed to act for the minors, and rejected the children\u2019s standing as parties to those proceedings.",

The Court considers that the position of children under Article 34 calls for careful consideration, as they must generally rely on other persons to present their claims and represent their interests, and may not be of an age or capacity to authorise any steps to be taken on their behalf in any real sense. A restrictive or technical approach in this area is therefore to be avoided and the key consideration in such cases is that any serious issues concerning respect for a child\u2019s rights should be examined (see C. and D. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 34407/02, 31 August 2004, and Tonchev v. , no. 18527/02, \u00a7 31, 19 November 2009).",

That is what the interests of justice and those of the children would have required. Such an action would also be in conformity with the message which the Council of Europe is promoting in this area, particularly in the light of the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Child-Friendly Justice adopted in 2010.",

This right extends only to disputes (\u201ccontestations\u201d) over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise. The outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play (see, for instance, Werner v.

San Marino, no.\u00a032250/08, \u00a7 151, 27 September 2011), it does not preclude that such cases be examined also under Article 6 (see, for example, B. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121, in respect of access rights; H. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, Series A no. 120, in respect of access rights and adoption; and M. and S. v Italy and the United Kingdom, (dec.), no. 2584/11, 13 March 2012, in respect of a taking into public care order). In particular the Court has applied the different safeguards provided by Article 6 in relation to proceedings regarding care orders and their equivalent numerous times (see for example, P., C. and S. v. the , no. 56547/00, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2002VI, in respect of proceedings regarding a care order and a freeing for adoption order, particularly in relation to fair and effective access to a court; Olsson v.  (no. 1), 24\u00a0March 1988, Series A no. 130, \u00a7\u00a7 86-91, regarding the fairness of proceedings requesting the termination of a taking into public care; and R.\u00a0v.\u00a0, no. 34141/96, \u00a7\u00a7 117-120, 30 May 2006, regarding the length of proceedings for the termination of public care). Finally, the Court reiterates that the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other\u2019s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life; furthermore, the natural family relationship is not terminated by reason of the fact that the child has been taken into public care (see Olsson, cited above, \u00a7 59). Thus, an action to contest a care order which deprives a parent of care and custody rights is a matter of family law. On that account alone, it is \u201ccivil\u201d in character (see, mutatis mutandis, Mizzi v. Malta, no. 26111/02, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2006I (extracts)). It is therefore indisputable that a dispute in respect of a care order falls under the civil limb of Article 6.",

Similarly, the  alluded to the same conclusion, although it did not make a finding on that issue (see paragraph 22 above). The Government have not submitted that a judicial remedy existed to challenge a care order during the time it was in force, namely until the minors reached eighteen years of age. Indeed, the Government argued that the courts would not be the right venue for such an assessment. The Court considers that such an argument runs counter to the entire basis of Article 6, which provides for access to an impartial and independent tribunal for the determination of civil rights and obligations. It is precisely a tribunal\u2019s role to supervise administrative action in any field and guarantee freedom from arbitrariness. Moreover, any assessment made by the courts would evidently take into consideration the input given by the relevant actors, such as the social workers in the present case.

This interpretation is further confirmed by the fact that the  had not made any reference to this provision. Nor have the Government submitted any evidence of the provision being used in this context. Bearing in mind that there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Raninen v. , 16\u00a0December 1997, \u00a7 41, Reports 1997-VIII), the Court considers that the first applicant was not required to attempt such a procedure.

The deprivation of parental rights is a particularly far-reaching measure which deprives a parent of his or her family life with the child and is inconsistent with the aim of reuniting them. Such measures should only be applied in exceptional circumstances and can only be justified if they are motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests (see Sabou\u00a0and Pircalab, cited above, \u00a7 47, and, mutatis mutandis, Johansen\u00a0v.\u00a0Norway, 7 August 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 78, Reports 1996III).",

These offences include defilement of minors; inducing persons under age to engage in prostitution; the making of indecent photographs, films, etc., of persons under age; and ill-treatment or neglect of children under twelve years of age, as in the present case. In consequence the Court notes that unlike the case of Sabou and Pircalab, this is not a blanket provision applied to all offences but solely to offences where the offender has any authority or right over the child, victim of the criminal act. Given its limited scope the Court finds the measure under Article 197 (4) both reasonable and necessary and in view of the interests at stake, it cannot be said that in legislating for such a measure the State exceeded its margin of appreciation. Nevertheless, the Court observes that the measure is one which not only affects the parent but also the children and thus should be applied with the highest degree of caution. As mentioned above, the Court notes that the application of Article 197 (4) is automatic and thus it escapes scrutiny by the domestic courts in relation to whether it is in the best interests of the child to apply such a measure at the date of conviction. Indeed, in circumstances where many Contracting States face considerable backlogs in their overburdened justice systems, leading to excessively long proceedings, it cannot be precluded that the situation relevant to an accused may have changed between the date of the commission of the offence and the date of sentencing. While it is true that the Court\u2019s examination is limited in scope to the circumstances of the case before it and that in the present case, the criminal proceedings had been timely, the Court considers that the automatic application of the measure to the applicant without any weighing of the interests of justice and those of the children whose interests are paramount, is of itself problematic.",

Indeed, in the present case this means that the first applicant, whose parental rights were forfeited by a judgment of 2006, when her children were six and four years of age, does not, and will not have the possibility in future to argue for the restoration of her parental rights in the light of a change in her circumstances.",

In other words, it does not follow that because automatic application of the measure constitutes a breach of Article 8, then, once applied, the perpetual application (until the attainment of majority by the child) of it constitutes a breach. Indeed, the facts of the case clearly show that, notwithstanding the application of Article 197(4), access by the first applicant, M.D., to her minor children had gradually increased, meaning that although she may have been deprived of parental authority, she was not deprived of seeing her children, of being with them and of having them residing with her for periods of time. Consequently, in the present case I only see a violation in respect of the automatic application of Article 197(4). Should the application of Article 197(4) be subject to an assessment by a domestic court, then I do not believe that future reviews would be required. The deprivation of parental authority is, vis-\u00e0-vis the parent, an extreme form of punishment, and this will be taken into consideration by a court when making its assessment as to whether such an extreme measure is required in the particular circumstances before it.",
