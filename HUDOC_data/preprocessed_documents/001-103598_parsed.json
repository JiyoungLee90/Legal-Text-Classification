The Committee notes the State party's submission that the author's counsel was provided with a number of official police reports on the case prior to his application for leave to appeal, without specifying their content and relevance to the verdict. The Committee, however, observes that these reports could not have provided guidance as to the motivation of the first instance court in convicting the author of a criminal offence, nor indication on what particular evidence the court had relied. The Committee recalls its established practice that in appellate proceedings guarantees of a fair trial are to be observed, including the right to have adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence. In the circumstances of the instant case, the Committee does not consider that the reports provided, in the absence of a motivated judgment, a trial transcript or even a list of the evidence used, constituted adequate facilities for the preparation of the author's defence.",

The Committee considers this motivation inadequate and insufficient in order to satisfy the conditions of article 14, paragraph 5, of the Covenant, which require a review by a higher tribunal of the conviction and the sentence. Such review, in the frame of a decision regarding a leave to appeal, must be examined on its merits, taking into consideration on the one hand the evidence presented before the first instance judge, and on the other hand the conduct of the trial on the basis of the legal provisions applicable to the case in question.",

It will be sufficient for the Court that the relevant international instruments denote a continuous evolution in the norms and principles applied in international law...\u201d (Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a085-86, 12 November 2008). It may well be that the Demir and Baykara case represents an example of unfortunate drafting and that nothing further beyond the scope of Article 31 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties should be read into it. However, if we were to follow the literal meaning of what the Grand Chamber said, it might suggest that in our case, even though the  has not ratified Protocol No. 7, since it does provide for a leave-to-appeal system of sorts the Chamber should have assessed whether the leave-to-appeal system as such complied with Article\u00a06.

The problem is really in the wording used by the Chamber in the instant case and the Grand Chamber in the Demir and Baykara case concerning the role of non-ratified treaties. I would like to think that what the Grand Chamber meant when it referred to non-ratified treaties was those treaties that some States may not have ratified but that could still indicate the emergence of a universal or regional customary norm. Where the customary rule turns out to be different from the Convention provision, at least in its original form and intent, that rule may indeed affect the subsequent reading of the Convention provision (see M. Villiger, Commentary on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2009, p. 433). Should not the Chamber have tried to assess whether there might be a regional custom as concerns procedural guarantees for the leave to appeal in minor offences cases, and whether any effect might be discerned in relation to the scope of Article 6, especially since the Netherlands provides for the possibility of the leave to appeal and in that sense the difference between the obligations under Article\u00a06 of the Convention and Article 14 of the ICCPR is reduced?",
