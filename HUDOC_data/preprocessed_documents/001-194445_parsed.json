He claimed that, as the then President Saakashvili had been dissatisfied with the editorial policy of Rustavi 2, he had summoned K.K. into his office and ordered him to cede his shares in the company to the two above-mentioned companies, which had been owned by trusted people from the President\u2019s entourage. President Saakashvili had threatened K.K. by saying that the State would create problems for him and his family in the event that he refused to cooperate. Subsequently, K.K. had met with a number of other high-ranking State officials, such as the Minister of the Interior and the Chief Public Prosecutor, and they had all told him to comply with the President\u2019s instruction. Consequently, K.K. had had no other choice but to sell his shares in the company to the other two companies under share-purchase agreements dated 26 December 2005 and 17\u00a0November 2006 for the total price of GEL 571,400 (approximately EUR 214,000). That price, which had been imposed on K.K. by the State, had been far below the actual value of the television channel. In his claim, K.K. thus requested that the impugned agreements be declared null and void ab initio for having been concluded in contravention of legal order and good morals and/or under duress, in accordance with Article 54 and/or 85 of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 183 and 186 below).",

According to Rustavi 2\u2019s journalists, it was only on 24\u00a0September 2015 that the injured person had suddenly been declared a victim and the judge\u2019s mother had been charged with the criminal offence of intentionally occasioning actual serious bodily harm. Interviewed by Rustavi 2\u2019s journalists, the injured party asserted that, to the best of his knowledge, Judge T.U. had tried to assist his mother by using his authority and connections in the immediate aftermath of the incident of 7 January 2014.",

The prosecutorial authority further outlined the reasons for the delay in bringing charges against Judge T.U.\u2019s mother. In particular, the statement explained that the incident had occurred on 7 January 2014, during a family conflict between the woman and her son-in-law, after the former\u2019s daughter (and the latter\u2019s spouse) had died, leaving behind her twelve-year-old child. The investigation had been commenced immediately on the charge of intentional infliction of injury of a less serious nature (Article 118 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). As the offence was classified as a less serious one under domestic legislation, and taking into account the age (seventy-five years old) and state of health of the offender as well as the interests of her grand-daughter, the investigative authorities decided, before charging the woman, to allow time for reconciliation with the victim. Such a procedural move was consistent with the well-established practice of the investigative authorities. However, after it had become clear that the parties had failed to reach reconciliation, the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office proceeded, on 24 September 2015, with bringing charges against Judge T.U.\u2019s mother and granting victim status to her son-in-law. The public statement further clarified that at the material time the investigation had already been concluded and the case was to be transmitted to the Tbilisi City Court for review, which minimised any influence the prosecutor\u2019s office might have on the final outcome.",

In arriving at that conclusion, the judge cited the following. Firstly, he noted that one of the legal grounds for lodging the claim for annulment of the impugned agreements had been Article 85 of the Civil Code on the basis of duress (see paragraphs 75 above). However, the judge observed that the claimant had failed to substantiate duress with sufficient evidence. Thus, although K.K. had lodged the criminal complaints, including that of 1\u00a0December 2008, regarding the loss of his business interests as a result of alleged pressure from the then President of Georgia, the mere fact of lodging those complaints, without the investigation having established any concrete facts, such as the actual use of threats or violence against K.K., could not be taken by the civil courts as proof of duress. Judge T.U. thus concluded that the claimant had failed to discharge the burden of proof.",

In that connection, the judge referred to a State auditor\u2019s expert opinion dated 9 September 2015 which had established that, using an asset-based valuation method (\u10d0\u10e5\u10e2\u10d8\u10d5\u10d4\u10d1\u10d6\u10d4 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e4\u10e3\u10eb\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10db\u10d4\u10d7\u10dd\u10d3\u10d8) the value of Rustavi 2 \u2013 the company as such together with all its assets and liabilities \u2013 in 2005-06 had been approximately GEL 7,322,686 (approximately EUR\u00a02,727,041). However, since the claimant had given up the company under the impugned share-purchase agreements for, overall, as little as GEL\u00a0571,400 (approximately EUR 212,766), that significant price difference itself meant that the contracts contradicted sound reason, ethical and equitable principles and public policy considerations. The judge also stated that the available case-file material did not confirm that even the derisory price stipulated in the impugned purchase agreements \u2013 GEL\u00a0571,400 \u2013 had in actual fact been paid to K.K. by G.-T.

Ltd and H. Ltd had further disposed of those shares in very short periods of time, fourteen days and nine months respectively, at almost the same price for which they had been purchased from K.K. All those circumstances clearly suggested that neither of the two purchasers had ever been genuinely interested in acquiring and running the television company, and moreover that media had never formed part of their ordinary business activities. All in all, and particularly given the manifest difference between the value of the ceded property and the derisory payment received in exchange, the judge concluded that the share-purchase agreements of 26\u00a0December 2005 and 17\u00a0November 2006 had been illusory, entered into in disregard of various public considerations, and were unenforceable under Article 54 of the Civil Code. That being so, those agreements were also void ab initio, which entailed the extinguishment of all possible legal consequences relating to the conclusion of the defective agreements, pursuant to Article 61 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 184 below). In the light of the above factual findings, and noting that there were no specific statutory time-limits in relation to claims concerning ab initio void contracts, the judge decided to apply the general statute of limitations of ten years under Article 128 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Code.",

In that connection, the judge firstly noted that the third applicant, who had always run various businesses with his brother (the fourth applicant), had been the authorised representative of a company which had bought Rustavi\u00a02 from G.-T. Ltd on 1 December 2006, that is to say only fourteen days after G.-T. Ltd had obtained the property from K.K. (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). In other words, the third and fourth applicants had known about the derisory price for which K.K. had given up the television company, and thus should have realised that they had been acquiring property which had been clearly tainted. In that regard, the judge relied on Article 187 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code, in accordance with which a third-party acquirer of movable property, such as shares in the company, could not be considered a bona fide owner if the property in question had been misappropriated from the original owner. In his reasoning, Judge T.U. also referred to the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008 as well as the follow-up criminal complaints lodged by K.K. with the Chief Public Prosecutors Office in 2008-09, by which the latter had brought the authorities\u2019 attention to the wrongful acts committed against him. The judge considered that the existence of those criminal complaints should have rebutted the presumption of regularity of any subsequent transfers of Rustavi 2 shares in the eyes of the relevant domestic authorities.",

The judge had not elaborated on why it had not been possible to proceed with an examination of the property dispute on the merits without applying such drastic measures against the television company and its owners. The applicants complained of the disproportionate and sweeping nature of the interim measures applied, measures which had clearly interfered with their property interests. They feared that the actual result of the impugned measures would be the opposite of what the first-instance judge had allegedly pursued. Without being able to manage its various movable and immovable assets freely and fully, the television company could suffer serious financial setbacks, which would have an adverse impact on its ability to perform its media activities with the requisite independence. In that connection, the applicants specified certain particular aspects of doing business in the media sector, such as, for instance, the seasonality of media production, which created the need for maintaining permanent access to the banking sector. Citing the relevant case-law of the Constitutional Court of Georgia and the Strasbourg Court, all four applicants referred to both the company\u2019s various proprietary interests as well as the first applicant\u2019s right to impart information under Article 10 of the Convention.",

Thus, it was not necessary to address the necessity of the applied interim measures from the standpoint of preponderance of evidence. Rather, in the appellate court\u2019s view, it was sufficient to establish that a prima facie situation existed militating in favour of an interim measure. In that connection, the Court of Appeal referred to the history of numerous transfers of Rustavi 2 shares from one private party to another within very short periods of time (see paragraphs 10-28 above). Given the ease with which the television company had changed hands in the past, there was a prima facie risk that another change in ownership could occur whilst the proceedings on the merits were still ongoing, something which would unduly thwart the execution of a final court decision. It stated that the legitimate aim pursued by the interim injunction of 5 August 2015 had been the need to avoid the creation of any new barriers to the enforcement of a final court decision in the future.",

That particular restriction, which did not have any relevance to the legitimate aim pursued, ought therefore to be lifted, and the television company would be allowed to rent a number of its assets for a limited but renewable period of time (thus rental contracts should not exceed three months).",

Specifically, in so far as Judge M.T. was concerned, the Grand Chamber stated that the applicants had failed to explain what the link between the judge\u2019s personal experience and the subject-matter of the ownership dispute had been. As regards the President of the Supreme Court, the Grand Chamber firstly stated that, although N.Gv. had brought disciplinary charges against her back in 2006, this fact was irrelevant because he had not been party to the ownership dispute in question. The Grand Chamber also emphasised that the President of the Supreme Court had not examined the ownership dispute as single-judge but as a member of the collegial body composed of nine judges. The court then stated that the applicants had not presented any proof capable of showing that the President had expressed any negative statements or attitudes in respect of N.Gv. in relation to the events that had occurred more than a decade previously. The Grand Chamber further attached significance to the fact that, although the disciplinary proceedings had resulted in the President\u2019s dismissal from her previous judicial post back in 2006, that disciplinary record had already been irrevocably erased and she had been able to obtain re-election to the highest judicial office in the country. These positive developments in her career further diminished the risk of the President\u2019s feeling personal animosity towards N.Gv. owing to the past and by that time completed and irrelevant dealings.",

Indeed, the essence of K.K.\u2019s civil claim was proving that he had been coerced into giving up the television channel by signing the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17\u00a0November 2006 because of threats from high-ranking State officials, such as the President of Georgia, the Minister of the Interior and the Chief Public Prosecutor. The Supreme Court stated that examining the ownership dispute through the lens of Article 85 of the Civil Code did not involve a need for establishment of any new factual findings. On the contrary, the cassation instance specified, by reference to its previous case-law, that \u201cduress was not a matter of fact but of legal evaluation\u201d, stating that \u201cthe lower courts had erred in their legal evaluation of the factual description of duress.\u201d",

In K.K.\u2019s case, since the duress had been the pressure exerted upon him by high-ranking State officials of the former UNM government, such a situation had lasted until the change in the ruling forces brought about by the results of the parliamentary election of October 2012. However, even prior to the change in the ruling forces, a fact which could have triggered the running of a statutory limitation period of one year under Article\u00a089 of the Civil Code, K.K. had already exercised his right to repudiate as void the relevant share-purchase agreements by lodging a criminal complaint on 1 December 2008 regarding the misappropriation of his property by high-ranking State officials.",

The Supreme Court specified that such a right to request the lifting ex post factum was not subject to any time-limit and could be exercised at any moment. It further stated that any such application for the lifting of the interim measure ex post factum had to be lodged with the court in accordance with Article 197(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, that is to say in accordance with the rules regulating interlocutory complaints (paragraph 15 in fine of the decision). In particular, the person who had ceased to be a respondent in the civil case had to lodge an interlocutory complaint first with the court that had omitted to lift the injunction measure, the addressed court then ought to take a decision on the lifting application, and only then could that decision be appealed to a higher court under Articles 197(1) \u00a7 4, 419 and 420 of the Code.

Everything from his or her associations or business interests to remarks which the judge may consider to be \u2018harmless banter\u2019 may diminish the judge\u2019s perceived impartiality. All partisan political activity and association should cease upon the assumption of judicial office. Partisan political activity or out of court statements concerning issues of a partisan public controversy by a judge may undermine impartiality. They may lead to public confusion about the nature of the relationship between the judiciary on the one hand and the executive and legislative branches on the other. Partisan actions and statements, by definition, involve a judge in publicly choosing one side of a debate over another. The perception of partiality will be reinforced if, as is almost inevitable, the judge\u2019s activities attract criticism and/or rebuttal. In short, a judge who uses the privileged platform of judicial office to enter the partisan political arena puts at risk public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary. There are some exceptions. These include comments by a judge on an appropriate occasion defensive of the judicial institution, or explaining particular issues of law or decisions to the community or to a specialized audience, or defence of fundamental human rights and the rule of law. However, even on such occasions, a judge must be careful, as far as possible, to avoid entanglements in current controversies that may reasonably be seen as politically partisan. The judge serves all people, regardless of politics or social viewpoints. That is why the judge must endeavour to maintain the trust and confidence of all people, so far as that is reasonably possible. ...",

In judicial matters, the test for conflict of interest must include both actual conflicts between the judge\u2019s self-interest and the duty of impartial adjudication and circumstances in which a reasonable observer would (or might) reasonably apprehend a conflict.

The wording of Article\u00a034 indicates that a \u201cclaim\u201d or complaint in Convention terms comprises two elements, namely factual allegations and the legal arguments underpinning them. These two elements are intertwined because the facts complained of ought to be seen in the light of the legal arguments adduced and vice versa. An illustration of this intrinsic link between the factual and legal components of a complaint may\u00a0be found in the Rules of Court. Thus, Rule\u00a047 \u00a7 1\u00a0(e) and\u00a0(f) of the Rules of Court provides that all applications must contain, amongst other things, a concise and legible statement of the facts and of the alleged violation(s) of the Convention and the relevant arguments.

Thus, it is evident that the first applicant made its various complaints in relation to the injunction proceedings, whilst the second to fourth applicants, the owners of Rustavi 2, called into question the ownership dispute.

Thus, whilst the first applicant had called into question the injunction order of 5 August 2015, in so far as that order had frozen its various assets, the final domestic decision in that connection had been, as a matter of domestic civil procedure (see Articles\u00a0197(1) and 419 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cited in paragraphs 196 and 200 above), the Tbilisi Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 20\u00a0November 2015. That decision had finally upheld the contested injunction order. Questions relating to interim injunctions were examined only at two levels of jurisdiction, and the decision of the second and thus highest level of jurisdiction in the injunction proceedings was final and binding. The Government emphasised that that approach had been consistently restated and maintained by the Supreme Court in its case-law (see paragraphs 204, 206-07, 210 and 215 above). As regards the application of 17\u00a0November 2016 that the first applicant, together with the other three applicants, had lodged with the Supreme Court under Articles\u00a0196 and 199(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph\u00a0148 above), that course of action had been an inappropriate legal remedy and thus could not have stopped the running of the six-month period. In particular, the Government submitted that whilst the use of those legal provisions had been reserved only for actual parties to the proceedings, the first applicant had irrevocably lost its standing as a corespondent on 7\u00a0June 2016, when the judgment of 3\u00a0November 2015 in its part concerning the first applicant had become final upon its confirmation by the appellate instance. The first applicant had itself acknowledged at the domestic level losing its standing as a party (see paragraph 149 above). The Government argued that, under Article 83 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only actual parties to the proceedings could lodge applications with the domestic courts. The Government emphasised that, after the first applicant had ceased to be a co-respondent, it had not applied to become involved in the proceedings as a third party, under Articles 88-92 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In that connection, the Government brought the Court\u2019s attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 18 May 2018 (case no. 194-194-2018), which clearly stated that no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure could be construed to confer upon individuals and legal entities the right to address a domestic court without complying with the basic procedural requirements of access (see paragraph 216 above).",

They submitted in that connection that the contested injunction had concerned all respondents to the dispute, not just the first applicant. The imposed interim measures had thus been necessary in their totality because, even after the first applicant had ceased to be a co-respondent, the ownership dispute had continued with respect to the second, third and fourth applicants, the owners of the first applicant. That being so, the value of shares held by the owners of the company would have been at risk of diminishing and even disappearing if the company had been allowed to enter into various legal relationships as a separate legal entity. As regards the first applicant\u2019s reference to Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 257\u00a0below), the Government reiterated that the wording of that provision made it clear that it could be relied on only by actual parties to the proceedings \u2013 either a claimant, a respondent or a third party with or without an independent claim (see their argument in paragraph 253 above). The Government also emphasised that, in the light of all the above-mentioned procedural shortcomings, the first applicant\u2019s application of 17\u00a0November 2016, which had represented an inappropriate legal remedy, had not been examined on the merits by the Supreme Court (see paragraph\u00a0151 above). In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Government concluded that first applicant\u2019s application of 17 November 2016 had represented a mere attempt to stop the running of the six-month time-limit which had otherwise started from the delivery of the Tbilisi City Court\u2019s decision of 20 November 2015, the final decision, within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, with respect to the injunction proceedings. Since the first applicant had lodged its complaints about the injunction proceedings as late as 3 March 2017, the relevant part of the application had clearly been lodged out of time.",

In particular, if the first applicant had considered that the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had become unlawful after it had lost the standing of a co-respondent on 7\u00a0June 2016, it should have lodged an interlocutory appeal under Articles 41420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, requesting the lifting of the injunction by reference to Article 199(1) of the same Code. As regards the first applicant\u2019s application of 17 November 2016, the Government emphasised that, apart from lacking the relevant standing for lodging such an application, Rustavi\u00a02 had addressed the impugned application to the wholly inappropriate domestic court. Thus, it had lodged the application with the Supreme Court, whilst the rules on lodging interlocutory appeals had made it crystal clear that such appeals should first be lodged with the court which had allegedly committed the alleged procedural breach. In particular, if the first applicant had considered that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal had omitted to discontinue the injunction measure after the termination of the copyright proceedings, the application for lifting the injunction order on the basis of Article 199(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure should first have been lodged with the latter court in accordance with the procedure on interlocutory appeals. In support of that argument, the Government invited the Court to take note of the relevant judicial practice of the Supreme Court. In particular in its decision of 29 December 2016 (case no. AS-806-773-2016), a copy of which has been submitted to the Court by the applicants\u00a0(see paragraphs\u00a0207 and 208 above), the Supreme Court stated that an application for the lifting of the interim measure made on the basis of Article\u00a0199(1) ought to be lodged with the competent court and examined under Article 197(1), 419 and 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the provisions that regulated the procedure for lodging interlocutory appeals.",

However, the first applicant argued that the six-month time-limit should not be calculated from the final decision of 20 November 2015 because there had been two further possibilities for calling into question the injunction order of 5 August 2015. In particular, the first applicant referred to Articles\u00a0196 and 199(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the two provisions that constituted the legal grounds for its application of 17 November 2016 lodged with the Supreme Court. As regards Article 196, the first applicant claimed that by virtue of that provision any entity or individual subject to an injunction \u2013 whether it was a claimant, respondent, third person or just an affected person without the status of a party to the proceedings \u2013 could apply for that interim measure to be replaced with another one. The first applicant emphasised, by reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 13\u00a0November 2012 concerning civil case no. AS-1185-1114-2012 (see paragraph\u00a0209 above), that the right to lodge an application under Article\u00a0196 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not constrained by any timelimits and depended only on a change of circumstances in the case at hand. The absence of any time-limits in that regard was conditioned by the fact that it was not possible to foresee when exactly negative consequences of the imposed injunction measure might occur.",

Since that court had failed to do so, the first applicant had been allowed to lodge under Article 1991 an appeal against the final appellate decision of 20 November 2015 with the highest judicial instance, the Supreme Court. In that connection, the first applicant claimed that the relevant domestic law and practice did not oblige it to lodge its application for the replacement or lifting of the interim measure under the procedure reserved for interlocutory appeals (whereby an appeal was first lodged with the same court that had issued a ruling negatively affecting the party\u2019s rights or interests). The first applicant also asserted that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of 7 June 2016 had not been served on it. In the light of these circumstances, the first applicant claimed that it had been entitled to address its application of 17 November 2016 directly to the Supreme Court. The first applicant also stated that the exercise of the right under Article\u00a0199(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, similarly to that under Article\u00a0196, was not subject to any statutory limits, and therefore its application of 17\u00a0November 2016 could not be said to have been timebarred.",

In addition, the first applicant referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 13 May 2016 in case no. AS-277-263-2016 to prove that under domestic law it was open even for a person not constituting a party to the civil proceedings to challenge an interim measure affecting his/her/its rights (see paragraph\u00a0203 above). As regards the possibility of getting involved in the proceedings in the capacity of a third party, under Articles 88-92 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 195 above) the first applicant claimed that lodging an application for obtaining such a procedural status would have been a futile exercise. What mattered, in the first applicant\u2019s opinion, was the fact that the Supreme Court had, in actual fact, examined its application of 17\u00a0November 2016 on the merits, without acknowledging the existence of any procedural deficiency (see paragraph 151 above). In any event, the first applicant also suggested that the freezing of its various assets by virtue of the injunction order of 5 August 2015 had been a continuing situation that had uninterruptedly lasted from the date of its application until 2\u00a0March 2017, the date of the delivery by the Supreme Court of its ruling on the injunction matter and of the final judgment on the merits of the ownership dispute.",

Since the core of the alleged violations was the imposition of the above-mentioned injunction order by the first-instance court, the first question that needs to be answered is what constituted the final domestic decision in the injunction proceedings at stake. The answer to this question is straightforward, as the relevant domestic law makes it clear that the proceedings relating to injunction measures are conducted at two levels of jurisdiction only, with the second, and the highest, instance delivering, under the procedure reserved for interlocutory appeals, final decisions on the matter (see Articles 197(1) and 419 \u00a7 3 of the CCP, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s relevant practice, cited in paragraphs 204, 206-7, 210 and\u00a0215 above). This was not even disputed by the first applicant (see paragraph\u00a0257 above). Consequently, it was the Tbilisi Court of Appeal\u2019s decision of 20\u00a0November 2015, which finally upheld the disputed injunction order of 5\u00a0August 2015 and stated that no further appeal lay (see paragraph\u00a0128 above), which represented the final domestic decision within the meaning of Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0of the Convention.",

The Court considers that this argument is ill-founded in the light of its relevant case-law, since, whenever the alleged violation of a Convention right is caused by a particular event produced at a particular time (the delivery of a court decision or other written legal act being a vivid example), the legal consequences of such an event, which may even stretch over significant time, do not qualify as \u201ca continuing situation\u201d for the purposes of the calculation of the six-month rule contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, amongst many other authorities, C\u0103lin and Others v.\u00a0Romania, nos. 25057/11 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60, 19 July 2016; Posti and\u00a0Rahko v.

In this regard, the Court observes that the rule on exhaustion requires, under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that the only remedies to be exhausted are those that are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). However, an applicant is not obliged to have recourse to remedies that are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 67, Reports 1996IV), and the pursuit of such remedies will unavoidably have consequences for the identification of the \u201cfinal decision\u201d and, correspondingly, for the calculation of the starting point for the running of the six-month rule (compare, for example, Prystavska v.

Notably, the parties have exchanged their views on whether, after it had ceased to be a co-respondent, the first applicant was still entitled to lodge an application under those two provisions. The Court observes that, even assuming that the first applicant had had the requisite standing for lodging such an application, it is clear, as a matter of relevant domestic law and practice, that this application ought to have been lodged in accordance with Articles\u00a0197(1), 419 and 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that is to say in accordance with the rules governing the examination of interlocutory appeals. Indeed, examination of the Supreme Court\u2019s practice, including the decisions submitted by the first applicant itself, consistently demonstrates that applications for changing or lifting of injunction measures were identical, in so far as their processing was concerned, to interlocutory appeals (see paragraphs\u00a0206, 208, 209-12 and 217 above). Processing of an interlocutory appeal in accordance with Articles 197(1), 419 and 420 of the Code meant, in its turn, that such an appeal should first be lodged with the court that had allegedly breached the party\u2019s procedural rights and interests.",

In other words, the Court notes that the only procedurally appropriate manner of lodging an application under Articles 196 and/or 1991 of that Code would have been for the first applicant to lodge an interlocutory appeal with the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, the very same court that had allegedly failed to lift the disputed injunctions after it had terminated the main proceedings in relation to this particular applicant. Since the first applicant did not do so, it can be concluded that it failed to use the claimed remedies in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law, as interpreted and applied by domestic courts. The latter finding automatically renders the first applicant\u2019s procedurally defective application of 17 November 2016 immaterial for the purposes of the calculation of the six-month rule (compare, for instance, Rezgui v.

The Court observes that, as acknowledged by the first applicant and confirmed by the judicial practice, the lodging of an application under either of the two above-mentioned provisions was not subject to any time-limits. However, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law, according to which remedies that have no precise time-limits, thus creating uncertainty and rendering nugatory the six-month rule contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, are not effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(see, amongst many other authorities, Galstyan v.\u00a0Armenia, no. \u00a06986/03, \u00a7 39, 15 November 2007; Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.) no. 32567/06, 17 February 2009; Kolu v.

Secondly, the first applicant also argued that it had not been obliged to request involvement as a third party because such an application would have been doomed, in its view, to failure. In particular, the first applicant argued that Article 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure \u2013 the provision setting down the framework for involvement of a third party without an independent claim \u2013 could hardly have applied in its situation because it had been unable to claim, within the meaning of the wording of that domestic provision, that the outcome of the ownership dispute could have affected its civil rights and responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis either the claimant, K.K., or the respondents, the second to fourth applicants.",

The first applicant, the company, was rather the object of the ownership dispute between the claimant and the respondents, the second to fourth applicants. The Court also observes that the first applicant acknowledged itself that its rights and legal interests had been represented by the second to fourth applicants at the domestic level. What is more, the same three applicants, in their capacity as the owners of the first applicant, have continued to voice the latter\u2019s interests before this Court as well (see paragraph 279 below). In other words, the first applicant cannot possibly claim to possess any independent and unprotected interest in relation to the ownership dispute.

In particular, referring to the relevant circumstances of the case, they submitted that, in actual fact, the ownership dispute had been examined along the lines of both Article 54 and Article 85 of the Civil Code by the first and the appellate instances. The second to fourth applicants had thus had ample opportunity to set out and explain their position with respect to both legal grounds before the lower levels of jurisdiction. In such circumstances, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to apply Article 85 of the Civil Code to the circumstances of the case had not been a novelty introduced at the final stage. There had not been any unfairness to the second to fourth applicants arising from the lack of an oral hearing before the Supreme Court either. The Government argued that the power of the Supreme Court to dispense with such a hearing in an appeal on points of law did not infringe Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention in view of the fact that at that instance only questions of law were examined. The Government further argued that the fact that the second applicant had been able to submit an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, whereas the opponent, K.K., had not submitted any comments in reply (see paragraph 158 above), had placed the relevant applicants in a more advantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis their opponent.",

Referring to the second to fourth applicants\u2019 specific grievances in a more detailed manner, the Government asked the Court to attach significance to the fact that the Supreme Court had addressed their arguments concerning the statute of limitations, giving cogent and reasoned answers that had bases in the relevant domestic law and practice. In particular, the Supreme Court had provided a clear and sufficient explanation as to why the application of Article 85 of the Civil Code to the circumstances of the present case had not been time-barred under the statute of limitations provided for in Article 89\u00a0of the Civil Code, as lex specialis, and alternatively, under Article 1008\u00a0of the same Code (see paragraphs 166-68 above).",

The second to fourth applicants also objected to the reference by the Supreme Court to the time-limit contained in Article 1008 of the Civil Code because the latter provision had been completely irrelevant for the purposes of examining the question of duress in contractual relations. The Supreme Court had also failed, in the second to fourth applicants\u2019 opinion, to sufficiently explain which pieces of evidence had established, on the balance of probabilities, the fact that K.K. had been coerced into signing the share-purchase agreements of 26 December 2005 and 17 November 2006.

In particular, amongst other statements, the legal commentary submitted by the applicants contained a statement, which was not supported by reference to judicial practice, that the lodging of a criminal complaint could not lead to the exercise of the right to void a contract within the meaning of Article 89.",

Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, \u00a7\u00a061, 5\u00a0February 2015). Thus, it is wholly immaterial from the standpoint of the Convention whether the Supreme Court could, pursuant to domestic law, quash the decision of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal and to deliver the final ruling of 2 March 2017 on the dispute without remitting the case for reconsideration to the lower courts. That being said, the Court cannot but note that there was nothing unusual in the Supreme Court overruling the decision of the appellate court and delivering, in the capacity of the final, cassation instance, the final decision on the civil dispute at hand (see, in particular, Article 411 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cited in paragraph\u00a0199 above; and compare, for instance, G.S. v.

In that connection, the only relevant assertion that the three applicants have voiced before the Court is their reference to the alleged change in approach at the last, cassation level of the proceedings with respect to the judicial examination (see paragraph\u00a0285 above). The Court does not exclude that, in principle, a sudden change in the judicial examination at the highest and last level of jurisdiction might, under certain circumstances, place an applicant at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his or her opponent as regards the opportunity to present legal arguments with a view of influencing the relevant highest court (see, mutatis mutandis, S\u00fasanna R\u00f3s Westlund v.\u00a0Iceland, no.\u00a042628/04, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 6 December 2007). It should also be borne in mind that the judges of the Supreme Court were expected to themselves respect the principle of adversarial proceedings when they decided to apply Article\u00a085 of the Civil Code to the ownership dispute (see, for instance, Clinique des Acacias and Others v. France, nos. 65399/01 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a038, 13\u00a0October 2005, and Skondrianos v. Greece, nos. 63000/00 and\u00a02\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029-30, 18\u00a0December 2003).",

On the contrary, it was clear from both the legal grounds mentioned in K.K.\u2019s civil action of 4\u00a0August 2015 and the reasons contained in the decisions of the first-instance and appellate courts, that Article 85 of the Civil Code had been constantly discussed throughout the proceedings. The second to fourth applicants had had ample opportunity to submit their arguments with respect to Article 85 before the domestic courts, and both the first-instance and the appellate court had given due consideration to Article 85 of the Civil Code in their respective decisions (see paragraphs 75, 81, 110-11 and\u00a0145 above).The Court attaches particular importance to the fact that the second to fourth applicants argued, in their initial statement of defence made before the first-instance court, that it was not Article 54 but rather Articles\u00a08589 of the Civil Code which should have been held applicable to the circumstances of the ownership dispute (see paragraph 82 above). Against this background, when the three applicants themselves insisted that the case ought to be examined under Article 85 of the Civil Code, the Court finds it striking that they now reproach the Supreme Court for applying that legal provision.",

Both sides were equal in their opportunity to make written submissions, and neither of them was obviously able to adduce any new factual evidence during the appeal-on-points-of-law proceedings (contrast S\u00fasanna R\u00f3s Westlund, cited above, \u00a7 71). If anything, it might even be considered that the second to fourth applicants were placed in a procedurally more advantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis their opponent given that it was only them, and not their opponent, who were able to file with the Supreme Court an amicus brief addressing, amongst other legal issues, Article 85 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 158 above). As regards the second to fourth applicants\u2019 complaint that they did not address Article\u00a085 of the Civil Code in their appeal on points of law, the Court does not see how that fact could be held imputable to the Supreme Court. The applicants knew or should have known that Article 85, together with Article\u00a054, had been invoked by the claimant, K.K., and that both the first-instance and the appellate courts had addressed that legal provision in their decisions. If, despite the above-mentioned circumstances, the applicants decided not to address Article 85 in their appeal on points of law, that was caused either by their omission or tactical choice, and, in either scenario, they should assume the legal consequences of their approach to present the case before the Supreme Court (compare, mutatis mutandis, Roberts and Roberts v.\u00a0the\u00a0United Kingdom (dec.), no. 38681/08, \u00a7 37, 5\u00a0July 2011).",

In essence, the Supreme Court, having regard to the submissions of both parties in the case file, did nothing else but clarify a point of law and, in the light of that clarification, accepted the argument of duress that had been made by the claimant and contested by the second to fourth applicants from the very beginning to the end of the proceedings. Consequently, it cannot be said that the principles of the equality of arms or the adversarial nature of proceedings were infringed (compare with the very similar situation in APBP v. France, no. 38436/97, \u00a7\u00a7 30-34, 21 March 2002). In the light of the latter conclusion, the fact that the Supreme Court dispensed with an oral hearing in the present case cannot raise any arguable issue under Article 6\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention. The cassation instance was fully capable of properly reviewing the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of the pertinent legal provisions on the sole basis of the parties\u2019 written submissions and other material in the case file, especially since numerous oral hearing had been held with the participation of both parties before the two lower courts (see, as the leading authority on this country-specific matter, Rizhamadze v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 2745/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37-40, 31 July 2007, and Gogoladze v.

The requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 as regards cases concerning civil rights are thus less onerous than they are for criminal charges (see, as a recent authority, Bartaia v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 10978/06, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 32, 26 July 2018; see also K\u00f6nig v.\u00a0Germany, no. 6232/73, \u00a7 96, 28 June 1978). Furthermore, according to its long-standing and established case-law, it is not for this Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where it can, exceptionally, be said that they are constitutive of \u201cunfairness\u201d incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention. While this provision guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to given items of evidence or to findings or assessments in issue before them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth instance and will not therefore question under Article 6 \u00a7 1 the judgment of the national courts, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. According to the thinking underlying the notion of \u201ca manifest error of assessment\u201d (une erreur manifeste d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation \u2013 a concept of French administrative law), as used in the context of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, if the error of law or fact by the national court is so blatantly evident that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, no reasonable court could ever have made it, this manifest error may disturb the fairness of the proceedings (compare, for instance, Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a022251/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061-62, ECHR 2015, and the other authorities cited therein).",

In its judgment of 2 March 2017, the Supreme Court concluded that the time-limit mentioned in Article 89\u00a0specifically applied to the circumstances of the case in conjunction with Article 85. Indeed, the Supreme Court found that K.K. had been in a continuing situation of duress until the parliamentary election of October 2012, which had led to the change of the ruling power in the country. The cassation instance then cited Article 138 of the Civil Code, which deals with the general rule on interruption of the running of time-limits. In that connection, the Supreme Court found that by lodging the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008, K.K. had interrupted, within the meaning of Article 138, the running of the statutory time-limit under Article 89. In addition to its analysis of the situation under Article 89 of the Civil Code, the Supreme Court also noted that the act of duress was so blatant that it could be considered a civil tort, and under Article 1008 of the Civil Code the time-limit for claiming damages in respect of a tort was three years. That being so, the Supreme Court developed an alternative line of reasoning, stating that, even if the situation were to be considered as a tort, the three-year limitation period under Article 1008 would still have been interrupted, within the meaning of Article 138 of the Civil Code by the lodging of the criminal complaint of 1 December 2008. In short, the same result \u2013 interruption of the statutory time-limit even before the situation constitutive of either duress or tort had ceased to pertain \u2013 would have been reached irrespective of whether the time-limit of one year under Article\u00a089 and or the time-limit of three years under Article 1008 of the Civil Code had been applied.",

Of particular interest was the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 15 March 2002 delivered in case no. 3/1186-01, in the light of which it cannot be said that the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of 2\u00a0March 2017 was inconsistent with previous domestic case-law.

In the light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that the Supreme Court either circumvented the one-year time-limit applicable under Article 89 of the Civil Code to the situation of duress or erred in interpreting the relevant domestic law by ruling that the relevant time-limit had been interrupted under Article 138 of the Civil Code (contrast, for instance, An\u0111elkovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Serbia, no. 1401/08, \u00a7 27, 9 April 2013).",

The second to fourth applicants\u2019 only response to K.K.\u2019s reference to that complaint was that \u201cthe mere fact of lodging a criminal complaint ... was not sufficient to turn the allegation of coercion into an established fact ...\u201d (see paragraph 81 above). It should also be noted that the civil case file had contained a copy of the two follow-up criminal complaints lodged by K.K. on 28 January and 12 March 2009, which documents had reproduced the content of the criminal complaint of 1\u00a0December 2008. Furthermore, the fact that K.K. had lodged the criminal complaint on 1 December 2008 had apparently been a matter of public knowledge, because it had been well documented in the Georgian Public Defender\u2019s annual report of 2008 as well as in the report of the US Department of State concerning the property row over Rustavi 2 (see paragraphs 222 and 223 above).

The Court further observes that with respect to Judge N.G. of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal the second to fourth applicants raised two independent grievances \u2013 the first one concerning her alleged proximity to Judge T.U. and the second one related to the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against her. The Court further notes that the Government objected to the admissibility of some of those complaints only. Specifically, they objected to the complaint calling into question the independence and impartiality of Judge N.G. on the grounds of the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings against her, and to the complaint relating to Judge Sh.K.",

Turkey (dec.), no. 30500/96, 1\u00a0June 1999). Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the second to fourth applicants\u2019 applications for the recusal of Judge N.G., in so far as the disciplinary proceedings against the latter were concerned, and Judge Sh.K., were left without examination owing to the applicants\u2019 failure to comply with the relevant procedural requirements. Specifically, whilst Article 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure \u2013\u00a0\u00a0the provision setting out the formal rules for lodging recusal applications \u2013\u00a0\u00a0imperatively stated that such applications must be made in writing and, at the very latest, before the parties have exchanged their last oral arguments, the second to fourth applicants had already, as a matter of fact, applied after the exchange of the parties\u2019 pleadings, on 7 and 9 June 2016 (see paragraphs\u00a0141 and 142 above).The applicants did not convincingly explain to the domestic courts why they had waited so long before applying. On the other hand, the Court notes that, according to the material available in the case file, the applicants knew or should have known about the facts on which they grounded their recusal applications much earlier. Thus, with respect to Judge Sh.K., the applicants should have known of that particular judge\u2019s specialisation in criminal law as early as 27 April 2016 (see paragraph 138 above), whilst, as regards the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings against Judge N.G., they should have known of that fact by 1\u00a0June 2016 at the latest, when the Director General of Rustavi 2 had mentioned that fact during the press conference (see paragraphs 139 above). The Court takes note of the second applicant\u2019s claim that it was 3 June 2016 when it applied for the recusal of Judge N.G. on account of the disciplinary proceedings for the first time (see paragraph 287 above). However, whilst that applicant did not submit a proof of its assertion, the available case-file material clearly shows that the first time the second applicant lodged a signed written application for recusal of the mentioned judge on the relevant grounds was 7\u00a0June 2016 (see paragraph 141 above).",

This, in the Court\u2019s view, is equally true when requests for recusal of domestic judges are concerned (see, for instance, Yasar, cited above). That being so, the Court finds that, in the light of the second to fourth applicants\u2019 failure to voice, in compliance with the formal requirements contained in Article 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure, their challenges to Judge Sh.K. and to Judge N.G. (in so far as the fact of the disciplinary proceedings was at stake), the relevant part of their complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention must be rejected pursuant to Article\u00a035 \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01 and\u00a04 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In particular, the mere fact that the State, through its judicial system, provided a forum for the determination of such a private-law dispute does not give rise to an interference by the State with property rights under Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 (see, for example, Kucha\u0159 and \u0160tis v. the Czech Republic\u00a0(dec.), no.\u00a037527/97, 21 October 1998).The State may be held responsible for losses caused by such determinations if court decisions are not given in accordance with domestic law or if they are flawed by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness contrary to Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No. 1 (see, for example, Vulakh and Others v.

However, it should be borne in mind that the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited, and it is not its function to take the place of the national courts. Rather, the Court\u2019s role is to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not arbitrary or otherwise manifestly unreasonable (see, for example, Anheuser-Busch Inc. v.

In so far as the applicability of Article 18 is at stake, the Court confirmed in that landmark case that this provision cannot have an independent existence. It can only be applied in conjunction with an Article of the Convention or the Protocols thereto which sets out or qualifies the rights and freedoms that the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to secure to those under their jurisdiction. Whilst there can be a breach of Article 18 even if there is no breach of the Article in conjunction with which it applies, a breach of the former provision can only arise if the right or freedom at issue is subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention, (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 287 and 290).",

In other words, the issue is whether the rights and freedoms protected by the latter provision are subject to permissible restrictions. It should be noted in this connection that in the case of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, (no. 14902/04, \u00a7\u00a7 263-66, 20 September 2011) the Court, without giving a definitive answer to the question of whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was prone to permissible restrictions, implicitly accepted that Article 18 of the Convention can, in principle, be brought to bear in conjunction with the former provision. However, the problem in the case at hand is that the second to fourth applicants\u2019 reference to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was manifestly ill-founded. With the Court\u2019s having been unable to establish the existence of an interference by the State with the relevant applicants\u2019 property interests (see paragraphs 310-12 above), Article 1 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 cannot be said to have ever been engaged. This is what distinguishes the present case from that of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, where the Court accepted that there had been multiple instances of interference with the applicant company\u2019s property rights and proceeded to the examination of the merits of the relevant complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, reaching the findings of both violations and non-violations of the substantive provision (compare OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 558, 563-75, 588-607 and 664).",

In support of their assertions, the three applicants firstly averred that the examination of the case had started with \u201cforum shopping\u201d. They asserted in that regard that, being aware that Judge\u00a0T.U. had been the only civil judge specialising in intellectual-property disputes on duty at the Tbilisi City Court, K.K. had artificially included in his action a clearly unmeritorious copyright claim. Secondly, the second to fourth applicants referred to the fact that Judge T.U.\u2019s mother had been accused of a criminal offence. They argued that, from the perspective of an objective observer, it looked questionable that the criminal investigation had been revived and the charge formally preferred against that woman twenty months after the relevant incident (see paragraph 97 above). Those dubious circumstances might lead the public to think that, by renewing the criminal case against the judge\u2019s mother after such an inexplicable delay, which coincided with the commencement of the examination of the Rustavi\u00a02 ownership dispute, the authorities had wished to obtain leverage over the examining judge. The fact that Judge T.U.\u2019s mother had eventually been convicted had not detracted from the way in which the State had used those criminal proceedings against her as a way of exerting pressure on the judge. Thirdly, the second to fourth applicants referred to the Facebook posts made by Judge T.U.\u2019s wife on 7\u00a0July, 13 August and 2 October 2015, complaining that those posts contained negative views of Rustavi 2. With such biased attitudes held by the judge\u2019s closest family member against the television channel, it was objectively justifiable to assume that the judge himself could not have been impartial during the examination of the ownership dispute over the television company. The second to fourth applicants argued that the inference drawn from the Facebook posts was not that specific posts influenced specific decisions of Judge T.U., but that the collection of posts had provided a reasonable basis for a fear that the judge\u2019s wife and the judge himself had not been impartial in relation to Rustavi 2 and its owners. The fact that the judge\u2019s wife had posted such views of Rustavi 2 repeatedly showed that she had consistently held such views. In that connection, the second to fourth applicants referred to Principle 4.8 of the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct in accordance with which a judge must not allow his or her family, social or other relationships to influence improperly his or her judicial conduct. They argued that the actions of a judge\u2019s close family member sufficed to raise concerns as to the impartiality of the judge even in the absence of a direct proof that such views were also held by the judge himself. Lastly, the second to fourth applicants also claimed that the speed with which Judge T.U. had examined the ownership dispute as well as the preliminary and interim rulings that he had issued to the detriment of the applicants, including Judge T.U.\u2019s refusal to recuse himself from the case, proved further his personal bias against them.",

In particular, the three applicants argued that the latter judge had had close links with Judge T.U. as both had been founding members of the Union of Judges of Georgia, the association of judges that had publicly expressed its support towards Judge T.U. and criticised the Director General of Rustavi 2 (see paragraph 135 above). In that connection, the second to fourth applicants submitted that the public statements issued by the association had been uncalled for as Rustavi 2 had never attacked the judiciary but had simply reported, in a neutral manner, on the civil proceedings. Being a public watchdog, the television channel had been fully entitled to do so. The second to fourth applicants also denied that the first applicant, Rustavi 2, had ever tried to artificially create conditions for the recusal of the various judges, including Judge N.G. The television channel had merely been exercising its freedom of expression, whilst the judges had been under an obligation to keep a low profile and tolerate the legitimate criticism of the media. They also argued that the fact that the statements of the Union of Judges of Georgia had not addressed the merits of the case was not important at all. Rather, for the purposes of assessing impartiality, the significance lay in the fact that those statements had expressed support towards Judge T.U. and his arbitrary decisions.",

As regards the former judge, the applicants referred to the fact that, prior to being elected to the Supreme Court, she had worked as the head of the legal department of a bank owned by the former Prime Minister and had donated GEL 34,000 (approximately EUR 10,600) to the GDC between 2012 and 2014 (see paragraph 157 above), a fact which proved that she had clear political sympathies towards the ruling party. However, since the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 had been a politically sensitive one, it had been inappropriate for the judge with a clear political orientation to sit in the case. With regard to the President of the Supreme Court, the applicants referred to the fact that she could have held animosity towards the Director General of Rustavi 2, N.Gv., since it had been the latter who had brought disciplinary charges against the former back in 2006, while N.Gv. had been a member of the High Council of Justice. Those disciplinary proceedings, led by N.Gv., had resulted in the judge being dismissed from her judicial post in 2006. The second to fourth applicants claimed that those facts had constituted a sufficient basis for an objective observer to suspect that the President of the Supreme Court could be biased against Rustavi 2\u2019s Director General. Lastly, although the second to fourth applicants\u2019 challenge had been directed against only two of the nine judges in that composition of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 161 above), they claimed that it had been perfectly possible for those two judges to exert influence over the rest of the bench. They also submitted that, as a matter of principle, the main question was not whether such influence had actually been exerted but that the likelihood of such influence had existed. Therefore, the lack of independence or impartiality on the part of two judges had tainted the whole bench of the Supreme Court that had examined the ownership dispute, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

First of all, contrary to the applicants\u2019 allegations, T.U. had not been the only judge at the Tbilisi City Court who had been expert in issues related to copyright law. At the material time, two other judges in the same court had been specialists in examining copyright disputes. Furthermore, the Government referred to the fact that the assignment of the ownership dispute to that particular judge had been conducted in alphabetical order, pursuant to section 5 of the Allocation of Cases to Judges Act of June 1998 (see paragraph 91 above). As regards the challenge to Judge T.U. on the basis of the initiation of the criminal proceedings against his mother, the Government submitted that those proceedings had commenced in January 2014, long before K.K. had brought the ownership dispute to the court on 4 August 2015. As regards the reasons for the delay between the incident and charges being brought against the woman, the Government referred to the documents confirming that it had been caused by the prosecution authorities\u2019 decision to give the parties time for reconciliation (see paragraph 97 above). The Government emphasised that such practice was far from being unusual. They submitted statistical data from the Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office demonstrating that in 2014 the investigation of offences under Article 118 of the Criminal Code, the same provision under which Judge T.U.\u2019s mother had been charged, had commenced in 1,032 cases, out of which charges had been brought only in 115 cases, whilst the remaining cases had ended with reconciliation between the parties. Furthermore, the Government submitted documents which disclosed that Judge T.U.\u2019s mother had eventually been convicted on 11\u00a0December 2017, that is to say well after Judge T.U. had delivered the judgment in favour of K.K. (see paragraphs 98 before). Judge T.U. had never shown personal bias and no circumstances existed that could objectively justify the second to fourth applicants\u2019 fear that the judge had been pressurised by the authorities into deciding the ownership dispute in favour of K.K.",

Neither the Bangalore Principles, to which the three applicants referred, nor any other international document on the impartiality of judges contained any provision restricting the freedom of expression of judges\u2019 family members or their right to form opinions, positive or negative, with regard to events and individuals. Furthermore, the impugned Facebook posts had not expressed any opinion on the outcome of the civil case, they had simply made negative comments about Rustavi 2 and its Director General. However, as long as it had not been showed that the judge had been influenced by those opinions, it could not be said that the he had lacked either independence or impartiality. The Government attached importance to the fact that Judge T.U. had emphasised in his decision of 19 October 2015 that his spouse had never agreed the contents of the Facebook posts with him, nor had he been aware of the existence of those posts. They also submitted that, as a matter of fact, Judge T.U. had taken a number of decisions, both procedurally and on the merits, in favour of the applicants, and that those decisions could be taken as an indication of the absence of any particular bias against them. Lastly, the Government invited the Court, by submitting the relevant documentary proof, to take note of the fact that Judge T.U.\u2019s term of office had expired on 29 April 2016. He had subsequently applied to the High Council of Justice for reappointment for life and took part in an open recruitment competition but, far from receiving favourable treatment, he had in fact been passed over by the Council in favour of another candidate. Those developments in Judge T.U.\u2019s career further underscored, in the Government\u2019s view, the baseless nature of the second to fourth applicants\u2019 suggestion that he had been acting under the influence of the Government in his adjudication of the Rustavi 2 dispute.",

The Government argued that nothing in the association\u2019s statements of 31 August and 20\u00a0October 2015 had demonstrated any indication of personal bias or a predetermined position on the part of Judge N.G. or Judge T.U.

In general, the Government argued, with reference to relevant comparative material relating to such countries as Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Portugal, that the practice of protecting individual judges from attacks in the media by non-governmental organisations and associations of judges was not uncommon.",

As regards the former judge, the Government stated that her connection as an employee of the bank owned by Mr Ivanishvili\u2019s family, which was in no way connected to the ownership dispute, could not cast legitimate doubts on her impartiality during the examination of the ownership dispute. The Government further submitted documentary proof of the following facts. Before being elected as a Supreme Court judge in 2015, Judge M.T. had held various judicial offices in different courts in Georgia from 1985 to 2005. She had then worked for ten years in the private sector from 2005 to 2015. She had made donations to the GDC only between 2012 and 2014, that is to say during the period when she had been employed in the private sector. There was no information on Judge M.T.\u2019s political activity following her appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court on 12 June 2015. On the contrary, according to a letter of the State Audit Service, since 12 June 2015 M.T. had not made any donations to the GDC or any other political party. As regards the President of the Supreme Court, the Government emphasised that there was no proof capable of showing that the President had held or expressed any negative attitudes in respect of the Director General of Rustavi 2 in relation to the events that had occurred more than a decade previously \u2013 the disciplinary proceedings that had been conducted against her in 2006. On the other hand, the Government argued that a judge\u2019s negative attitude towards one of the parties due to past affairs could be discerned only in cases where the judge clearly expressed his or her willingness for retribution. In any event, the judgment of 2 March 2017 was adopted unanimously by nine judges of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court. In these circumstances, any concerns regarding the independence and impartiality of the two particular judges could not have affected the judicial decision adopted by nine judges in consensus. The Government also emphasised in that regard that the majority of the judges sitting in the Grand Chamber (five out of nine) had become members of the Supreme Court during the period 2009-11, when President Saakashvili and his UNM party had been in power and during which time the then Director General of Rustavi 2, N.Gv., had held various high-ranking positions in the then Government of Georgia.",

The Government referred in that connection to the various insults that had been directed at the judges by the Director General of the television channel (see paragraphs 175-76 above), urging the Court to take this aspect into account when examining the relevant complaints.",

According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2005-XIII, and Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 93). In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test (see Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 95, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, \u00a7 75, 23 April 2015). However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test) (see Kyprianou, cited above, \u00a7 119). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge\u2019s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, \u00a7 32, Reports 1996-III).",

This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 96, and Morice, also cited above, \u00a7 76). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other actors in the proceedings (see Micallef, cited above, \u00a7 97). It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal (see Pullar, cited above, \u00a7 38). In this connection even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, \u201cjustice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done\u201d (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no.\u00a06639/11, \u00a7 63, 25 September 2018, and De Cubber v. Belgium, 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 26, Series A no. 86). What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public. Thus, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, 28 October 1998, \u00a7\u00a045, Reports 1998-VIII). The Court further restates that appearance of partiality under the objective test is to be measured by the standard of an objective observer (see, amongst other authorities, Pullar, cited above, \u00a7 39, A.K. v. Liechtenstein, no. 38191/12, \u00a7 75, 9 July 2015; and Miminoshvili v.\u00a0Russia, no. 20197/03, \u00a7 114, 28 June 2011). The Court further observes that the appearance that a judge is not impartial can be given not only by apparent conflict of interest (see, for instance, Micallef, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0102; Ramljak v. Croatia, no. 5856/13, \u00a7 31, 27 June 2017; and Dorozhko and\u00a0Pozharskiy v. Estonia, nos. 14659/04 and 16855/04, \u00a7 58, 24 April 2008) or a judge\u2019s demeanour on the bench (compare Morice, cited above \u00a7\u00a086), but equally by the conduct of a judge outside the courtroom (compare, mutatis mutandis, Tocono and Profesorii Prometei\u015fti v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 32263/03, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a017 and 31, 26 June 2007).",

It is of the opinion that the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in developing methods for the assignment of cases to particular judicial formations. A wide range of factors, such as, for instance, resources available, qualification of judges, conflict of interests, judicial workload etc., must be taken into account by the authorities when assigning a case. The Court has previously held that, although it is not its role to assess whether there were valid grounds for the domestic authorities to (re)assign a case to a particular judge or court, it must be satisfied that such (re)assignment was compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1, and, in particular, with the requirements of independence and impartiality (compare, mutatis mutanids, with Sutyagin v. Russia, no.\u00a030024/02, \u00a7 187 178-93, 3\u00a0May 2011). On the facts of the present case, the Court cannot see indices of the type of judicial \u201cforum shopping\u201d alleged by the applicants. Whilst the applicants claimed that Judge T.U. had been the only judge at the Tbilisi City Court specialising in the examination of intellectual-property law, the documents available in the case file suggest that, in actual fact, two other judges with such a specialisation had also been available. Of further significance in that connection is that Judge T.U. himself explained in detail the way in which the ownership dispute had been allocated to him. Specifically, he confirmed that the decision on allocation had been made, under section 5 of the Allocation of Cases to Judges Act of June 1998, in alphabetical order (see paragraphs 91 and 324 above). The applicants were unable to refute Judge T.U.\u2019s credible explanation and did not provide any evidence in support of an alternative version as to how the case might have been assigned to him.",

However, the Court notes that both the prosecution authority at the domestic level and the Government in the Convention proceedings provided a sound explanation in respect of those circumstances. Thus, according to the material available in the case file, given the senior age and the state of health of the accused, Judge T.U.\u2019s mother, as well as the less-serious character of the impugned offence under domestic legislation (Article 118 of the Criminal Code), the prosecution authority had given her, in accordance with the well-established practice, time for reconciliation with the victim of the offence, her son-in-law. The existence of such a reconciliatory practice is confirmed by the statistical data of the prosecutor\u2019s office regarding the prosecution of offences committed under Article 118 of the Criminal Code in 2014-15. It was only after all the possibilities for reconciliation had been exhausted, that the prosecution authority had brought charges against the offender\u00a0(see paragraphs\u00a097-8 and\u00a0324 above).",

Two interrelated questions arise: (i) whether the character of those statements was such as to raise objectively justifiable concerns about the impartiality of the judicial review of the ownership dispute over Rustavi\u00a02 shares and (ii) whether the statements published by Judge T.U.\u2019s wife can be said to have been associated with the judge himself.",

However, neither of these two represented an actual party to the ownership dispute. The judge\u2019s wife did not comment in any manner on the eventual outcome of the on-going ownership dispute. None of the Facebook posts, one of which predated the assignment of the ownership dispute to Judge T.U., could be understood as creating an impression that the judge\u2019s spouse was attempting to exploit her husband\u2019s judicial position or influence him.",

The requirement of judicial impartiality cannot prevent a judge\u2019s family expressing their views on issues affecting society. However, it cannot be excluded that the activities of close family members might, in certain circumstances, adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of a given judge\u2019s impartiality (see paragraph 67 of the Commentary on the Bangalore Principles, cited in paragraph 225 above). The Court notes that, in the case at hand, the second to fourth applicants have not presented any evidence that Judge T.U. was influenced by his spouse\u2019s social networking statements while adjudicating the case. There is no proof in the case file that the judge ever discussed the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 shares with his spouse either privately or in public. In his decision of 19 October 2015, the judge emphasised that his spouse had never agreed the contents of her Facebook posts with him and that he had not even been aware of the existence of those posts. The Court thus considers that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, the judge sufficiently distanced himself from the opinions which his wife published on Facebook.",

To start with, the Court reiterates that a judge, like any other individual, is entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly, but in exercising these rights, he or she should conduct himself or herself in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary (see its findings in paragraph 344 above; and compare, mutatis mutandis, N.F. v.\u00a0Italy, no.\u00a037119/97, \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 32, ECHR\u00a02001IX; Kudeshkina v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a029492/05, \u00a7\u00a086, 26\u00a0February 2009; and Harabin v.\u00a0Slovakia (dec.), no.\u00a062584/00, 29\u00a0June 2004). A judge may form or join associations of judges or participate in other organisations representing the interests of judges (see the Commentary to the Bangalore Principles, cited in paragraph\u00a0225 above). Thus, it does not see anything improper in the fact that both Judge T.U. and Judge N.G had been founding members, together with sixteen other judges, of the Union of Judges of Georgia, an association representing acting judges\u2019 interests. At the time of the examination of the ownership dispute, Judge T.U. and Judge N.G were still members of the organisation, together with some fifty other acting judges in Georgia.",

The terms and expressions that the Director General had used with respect to that particular judge in his televised statements included: \u201ca Sonder-judge\u201d (the latter expression being used with a Nazi connotation), \u201csoil will burn under the judge\u201d, illiterate\u201d, \u201ccorrupt\u201d, \u201cpuppet\u201d, \u201cpseudo-servant of Themis\u201d, \u201carmed with an axe\u201d, \u201cfor-hire\u201d and \u201cscoundrel\u201d (for more epithets used by Rustavi 2\u2019s Director General in the course of the domestic proceedings, see paragraphs\u00a01756 above). It furthermore is evident from the available case-file material that the Director General did not even hide the fact that he was making such abusive public statements intentionally, with the aim of provoking the judge and obtaining grounds for requesting the latter\u2019s recusal (see paragraphs\u00a0104 and 173 above). In that regard, the Court considers it important to emphasise that, whilst parties to the proceedings may defend their rights and legal interests even in a boisterous manner, which may include resort to exuberant speech, they are nevertheless expected to confine such conduct strictly to the courtroom (see, for instance, \u010ceferin v.\u00a0Slovenia, no.\u00a040975/08, \u00a7 54, 16 January 2018). In the present case, however, Rustavi\u00a02\u2019s Director General, chose to voice his criticism of Judge T.U. not in a courtroom, although he had every possibility to do so given the involvement of Rustavi 2 as a party to the proceedings at that time, but by employing Rustavi 2\u2019s powerful media premises and with the inappropriate goal of provoking the judge and artificially creating the preconditions for the latter\u2019s recusal.",

Secondly, having regard to the general question of the significance of the appearance of judicial independence from the executive and legislative branches, the Court is ready to accept that, in addition to the need for judges to refrain from taking part publicly in controversial political discussions (see the Court\u2019s findings in paragraphs 344 and 349 above), it would be normally preferable for professional judges to refrain, during their mandate, from partisan political activities, such as contributing to political parties or campaigns (see also the Bangalore Principles and the Commentary thereto, cited in paragraphs 224 and 225 above). However, according to the casefile material, Judge M.T. contributed to the political party in question some years previously, at a time when she was employed in the private sector\u00a0(see paragraph\u00a0327 above).

In practice, however, it is very difficult to establish the existence of personal bias of a judge under the subjective test, and the Court normally prefers to assess the situation from the objective standpoint. For instance, in the case of Tocono and Profesorii Prometei\u015fti, the Court held that the judge\u2019s personal grudge towards a party to the proceedings could only be discerned under the objective test by having due regard not only to past events that could, from the perspective of an objective observer, be considered as the plausible cause of the animosity but also to the question of whether or not the judge had ever expressed a willingness to retaliate (see Tocono and Profesorii Prometei\u015fti, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28-33).",

With this mind, the Court considers that the enlarged bench of the Supreme Court, the body seized with the relevant request for recusal of its President, had to subject the request to a serious scrutiny. The Court observes that in its ruling of 2 March 2017, the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court extensively addressed the relevant arguments of the second to fourth applicants, carefully assessing them under both the subjective and objective tests contained in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

Denmark, 24 May 1989, \u00a7\u00a047, Series A no. 154), the Court further notes that the second to fourth applicants have not presented, either at the domestic level or in the proceedings before it, any information to show that the President of the Supreme Court held such a negative attitude with regard to N.Gv. in relation to the past affairs that had occurred more than a decade before. Leaving aside the lack of proof of the President\u2019s willingness to retaliate (again contrast Tocono and Profesorii Prometei\u015fti, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02833, and Remli, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43-48), there is also no evidence in the case file to show that the judge ever expressed any views at all either about Rustavi\u00a02, N.Gv. or the latter\u2019s role in the disciplinary proceedings conducted against her. In the circumstances when the second to fourth applicants had been systematically introducing ill-founded recusal requests against many different judges of all three levels of jurisdiction and when the attacks broadcast by Rustavi 2 against some of the judges involved in the case had been sustained, the Court considers that the Supreme Court\u2019s wellreasoned decision to maintain the President was not, given the circumstances of the case and the elements relied on when seeking her recusal, unjustified.",

That being so, it is of the opinion that, from the standpoint of an objective observer, the whole of the enlarged bench cannot be said to have been tainted by the applicants\u2019 challenge to the President of the Supreme Court, especially when that judicial formation decided on the case by unanimous vote (compare, amongst others, with Sturua v.\u00a0Georgia, no.\u00a045729/05, \u00a7 35, 28 March 2017; Fazl\u0131 Aslaner v.

The Court is not oblivious to the fact that in the case of Morice v.\u00a0France it found that the fact that only one judge, whose impartiality was, as such, \u201copen to genuine doubt\u201d, was sitting on an enlarged bench was not decisive for the objective-impartiality issue under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. However, the Court explicitly specified that the aforementioned finding was limited to \u201cthe very singular context\u201d of the French case (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84-86 and 89). Thus, amongst other differences with the Morice case, the applicants in the present case had the possibility to request recusal of the President of the Supreme Court from sitting, and their request was then seriously examined with reference to the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraphs 360 and 162 above and contrast with ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 53, 66 and 68). In the case of Morice, the French courts had explicitly established the existence of personal animosity between the applicant and the judge challenged for bias, whereas in the case at hand the second to fourth applicants were unable to show proof of any personal or professional conflict between them and the President of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 359-362 and 162 above and contrast with ibid., \u00a7\u00a7\u00a050 and 86).",

The majority go on to say that \u201cthere is no proof in the case file that the judge ever discussed the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2 shares with his spouse either privately or in public\u201d.

Judge T.U.\u2019s cursory, almost dismissive, statement that he was not aware of his wife\u2019s Facebook posts at the time they were published (because, evidently, later he was aware of them) could not, by and of itself, dismiss from the mind of a reasonable lay observer the suggestion that he and his wife had aired the ownership dispute in their family discussions. To my mind, Judge T.U. did not sufficiently distance himself from his wife\u2019s opinions, either by denouncing the Facebook posts as inappropriate or, at least, by indicating that he and his wife had had a \u201cChinese wall\u201d in their household, that is to say, a deliberately installed ethical barrier that prevented communication (in this case between the spouses) on matters relating to the former\u2019s judicial functions. The judge merely referred to his wife\u2019s freedom of expression, implicitly suggesting that he himself did not see anything inappropriate in the content of her remarks. Moreover, to compound the problem of perceptions, in his decision of 19 October 2015 he even went on the offensive by saying that the Director General of Rustavi 2, N.Gv., had orchestrated the public campaign against him (see paragraph 106 of the judgment). From this standpoint alone, Judge T.U. could be readily associated by a reasonable observer with his wife\u2019s opinions published on Facebook.",

The Facebook posts related either to Rustavi 2 as a television channel or to its Director General, N.Gv., personally. Neither of these two represented an actual party to the ownership dispute; however, it was reasonable to look, from the perspective of a lay observer, at both the first applicant \u2013 the television channel Rustavi 2 \u2013 and the owners of the first applicant \u2013 the second to fourth applicants \u2013 as a single whole sharing identical goals in the judicial saga over Rustavi 2 which was unfolding before the domestic courts. Indeed, both at the domestic level and before the Court, the owners of the television company publicly expressed their fears for the channel\u2019s editorial independence, whilst the channel itself fought tooth and nail, alongside its corporate interests, for the owners\u2019 pecuniary rights. In such circumstances, when the publicly declared interests of the television channel and its owners coincided, any invective coming from a close family member of the judge, to wit his wife, could only be perceived by the public as an indication of ill-will towards the owners of the channel \u2013 that is, towards the second to fourth applicants.",

It conveyed her views on a reality television music competition broadcast by Rustavi 2, with her criticism of the members of the jury, rather than of the channel itself. However, the second post, published on 13 August 2015, was quite explicit: in it she compared Rustavi 2 with a Georgian literary character, Arkipo Seturi, who is an artistic image for a type of \u201cBig Brother\u201d totalitarian ruler. A fair-minded and properly informed observer could not in this instance escape the conclusion that the judge\u2019s wife held utterly negative views (of a \u201cpolitical\u201d character) on Rustavi 2. As regards the third Facebook post, published by her on 2\u00a0October 2015 (and therefore when her husband had not yet delivered his decision of 19 October on the recusal issue, much less the judgment of 3\u00a0November 2015 on the merits), whilst the comments she appended to it can be said to constitute a mere personal attack on N.Gv., and were therefore not directly associable with the television channel itself, what I find extremely troubling is the origin of that post. For the purposes of advancing her negative and satirical views on N.Gv. on Facebook, the judge\u2019s wife shared a status update from a \u201cfun\u201d page called \u201cProperty-frozen Rustavi 2\u201d, and by doing so she either inadvertently or deliberately referred to the injunction ruling issued by her husband on 5 August 2015. For me \u2013 as, I am sure, for any reasonable observer even if bereft of the experience of being a career judge \u2013 the conduct of the judge\u2019s wife displayed all the signs of satisfaction that came from her husband\u2019s decision to freeze Rustavi 2\u2019s assets in the course of the examination of the ownership dispute. By publishing the Facebook posts on 13 August and 2\u00a0October 2015, Judge T.U.\u2019s wife expressed in a public forum her negative opinion of Rustavi 2\u2019s editorial policy and further displayed signs of Schadenfreude regarding her husband\u2019s decision to freeze the company\u2019s assets. From the standpoint of a reasonable, fair-minded and informed observer, such conduct on the part of the judge\u2019s close family member could not but tarnish T.U.\u2019s capacity to examine the ownership dispute without perceived bias against Rustavi 2 and its owners (the second to fourth applicants). The Tbilisi Court of Appeal cavalierly dismissed the overall picture conveyed by these posts and its implications for the issue of objective impartiality.",

Finland (19 December 1997, \u00a7 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VIII) to dismiss the complaint of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the ground of Judge T.U.\u2019s wife\u2019s Facebook posts. Although it is true that a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention cannot be grounded on the alleged lack of independence or impartiality of a decision-making tribunal if the decision taken was subject to subsequent oversight by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and ensures respect for the guarantees laid down in that provision, in the circumstances of the instant case this principle is inapplicable. Despite the fact that the applicants had, notionally at least, further access to the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, which indeed had full jurisdiction to assess matters of fact and law, this appellate court could not redress the breach of the impartiality requirement at the first-instance level, for two reasons: firstly, the independence and impartiality of the appellate court itself was also intensely contested by the applicants; and, secondly and more critically, the Tbilisi Court of Appeal, contrary to what the majority hold in paragraph 345, failed to ensure a sufficient examination of the applicants\u2019 appeal against Judge T.U.\u2019s decision of 19 October 2015 not to withdraw from the case (see paragraph 147 of the judgment and compare with Editorial Board of Grivna Newspaper v. Ukraine, no. 41214/08, \u00a7 68, 16 April 2019, with further references therein).

The majority dismiss this complaint basically for four reasons (see paragraphs 361 to 363 of the judgment): (1) the second to fourth applicants have not presented any information to show that the President of the Supreme Court held negative attitudes with regard to N.Gv.; (2) these applicants had systematically lodged \u201cill-founded recusal requests\u201d against several judges; (3) the passage of time (from 2006, when the said President had been dismissed from her judicial post following disciplinary proceedings brought by and conducted against her by N.Gv. when he had been a member of the High Council of Justice (see paragraph 156) to 2017, when the composition of the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court was announced (see paragraph 161)); and (4) the President was only one judge out of several in the enlarged bench of the Grand Chamber.",

As regards the first of these four reasons, here again the majority drift \u2013 whether inadvertently or deliberately is not at all clear \u2013 from objective to subjective impartiality. As to the second reason (it is not clear whether by the adjective \u201cill-founded\u201d, with reference to the recusal requests, the majority meant requests which were an abuse of process or requests which turned out to be simply unjustified \u2013 not every unjustified request is an abuse of process), this is tantamount to saying falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus \u2013 a common-law principle once applied in the assessment of the credibility of witnesses, which has been ditched in most jurisdictions. The majority then endorse, and consider to be \u201cwell-reasoned\u201d, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (see paragraph 162 of the judgment) dismissing the challenge to the President. Even a cursory examination of this decision shows that the Supreme Court approached the issue only from the subjective limb of impartiality, omitting entirely to examine the objective limb. Regarding the passage of time, the majority find it \u201cdifficult, from the standpoint of an objective observer, to see any long-lasting effects of the professional blow of the past\u201d. I find this (third) reason, to say the least, extraordinary. From my experience \u2013 always as a career judge \u2013 the ordinary man in the street will say: \u201cAt last, after ten years, she can now exact her pound of flesh\u201d (with apologies to Shylock). While I am prepared to assume that the President of the Supreme Court could not be said to have been subjectively biased against Rustavi 2 \u2013 there is no evidence to that effect \u2013 I find it highly problematic that this judge took part in the examination of the ownership dispute over Rustavi 2, whose Director General \u2013 the person whom everyone associated with the channel, the face and spokesman of the channel \u2013 had ten years earlier brought charges against her, as a result of which she was dismissed from the post she then held. Admittedly, unlike the situation in the case of Tocono and Profesorii Prometei\u015fti (no. 32263/03, \u00a7\u00a7 28-33, 26 June 2007), the President of the Supreme Court in the instant case had never expressed, either privately or in public, any comments conveying animosity towards either Rustavi 2 or its owners or, indeed, towards the Director General (N.Gv.). However, since the disciplinary proceedings conducted by the said N.Gv. had resulted in the President\u2019s dismissal from the judicial post she had then held, such a severe professional blow from the past was sufficient, even in the absence of any additional circumstances, to make the President of the Supreme Court appear, in the eyes of a reasonable observer, ill-disposed to Rustavi 2\u2019s Director General personally and, by close association if not indeed identification, to the channel itself and its owners.",

Given the sensitivity of the case, irrespective of the lack of evidence of any explicit personal animosity between the President of the Supreme Court and N.Gv. (at the end of paragraph 363 the majority again slide into subjective impartiality), and in light of the previous history between her and the said N.Gv., the presence of the President of the Supreme Court as part of the composition which was to have the final say in the case at domestic level should have been more than enough reason for the President to either abstain or be recused. From the standpoint of an objective observer, even one biased judge may plausibly render the whole of the enlarged bench of judges vulnerable, and in reality there is no need to ascertain the extent of that judge\u2019s actual influence on that occasion (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7 89).",
