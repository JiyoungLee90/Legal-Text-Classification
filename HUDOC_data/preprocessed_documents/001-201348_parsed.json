It also held that Article 336 \u00a7 1 of the new Criminal Code was applicable because in the applicant\u2019s case it was necessary to postpone the imposition of the sentence for the act committed by him. Consequently, it concluded that the new legal provisions were the more lenient and decided to dismiss the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s request to change the legal classification of the offence. In sentencing the applicant, the court took into account the general sentencing criteria set out in the new criminal law and the general purpose of penalties. In addition, it held that the limits of the penalty provided for by law had to be reduced by a third in accordance with the new criminal procedure rules concerning admission of guilt. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and the applicant\u2019s behaviour, the court held that, as far as the seriousness of his actions was concerned, he had not been driving on a busy road. It further held that, as far as he himself was concerned, he had no previous convictions, had admitted and regretted his actions, had been employed, and was responsible and fully integrated into society. On that basis, the court considered that setting a penalty for the applicant would be sufficient to make him realise the consequences of his behaviour and deter him from repeating it. Consequently, it decided that the immediate imposition of a sentence was unnecessary, but that a period of probation was required. It therefore concluded that the most appropriate manner of dealing with the case was to give the applicant a ten-month prison sentence and postpone its imposition for two years. Lastly, it ordered him to comply with certain conditions during the period of probation, but they did not include a ban on driving a vehicle.",

The applicant had had a very high alcohol level in his blood and had consented to driving a vehicle occupied by another person who had eventually been injured. He had not justified in any way why he had committed the offence. The fact that he had committed the offence on a less busy road or that the injured person had not lodged a criminal complaint against him was irrelevant and could not diminish the serious nature of the offence. On the contrary, his actions had made the offence even more serious because the consequences could have been even more severe as far as road safety and the person\u2019s life and physical integrity were concerned. Furthermore, the applicant had initially denied having committed the offence and had entered into a heated dispute with individuals travelling in the other car. The fact that he had admitted to having committed the offence in circumstances where the evidence against him was indisputable could not be viewed as mitigating circumstances sufficient to justify postponing the imposition of a sentence. The same could also be said about the absence of previous convictions, as the applicant deserved no particular credit for being in a normal situation specific to most members of society. The fact that he was well integrated in society should have made him foresee the serious consequences that driving a vehicle under the influence might have had. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s office reiterated its arguments concerning the need to change the legal classification of the offence. It urged the appellate court to give the applicant a sentence which could be suspended for the duration of a supervision period in accordance with the provisions of the old criminal law. It argued that the old criminal law contained more favourable terms for the applicant than the new criminal law in so far as suspending the serving of his sentence for the duration of a supervision period was concerned, because the old criminal law allowed for his automatic legal rehabilitation if he did not reoffend during that period.",

Referring to the general sentencing criteria set out in both the new and old criminal law and applying them to the applicant\u2019s case, the court held that the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s arguments were well-founded and that the punishment imposed on the applicant had not been appropriate to ensure his rehabilitation in the sense of respect for the values protected by criminal law, namely general and special prevention. In this connection, the court took into account the particular circumstances in which the applicant had committed the offence, the level of alcohol in his blood at the time of the incident and his conduct thereafter, namely his involvement in a verbal dispute with one of the witnesses and other individuals. As far as his admission of guilt was concerned, the court held that he would be rewarded with a one-third reduction of his penalty, as provided for by the new domestic criminal procedure rules. As a result, the court decided to impose a penalty on the applicant within the specific limits provided for by law for the offence and reduce it accordingly. For the above-mentioned reasons, the court held that the old criminal law was the more lenient in the applicant\u2019s case, given the conditions to be met for suspending the serving of the sentence for the duration of a supervision period.",

Generally, a domestic court would first determine if the elements of an offence were made out. Subsequently, it would examine the statutory penalty for the offence. If two criminal laws were in force between the moment an act was committed and the moment the final court judgment was delivered and under one of those laws the penalty for the offence was imprisonment and under the other either the same term of imprisonment or a fine, the judge would consider the latter law more lenient only if he or she decided to sentence the defendant to pay a fine. In other words, the mere existence of a potential alternative penalty would not render a law more favourable. If, however, the two laws in question provided different terms of imprisonment for the same offence, the domestic courts would determine the more lenient criminal law by taking into account the specific prison sentence it intended to impose. Therefore, if the court intended to give a sentence which was closer to the statutory maximum sentence, the more lenient criminal law would be that which provided the shortest statutory maximum sentence. Likewise, if the court intended to give a sentence which was closer to the statutory minimum sentence, the more lenient criminal law would be that which provided the shortest statutory minimum sentence. Lastly, if the offence carried the same penalty under both laws the court, depending on the chosen penalty, would be called upon to examine other elements, such as the requirements for suspending the serving of the sentence.",

In so far as his argument may be understood to amount to a general complaint about the severity of the penalty imposed on him by the last-instance court, the Court reiterates that issues relating to the appropriateness of a penalty do not fall within the scope of Article 7, as it is not the Court\u2019s role to decide the length of a prison sentence or the type of penalty which is suited to any given offence (see Hummatov v.

The Court notes at this point that the new criminal law requires that the offence under examination be minor or that the prison sentences set for or imposed on defendants be three years or less for the various manners in which a sentence is to be served to take effect and to be applicable in any given case. Since in the applicant\u2019s case the offence committed by him and the prison sentence imposed on him did not meet these requirements, he would have been forced to serve his prison sentence had the new criminal law been applied.",

Similar provisions were also available under the old criminal law and would have had the same effect as regards the applicant\u2019s sentence.
