They argued that until 31\u00a0December\u00a01995 child benefits had been granted under the social benefits scheme, but from 1\u00a0January 1996 onwards they were granted on the basis of the Income Tax Act. The Government explained that the Income Tax Act provided for child benefits or a child-related tax exemption: all beneficiaries received child benefits during the calendar year, then, when assessing income tax for a specific year, the tax authorities examined whether the child-related tax exemption was more advantageous for the beneficiary than the child benefits paid monthly; if it was more advantageous, the tax exemption was granted instead of the child benefits. The purpose of this legislative amendment had been to take into account the reduced capacity of parents to pay taxes by exempting from tax an amount of income that corresponded to the level of subsistence of the child. The Government admitted that \u201c[i]nsofar as the child benefit, paid monthly, [was] not necessary to make the level of subsistence of the child exempt from tax, in particular with low-income families, it serve[d] to promote the family and [was] to be characterised as a social benefit\u201d. The Government nevertheless claimed that whether or not Article 6 was applicable to child benefits under the Income Tax Act could not depend on the individual case but had to be examined on a general level. The Government concluded that the primary objective of child benefits was to take into account parents' reduced capacity to pay taxes, which was an issue related to the field of tax law and thus fell outside the scope of Article 6.",
