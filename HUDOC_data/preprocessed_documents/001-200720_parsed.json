Moreover, the debtor institution submitted that they could not reinstate the applicant in August-September 2006 due to the fact that the head of their institution was on leave. The Town Court noted that the bailiffs attempted to penalise the head of the debtor institution in December 2005 and in February 2006, and applied for recovery of the wages for the applicant for the period of non-enforcement (see paragraph 8 above).

According to the court, neither the alleged lack of the post to which the applicant had to be reinstated nor the absence of the head of the institution during his leave could prevent the reinstatement.

Therefore, it follows that the complaint under Article 6 and Article 1 Protocol No. 1 about allegedly delayed payments under the domestic judgments is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article\u00a035\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

Therefore, it remains unclear whether in the situation of a non-material obligation of an institution, as the obligation to reinstate the applicant in the present case, is covered by the same legal provisions and would bring similar results. Thus, in so far the Government may be understood as arguing that the applicant did not use an effective domestic remedy in respect of the delay in her reinstatement as ordered by the judgment of 20\u00a0October 2005, the Court considers their argument unsubstantiated (see Selmouni v.

Thus, the Court is prepared to accept that in some cases execution of such an obligation can give rise to issues which may well take more time to fulfil than a monetary obligation. It notes in this regard that in order to protect person\u2019s rights in cases when reinstatement is delayed the domestic law provided for the possibility to recover the average wages for the period of non-enforcement, as it was done in the present case (see paragraphs 8-14 above).",
