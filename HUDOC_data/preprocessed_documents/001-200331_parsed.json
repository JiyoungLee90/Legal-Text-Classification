Given that on 3\u00a0February 2009 the social tenancy agreement was discontinued (see paragraph\u00a014 above), and no outstanding obligations on the MUP were established by the domestic courts (see paragraphs\u00a015 and 17 above), the Court concludes that on that date the judgment of 14\u00a0August 2001 became unenforceable. However, on 24\u00a0August 2009 in the proceedings against the local administration the Town Court established an updated list of major repairs which had still been necessary since at least 2003 but had not been performed (see paragraph\u00a016 above).",

As regards the applicant\u2019s allegations about the insufficient scope and poor quality of the works performed, the Court reiterates that the domestic courts are better placed to ascertain the proper method of enforcement and to decide the issue of whether and when full and appropriate compliance with a judgment has been secured.
