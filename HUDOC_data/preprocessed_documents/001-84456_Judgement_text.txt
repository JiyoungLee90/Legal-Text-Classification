The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights.
On 30 May 2006 the Court decided to communicate to the Government the complaints under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments and the labour commission's decisions given in the applicants' favour. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
The applicants live in Kostyantynivka, in the  region.
On various dates between 1997 and 2002 (see appendix for details) the first to fifteenth applicants received final rulings (court judgments, labour commission's decisions) awarding salary arrears and other compensation against the State-owned factory “Avtosklo” (Виробниче об'єднання завод „Автоскло”) and instituted enforcement proceedings to recover the debts.
On 22 August 2000 a new State-owned company, the “Tehkbudsklo” (Державне підприємство „Технобудскло”), was created in the course of the “Avtosklo” factory restructuring.
On various dates in 2002 (see appendix for details) the fifteenth to the twentieth applicants received final court judgments awarding salary arrears and other compensation against the “Tekhbudsklo” company and instituted enforcement proceedings to collect the debts.
On various dates the bailiffs informed the applicants that the collection of the debts in their favour was impeded by the companies' lack of funds and the statutory moratorium on forced sale of the State property.
On 18 February 2002 and 1 November 2005 the  (Господарський суд Донецької області) declared bankrupt the “Avtosklo” and the “Tekhbudsklo” companies respectively and ordered their liquidation.
On 19 April and 1 November 2005 the enforcement proceedings concerning “Avtosklo's” and “Tekhbudsklo's” debts respectively were terminated on account of the initiation of the companies' liquidation.
The labour commission's decisions and the court judgments given in the applicants' favour remain unenforced to the present date.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, § 17-22, 26 April 2005).
