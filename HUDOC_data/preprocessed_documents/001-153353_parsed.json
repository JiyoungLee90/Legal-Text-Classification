As long as there is some meaningful contact between families and the authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a time when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be, provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case. Where more than ten years have elapsed since the incident, the applicants have to justify such a delay in lodging their application with the Court (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016263).",

Whether a failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on specific evidence, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (see \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 85, ECHR 1999-IV, and Ertak v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a020764/92, \u00a7 131, ECHR 2000-V).",

Therefore, the Government\u2019s argument concerning the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention instead of Article 2 is inconsistent. However, leaving aside the contradictory nature of the Government\u2019s position in this regard and having already found that the applicants\u2019 abducted relative was under the control of State agents after abduction, the Court considers that the period of time which has elapsed since the person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may, along with other elements of circumstantial evidence before the Court, provide grounds to conclude that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that such a situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention (see, among other authorities, \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 cited above, \u00a7 86, and Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2000VI). Accordingly, the Court finds that Article 2 of the Convention applies and that the Government\u2019s objection in this respect should be rejected.",

In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been pending for a number of years without bringing about any significant developments as to the identities of the perpetrators or the fate of the applicants\u2019 missing brother. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings have been plagued by a combination of the defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012325). For instance, the investigation was subjected to a significant period of inactivity which further diminished the prospects of solving the crime. No meaningful steps were taken to verify the applicants\u2019 allegations such as the abductors\u2019 entry into the premises of the Avtury collective farm (see paragraph 9 above) and to question the head of the Avtury administration and the police officer about the abductors\u2019 passage into the premises of the military unit stationed on the outskirts of the village (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). No steps were taken to identify and question the servicemen of the OMON unit from St Petersburg concerning their alleged questioning of the abducted men (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above), as well as the servicemen who had manned the checkpoints in the vicinity of the settlement on the night of the abduction or the drivers of the military APCs used by the abductors.",
