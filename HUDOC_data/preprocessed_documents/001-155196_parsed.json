The Court further considers that the fact that the Government contested the authenticity of the applicant\u2019s complaints lodged with the prosecuting authorities, in a general way and without any evidence, could not give rise to circumstances justifying a decision to declare the application inadmissible as an abuse of the right of individual application.

Where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons under their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.

In particular, where an individual, when taken into police custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v.

As noted in paragraph 73 of the judgment, \u201cthe applicant presented a detailed description of his ill-treatment by agents of the MNS. In support of his claim, he submitted a photograph of his body taken, according to him, by his family immediately after his release from detention and a medical record of 1 October 2007\u201d (see also paragraphs 9-14 and 31 of the judgment). It seems to me that those elements constitute prima facie evidence of illtreatment. All the more so as the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant drew extensive media coverage (see paragraph 29).",
