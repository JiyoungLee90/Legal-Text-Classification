The hospital concerned was under an obligation to apply to a court for permission, indicating in the application the reasons for which the hospitalisation was sought and attaching a copy of the decision of a commission of psychiatrists. None of the above legal requirements was complied with in the present case, and the applicant was subjected to confinement and medical treatment in circumstances of complete arbitrariness. This finding alone would have been sufficient for the Court to consider that there has been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case.

In reaching this conclusion, they relied on the statements made by Doctor A.G., who submitted that he had seen the applicant on 25\u00a0February 2008, when the latter was brought to his office by the two police officers who had arrested him on the same date (see paragraph 18 above). The Court has serious reservations about the truthfulness of this statement, since Doctor A.G.\u2019s account was not confirmed by any of the other persons questioned. In particular, the police officers who had arrested the applicant on the evening of 25 February 2008 stated that they had taken him directly to the B\u0103l\u0163i psychiatric hospital (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant\u2019s family doctor submitted that it had been the applicant\u2019s sister who had obtained the document from Doctor A.G. (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant\u2019s sister submitted that Doctor A.G. had given her the document without seeing the applicant (see paragraph 16 above). Moreover, Doctor A.G.\u2019s account of the events is inconsistent with his own actions, namely with the fact that only two months after the applicant\u2019s release from the B\u0103l\u0163i psychiatric hospital, he issued him with a report confirming his mental health, without making any note that a mere two months earlier the applicant had been hospitalised in a psychiatric institution at his (Doctor A.G.\u2019s) own initiative (see paragraph 11 above).",

It is true that after his confinement in the B\u0103l\u0163i psychiatric hospital he was diagnosed with paranoid depression by the doctors treating him; however, it was not argued by the Government that those records contained information according to which the applicant presented any risk to himself or to other persons, and that therefore his mental disorder was of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement.",

The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, inter alia, Price v. the United Kingdom, no. 33394/96, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001-VII; Mouisel v. France, no.\u00a067263/01, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2002-IX; and Naumenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a042023/98, \u00a7 108, 10 February 2004). Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Klaas v.\u00a0, 22 September 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 269). To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences, or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161 in fine, Series A no. 25, and Labita, cited above, \u00a7 121).",

Austria, 24 September 1992, \u00a7\u00a082, Series A no.\u00a0244, and Naumenko, cited above, \u00a7 112).

In the circumstances of the present case, the Court sees no reasons to disagree with the applicant and notes that no medical necessity to subject the applicant to psychiatric treatment has been shown to exist and that his subjecting to psychiatric treatment was unlawful and arbitrary (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above). Moreover, the Court notes the considerable duration of the medical treatment which lasted for forty-one days and the fact that the applicant was not allowed having contact with the outside world during his confinement (see paragraph 8 above). In the Court\u2019s view such unlawful and arbitrary treatment was at the very least capable to arouse in the applicant feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority. Accordingly, the Court considers that the psychiatric treatment to which the applicant was subjected could amount at least to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.",
