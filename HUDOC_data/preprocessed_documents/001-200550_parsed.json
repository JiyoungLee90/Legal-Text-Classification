It is for the Court to ascertain that the proceedings, considered as a whole, were fair (see SA-Capital Oy v.\u00a0Finland, no. 5556/10, \u00a7 106, 14 February 2019). Fairness with regard to criminal proceedings also includes respecting the presumption of innocence. Article 6 \u00a7 2 requires,\u00a0inter alia, that when carrying out their duties, the members of a court should not start with the preconceived idea that the accused has committed the offence charged; the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and any doubt should benefit the accused. Thus, the presumption of innocence will be infringed where the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence (ibid, \u00a7\u00a0107 and the cases cited therein). Furthermore, while it is incompatible with Article 6 to base a conviction in criminal proceedings solely or mainly on an accused\u2019s silence or his refusal to answer questions or give evidence himself, in situations which clearly call for an explanation from the accused, his silence or other response can be taken into account in assessing the persuasiveness of the evidence adduced by the prosecution (ibid, \u00a7\u00a0108) for proving the defendant\u2019s guilt and for rebutting the presumption of innocence.",

Thus, while the trial judgment did not elaborate on that evidence, the Court considers that the presumption of innocence was rebutted in the present case. Therefore, the manner in which the applicant\u2019s guilt was substantiated was not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable, and the body of incriminating evidence was not so insubstantial that this amounted to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Moreira\u00a0Ferreira v.
