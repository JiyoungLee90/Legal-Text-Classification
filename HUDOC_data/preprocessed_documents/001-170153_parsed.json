The Court also observes that although the applicant had lodged a complaint on 4 June 2008 it was only on 2 October 2008, when his prison regime automatically changed owing to his imminent release, that he had been moved to a section of the prison which had a properly equipped recreation yard.",

The judgment of 27 October 2009 of the Arad County Court relied on by the Government does not concern the issue of material conditions of detention. Moreover, the Court has already found that in case of complaints about the material conditions of detention a separate civil action for tort did not constitute an effective remedy (see Florea v.\u00a0Romania, no. 37186/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37-45, 14 September 2010). The Court also held that a civil action for damages based on the Romanian general tort law requires proof of negligence on the part of the person complained against (see, among others, Lazariu v. Romania, no. 31973/03, \u00a7\u00a7 88 and 89, 13 November 2014). In this context and having in mind that the postsentencing judge already considered that there was no legal obligation to equip the recreation yards as requested by the applicant (see paragraph\u00a010 above), the Court is not convinced about the prospects of success of such an action in the specific situation of the current case.",
