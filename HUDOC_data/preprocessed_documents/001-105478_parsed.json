For instance, Article 3 was found to be infringed where, without sufficient security justifications, the applicants were placed in a metal cage separating them from the general public during a criminal trial against them (Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 1704/06, \u00a7\u00a7 99-102, 27 January 2009) or were subjected to unjustified public exposure in handcuffs (see, for example, Erdo\u011fan Ya\u011f\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 45-48, and Gorodnichev v.

On the contrary, according to his submissions, undisputed by the Government, the announcement of the confinement order caught the first applicant by surprise, as he had allegedly obtained a psychiatric fitness certificate two days before the events in question and reported to the police believing in good faith that he would obtain a rifle permit. Further, the first applicant was not afforded an opportunity to contact either the chief of the police department or his advocate before the measure was applied. The decision-making process leading to his confinement in the present case therefore lacked basic procedural safeguards, casting serious doubts concerning the therapeutic necessity for the measure at issue and even more serious doubts concerning the need for its forceful execution.",

It is clear from the case-file that he refused to get into the ambulance car and vigorously demanded access to his lawyer and the chief of the police department to protest against his confinement. However, it does not appear that he attempted to inflict any physical harm on anyone or to escape from the police quarters. In view of this, the Court considers that this case is to be distinguished from those where the applicants resisted violently when faced with a simple obligation to submit to the legitimate requirements of law enforcement officers - an obligation which is part of the general civil duty in a democratic society (see Berli\u0144ski v. Poland, nos.\u00a027715/95 and 30209/96, \u00a7 62, 20 June 2002, and Barta v. Hungary, no.\u00a026137/04, \u00a7 71, 10 April 2007). The Court further notes that it is unclear whether the police officers acted in good faith, given the information about the applicant\u2019s alleged dangerousness, and to what extent they were bound by the psychiatrist\u2019s request. In particular, the Government did not inform the Court whether any specific regulations in this respect existed. However, in the Court\u2019s view, in the context of the situation, the manner in which they reacted to the first applicant\u2019s demands for clarification concerning the legality of his confinement order, namely, by applying force to put him in the ambulance car, was manifestly disproportionate.",

Russia, no. 3933/04, \u00a7\u00a7 162-165, 29 July 2010). In the present case, the Court takes note that both the psychiatric professionals and the police officers involved in the incident had time to plan their operation well in advance, including to prepare for potential violence and resistance on the part of the first applicant, who was allegedly in need of in-patient treatment on account of his aggressive and uncooperative behaviour. Further, the Court remarks that the confrontation took place on the premises of the police station, where the officers, specially trained in the art of combat, outnumbered the two applicants, who had no particular force or skills to resist them. The officers were placed in a considerably superior position in terms of controlling the situation. Based on the above considerations, the Court finds that, irrespective of whether the first applicant\u2019s injuries were self-inflicted by banging against various objects, as argued by the Government, or inflicted by the police officers, as suggested by him, the Government have failed to show that these injuries could have been caused by an application of force which was appropriate in the circumstances.

The Court considers that analysis of the alleged procedural shortcomings of the applicant\u2019s psychiatric examination was of crucial significance in the present case. The Government likewise did not provide any plausible explanation as to conformity of the procedural aspect of the applicant\u2019s psychiatric examination with applicable law. The Court therefore considers that the establishment of the first applicant\u2019s diagnosis was not in accordance with the law.",

The Government have not presented any documents indicating when and how either the first applicant or his lawyer had been notified of the hearing of 30 April 2002. The Court considers that regard being had to the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure concerning notification of hearings (see paragraph 42 above), the general remark in the hearing record that the first applicant had been duly notified of it, on which the Government relies as the proof of such notification, is not sufficient to rebut the first applicant\u2019s submissions (see Strizhak, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-41 and, by contrast, Shytik, cited above).",

Furthermore, the Court of Appeal admitted new evidence in the proceedings, on which the first applicant had not been able to comment before the bench (see paragraph 14 above). The hearing ended in a reversal of the first-instance court judgment, the Court of Appeal having reassessed not only the law, but also the facts of the case (that is, whether or not M.
