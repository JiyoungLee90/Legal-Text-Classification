In particular, as held in judgment no. 401/2008 of the Constitutional Court, the legislature had intended for the increase in question to be a pension increase, and not an independent benefit.

In dismissing the applicants\u2019 complaints, the Court of Cassation therefore held that the question of constitutional legitimacy raised by the applicants, as well as the entry into force of Law no. 244/2007, were completely irrelevant.
