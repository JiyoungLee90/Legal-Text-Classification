On 15 December 1999 it had been sold for RUR 3,000. The court found that, in breach of the requirement of the Enforcement Act, the applicant had not been informed of the enforcement proceedings, the bailiff had not attempted to identify his other assets or money, the creditor had not been offered to keep the car or to contest the sale price of the car. The court noted the decision of the  prosecutor's office of 22 October 2002 whereby criminal proceedings against the court bailiff were discontinued. The decision established that the bailiff might have been guilty of professional negligence (Article 293 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code), but prosecution was time-barred. The court ruled that there was a causal link between the bailiff's unlawful actions and the pecuniary damage caused to the applicant, and ordered the Ministry of Justice, as the bailiff's employer, to reimburse RUR\u00a06,858 to the applicant (the difference between the car's valuation and sale price) and to pay RUR\u00a0500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, RUR 2,000 for legal costs and also to bear court fees.",

Nor did he contest the lawfulness of the decision to seize his car as the object of that breach. The alleged violation of his property rights stemmed not from those actions by the domestic authorities but rather from the sequence of later events that ultimately led to the loss of ownership of the car.

That contention is based on the assumption that the applicant would have lost title to his car irrespective of the course of enforcement proceedings. The Court finds that this assumption does not have a sufficient logical and legal basis. The applicant was required to pay a specific sum of money to the State equal to the car's value. He was not, however, required to relinquish ownership of the car, which was not subject to any forfeiture or confiscation order and merely served as security for the payment of the fine. If the applicant had paid the fine after his appeal had failed at last instance, he would have recovered possession of the car (see paragraph 31 above). As it happened in the present case, the applicant was not afforded the option of paying the fine in cash because the car was sold when the appeal was still pending. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the sequence of events culminating in the sale of the applicant's car amounted to interference with his right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

The same can be said about the handover of the car to the bailiff, which did not involve a transfer of ownership as enforcement could be stayed at any time and the car returned to the applicant. However, the sale of the car had the effect of depriving the applicant of ownership and brought the situation into the ambit of the second rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning deprivation of possessions.",

In a letter of 24 May 2001 the transport prosecutor determined that the customs office had been aware of the applicant's appeal to a court at least since 24 September 1999 but it had taken no steps to forward that information to the bailiff or to suspend the enforcement proceedings, in breach of the requirements of Article 376 of the Customs Code (see paragraphs 19 and 31 above). That indicates that the conduct of the Podolsk Customs Office was not in accordance with law.",

The failure to inform the applicant about the opening of the proceedings affecting his possessions and to ensure his effective participation should be regarded as a most serious failing, undermining the substance of the guarantees of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The bailiff had acted unlawfully in that he had not notified the applicant about the institution of the proceedings or advised him of the right to be a party, had not attempted to identify the applicant's other assets prior to billing the car for sale, and had not offered the car to the creditor (the customs office) after the initial statutory two-month period had expired. Moreover, the bailiff had reduced the sale price on four occasions, without informing either the applicant or the customs office. The prosecutor's office, the domestic courts and the respondent Government, in their observations on the merits of the case, recognised that the bailiff's actions had not been in accordance with the law.",
