Rebutting the Government\u2019s argument as to the impossibility of enforcing that ruling for objective reasons, the representatives submitted a letter dated 13 January 2006 from the Director of the Asatiani Psychiatric Hospital in Tbilisi, according to which it had been fully possible for psychiatrists from that hospital to conduct a forensic examination on the premises of the Poti Psychiatric Hospital at the material time. The representatives further stated that the fact that the applicant had been admitted to the psychiatric wing of the prison hospital for almost two years, during which period he had systematically been treated with tranquilisers, antidepressants and antipsychotics, had amounted to an acknowledgment by the authorities of his mental illness. The representatives insisted that, given the regularity of their client\u2019s suicide attempts in Zugdidi Prison and in the prison hospital, the prison authority should be suspected of having been negligent with respect to the applicant. Thus, as soon as the applicant had first attempted suicide by slashing his wrists, he should immediately have been transferred to the prison hospital and placed under constant and appropriate medical supervision. However, even after the applicant\u2019s belated transfer to that hospital, he had managed to persist with his suicidal behaviour by overdosing on drugs, which pointed to a failure of the prison hospital staff to restrict the applicant\u2019s unregulated access to strong drugs.",

In this respect, it is incumbent upon the relevant domestic authorities to ensure, in particular, that diagnosis and care have been prompt and accurate, and that supervision by proficient medical personnel has been regular and systematic and involved a comprehensive therapeutic strategy. The mere fact of a deterioration of an applicant\u2019s state of health, albeit capable of raising, at an initial stage, certain doubts concerning the adequacy of the applicant\u2019s treatment in prison, cannot suffice, by itself, for a finding of a violation of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, if, on the other hand, it can be established that the relevant domestic authorities have in a timely fashion provided all reasonably available medical care in a conscientious effort to hinder development of the disease in question (see, among other authorities, Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 69-71). A prison authority\u2019s failure to keep comprehensive records concerning a detained applicant\u2019s state of health or the respondent Government\u2019s failure to submit such records in their entirety would consequently allow the Court to draw inferences as to the merits of the applicant\u2019s allegations of a lack of adequate medical care (see, for instance, Gladkiy v.

However, it was not until 14\u00a0June 2006 that the applicant underwent such an examination for the first time, the results of which then permitted a diagnosis that he suffered from an organic personality disorder (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). In this regard, the Court attaches importance to the relevant authorities\u2019 refusal to implement immediately the Zugdidi District Court\u2019s ruling of 20 January 2006 concerning the applicant\u2019s placement in the psychiatric hospital for the purposes of a forensic psychiatric examination (see paragraph 12 above).

Furthermore, having regard to the parties\u2019 submissions on the question, the Court cannot conclude, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, that the enforcement of that ruling was objectively impossible (see paragraphs 53 and 57 above).

Prior to that date, however, as can be inferred from the Government\u2019s failure to disclose any medical records accounting for the applicant\u2019s treatment during the preceding period, he had not been provided with any meaningful psychiatric care for his personality disorder and depression on an out-patient basis, either in Tbilisi no. 5 prison or in Zugdidi Prison. This conclusion is also consistent with the general picture of the level of psychiatric care in prisons in , as was documented at the material time by the relevant international observers (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above). Notably, the Court is mindful that the only way of obtaining a minimum level of psychiatric or psychological treatment for mentally disturbed prisoners at that time was to have them transferred to a prison hospital, which, in the applicant\u2019s case, did not happen until 18\u00a0August 2006.",

The authority was too late in obtaining the correct diagnosis of the applicant\u2019s condition, which failure obviously delayed the beginning of the treatment as well. Of particular concern was the relevant domestic authorities\u2019 unjustified refusal to implement the Zugdidi District Court\u2019s ruling of 20 January 2006 concerning the applicant\u2019s admission to the psychiatric hospital for a medical examination. Furthermore, whilst being perfectly aware of the applicant\u2019s self-harming tendencies, the prison authority could not be said to have exercised the necessary vigilant control over his behaviour, thus failing, contrary to its positive obligations, to diminish the risk of suicide attempts in prison. These findings are sufficient for the Court to conclude, without exploring the other aspects of the case, that there has been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the failure to provide timely and adequate care for the applicant\u2019s mental health problems in prison.",

Notably, he was repeatedly consulted by a cardiologist, a vascular surgeon and other appropriate medical specialists, underwent the necessary medical examinations, including electrocardiography and scans of the vascular system, was administered cardiology drugs and so on (see paragraph 33 above and compare with Goginashvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 73-76; and contrast, for instance, with Testa v. Croatia, no. 20877/04, \u00a7 52, 12 July 2007, and Poghosyan v. Georgia, no.\u00a09870/07, \u00a7 57, 24 February 2009).",

However, the applicant initially turned down that offer, making certain additional demands, thus needlessly further complicating the situation (see paragraphs 39 and 58 above). However, the Court recalls that Article\u00a03 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as requiring a prisoner\u2019s every wish and preference regarding medical treatment to be accommodated. In this as in other matters, the practical demands of legitimate detention may impose restrictions a\u00a0prisoner will have to accept (see Mathew v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a024919/03, \u00a7\u00a0186, ECHR\u00a02005IX). Despite the applicant\u2019s initially uncooperative conduct, the prison authority finally managed to have him transferred on 3 April 2009 to the private hospital specialised in cardiology treatment. In that private medical setting, the applicant underwent numerous extensive examinations and was administered, with the State bearing their cost, various cardiology drugs, as a result of which treatment his condition considerably improved and he was then discharged back to the prison on 15\u00a0May 2009 (see paragraph 43 above and contrast with, for example, Pitalev v. Russia, no. 34393/03, \u00a7 57, 30\u00a0July 2009, and Akhmetov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a037463/04, \u00a7 81, 1 April 2010).",

Admittedly, that treatment did not start shortly after the relevant diagnosis had been made (see paragraph above). However, as the facts of the case show, that delay was apparently deliberate and accorded with the attending doctors\u2019 professional caution. Notably, given the often deleterious effects of anti-HCV drugs on patients\u2019 mental stability, it was first necessary to have the applicant\u2019s personality disorder and symptoms of depression successfully treated. This is exactly what happened in the applicant\u2019s situation (see paragraphs 43 and 45 above and compare with Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, \u00a7 83, 3 March 2009). In other words, the prison authority made use of a truly comprehensive therapeutic strategy to treat the applicant\u2019s HCV (compare with Sarban v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a03456/05, \u00a7\u00a079, 4\u00a0October 2005, and Popov v.
