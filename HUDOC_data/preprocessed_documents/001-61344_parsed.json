Firstly, as a result of the 1999 amendment, the applicant was prevented for approximately three years and eight months from having his civil claim decided by a court. Secondly, the Liability Act of 2003 enables a court to proceed with the applicant's case, but nevertheless interferes with the applicant's previously established right to compensation from the State by imposing new conditions under which the State is liable for damage caused to the applicant's property.",
