The applicant, who had given diverging versions of the motive for his offence, had only admitted in 2005/2006, during his examination by a psychological and a psychiatric expert, that in his murder he had put into practice intensifying fantasies of exercising power over women by attacking their neck and by masturbating on their inanimate bodies.

In this twin-track system of sanctions, penalties (see Articles 38 et seq. of the Criminal Code) mainly consist of prison sentences and fines, which are fixed in accordance with the defendant\u2019s guilt (Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code). Measures of correction and prevention (see Articles 61 et seq. of the Criminal Code) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital (Article 63 of the Criminal Code), in a detoxification facility (Article 64 of the Criminal Code) or in preventive detention (Articles 66 et seq. of the Criminal Code). The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders and to protect the public from them. They may be imposed on criminally liable offenders in addition to their punishment (cf. Articles 63 et seq.). Such measures must, however, be proportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed, or expected to be committed, by the defendants, as well as to their dangerousness (Article 62 of the Criminal Code).",

Initially, a preventive detention order could only be made by a criminal court at the time of the defendant\u2019s conviction, additionally to a term of imprisonment. Under Article 66 of the Criminal Code, this required, in particular, that the criminal court had convicted the defendant of an offence of a certain gravity (as specified in the law) and that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, the defendant presented a danger to the general public. Under the law in force prior to 31 January 1998 (Article 67d \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code), the first period of preventive detention executed against a defendant could not exceed ten years.

As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of persons of unsound mind in Article 5 \u00a7 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court\u2019s case-law (see \u00a7\u00a7 138 and 143-56 of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment).

The\u00a0latter was a measure of correction and prevention, which was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt, but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender (see paragraphs 100-101 and 141-42 of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment). The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (ibid., paragraphs 102 and 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of penalty with that under the Convention.

Germany, cited above) the Federal Constitutional Court found that the detention of a person for being of unsound mind could be justified provided that the detention was effected in an appropriate psychiatric institution, which, in turn, required the mental disorder to be of corresponding intensity (see file nos. \u00a02\u00a0BvR 2302/11 and 2\u00a0BvR 1279/12, cited above).",

Out of a total of 58 inmates, 48 participated in individual counselling sessions, including 13 who were also involved in one of the above-mentioned group therapies and eleven who were involved in two treatment groups. Seven inmates refused to take part in any therapy, two were new arrivals and not assigned yet to a treatment programme and one was apparently not capable of participating in any treatment programme (due to brain damage). The team of specialised staff comprised three psychologists and four social workers (one on each floor). The delegation was informed that, based on the staff/inmate ratio applied in sociotherapeutic institutions, the unit for preventive detention would need at least six full-time psychologists. (...) The head of the psychology service indicated that, due to the limited staff resources, it was not possible to organise individual therapy on a weekly basis (...), that it was not possible to reach out to those who were lacking any motivation and were unwilling to engage themselves in therapeutic measures and that it was not possible to organise milieu therapy in an effective manner.",

Out of 40 inmates, only 24 were receiving individual therapy and only eight were participating in group therapy. It is also regrettable that no efforts had thus far been made by the prison administration to organise group sessions for art, music or drama therapy which may be particularly beneficial for those inmates who are unwilling or unable to participate in any other group therapy programme.

The focus of the new overall concept of preventive detention now lay on the individualised medical and therapeutic treatment of the detainees. The\u00a0statistical material available (see paragraph 91 above) showed that many of the detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered subsequently had been released since the M. v.

The\u00a0interpretation of that term was too broad and imprecise. The EPLN noted that according to the Federal Constitutional Court, the notion of mental disorder under German law also covered non-pathological disorders. However, the term persons of unsound mind, or ali\u00e9n\u00e9 in the French text, designated persons who were at least in a severe pathological state and whose capacity for assessing the wrongfulness of their acts was non-existent or at least diminished. Moreover, in order to be convicted, the persons concerned had to have been criminally liable at the time of their offence, which was incompatible with the subsequent finding that these persons were of unsound mind.",

This stance is further comparable to the approach taken in the assessment of the compliance of conditions of detention with Article 3, where a change in the conditions of detention is also determinative for assessing compliance with the prohibition on degrading treatment (see, in particular, Mur\u0161i\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no. 7334/13, \u00a7\u00a7 136 et seq., ECHR\u00a02016).

To\u00a0render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 307A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 317B; and Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7 81). The wording of the second sentence of Article 7 \u00a7 1 indicates that the starting-point \u2013 and thus a very weighty factor (see Glien, cited above, \u00a7 121; and Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7 150) \u2013 in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question was imposed following conviction for a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 28; Van \u00a0der \u00a0Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 142). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may, just as measures which must be classified as a penalty, have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, \u00a7 32; Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7 82; and Bergmann, cited above, \u00a7 150).",

It further found that the provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention as they then stood failed, however, to meet the constitutional requirement of differentiating between purely preventive measures of correction and prevention, such as preventive detention, and penalties, such as prison sentences (see paragraphs 70-72 above).

Furthermore, his detention was subject to regular judicial reviews at relatively short intervals (see paragraph 64 above). That increased the probability that the measure would not last overly long.

He had therefore been partial and the applicant had had reason to believe that Judge P.\u2019s lack of impartiality subsisted in the proceedings at issue in which P. had again been on the bench.",

That discussion, which took place just after the Regional Court had delivered its first judgment ordering the applicant\u2019s retrospective preventive detention on 22 June 2009, concerned the applicant\u2019s possible future transfer to a psychiatric hospital. It appears uncontested between the parties, and the Court agrees with that interpretation, that the remark allegedly made by Judge P. within that context to the effect that the applicant\u2019s female counsel should be careful that the applicant would not visit and \u201cthank\u201d her when released was to be understood as meaning that Judge P. considered that there was a risk that the applicant would commit a serious violent or sexual offence against his lawyer (similar to the one he had been found guilty of) if released.",

Assuming, as the national courts did, that he actually made the alleged remark, he did so immediately after the Regional Court, of which he was a member, had ordered the applicant\u2019s retrospective preventive detention as it considered that the applicant was still suffering from violent sexual fantasies and that there was a high risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences, including murder for sexual gratification, if released ....

In other words, the third Engel criterion \u2013 which constitutes the principal source of inspiration in the present case \u2013 is not flexible or changeable but inflexible and rigid.

Secondly, the deferred preventive detention system was expanded. Under certain circumstances, deferred preventive detention under Article 66a of the Criminal Code became possible for offenders who are only sentenced to a five-year prison term.

Germany. Since referring to Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) did not seem to pose the same problem with respect to retrospective legislation, the German legislator decided to ground the confinement of the very same population (except for the release of some minor cases) on the legal purpose of providing therapy for \u201cpersons of unsound mind\u201d, seemingly detaching it from the offences that were the original basis for their detention.

An offender of unsound mind is sent, under a hospital detention order, to a forensic psychiatric hospital (Article 63 of the Criminal Code) after an expert concludes that there is a danger of further offences as a consequence of a mental disorder. An offender is sent into preventive detention (Article 66 of the Criminal Code) when there is no underlying mental disorder, only a vicious tendency which could lead to the commission of future offences. Article 63 was aimed at the \u201cmad\u201d offender (that is to say an insane dangerous offender who has committed a criminal offence owing to a mental illness), while Article 66 targeted the \u201cbad\u201d offender (namely a sane dangerous offender who repeatedly commits serious offences (Gewohnheitsverbrecher) and is considered as \u201cuntreatable\u201d (unverbesserlich).

Furthermore, Article 67 of the Criminal Code lays down the so-called vicarious system. In case of a mental hospital order or an addiction treatment order, the measure as a rule has to be executed before the prison sentence. When a measure is executed while a prison sentence is still open for execution, the time spent in the clinic in execution of the measure will be counted as prison time up to a total of two-thirds of the prison sentence.

In fact, the German parliamentarians engaged first in a policy of \u201ctransubstantiating\u201d preventive detention into a non-criminal law, a non-punitive measure of therapy placement in order to safeguard its autonomy from imprisonment and above all its retrospective applicability. Subsequently, in its judgment of 4 May 2011, the Constitutional Court based the further confinement of those who were subjected to retrospective preventive detention on the conditions set out in the Therapy Placement Act. In practice, this resulted in their continued detention, but not in their placement in therapy, which would have to be ordered by a civil court and in accordance with civil law. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court referred to a new law (the Therapy Placement Act) for the justification of the continuance of preventive detention, including detainees under the juvenile law, for which it had acknowledged a violation of the principle of legitimate expectation (albeit not of the prohibition of retrospective legislation) in the very same judgment. In so doing, the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment produced a retrospective cure of preventive detention even though it explicitly resulted from a new perception of Sicherungsverwahrte as people of \u201cunsound mind\u201d and a seemingly ex nunc perspective on their dangerousness and the necessity of their future treatment.",

In fact, the Karlsruhe judges considered the problem of unsafe empirical evidence as a specific ground for the distance requirement and the execution of preventive detention according to this requirement, but failed to take into account that same unsafe aspect with regard to prison sentences. These problems are compounded by recent developments in psychiatry and psychology which have triggered a massive expansion of diagnoses under the category of mental disorders.

Under such systems, protective measures can be imposed in addition to the penalty assigned for the committed crime. The second group comprises sixteen States which, while sentencing such offenders, nevertheless impose measures that permit the sentence to be served in a specialised psychiatric institution. A third group includes five States where individuals who commit a crime while suffering from a mental disorder which requires compulsory mental health treatment must be treated under the ordinary civil regime for the mentally ill. The focus of the research study is on the first group. Of the ten countries that make up the first category, six require the sentencing court\u2019s judgment to comprise either an order for the preventive measure itself or the possibility of adopting the measure by the end of the prison sentence, three allow the measure to be imposed after the sentence and before the termination of the execution of the sentence, and one allows both, depending on the applicable regime.",

The accessibility requirement is only examined thoroughly when there are clear signs to the contrary, accessibility being assumed when the offence is included in a criminal code. Furthermore, the case-law has been rather undemanding on the review of the wording of the statutory provision for the purpose of assessing its foreseeability, often accepting vaguely worded offences, because the impugned statutory concepts are \u201cmatters of common knowledge and widely understood\u201d. The Court\u2019s limited standard of protection is further loosened by the consideration of sufficiently consistent interpretative case-law at the time of the offence, which can satisfy the foreseeability requirement in case of vaguely worded offences or even of common-law offences, which breach the lex scripta requirement.

Hence, there is no added value in distinguishing between the two requirements. The severity of the offence is also invoked as an element of foreseeability, considering the criminalisation of certain serious offences as \u201cobvious\u201d.

In other words, the lex stricta and the lex certa requirements conflate in the same kind of subjective foreseeability test. Worse still, this standard lends itself to theoretical and practical dogmatic confusion, since it mingles issues of different nature, namely the principle of legality and the principle of guilt (ignorantia legis non excusat, mistake of law, Verbotsirrtum).

Similarly, punishment is said to prevent crime generally, through deterrence of would-be offenders (negative general prevention) and the signalling of norm enforcement (general positive prevention). Therefore, the \u201cpreventive\u201d purpose of a measure by no means rules out its punitive character.

Of course, this rhetorical question could be further complicated: how many kitchen units, how many separate bathrooms, how many TV sets or body-building machines, how many doctors and nurses, how many visiting hours or phone calls should there be for a preventive detention unit to change nature and for detention therein to change its \u201cpurpose\u201d?

But a State coercive measure that has the commission of a criminal offence as a \u201cprecondition\u201d can only be a penalty. Not only is preventive detention subject to the requirement of a criminal conviction, but also the criminal offence or offences committed must be of a certain kind and gravity. According to the Juvenile Courts Act, these orders can only be directed against people sentenced to at least seven years\u2019 imprisonment for crimes against life, physical integrity or sexual self-determination, or some other specific offences. Indeed, it is telling that the majority did find Article 7 applicable to this case, and therefore the application admissible.

Indeed, the applicant has been under retrospective preventive detention (and previously under provisional preventive detention) for ten years now as a \u201cscapegoat\u201d to quench the punitive needs of the community.",

The deferential approach towards domestic criminal courts leaves extensive leeway for repressive, case-dependent application of the principle of legality.

By putting its uncontested moral authority behind the political choice made by the legislator in the \u201cAct on Therapy and Detention of Mentally Disturbed Violent Offenders\u201d, the Constitutional Court acted as a facilitator of the political majority, not as a guarantor of the fundamental rights of the Basic Law read in a public-international-law-friendly manner. By acquiescing to a strategy of apparent compliance with the Convention guarantees, while in substance departing from the core message of the Court that Sicherungsverwahrte have a Convention guarantee to nulla poena sine lege praevia, the Karlsruhe court chose to align itself schematically with Berlin, and not with Strasbourg.",

But this construction was applied only to historic cases of preventive detention, resulting for those cases in the intended result of keeping the targeted detainees in custody. The Karlsruhe judges did not apply this construction to future preventive detention cases. For the latter, the Constitutional Court only imposed the requirement of a distinction to be respected, but did not draw any connection with the necessity of a mental disorder. This is the reason why, as the applicant claimed, only a minority of the persons in preventive detention in the new Straubing centre were detained as mental health patients. Since the criteria for categorising these institutions as being institutions for mental health patients follow legal categories, and not medical ones, it is more than comprehensible to ask whether these institutions are in fact also psychiatric. The same institution cannot simultaneously be a psychiatric institution for some detainees and not for others. If for the majority of those detained in such an institution it is not reasonable to operate it as institution for mental-health patients, it would have to be ascertained whether it can be and actually is a psychiatric institution for the minority. On the contrary, if such an institution were a psychiatric institution, there would be a pressing need to justify the confinement of non-mental-health-patients (the \u201cregular\u201d Sicherungsverwahrten) in this environment, because it is inappropriate to treat such detainees as if they were mental health patients. The Government failed to meet this need in the present case.",

If human rights have a basic purpose, it is precisely to be \u201ctrump cards\u201d that protect individuals\u2019 fundamental rights against the oppressive actions of ill-advised majorities. This is particularly true in the case of easily disposable minorities, such as prisoners or migrants. Politicians that emerge from these majorities should comply with international human rights in general and with the Convention in particular, since every State official is bound by human rights law and the Convention contributes to promoting a \u201cjoint European development of fundamental rights\u201d (gemeineurop\u00e4ische Grundrechtsentwicklung).

Sadly, now it is the turn of the German Federal Constitutional Court and its unapologetically faithless reading of M. and its progeny in the sense of the inapplicability of the principle nulla poena sine lege praevia to preventive detention. By rubber-stamping the Karlsruhe court\u2019s stance, against the crystal-clear and longstanding standards of customary international and treaty law and the consensus reigning in comparative law, the Court is taking one step more towards the legal periphery in Europe. While finding that the imposed preventive detention was a retrospective \u201cpenalty\u201d in breach of Articles 7 and 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, I plead for the central role of the Court in the defence of modern criminal law principles and the safeguard of human rights in Europe.",
