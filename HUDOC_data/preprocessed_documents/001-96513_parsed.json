As a general rule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court\u2019s task is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (see, among many authorities, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a028-29, ECHR 1999-I). On the basis of the materials submitted by the applicant company, the Court notes that, within the framework of the tax litigation, the applicant company was able to introduce all necessary arguments in defence of its interests, and that the judicial authorities considered them at three levels of jurisdiction. The decisions of the domestic courts do not appear unreasonable or arbitrary.\u00a0\u00a0It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

In the applicant company\u2019s view, had the proceedings in its case not been protracted, it would have had a wider range of available domestic remedies.",

Given that the assessment of the grounds for cassation is a matter over which the Lithuanian Supreme Court has sole jurisdiction, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the applicant company\u2019s cassation appeal would have been accepted for examination by the Supreme Court, had the former lodged it while the old Code of Civil Procedure was still in effect. Again, the Court\u2019s task is only to determine whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (see, for example, Kukkonen v.  (no. 2), no. 47628/06, \u00a7\u00a025, 13 January 2009).

The Court has likewise held that the Contracting States must be free to empower tax authorities to impose fines even in large amounts (see, mutatis mutandis, Bendenoun v. , \n24 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a046, Series A no. 284). Although the fine imposed on the applicant company could be considered heavy, no convincing reasons have been put forward to the Court to explain why it cannot be regarded as compatible with the above-mentioned legitimate State interests.
