He reiterated the argument he had made before the appellate court that spearguns were not weapons and that he had therefore been convicted on account of an act which had not constituted an offence under domestic law (see paragraph 8 above). In addition, he criticised the position of the High Court for Minor Offences (see paragraph 9 above) that spearguns were bowstring weapons and thus weapons within the meaning of the Weapons Act. Specifically, he submitted that a mere visual examination of the speargun confiscated from him would have revealed that it was band-powered rather than bowstring-powered, and that it was exclusively intended for fishing.",

In keeping with this principle of harmonious interpretation of the Convention, the Court has held, for example, that the notion of \u201cpenal procedure\u201d in the text of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be interpreted in the light of the general principles concerning the corresponding words \u201ccriminal charge\u201d and \u201cpenalty\u201d in Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention respectively (see, for example, Sergey Zolotukhin v.

Therefore, the three criteria set out in the case of Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 82, Series A no. 22 (and subsequently reaffirmed in Jussila v.

In so doing, the Court will, as indicated above (see paragraph 28), have regard to the three alternative criteria laid down in Engel (see Engel and Others, cited above, \u00a7 82, and Jussila, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31): (a)\u00a0the classification of the offence under domestic law, (b)\u00a0the nature of the offence, and (c) the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring (see \u017daja, cited above, \u00a7 86).

What is more, the fine imposed on the applicant was punitive in nature as it was intended to serve as a penalty to deter reoffending. The Court finds these elements sufficient for a conclusion that the minor offence in question was of a criminal character and thus attracted the guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtochiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, and Jussila, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

As a corollary of the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty, the provisions of the criminal law are to be strictly construed (see Dragotoniu and Militaru-Pidhorni, cited above, \u00a7 40). Article 7 thus also embodies the principle of lex stricta according to which the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment to an extent amounting to analogy (see, for example, Vasiliauskas, cited above, \u00a7 154).",

More generally, the Court points out that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation.

To accord a lesser power of review to the Court would render Article 7 devoid of purpose (ibid., \u00a7 52). Accordingly, in such circumstances the Court must have jurisdiction to decide whether the relevant provision of criminal law has been complied with, as its application to an act not covered by that provision would directly result in a conflict with Article 7 of the Convention (see \u017daja, cited above, \u00a7 92).",
