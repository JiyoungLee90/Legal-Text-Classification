The parties waiting for legal-aid services cannot be held at fault for shortcomings in the system. A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it. A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within seven days from the date on which the legal-aid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal (4\u00a0March 2005, II UZ 72/04; 27\u00a0June 2000, I CZ 62/00), or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local Bar Association (11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01; 17\u00a0November 1998, II UZ 122/98; 11\u00a0October 2001, IV CZ 163/01;",

The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to the Supreme Court for legally-aided parties genuine and effective.

The Court further observes that the second legal-aid lawyer, who was assigned to the case after the first one had requested the court to release him from the obligation to represent the applicant, informed the applicant of his refusal by a letter of 29 February 2008. The applicant was therefore left with no realistic opportunity of having his case brought to and argued before the Supreme Court by the legal-aid lawyer within the time-limit provided for by law (see Sia\u0142kowska v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a08932/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0115-116, 22\u00a0March 2007).",
