Decisions by the authorities to which applications were made under section 35 were adopted without adversarial proceedings and no appeal to the ordinary courts or the Court of Cassation lay against them. The lack of such a remedy had, moreover, already been noted and criticised by the European Court in the Calogero Diana v. Italy and Domenichini v. Italy judgments (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V).",

Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, Klaas v. , 22\u00a0September 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 269). To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 161 in fine, Series A no.\u00a025, and Labita v.

The Court cannot rule out the possibility that in particularly serious cases situations may arise where the proper administration of criminal justice requires remedies to be taken in the form of humanitarian measures (see Matencio v.

Furthermore, the Court has held that detaining a person suffering from tetraplegia in conditions inappropriate to her state of health amounted to degrading treatment (see Price, cited above, \u00a7 30). In these circumstances, the Court must take account of three factors in particular in assessing whether the continued detention of an applicant is compatible with his or her state of health where the latter is giving cause for concern. These are: (a)\u00a0the prisoner\u2019s condition; (b) the quality of care provided; and (c) whether or not the applicant should continue to be detained in view of his or her state of health (see Farbtuhs v.

(no. 2) (no. 25498/94, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09496, ECHR 2000X), the Court, while acknowledging that the right to an effective remedy was not infringed merely by a failure to comply with a statutory time-limit, concluded that the systematic failure to comply with the ten-day time-limit imposed on the court responsible for the execution of sentences by Law no. 354 of 1975 on prison administration was liable to considerably reduce, and indeed practically nullify, the impact of judicial review of the decrees issued by the Minister of Justice. The Court arrived at this conclusion by taking account of two factors in particular, namely the limited period of validity of each decree imposing the special regime and the fact that the Minister of Justice could issue a new decree without being bound by any decision the court responsible for the execution of sentences might have taken to rescind all or part of the restrictions imposed by the previous decree. In , the Minister of Justice had issued new decrees reintroducing the restrictions struck down by the court responsible for the execution of sentences immediately after the expiry of the period of validity of the impugned decrees.",

As regards the supposedly similar situations of other Italian prisoners detained under the special regime (see paragraphs 64 to 66 of the judgment), the fact that Mr\u00a0Enea used a wheelchair and had to remain in the prison hospital between June 2000 and February 2005 leads us to conclude that his situation was not comparable to theirs. We are more inclined to follow the conclusions of the Mathew judgment, especially the Court\u2019s concern \u201cthat, despite a request to that effect from the applicant, no attempt appears to have been made to find a place of detention appropriate to the applicant ...\u201d (see Mathew v. the , no. 24919/03, \u00a7 204, ECHR 2005-IX). The prison hospital was not, to our mind, an appropriate place in which to detain Mr Enea for several years, even taking into account the potential danger posed by the applicant as a member of a mafia-type criminal organisation (compare Farbtuhs v. Latvia, no. 4672/02, \u00a7 53, 2 December 2004, and Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, \u00a7 38, 15 January 2004).",

The assessment of the minimum threshold of severity required in order to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention is a matter of subjective opinion. In our opinion, this threshold was attained.",
