However, the Court notes that by November 2001 all necessary pieces of expert evidence were taken and therefore the alleged complexity on points of facts could in no way prolong the proceedings up to the present day.

Therefore, it considers that the delay in the proceedings was mainly caused by the repeated re-examination of the case. Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, it observes that, since remittal is usually ordered because of errors committed by lower courts, the repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency in the judicial system (Wierciszewska v. Poland, no.\u00a041431/98, \u00a7\u00a046, 25\u00a0November\u00a02003). Moreover, it is the role of the domestic courts to manage their proceedings so that they are expeditious and effective (see Scordino v.  (no. 1) [GC], no.\u00a036813/97, \u00a7\u00a0183, ECHR 2006-...).",

Another flaw was a repeated failure to examine the case by a panel of judges (see paragraph\u00a024).
