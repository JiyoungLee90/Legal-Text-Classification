Essentially, they relied on the following three main points in support of their position: 1)\u00a0the applicant\u2019s ticket was bought in Uzbekistan at the request of the competent authorities; 2) the ticket was bought with an expired passport and the same passport was used for crossing the Russian border, which would have been impossible without involvement of the security agencies; 3) the Uzbek law-enforcement authorities were aware of the applicant\u2019s arrival, immediately arrested him and transferred to a pre-trial detention facility (see paragraphs 13-14 above).",
