His psychotic disorders were described as an acute delirious episode by the ERIC team and he made an initial suicide attempt on 2\u00a0July 2000 by phlebotomy. The suicide attempt may have taken the form of self-mutilation in a delusional state. It is also legitimate to wonder whether his assault on a warder, in the days that followed, was not likewise part of a pathological acting-out process. A course of neuroleptic treatment was immediately started, which seems to have been effective in that Mr Renolde\u2019s speech became more coherent. At the same time, he was placed in the punishment block. If his state of health was compatible with detention, we do not consider that placement in the punishment block could actually have worsened his psychological condition, since the dominant disorders were not depressive but psychotic. It remains to be determined whether such disorders could have been treated satisfactorily in detention, bearing in mind that the medication was handed to the prisoner only twice a week and thus left at his disposal. In view of his lack of awareness of the disorders, it would perhaps have been preferable to have supplied him with the medication every day and to have supervised his taking it.",

It cannot therefore be ruled out that this poor medicine compliance might have contributed to the suicide, which may have been committed in a state of delirium. However, even if Mr Renolde was no longer under medication, none of the members of the team, including the nurse who met him on the day of his suicide, noted any resurgence of delirium, any incoherent behaviour or any major signs of dissociation. The suicide attempt cannot be solely ascribed to psychotic disorders. It may quite conceivably have taken place at a time of legitimate despair or sadness in a person who readily resorted to acting-out (suicide attempt on 2 July, assault on 5 July, suicide on 20 July).",

Such monitoring involves a minimal amount of time and effort. It consists in the assistant, nurse or doctor attending the patient until he or she has taken the medication and ensuring that it does not, for example, fall on the floor or is not concealed by the patient. While this description of the sequence of events may appear trite, the matter is of cardinal importance if a person will suffer, even suffer seriously, from the consequences of failing to take the prescribed medication.",

The whole case turns on this statement. While such trust might be an important element of a relationship between a medical doctor and a responsible and mature patient, I fail to see how such trust can at all be established with a vulnerable person such as the applicant\u2019s brother, who in addition had already attempted to commit suicide.",
