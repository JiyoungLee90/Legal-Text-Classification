On being shown the applicant's photograph, he said that he recognised it as that of a man who had given him heroin when he was ill.  However, towards the end of his examination he stated that he was no longer quite sure of recognising the man on the photograph; it might be that the man who had given him the heroin only resembled that man.  He further alleged that when shown the photographs by the police, he had only identified the applicant's photograph as that of a person from whom he had bought drugs because at the time he had felt very ill and had been afraid that the police might not give him back the drugs which they had found in his possession. The court adjourned its further examination until 29 November 1988, ordering the appearance of the witnesses R. and N., and - on a motion of the defence - of L., an expert in the field of problems related to drug trafficking and abuse.

The defence withdrew its request to have him heard but maintained its request that the Court of Appeal should hear the six anonymous witnesses and the expert K. Referring to its decision of 10 May, the Court of Appeal refused to accede to the request of the defence to hear the six anonymous witnesses.  However, in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court of 2 July 1990 (see paragraph 46 below), it decided to refer the case back to the investigating judge, requesting her to record her findings as to the reliability of the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16, adding that if in order to appraise their reliability the investigating judge found it necessary to hear them again she should do so. Although the expert K. was present at the hearing on 28 August 1990, having been convened by the defence, the Court of Appeal decided not to hear him.  The reason given was that as an expert rather than a witness he could not be expected to contribute to the elucidation of the facts of the case. The witness N. was heard by the Court of Appeal in the applicant's presence and the applicant's lawyer was given the opportunity to question him.  N. said that his statement to the police had been untrue and that he did not in fact know the applicant. In pursuance of the court's order of 10 May 1990 that he be brought by force, the named witness R. was present initially. It appears that before he was heard, he asked the court usher who was guarding him for permission to leave for a minute; this being allowed him, he then disappeared and could not be found again. The court subsequently ordered that he be brought before it by force at its next hearing on 22 November 1990. The Court of Appeal heard the expert L., who stated that drug addicts often made unreliable statements concerning alleged drug dealers to the police.  He understood from drug addicts that police officers made promises to them and that they made statements only in order to be allowed to leave as soon as possible.  Such statements were, in his view, \"somewhere between the truth and a lie\".",

The court thereupon decided that a new order for R.'s appearance would be pointless. The procurator general brought forward a police officer, I., who had been involved in the investigation and asked that he be heard.  The applicant's lawyer protested that the expert K. had not been heard and that the defence had no opportunity to prepare for the questioning of I.; to agree to hear I. now would prejudice the rights of the defence.  The Court of Appeal nonetheless acceded to the request, and I. was heard concerning the way in which the investigation had been conducted.  I. explained that from 1982 until 1988 he had been a member of a police team set up to fight drug trafficking in the centre of .  Over the years that team had built up a good understanding with many of the drug addicts living in that area; making use of that relationship, they had asked them for information on drug dealers.  Their cooperation was wholly voluntary.  I. denied that the police made promises to drug addicts or put pressure on them; nor were photographs shown to addicts who had been arrested.  In his assessment the statements made by drug addicts were therefore highly reliable.  Moreover, action was only taken against alleged drug dealers if there were at least eight statements incriminating them.  He further confirmed that it had happened in the past that convicted drug dealers, after serving their sentence, had threatened and assaulted drug addicts who had made incriminating statements against them.  Although he had never known the applicant to resort to violence or threats, he did not rule out the possibility that he might do so. The defence challenged the reliability of the statements made by the various witnesses, both named and anonymous, pointing to what they considered to be inconsistencies among them.  They objected particularly to the admission as evidence of the statements made by Y.15 and Y.16, on the grounds, inter alia, that both were drug addicts and that the investigating judge's record of her findings of 20 March 1990 did not contain a statement that she believed that the witnesses had been telling the truth.  Relying on the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 24 May 1989 (Series A no. 154), they moreover expressed doubts as to the impartiality of the investigating judge, Judge Sm., in that as a member of the Regional Court she had taken part in the hearing of the Regional Court of 25 August 1988 and in the decisions then made.

The Court of Appeal added that it had used their statements \"with the necessary caution and circumspection\".

It also found that the reliability of the witnesses and the well-foundedness of their wish to remain anonymous had been sufficiently verified by the investigating judge. The witness N. had been heard in open court both at first instance and on appeal.  Although he had retracted his earlier statement to the police, that was the statement which the Court of Appeal chose to believe in light of the testimony of the police officer I. Finally, the mere fact that the defence had not had the opportunity to question R. did not mean that his statement could not be used in evidence. The Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's complaint based on the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge Sm.  It noted that the hearing on 25 August 1988 had been summary; the  had only considered the applicant's request to have the six anonymous witnesses examined and his request for release.  During that hearing the  had not examined the substance of the applicant's case.  It did not appear, nor had it been argued, that Judge Sm. had had any dealings with Y.15 and Y.16 before questioning them.  An investigating judge in any case did not have to provide the same safeguards as a member of a trial court.  Furthermore, no particular facts or circumstances had been suggested or had come to light warranting the conclusion that she had not been able to form an unprejudiced opinion as to the reliability of the witnesses she had examined, or that she had been biased in her examination of those witnesses. The applicant was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment.  The time which he had spent in police custody and detention on remand was deducted from the sentence.",

In its judgment of 2 July 1990, Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (Netherlands Law Reports, \"NJ\") 1990, no. 692, the Supreme Court considered that it had to be assumed in light of the European Court's Kostovski judgment that the use of statements by anonymous witnesses was subject to stricter requirements than those defined in its case-law until then.  It defined these stricter requirements in the following rule: such a statement must have been taken down by a judge who (a) is aware of the identity of the witness, and (b) has expressed, in the official record of the hearing of such a witness, his reasoned opinion as to the reliability of the witness and as to the reasons for the wish of the witness to remain anonymous, and (c) has provided the defence with some opportunity to put questions or have questions put to the witness.  This rule is subject to exceptions; thus, according to the same judgment, the statement of an anonymous witness may be used in evidence if",

The Act of 11 November 1993, Staatsblad (Official Gazette) 1993, no. 603, has added to the CCP a number of detailed provisions relating to the \"protection of witnesses\".  It entered into force on 1 February 1994.  The additions include the following. Article 226a now provides that the identity of a witness may remain secret if there is reason to believe that the disclosure of his identity may threaten his life, health, safety, family life or socio-economic existence and if the witness has made it clear that he does not wish to make any statement because of this.  The decision is made by the investigating judge, who must first hear the prosecution, the defence and the witness himself. An appeal against the decision of the investigating judge lies to the trial court (Article 226b). The investigating judge may order that a threatened witness be heard in the absence of the accused, or of counsel, or of both, so as not to disclose the identity of the threatened witness; in that event, the prosecution authorities may not attend the questioning of the witness either.  The investigating judge must then allow the defence to put questions of its own to the witness, either through the use of telecommunication or in writing (Article 226d). Article 264 now lays down that the prosecution may refuse to summon a threatened witness. If the trial court has ordered that a witness be heard and that witness turns out to be under threat, he must be heard in camera by the investigating judge (Article 280 para. 5). The statement of an anonymous witness taken in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions may only be used in evidence against a person accused of crimes in respect of which his detention on remand is permitted (Article 342 para. 2 (b)). A new paragraph has been added to Article 344 to the effect that a statement of a person whose identity is not apparent may only be used in evidence if the conviction is based to a significant degree on other evidence and if the defence has not at any time during the trial sought to question that person or have him questioned.",

He also raised various claims about the use made of the statements of the anonymous witnesses Y.05, Y.06, Y.13 and Y.14, about the procedure for confronting witnesses and informants with photographs of suspected drug dealers and about the fact (admitted by Y.16 himself - see paragraph 25 above) that the police had rehearsed his statement with him while taking him to see the investigating judge. These are new complaints.  They were not raised as such in the proceedings before the Commission; nor were they encompassed by the Commission's decision on admissibility.

The applicant claimed in the first place that in obtaining the statements of the anonymous witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 the rights of the defence had been infringed to such an extent that the reliance on those statements by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal was incompatible with the standards of a \"fair\" trial. He emphasised, first of all, that during the first-instance proceedings Y.15 and Y.16 were questioned by an investigating judge, Judge M., in the absence of his counsel. He claimed that this was in violation of an agreement between his counsel and Judge M. (see paragraph 14 above). Although he conceded that in the course of the appeal proceedings Y.15 and Y.16 had been questioned by Investigating Judge Sm. in the presence of his counsel and had identified him from a photograph taken several years previously (see paragraph 25 above), that was not a proper substitute for a confrontation with him in person.  Not knowing the identity of the persons concerned, he could not himself cross-examine them to test their credibility.  Nor could the possibility of mistakes be ruled out.  It would, in his submission, have been possible to examine the witnesses in his presence, protecting them, if need be, by the use of disguise, voice-distorting equipment or a two-way mirror. In fact, he questioned the need for maintaining the anonymity of Y.15 and Y.16 at all.  Both had stated before the investigating judge that they feared reprisals (see paragraph 25 above) but there was nothing to suggest that they were ever subjected to, or for that matter threatened with, violence at the hands of the applicant.  Moreover, the basis of the investigating judge's assessment of the need for anonymity was not made clear to the defence. He further submitted that it was inappropriate that the trial court should have accepted unquestioningly the assessment of the reliability of the evidence given by Y.15 and Y.16 to the investigating judge (see paragraphs 32 and 34 above).  In this connection the applicant pointed out that both Y.15 and Y.16 were drug addicts.  Y.16, on his own admission, had been an addict for no less than seventeen years.  Statements by drug addicts were notoriously unreliable, as appeared from, inter alia, the statement made by the expert witness L. (see paragraph 31 above). The investigating judge had not herself carried out the complete investigation of the case, so that she could not assess the credibility of the witnesses in the light of the complete case file; furthermore, an important safeguard - namely, a complete assessment by the full trial court, which consisted of three judges of the Court of Appeal - had been lacking.",

The Government contended that it had not been necessary to hear the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in open court as the hearing of witnesses by the investigating judge offered sufficient safeguards.  The involvement of the investigating judge afforded the suspect the guarantee that the investigation would be impartial and objective.  It was the duty of the investigating judge to collect not only evidence that tended to incriminate the suspect, but also evidence that might disculpate him.  In addition, the investigating judge had the power to hear witnesses on oath, and the prosecution and the defence had the right to attend and ask questions of their own or to submit questions in writing (see paragraph 37 above and the Court's Kostovski judgment cited therein, p. 14, para. 23). They noted in addition that the applicant's counsel had twice had the opportunity to question the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in the presence of an investigating judge.  The first such opportunity was on 30 May 1988, during the preliminary judicial investigation; on that occasion the lawyer had left, for reasons of his own, before these witnesses appeared (see paragraph 14 above).  The second was during the appeal proceedings, on 14 February 1990 (see paragraph 25 above).  On that occasion counsel had been present and had in fact put direct questions to the witnesses. Given that counsel had in fact been able to question Y.15 and Y.16 face to face, the lack of any confrontation with the applicant in person had not materially restricted the ability of the defence to cast doubt on their credibility or that of their statements or to counter their statements as it saw fit. Moreover, the investigating judge, Judge Sm., had been aware of the identity of the anonymous witnesses.  She had also examined their reasons for wishing to remain anonymous - namely, fear of reprisals - and considered them well-founded.  Her decision had been upheld by the Court of Appeal, which had found it established that potential witnesses in drug-using circles were in fact frequently threatened by drug dealers (see paragraph 28 above). The Court of Appeal had been entitled to consider the reliability of the statements of Y.15 and Y.16 sufficiently corroborated by the findings of the investigating judge, as officially recorded on 19 November 1990, and by the statement in open court of the  that the witnesses in the case had been under no constraint.  In any case, the Court of Appeal had noted in its judgment that it had made use of the anonymous statements \"with the necessary caution and circumspection\" (see paragraph 34 above). They noted generally that the procedure followed had been in accordance with the case-law of the Netherlands Supreme Court in which rules had been laid down for the implementation in domestic law of the Court's judgment in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 46 above).",

This is certainly a relevant reason to allow them anonymity.  It remains to be seen whether it was sufficient. Although, as the applicant has stated, there has been no suggestion that Y.15 and Y.16 were ever threatened by the applicant himself, the decision to maintain their anonymity cannot be regarded as unreasonable per se.  Regard must be had to the fact, as established by the domestic courts and not contested by the applicant, that drug dealers frequently resorted to threats or actual violence against persons who gave evidence against them (see paragraph 28 above).  Furthermore, the statements made by the witnesses concerned to the investigating judge show that one of them had apparently on a previous occasion suffered violence at the hands of a drug dealer against whom he had testified, while the other had been threatened (see paragraph 25 above). In sum, there was sufficient reason for maintaining the anonymity of Y.15 and Y.16.",

It follows from the above considerations that in the circumstances the \"counterbalancing\" procedure followed by the judicial authorities in obtaining the evidence of witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 must be considered sufficient to have enabled the defence to challenge the evidence of the anonymous witnesses and attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of their statements, which it did in open court by, amongst other things, drawing attention to the fact that both were drug addicts (see paragraph 33 above).",

According to the defence, K. would have been able to testify generally to the effect that statements made to the police by drug addicts were often unreliable.
