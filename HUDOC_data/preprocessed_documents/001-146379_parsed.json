It held that it had not been possible to take a statement from the applicant because she had been in a situation and state which prevented her from engaging in conversation as a result of psychotropic medication she had been administered, which had a negative psychopathological effect. Moreover, it would have been immoral to find that the applicant\u2019s parents had unlawfully deprived her of her freedom given that she had been unable to express her own will because she was constantly accompanied by MISA members and was not allowed to attend meetings alone. M.A. was sixteen years older than the applicant and he had not been able to prove that he was her fianc\u00e9. He had initially informed an employee at the mayor\u2019s office that he was the applicant\u2019s boyfriend, and had stated that he was her fianc\u00e9 only after a telephone conversation with a third party, and only in order to justify his own interests in respect of the applicant. It had been natural for the applicant\u2019s parents to attempt to bring their daughter back home by any means necessary and to try to ensure her physical and emotional recovery, given that they had seen the press campaign concerning what happened to young women at the MISA premises. According to her parents, they had made considerable efforts to recover the applicant physically, while psychologically it had been clear that she was unable to express herself as long as MISA members accompanied her everywhere, including to family meetings. As to the medical treatment the applicant had been administered, the parties would have to ask the doctor who had treated her.

Be that as it may, the question whether she was physically locked in the facility is not determinative of the issue. In this regard, the Court refers to its case-law to the effect that a person may be considered to have been \u201cdetained\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 even during a period when he or she was allowed to make certain journeys or was in an open ward with regular unescorted access to unsecured hospital grounds and the possibility of unescorted leave outside the hospital (see Stanev v. Bulgaria [GC], no.\u00a036760/06, \u00a7 128, 17 January 2012, and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a045508/99, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2004-IX). As to the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the key factor in determining whether the applicant was deprived of her liberty is that the medical staff of the Nifon Unit of the S\u0103poca Psychiatric Hospital exercised complete and effective control by means of medication and supervision over the assessment, treatment, care, residence and movements of the applicant from 3\u00a0February\u00a02005, when she was admitted to that institution, to 1 April 2005, when she left the hospital. It appears from the Government\u2019s observations that she could have asked to be discharged at any time. Consequently, it seems that the applicant could not have left the institution without the medical team\u2019s permission. While there is no evidence in the file that the applicant made any attempts to leave the institution without informing the medical staff, it nevertheless appears from her clinical observation papers produced by the hospital on 4 March 2005 that she \u201cmentioned discharge\u201d (see paragraph 19 above). Even if the Court accepts that the authenticity of the copy of the applicant\u2019s clinical observation papers is debatable, none of the parties has contested the aforementioned statement. In addition, the Court notes that the hospital was located in a remote area and could be reached only by car, which made it difficult if not perilous for the applicant to leave on her own (see paragraph 16 above).",

However, each case has to be decided taking into account its particular \u201crange of factors\u201d, and while there may be similarities between the present case and H.M., there are also distinguishing features. In particular, even though, like in the case at hand, it was not established that H.M. was legally incapable of expressing a view on her position, she stated on several occasions that she was willing to enter the nursing home, and within weeks of being there she agreed to stay, which is in plain contrast to the applicant in the instant case. Further, a number of safeguards \u2013 including judicial scrutiny \u2013 were in place in order to ensure that the placement in the nursing home was justified under domestic and international law.",

Furthermore, the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe, measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. This means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold Litwa v.

In view of the parties\u2019 disagreement on the matter, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation was based exclusively on medical reasons; however, although the applicant had previously been hospitalised in a psychiatric institution on one previous occasion, there is no evidence in the file that she had ever tried to harm herself or others. Moreover, the fact that she was discharged with the same diagnosis as upon her hospitalisation raises serious doubts as to the necessity of the impugned measure for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e). Lastly, the Government have not put forward any convincing arguments as to why the applicant\u2019s condition could not have been treated and monitored without her being deprived of her of her liberty.",
