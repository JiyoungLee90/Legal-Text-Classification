He was also informed that the criminal procedure against him was pending in Belarus and not in . The same day the Kyiv Pechersky Police Department received an official request from the  authorities for the applicant\u2019s arrest, with indication that a request for extradition would be submitted under the Minsk Convention. On 11 January 2005 the  ordered the applicant\u2019s detention for one month pending the extradition proceedings against him. On 19 January 2005 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Ukraine received an official request from the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Belarus for the applicant\u2019s extradition with a view to criminal prosecution. The Court further notes that the Minsk Convention, which is part of the domestic law in , provides for provisional arrest of the wanted person with a view to his possible extradition to the requested State even prior to the official request for extradition. From the facts described above the Court considers that the Ukrainian authorities arrested and detained the applicant in order to take action with a view to his extradition. There were no criminal proceedings against the applicant in . Moreover, no other reason but extradition was ever advanced by the authorities for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period in question and there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that any such other reason has ever existed. Therefore, notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s submissions to the contrary, his detention had always been with a view to extradition and his above complaint falls to be considered under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 (f) of the Convention (see Novik v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 48068/06, 13\u00a0March 2007).

In the present case, the applicant was brought to the court with significant delay, his detention was ordered for one month and never extended by the court. Furthermore, the domestic courts ultimately acknowledged that his detention could not be challenged under the Code of Criminal Procedure, without suggesting however any other procedure which could apply in the applicant\u2019s case. In such circumstances the Court does not find any reasons to deviate from the conclusions reached in the Soldatenko judgment and confirms that the relevant domestic legislation failed to protect the applicant from arbitrariness. In these circumstances, the Court does not need to consider separately whether the extradition proceedings were conducted with due diligence (see Ismoilov and Others v. , no. 2947/06, \u00a7\u00a0140, 24 April 2008).",

Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, \u00a7 76). A remedy must be made available during a person\u2019s detention to allow that person to obtain speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention, capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov\u00a0v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a09808/02, \u00a7\u00a066 in fine, 24 March 2005, and Vachev v. Bulgaria, no. 42987/98, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2004-VIII (extracts)). The accessibility of a remedy implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a046 and 55).",

The Court also reiterates that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure referred to by the Government were analysed by the Court in the Soldatenko judgment and were found to refer to the situations of and parties to domestic criminal proceedings and not specifically to extradition proceedings (see Soldatenko, cited above, \u00a7 126).
