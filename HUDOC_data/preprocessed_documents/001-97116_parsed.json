Furthermore, difficult legal questions in relation to property-law issues arising from German reunification had had to be resolved. Finally, the applicant\u2019s conduct had rendered the proceedings unusually complex. The Government maintained that the applicant\u2019s fourteen requests for extensions of deadlines and postponements of hearings, twenty amendments or increases of his claims, seventeen challenges for bias against the judges involved in the proceedings, eighteen changes of lawyer, several third-party notifications, which he had later withdrawn and his conduct regarding the expert had considerably contributed to the length of the proceedings. As to the conduct of the domestic courts, the Government submitted that it had not been possible to deliver the expert report on the value of the properties until 15 March 2004 owing to the applicant\u2019s numerous challenges for bias and changes of lawyer. In any event, no assessment of the properties\u2019 value would have been possible prior to 28 November 2000 owing to a lack of information from the land offices. On the other hand, the Government acknowledged that the proceedings had been delayed for a period of seven months (between 25 January and 19 August 1999) because the Court of Appeal was overburdened. In their view, this delay, together with another seven-month delay caused by the late submission of B.P.\u2019s expert report, could give rise to a finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. Finally, they recognised that the proceedings had been of high importance for the applicant given the high amount of damages at stake.",

In this connection the civil courts were called upon to examine issues related to German reunification which would normally have been dealt with by the administrative authorities or courts. In particular, they had to clarify whether, at what time and to what extent the property would have been restituted under the Property Act or compensated under the Indemnification Act had the lawyers fulfilled their professional duties. This involved numerous inquiries of various authorities and the taking of an expert report on the value of the properties.",

The Court further observes that the applicant amended or increased his initial claim on sixteen occasions and that he changed his legal representatives at least fourteen times during the proceedings before the Court of Appeal after the remittal by the Federal Court of Justice, sometimes even after relatively short periods, which inevitably prolonged the proceedings because the new lawyers had to become acquainted with the applicant\u2019s case. Moreover, the applicant lodged several third-party complaints against his former lawyers, which he later withdrew. This conduct made it necessary for the Court of Appeal to appoint and consult an expert to examine the applicant\u2019s capacity to be a party to an action. Moreover, the applicant lodged altogether eighteen requests for bias against an expert and the judges of the Court of Appeal, which necessitated several interim decisions by that court and which caused the postponement of several hearings. Even though the applicant had the right to extend his claim and to lodge the said requests, his conduct inevitably prolonged the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, and their duration is therefore to a decisive extent imputable to the applicant.",

It observes that certain delays were caused by the Court of Appeal\u2019s failure to appoint an expert to assess the value of the property once the court had received the necessary information from the land offices on 28 November 2000. However, the Court also notes that, apart from these shortcomings, the domestic courts conducted the proceedings with due diligence. In particular, the Court of Appeal decided, in a timely manner, on the applicant\u2019s numerous challenges for bias, his requests asking that the court reconsider its decisions and his further procedural requests. Moreover, both the Federal Court of Justice and the  decided on the applicant\u2019s complaints particularly speedily and the applicant\u2019s complaints in the proceedings relating to the court costs, the fees relating to his complaints against the costs orders and their subsequent enforcement were decided rapidly. \nThe Court notes that the entire proceedings before the Court of Appeal appear to have been significantly slowed down by the applicant\u2019s extensive personal submissions, and his numerous challenges for bias and changes of counsel. However, a delay at some stage may be tolerated if the overall duration of the proceedings cannot be deemed excessive (see, inter alia, Nuutinen v. Finland, no. 32842/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR\u00a02000VIII).
