When assessing the heirs\u2019 standing to pursue the application on behalf of a deceased person, what is important is therefore not whether the rights at issue are transferable to the heirs but whether the victim made a choice to exercise his or her right of individual application under Article 34 of the Convention by activating the Convention mechanism. It follows that, if an applicant dies after lodging an application with the Court, his or her heirs may in principle pursue the application on his or her behalf. By contrast, the situation is different if an application is introduced by close relatives after the death of the direct victim of an alleged violation of the Convention (see\u00a0Ergezen v. Turkey, no.\u00a073359/10, \u00a7\u00a7 28-30, 8 April 2014, with further references).",

That assertion is disputed by the Government. The appeal judgment clearly indicates that no request for adjournment was made by the applicant (see paragraph 15 above). In the absence of any proof to the contrary in the case file, the Court does not see any reason to doubt the appeal court\u2019s finding. It is also noteworthy that the applicant, who was neither sick nor otherwise prevented from attending the hearing in person, chose not to attend. In these circumstances Russian law allowed the judge to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the applicant (see paragraph 25 above).",
