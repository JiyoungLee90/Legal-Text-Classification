The case originated in an application (no. 13820/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals, Mr Guriy Aleksandrovich Grigoryev and Mrs Alevtina Aleksandrovna Kakaurova (“the applicants”), on 24 March 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 22 February 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1930 and 1934 respectively and live in .
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 22 December 1986 the  regional administration ordered expropriation of the applicants' plot of land, house and certain constructions in the public interest and transferred them to the State enterprise “Vostok”. The actual transfer took place in 1992.
On 27 January 1993 the first applicant reached an agreement with “Vostok” by which the enterprise undertook to move the applicant's garage and cellar to his new place of residence. By a decision of the same date, the Sverdlovskiy District Court of the Irkutsk Region approved the agreement. It was later invalidated by domestic courts.
On 22 September 1995 the Sverdlovskiy District Court allowed the applicants' civil claims against “Vostok” and awarded them compensation for the expropriated property. The applicants did not specify the amount awarded. It appears that the judgment became binding and enforceable on 2 October 1995.
On 1 November 1996 and 13 March 2001 the District Court adjusted the award under the judgment of 22 September 1995 in line with the inflation.
According to the judgments of 22 September 1995, 1 November 1996 and 13 March 2001, the federal State unitary enterprise “Vostok” (федеральное государственное унитарное предприятие “Восток”) was to pay 72,502.20 Russian roubles (“RUR”) to the first applicant and RUR 4,856.30 to the second applicant.
On an unspecified date the bailiffs' service opened enforcement proceedings and placed the applicants on the waiting list, along with many others creditors of “Vostok”.
On 28 January 2002 the Commercial Court of the Irkutsk Region started insolvency proceedings against “Vostok”.
On 24 February 2004 the bailiff passed the enforcement documents to the company receiver.
On an unspecified date the applicants brought civil proceedings against the Irkutsk City Administration, claiming that the Administration should be liable for the debts of the State enterprise.
On 3 December 2003 the Kirovskiy District Court of Irkutsk dismissed their claim as having no basis in the domestic law. On 30 January 2004 the  upheld the judgment on appeal.
It appears that the judgments of 22 September 1995, 1 November 1996 and 13 March 2001 have not been enforced to date, and that the insolvency proceedings against “Vostok” are still pending.
The Civil Code defines State and municipal unitary enterprises as a special form of legal entities that do not exercise the right of ownership in respect of the property allocated to them by the property owner (Article 113 § 1). The State or municipal authority retains ownership of the property but the enterprise may exercise in respect of that property the right of economic control (право хозяйственного ведения) or operative management (право оперативного управления) (Article 113 § 2). The name of the unitary enterprise must indicate the owner of its property (Article 113 § 3).
The manager of a unitary enterprise is appointed by, and reports to, the property owner (Article 113 § 4). The owner has the right to re-organise or liquidate the unitary enterprise. A consent by the owner is required for any transaction that may lead to encumbrance or alienation of the property.
The State or municipal owner of the property is not liable for debts of unitary enterprises having the right of economic control over the property unless the owner has caused insolvency of the enterprise or violated the procedure for its liquidation (Article 114 of the Civil Code and section 184 of the Bankruptcy Act, federal law no. 8-FZ of 8 January 1998, effective at the material time).
Unitary enterprises having the right of economic control over the property may be declared insolvent in accordance with the insolvency procedure applicable to private companies. The State or municipal owner of the property may, but is not obliged to, pay debts of a State enterprise in the framework of insolvency proceedings (sections 1 and 89 of the Bankruptcy Act).
The State or municipal owner of the property is liable for debts of unitary enterprises having the right of operative management of the property in case of insufficiency of their funds (Article 115 of the Civil Code).
