The object of the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judicial authorities) to address an allegation that a Convention right has been violated and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court. In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, any argument as to an alleged violation of a Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used (see Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7\u00a038, ECHR 2004III).",

Whether or not a particular premise constitutes a \u201chome\u201d which attracts the protection of Article 8 \u00a7 1 will depend on the factual circumstances, namely, the existence of sufficient and continuous links with a specific place (see Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25\u00a0September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a052-54, and Commission\u2019s report of 11 January 1995, \u00a7 63; Gillow v. the United Kingdom, 24\u00a0November 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 109; Wiggins v. the United Kingdom, no. 7456/76, Commission decision of 8 February 1978, DR 13, p. 40; and Prokopovich v.\u00a0Russia, no. 58255/00, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2004XI (extracts)).

Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no.\u00a031107/96, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection, the Court notes that under section 428(a) of the Civil Procedure Act an applicant may file a petition for reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of the Convention (see Orli\u0107 v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7 78; and Bjedov v. Croatia, cited above, \u00a7 78).",
