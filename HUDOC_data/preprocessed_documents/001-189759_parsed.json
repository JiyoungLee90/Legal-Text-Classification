The Government have made no specific comment on this aspect of the case. For its part, the Court reiterates that in determining this matter the decisive point is not whether the rights in question are transferable to the heirs wishing to pursue the procedure, but whether the heirs or the next of kin can in principle claim a legitimate interest in requesting the Court to deal with the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s wish to exercise his or her individual and personal right to lodge an application with the Court (see\u00a0Ergezen v.

Russia, nos. 45044/06 and 5 others, \u00a7\u00a7 87 and 117, 12\u00a0December 2017). Also, human rights cases before the Court generally have a moral dimension and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice be done, even after the applicant\u2019s death (ibid). The Court is satisfied that the condition of close kinship has been met and that Mrs Larisa Makarova has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the application on behalf of the applicant is pursued. The Court has no reason to doubt that the late applicant and her mother were in a sufficiently close relationship. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mrs Larisa Makarova has standing to continue the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s stead. For practical reasons, Ms Tatyana Makarova will continue to be called \u201cthe first applicant\u201d in this judgment.",

As regards the first applicant\u2019s additional complaint, the Government considered that the Justice of the Peace had been empowered to examine her case under Articles 23.1 \u00a7 3 and 28.7 \u00a7 1 of the CAO.",

It is true that those rules then changed as of 1\u00a0January 2013, so that cases concerning, inter alia, administrative offences under Article 20.2 of the CAO were to be examined by the district courts at the first instance.

The applicant raised no related argument on appeal against her conviction and made no submissions in reply to the Government\u2019s arguments. The Court concludes that the available material does not disclose a breach of any essential elements pertaining to the requirement that a tribunal must be \u201cestablished by law\u201d.

This specific matter was already examined by the Court in Lashmankin and Others (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0443-52) and, as it happens, in relation to the very same factual background. The Court stated, in particular, that the Public Events Act made no allowance for special circumstances, where an immediate response to a current event was warranted in the form of a spontaneous \u201cassembly\u201d within the meaning of Article 11 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

The date of the parliamentary examination of the draft law had been announced two days in advance, making it impossible for the protesters to comply even with a three-day notification time-limit for \u201cpickets\u201d (see paragraphs 6-8 above). The failure to inform the public sufficiently in advance of the date on which Parliament would examine the draft law therefore left the protesters with the option of either forgoing their right to peaceful assembly altogether, or of exercising it in defiance of the administrative requirements (see\u00a0Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 453).",

In the absence of a proper judicial review of those issues in the administrative cases or in separate proceedings, the Court cannot speculate as to whether the facts of the present case disclosed such special circumstances to which the only adequate response was an immediate assembly. For their part, the Government have not given any convincing reason why it should have been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to make no exceptions to the application of the notification procedure, including its requirement of specific time-limits for notification, in circumstances where it is impossible to comply with such time-limits. In the Court\u2019s view, the automatic and inflexible application of the notification time-limits without any regard to the specific circumstances of the present case amounted to an interference which was not justified under Article 11 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see\u00a0Lashmankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0473 and 475).",
