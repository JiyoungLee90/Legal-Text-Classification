The Committee is gravely concerned by the case of Azimjan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek human rights defender prosecuted on criminal charges in connection with the death of a police officer in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, which has been raised by several Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (A/HRC/22/47/Add.4, para.\u00a0248; A/HRC/19/55/Add.2, para.\u00a0212). Mr.\u00a0Askarov has alleged that he was beaten severely by police on numerous occasions immediately following his detention and throughout the course of the criminal proceedings against him, and that he was subjected to repeated violations of procedural safeguards such as prompt access to a lawyer and to an effective, independent medical examination. The Committee notes that independent forensic medical examinations appear to have substantiated Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s allegations of torture in police custody, and have confirmed resulting injuries including persistent visual loss, traumatic brain injury, and spinal injury. Information before the Committee suggests that Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s complaints of torture have been raised on numerous occasions with the Prosecutor\u2019s office, as well as with the Kyrgyz Ombudsman\u2019s office, and with Bazar-Korgon District Court, the  and the Supreme Court. To date, however, the State party\u2019s authorities have declined to open a full investigation into his claims, relying on allegedly coerced statements made by Mr.\u00a0Askarov while in police custody that he had no complaints. The Committee understands that the State party is presently considering the possibility of further investigating these claims.

In a previous case concerning extradition to Kyrgyzstan, it found that in 2012 the situation in the south of the country was characterised by torture and other illtreatment of ethnic Uzbeks by law-enforcement officers, which had increased in the aftermath of the events of June 2010 and remained widespread and rampant, being aggravated by the law-enforcement officers\u2019 impunity. Moreover, the Court established that the issue ought to be seen in the context of the rise of ethnonationalism in the politics of Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the south, the growing inter-ethnic tensions between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, continued discriminatory practices faced by Uzbeks at the institutional level and underrepresentation of Uzbeks in, amongst others, law-enforcement bodies and the judiciary (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 72). As is clear from the reports by UN bodies and reputable NGOs, in 2012-13 the situation in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan had not improved. In particular, various reports are consistently in agreement when describing biased attitudes based on ethnicity in investigations, prosecutions, condemnations and sanctions imposed on ethnic Uzbeks charged and convicted in relation to the events in the Jalal-Abad Region, as well as a lack of full and effective investigations into the numerous allegations of torture and ill-treatment imputable to the Kyrgyz law-enforcement agencies, arbitrary detention and the excessive use of force against Uzbeks allegedly involved in the events of June 2010 (see paragraphs 72-77 above). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the current overall human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan remains highly problematic (see, mutatis mutandis, Klein v. Russia, no. 24268/08, \u00a7\u00a051, 1\u00a0April 2010).",

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2005I). It reiterates in this connection that where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment, the protection of Article 3 enters into play when the applicant establishes, where necessary on the basis of information contained in recent reports by independent international human rights protection bodies or NGOs, that there is serious reason to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned. In those circumstances, the Court will not then insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 132, ECHR 2008, and NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 116, 17 July 2008). The Court considers that this reasoning is of particular relevance in the present case, where the applicants, ethnic Uzbeks, are charged with a number of serious offences allegedly committed in the course of the violence of June 2010 (see, by contrast, Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 73). Given the widespread use by the Kyrgyz authorities of torture and ill-treatment in order to obtain confessions from ethnic Uzbeks charged with involvement in the inter-ethnic riots in the Jalal-Abad Region, which has been reported both by UN bodies (see paragraphs 72-73 above) and reputable NGOs (see paragraphs 74-77 above), the Court is satisfied that the applicants belong to a particularly vulnerable group, the members of which are routinely subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the requesting country.",

The applicants\u2019 arguments in respect of the risk of ill-treatment were not addressed at all (see paragraphs 21, 28 and 53 above). As for the extradition proceedings, the Court notes that in the applicants\u2019 respective cases the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office failed to assess the alleged risk of illtreatment altogether (see paragraphs 26 and 58).

Moreover, any prosecutor\u2019s decision taken on the basis of that procedure could only be challenged in court under Article 125 of the CCrP, which does not empower a court to order a detainee\u2019s release, even if it were to find the impugned detention order unlawful or unjustified (see Zokhidov v.

Article 5\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in appeal proceedings. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings have been conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7 106, 9 July 2009). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before an appellate court (see Lebedev v.

The Court considers that both the indication of an interim measure and the adoption of the final decision upholding the extradition order constituted new relevant factors that might have affected the lawfulness of, and justification for, the applicant\u2019s continued detention. This was, in a way, confirmed by the Orel deputy regional prosecutor in his decision of 25 September 2013 ordering the applicant\u2019s release owing to the interim measures indicated under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see paragraph 35 above). The applicant was therefore entitled under Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04 to proceedings to have those new relevant factors assessed by a court without unreasonable delay (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7 216). It was not, however, until almost three months after these factors emerged that the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention was reviewed and his release ordered.",

It thus concludes that the length of the interval between the extension order of 13\u00a0May 2013 and the proceedings of 25 September 2013, when the preventive measure in respect of the applicant was varied, was unreasonable.",
