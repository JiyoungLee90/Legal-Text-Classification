Accordingly, the applicant cannot be held responsible for any delay resulting from his requests to await the completion of the criminal investigation. The Court further observes that the proceedings were adjourned on at least three occasions pending the criminal investigation, causing delays of seven and a half months, six months and one year and eight months respectively (see paragraphs 12, 14 and 17 above). Admittedly, the findings of the criminal investigation were decisive for the resolution of the civil dispute initiated by the applicant and, as the Government pointed out, the District Court had to wait for the completion of the criminal investigation. However, the Court reiterates in that connection that it is incumbent on respondent States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet the requirements of Article\u00a06 of the Convention, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see S\u00fcrmeli v.  [GC], no. 75529/01, \u00a7 129, ECHR 2006VII). Accordingly, the Court considers that the adjournments of the proceedings owing to the lengthy criminal investigation seriously protracted the proceedings and were attributable to the authorities.",

The respondent company's conduct thus caused another delay of five months in the proceedings. In the Court's opinion, it was incumbent on the District Court to discipline the defaulting party in order to ensure that the proceedings were conducted at an acceptable pace (see Ku\u015bmierek v. , no. 10675/02, \u00a7\u00a034, 21\u00a0September 2004).
