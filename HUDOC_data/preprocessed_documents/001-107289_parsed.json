He stressed that it was not in dispute that the applicant and his family had been victims of political repression by the totalitarian regime. The destruction of the farm by the communist secret police had not been disputed. Hence, the objection made by the State, which had resulted in the applicant\u2019s claim failing, had to be seen as an abuse of rights incompatible with the \u201cprinciples of social co-existence\u201d.

The Supreme Court stated that the time-limit for seeking compensation for damage caused by such crimes should be examined in the light of the provisions of civil law.

The complainant argued that that period had been unreasonably short, to the detriment of victims, and that in the political realities of the system its short duration had made it impossible for them to effectively vindicate their well-founded compensation claims originating in Stalinist oppression.

It further held that, in the examination of the constitutionality of the provision in issue in the complaint, it was necessary to have regard to the manner in which it was interpreted in judicial practice. It referred to the practice of the Supreme Court \u2013 in particular, to its resolution of 11 October 1996. It noted, firstly, that the Supreme Court had been of the view that the political situation during the communist times could legitimately be seen as creating a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d, justifying the staying of the prescription time-limit. Secondly, the Supreme Court had not excluded that grounds for such a stay could, in individual cases, persist even after June 1989. Thirdly, the Supreme Court had often emphasised that the courts were obliged to examine whether the State Treasury\u2019s reliance on prescription of a compensation claim was compatible with the prohibition of abuse of one\u2019s rights, stipulated by Article 5 of the Civil Code.

They served several important purposes, namely to ensure legal certainty and finality, protect potential defendants from stale claims which might be difficult to counter and prevent the injustice which might arise if courts were required to decide upon events which took place in the distant past on the basis of evidence which might have become unreliable and incomplete because of the passage of time (ibid., \u00a7 51).",

The Act, which entered into force on 28 November 1956, was aimed at making it possible for victims of Stalinist repression to claim compensation for damage if the claim was filed within one year from the Act\u2019s entry into force (see paragraph 26 above).",

It is true that this one-year time-limit was shorter than the threeyear time-limit generally applicable in the context of liability in tort. However, the Court has held that there is no general obligation for States to compensate wrongs inflicted in the past under the general cover of State authority (see Wo\u015b v. Poland, no. 22860/02, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2006VII; Klaus\u00a0and Iouri Kiladz\u00e9 v. , no. 7975/06, \u00a7 53, 2 February 2010). In any event, in the present case, the courts did not hold that the time-limit for lodging the applicant\u2019s claim had started to run when the 1956 Act entered into force in 1956 and had expired in 1957. In the applicant\u2019s case, the courts expressly acknowledged that before the ultimate collapse of the communist regime in  in 1989 it might have been either difficult or simply impossible for the victims of Stalinist repression to have had recourse to the 1956 Act. The victims could at that time have legitimately been afraid of taking proceedings against the State, particularly in the context of such a heavily political issue as redress for Stalinist repression of political opposition. The courts observed that the time-limit could therefore be said to have started to run only as from 4 June 1989, the date commonly accepted as having marked the end of the repressive regime and opening the way for the applicant to seek redress openly and without fear.",

The 1991 Act applied in that case put in place a special legal scheme designed to examine the validity of judicial decisions given by the communist authorities in the past which had been intended to repress political opponents. The courts accepted that the applicant could have become aware of the fact that his efforts to have the damage compensated offered prospects of success only after that judgment was given in 1999.",

Where, moreover, the superior national courts have analysed in a comprehensive and convincing manner the precise nature of the impugned restriction, on the basis of the relevant Convention caselaw and principles drawn therefrom, this Court would need strong reasons to differ from the conclusions reached by those courts by substituting its own views for those of the national courts on a question of interpretation of domestic law (see Z.\u00a0and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 101) and by finding, contrary to their view, that there was arguably a right recognised by domestic law. In this connection, the Court notes that the domestic courts, when examining the applicant\u2019s case, had regard to the caselaw of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had already, by the time the applicant\u2019s case was examined by the courts, considered the issues arising in connection with compensation claims brought by victims of political repression in the past. The domestic courts had regard to the reasoning which the Supreme Court developed in its Resolution given in 1996 (see paragraphs 12 and 35 above).",
