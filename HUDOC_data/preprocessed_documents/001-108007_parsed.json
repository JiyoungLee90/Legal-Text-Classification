As to the conduct of the applicant, the Court agrees with the Government that he has delayed the proceedings (see paragraphs 7 and 10 above). However, those delays alone do not explain the overall duration of the still pending proceedings in the comparatively simple criminal case. In particular, as far as the conduct of the authorities is concerned, the Court notes three remittals of the case for retrial (see paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 above), the period of the examination of the case by the Prymorskyy Court (see paragraph 9 above) and the numerous adjournments of the hearings due to the judges\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and the interpreter\u2019s absence (see paragraph 10 above). As for the adjournments of the hearings due to the witnesses\u2019 failure to appear, the Court notes that, even though the courts have on a number of occasions applied compulsory summonses on those witnesses, they have also had at their disposal other effective mechanisms to ensure those persons\u2019 presence, including administrative penalties (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no. 7324/02, \u00a7\u00a031, 4 April 2006). It was not suggested by the Government that the courts have ever considered applying them. Nor have the applied summonses seemed to have any effect (see Kobtsev v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 71). As for the adjournments of the hearings due to the interpreter\u2019s absence, the Court notes that those adjournments have been made despite the fact that the domestic courts have established that the applicant has been fully conversant in the language of the proceedings. The Government did not explain the necessity of such adjournments. The Court thus concludes that the main responsibility for the length of the proceedings has rested with the State.",
