The case originated in an application (no. 58182/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Tajik national, K.I. (“the applicant”), on 2 August 2014.
The applicant was represented by Mr I.G. Vasilyev, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he would risk being subjected to ill-treatment if removed to Tajikistan, and that his detention pending expulsion had been unlawful and had involved procedural defects.
On 17 October 2014 the Court indicated to the respondent Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicant should not be removed to Tajikistan until further notice. It was also decided to grant this case priority under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.
On 7 January 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Court also decided to grant the applicant anonymity and case-file confidentiality under Rules 33 and 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1980. He arrived in Russia in 2003. He travelled to Tajikistan on a number of occasions to visit his parents for short periods of time.
On 3 May 2011 the applicant was charged in absentia in Tajikistan with participating in an extremist religious movement, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and an international search and arrest warrant was issued in his name. On 6 May 2011 the Tajik authorities ordered his pre-trial detention.
On 3 November 2013 the applicant was arrested in Moscow and detained. On 4 November 2013 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) ordered his detention pending extradition.
On 4 December 2013 the Tajik prosecution authorities requested the applicant’s extradition on the basis of the above charges. The request included assurances regarding his proper treatment, which were formulated in standard terms.
On 12 December 2013 the District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 3 May 2014.
An appeal by the applicant of 16 December 2013 was dismissed by the Moscow City Court (“the City Court”) on 3 February 2014.
On 29 April 2014 the District Court again extended the applicant’s detention until 3 August 2014.
An appeal by the applicant of 5 May 2014 was dismissed by the City Court on 23 July 2014.
On 9 October 2014 the applicant’s extradition was refused by the Deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, owing to the absence of culpable actions under Russian criminal law.
On 13 October 2014 the applicant was released from detention.
On 13 October 2014, immediately after his release, the applicant was rearrested for violating migration regulations.
On 14 October 2014 the District Court found the applicant guilty of violating migration regulations, fined him and ordered his administrative removal. Allegations by the applicant regarding a real risk of ill-treatment were dismissed, and he was detained pending expulsion. The District Court assessing the risks stated that “[t]he claims of the representative ... are of a speculative nature and not confirmed by the case materials”
The above judgment was upheld on appeal by the City Court on 24 October 2014. Claims by the applicant under Article 3 of the Convention were dismissed with reference to the District Court’s assessment of the case, which took into consideration “...the nature of the administrative offence, the character of the accused [who was criminally convicted in Russia]... the length of his stay in Russia and other circumstances of the case”.
According to the latest submissions of his representative in 2015, the applicant was still in detention.
On 18 December 2013 the applicant lodged a request for refugee status, referring to persecution in Tajikistan and a real risk of ill-treatment.
On 15 September 2014 his request was refused by a final administrative decision of the migration authorities. The applicant challenged that decision in the courts, referring, inter alia, to the risk of illtreatment.
On 12 November 2015 his appeals were dismissed by a final decision of the City Court.
The relevant domestic and international law is summarised in the Court’s judgments on removals from Russia to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (see Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, §§ 70101, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and Akram Karimov v. Russia, no. 62892/12, §§ 69-105, 28 May 2014).
Reports on the situation in Tajikistan were previously summarised in Khodzhayev v. Russia (no. 52466/08, §§ 72-74, 12 May 2010); Gaforov v. Russia (no. 25404/09, §§ 93-100, 21 October 2010); and Savriddin Dzhurayev (cited above, §§ 10407).
According to the more recent reports of independent international sources, the situation in Tajikistan did not significantly improve since then. The reputed international NGOs characterize the situation as tainted by the persecution of political opposition and religious groups and the use of oppressive methods (including torture) (see, for example, Tajikistan 2016/2017 and Tajikistan: A year of secrecy, growing fears and deepening injustice by Amnesty International; Nations in Transit 2017: The False Promise of Populism by Freedom House; and World Report 2017 by Human Rights Watch). In the relevant parts they stated the following:
The reports of the Human Rights Commissioner of Tajikistan for 2015 and 2106, while not reflecting the same level of concern as the international reports above and focusing rather on the prevention efforts, still maintain that “there are certain difficulties in this sphere [torture and ill-treatment] and that “the instances of beatings and bad treatment of detainees occur” (Human Rights Commissioner of Tajikistan, Annual Reports in 2015 and 2016).
Within the framework of the Universal Periodic Review in 2016 by the Human Rights Council of the United Nations Organisation the report of the working group on Tajikistan maintained that the use of torture in criminal justice system persisted, despite certain positive developments (Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, A/HRC/33/11, 2016).
