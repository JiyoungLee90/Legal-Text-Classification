The Government insisted that the State Secrets Act of 21 July 1993, together with Presidential Decree no. 1203 of 30 November 1995, formed a sufficient legal basis for the applicant's conviction for the imputed offence during the relevant period, given that both documents had been duly published and were accessible to him.",

It therefore includes everything that goes to make up the written law, including enactments of lower rank than statutes and the court decisions interpreting them (see Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2001-VIII). In the present case, the Court notes that the Russian Constitution established a principle that a list of classified information should be defined by a federal statute and that amendments were subsequently made to the State Secrets Act so as to bring it into conformity with the relevant constitutional requirement. It is clear that in the period between 12 December 1993, the date on which the Russian Constitution entered into force, and 9 October 1997, the date on which the amendments to the State Secrets Act became operative, there was a pressing need for a legal instrument which would have provided the competent authorities with a legal basis \u201cfor the performance of their duty to protect the security of the State, community and individuals\u201d (see paragraph  above). The Court is inclined to consider that the Russian authorities were justified in responding to that need through the enactment of a presidential decree \u2013 the procedure for the adoption of such a legal instrument being less complicated and more speedy than that of a federal statute \u2013 given in particular their margin of appreciation in regulating the protection of State secrecy (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, \u00a7 107, ECHR\u00a02007\u00a0...).

The domestic courts carefully scrutinised each of the applicant's arguments and corroborated their findings with several items of evidence. They relied, in particular, on several recordings of the applicant's telephone conversations with a Japanese national, proving his intention to transfer the information in question to Mr T.O. (see paragraphs 22 and 32 above). The domestic courts also gave due consideration to, and rejected as unreliable, the applicant's argument that the information collected by him was publicly accessible. Indeed, they critically assessed the expert report of 14 September 2001, having compared the experts' conclusions with other materials of the case, and rejected those conclusions which listed as classified information that could be found in public sources, such as a military reference book on submarines or a Greenpeace report (see paragraph  above). In respect of the information collected by the applicant, they noted, however, that it was not openly published (see paragraph  above).",

The Court also considers that the disclosure of the information concerning military exercises which the applicant had collected and kept was capable of causing considerable damage to national security. It is true that the applicant did not in fact transfer the information in question to a foreign national; on the other hand, the Court does not overlook the fact that his sentence was very lenient, much lower than the statutory minimum, and notably four years' imprisonment as compared with twelve to twenty years' imprisonment and confiscation of property (see paragraphs 28 and 37 above).",

The materials in the Court's possession reveal that the domestic courts carefully examined the circumstances of the applicant's case, addressed the parties' arguments and based their findings on various items of evidence. Their decisions appear reasoned and well-founded. On balance, the Court considers that the domestic courts cannot be said to have overstepped the limits of the margin of appreciation which is to be left to the domestic authorities in matters of national security (see Hadjianastassiou, cited above, \u00a7 47). Nor does the evidence disclose the lack of a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim pursued. There is nothing in the materials of the case to support the applicant's allegation that his conviction was overly broad or politically motivated or that he had been sanctioned for any of his publications.",
