It notes in this respect that as it follows from a report on the developments in the applicant\u2019s civil case submitted by the Government, even though the applicant did not attend the hearing in question, she requested the court to examine the case in her absence, while the defendant company, for its part, requested the court to adjourn the proceedings by reference to the belated delivery of the court summons. In such circumstances the Court considers that the ensuing delay is imputable to the authorities rather than to the applicant. It further notes that while the applicant\u2019s claim was registered on 15 September 1998, it took the District Court over six months to fix a hearing for 26 March 1999. On the latter date the hearing was postponed for another month and nineteen days, this delay being imputed to the authorities. Moreover, on five occasions the proceedings were adjourned for an overall period of eight months and seventeen days on account of the judge\u2019s involvement in other proceedings. In this respect the Court recalls that it is the States\u2019 duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7 21, 3\u00a0October 2000).",

Even though the latter then refused to bear the expenses for that examination with the result that the experts declined to carry it out, there is no indication that the court reacted in any way to such behaviour. Instead, on 19 November 2001 the court re-ordered the examination, which protracted the proceedings for over nine months. In such circumstances the Court is not convinced that the domestic court availed itself of the measures available to it under national law, e.g. under Article 74 of the Code of Civil Procedure then in force, to discipline the defendant so as to ensure that the case be heard within reasonable time (see, in a somewhat similar context, Sokolov v.
