In the case of Mr Yevdokimov and Mr Rezanov, they were serving their sentences in Barnaul and the court hearing their defamation claim was in Irkutsk, more than 1,300 kilometres away.

Article 6 \u00a7 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a059-60, ECHR 2005-II). Thus, the questions of personal presence, the form of the proceedings \u2013 oral or written \u2013 and legal representation are interlinked and must be analysed in the broader context of the \u201cfair trial\u201d guarantee of Article 6. The Court should establish whether the applicant, a party to the civil proceedings, had been given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations made or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis his opponent (see Siwiec v.\u00a0Poland, no. 28095/08, \u00a7 47, 3 July 2012; Larin v.

Nevertheless, the obligation under this Article to hold a hearing is not an absolute one. An oral hearing may not be necessary due to the exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see Koottummel v.

Also, provided that an oral hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, even if the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court (see Miller v.

Indeed, the right to appear in person before a court is in principle unrestricted in Russian civil proceedings (see paragraph\u00a028 above) but the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code on the Execution of Sentences make no provision for the exercise of that right by litigants who are detained pending trial or are serving a sentence (see paragraph 11 above). The Court has rejected that approach by the Russian courts as being excessively formalistic, noting that the absence of legislation on prisoners\u2019 attendance at hearings cannot be interpreted as sufficient grounds for depriving them of the right to appear (see Gryaznov, cited above, \u00a7 50). Just as no provision of domestic law should be interpreted and applied in a manner incompatible with the State\u2019s obligations under the Convention (see \u0106osi\u0107 v.

In establishing a universal right of the parties to civil proceedings to have an oral hearing on their claim, the Russian law endows the litigants with a legitimate expectation that they will be given an opportunity to appear before the judge. As noted in paragraph 22 above, this approach goes beyond the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, which does not guarantee the right to an oral hearing or the right to appear before a court in person, but rather enshrines a more general principle of fairness of proceedings (see Gladkiy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103, with further references). The Court has previously accepted that in civil proceedings concerning claims of a technical nature, the parties\u2019 presence was of lesser significance. Where the claim was not based on the applicant\u2019s personal experiences, his or her appearance at the hearing was not considered to be indispensable for the proceedings to be recognised as having been \u201cfair\u201d (see the case-law cited in paragraph 24 above). Nevertheless, in a situation where an applicant is incarcerated and cannot freely decide whether or not to attend the hearing, in order for the proceedings to be considered \u201cfair\u201d it is not sufficient that the applicant\u2019s absence should coincide with the absence of the procedural adversary, for such coincidence is merely fortuitous given that the absence or presence of the other party is beyond the applicant\u2019s control.",

Given the large variety of types of civil disputes, compiling an exhaustive list of such cases is a daunting task and the domestic courts, which have the advantage of possessing direct knowledge of the situation, are better placed to determine the nature of each claim and the underlying legal interests (see Lagard\u00e8re v.

The date of the final decision rejecting their claims for compensation cannot be relied upon as resetting the time-limit for their complaints. It follows that these complaints are inadmissible for non-compliance with the sixmonth rule set out in Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention, and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.",

The most appropriate form of redress would, in principle, be the reopening of the proceedings, if requested, without unduly upsetting the principles of res judicata or legal certainty in civil litigation, in particular where such litigation concerns third parties with their own legitimate interests to be protected (see Bochan v.\u00a0Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a057-58, ECHR 2015, and also Bortkevich, \u00a7 76, and Rozhin, \u00a7 40, both cited above, with further references).
