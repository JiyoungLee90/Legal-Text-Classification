It observed that the generally binding effect did not entail an obligation to adhere either to one of the employers\u2019 associations or to the Social Welfare Fund. Referring to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (decision of 15 July 1980, 1\u00a0BvR 24/74, see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 27), the Labour Court of Appeal conceded that the applicant company, which was not a member of one of the employers\u2019 associations, had the disadvantage of not being able to assert its interests by exercising control over the activities of the Social Welfare Fund via these associations. The right to participate in the decision-making process within these associations was reserved to members of the respective association. In so far as this fact exerted a certain pressure to become a member of one of the employers\u2019 associations, this was, however, not sufficient to amount to a violation of the negative aspect of its right to freedom of association.",

The Court reiterates that the obligation to contribute financially to an association can resemble an important feature in common with that of joining an association and can constitute an interference with the negative aspect of the right to freedom of association (V\u00f6r\u00f0ur \u00d3lafsson, cited above, \u00a7 48).",

It notes that the relevant collective agreements were designed to be declared generally applicable. Sector-specific supplementary social welfare systems could not provide the intended social security for all employees in that sector if only employers who were members of an employers\u2019 association had to participate. In order to provide the intended social security, the social welfare schemes presupposed that all employers and employees in the building industry, especially those not bound by collective agreements, were included in the schemes. The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s contributions could exclusively be used to administer and to implement these schemes and to pay out the respective benefits (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 35). In addition, the ZVK and the ULAK offered optional benefits to employers and employees, irrespective of whether or not the employer was a member of an employers\u2019 association (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph 32). The contributions at stake in the present case can thus not be considered membership contributions. What is more, the duty to pay contributions was offset by the applicant company\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement by the Social Welfare Fund.",

The entity of the Social Welfare Fund to which the applicant company was obliged to contribute financially, the ZVK, was subject to supervision by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph \u00a7 34).

It argued that, at most, the applicant company\u2019s assets were affected because they would initially decrease on account of the duty to pay contributions and that assets as such did not fall within the protection of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Also, the duty to pay contributions was offset by the applicant company\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement by the Social Welfare Fund. Moreover, declaring collective agreements establishing supplementary social welfare schemes in the building industry generally applicable was necessary in the public interest and within the wide margin of appreciation that member States enjoyed in relation to social and economic policies.",

The Court further considers that it was established case-law of domestic courts that drilling work, as carried out by the applicant company, fell within the scope of the VTV. Whilst noting that there is dispute between the parties as to whether the conditions for declaring the VTV generally binding were met at the material time, and whether the applicant company fell within the scope of application of the VTV, the Court finds no reason to question the finding of the domestic courts that declaring the VTV generally applicable was in conformity with domestic law and that the applicant company fell within its scope of application. It is in the first place for the domestic authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law (see V\u00f6r\u00f0ur\u00a0\u00d3lafsson, cited above, \u00a7 72, with further references).
