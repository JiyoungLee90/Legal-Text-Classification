As concerns the hunger strike, Dr H. stated that it was likely that Y.C. had not eaten solid food for several days, but that it was unlikely that he had engaged in a long-term total hunger strike as the large intestine had still been filled with an abundance of stool along its entire length.",

Rather, it was more likely that a shift in the electrolyte system had commenced over a period of several days, as indicated by the results of the blood test conducted by Linz General Hospital on 4 October 2005. A post-mortem examination of Y.C.\u2019s blood (conducted in the course of the autopsy) had shown that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait (Sichelzellanlage). Dr H. explained that sickle cell disease (Sichelzellenkrankheit) was an inherited red blood cell disorder; while red blood cells (containing normal haemoglobin) were disc-shaped, sickle haemoglobin could form stiff rods within the cell, changing it into a sickle shape. Dr H. added that the disease was rare among the white population, occurring mostly among black people. Unlike in the case of people suffering from sickle cell disease, in Y.C.\u2019s blood the trait had been present in the heterozygous form, which is why the disease had remained undetected during his lifetime. In cases like Y.C.\u2019s, symptoms of sickle cell disease only manifested themselves if there were further damaging external factors, such as dehydration or a lack of oxygen.",

Neither the authorities nor Y.C. himself had been aware that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait. Dr H. stated that Y.C.\u2019s death could only have been prevented if he had been tested earlier for sickle cell trait, or if he had been aware that he was a carrier thereof.

Dr W.G, who had not examined Y.C.\u2019s body, had based his report on the autopsy report and expert report issued by Dr H., the report of the OIA (see paragraph 24 above) and the report by Linz General Hospital, and had come to the following opinion. On 12 September 2005, the day on which Y.C. had been taken into detention with a view to his expulsion, he had weighed 76.5 kg. On 28\u00a0September 2005, the day on which Y.C. had announced that he was on hunger strike, he had had a body weight of only 67 kg. The police doctor had made a mistake in taking the latter as the normal weight of Y.C. for the purposes of calculating his critical body weight. The doctor had not taken into account the fact that Y.C. had already lost 9.5 kg between 12 and 28\u00a0September 2005, meaning that Y.C. must have already started his hunger strike before he had officially announced it. From 28 September until the day of his death on 4\u00a0October 2005, Y.C. had lost a further 8 kg in body weight. However, the doctor had used Y.C.\u2019s weight on 28 September (namely 67 kg) as a starting point, and had established his critical weight as 54 kg, which in Dr W.G.\u2019s view was incorrect. The police doctor should have based his calculations on how much Y.C. had weighed when he had arrived at the detention centre. If he had, the correct critical weight would have been determined at 67 kg, minus 10%. Instead, Y.C. at the time of his death had already lost approximately 18% of his weight in fluids. For an adult person a loss of even 10% in fluids constituted a life-threatening situation. Dr W.G. assumed that Y.C. had died of dehydration resulting from the erroneous calculation of his body weight. He did not deal with the question of how far the sickle cell trait present in Y.C.\u2019s blood had played a role in his death, nor did he provide any scientific source for his calculations. Dr W.G.\u2019s opinion was later not supported by any of the official experts.",

Concerning the cause of Y.C.\u2019s death, the IAP reiterated the findings of the autopsy report and the expert report attached thereto (see paragraphs 30-33 above). The IAP argued that the State authorities had not fulfilled their role of guarantor of the applicant\u2019s rights under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. It found that given the frequency of sickle cell disease among people from sub-Saharan Africa, the State was under an obligation to offer a test for sickle cell disease to all detainees from that specific geographic area, and in particular to those on hunger strike.",

He added that this was the case in respect of 30% of the population of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, such as the Gambia (where Y.C. had been from), and that this trait served as a protection from Malaria. The fact that a person was a carrier of sickle cell trait did not mean that he or she was ill or had a lower life expectancy. Nonetheless he or she would face a higher risk of death in the event of engaging in strenuous activities (anstrengungsassoziierte Todesf\u00e4lle), and the trait could also cause rapid dehydration in the event of reduced liquid intake. Dr L. explained that sickle cell disease could only be detected through an analysis of blood samples, but that the need for such an analysis had at no point been clearly indicated in Y.C.\u2019s case, even in the light of his reduced mental and physical condition.",

These ordinances required police detention centres, after being notified of a hunger strike, to ensure without undue delay the undertaking of a preliminary examination of the hunger striker in question by a police doctor in the presence of an interpreter or an official conversant in the language of the detainee. The individual critical weight of the person on hunger strike had to be determined during such a first examination on the basis of his or her weight at the outset of the hunger strike. In the event that a hunger striker was of normal weight or was overweight and enjoyed good health, the benchmark for determining the critical weight of a hunger striker was to be 20% of his weight, as recorded at the outset of his hunger strike; in the event that a hunger striker was in poor physical condition the benchmark was to be 10%. A urine test was recommended. A documented clinical examination of all the parameters set out in the hunger-strike form \u2013 together with a documented assessment of arterial oxygen saturation \u2013 had to be carried out on a daily basis.",

After the public prosecutor had decided to discontinue the criminal investigation into Y.C.\u2019s death, the applicant\u2019s counsel had been informed in writing that the applicant had the possibility to take over the prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor (Subsidi\u00e4rankl\u00e4ger), in accordance with Article 48 \u00a7 1 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Government has not brought forward any convincing arguments in that respect or quoted domestic case-law to demonstrate that in a comparable case this remedy has proven to be effective. In the light of the fact that the public prosecutor did not find any reason to continue the preliminary investigation, and given that there were not even any concrete suspects (since the investigation was directed against \u201cunknown persons\u201d), it appears unlikely that a request to continue the proceedings would have had any prospect of success. The Court agrees in any event with the applicant that requesting him to pursue this remedy would have inappropriately shifted the duty stipulated by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation from the Government to the applicant. The procedural obligation to investigate alleged ill-treatment and a death in police custody under these provisions clearly lies with the authorities, who must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. The authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, Nachova and Others v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2005VII).

Although the failure to comply with such an obligation may have consequences for the right protected under Article 13, the procedural obligation of Article 2 is seen as a distinct obligation (see, inter alia, \u0160ilih v.\u00a0Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, \u00a7\u00a7 153\u2011154, 9 April 2009). It can give rise to a finding of a separate and independent \u201cinterference\u201d. This conclusion derives from the fact that the Court has consistently examined the question of procedural obligations separately from the question of compliance with the substantive obligation (and, where appropriate, has found a separate violation of Article 2 on that account) and the fact that on several occasions a breach of a procedural obligation under Article 2 has been alleged in the absence of any complaint as to its substantive aspect (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 158-159).",

Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 16\u00a0December 1992, \u00a7 34, Series A no 247-B). Although the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by the domestic courts (see Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0180, and Aydan v.

All relevant witnesses were questioned, evidence was immediately secured and seized, and an expert report concerning the cause of death was ordered. It was not disputed by the applicant that the expert Dr\u00a0H. had been independent. The applicant, as a member of Y.C.\u2019s family, was able to join the proceedings as a private party. The Court cannot discern any indication of shortcomings in the public prosecutor\u2019s investigation. The criminal investigation was ultimately closed by the public prosecutor as no sufficient evidence was found to indicate misconduct on the part of the persons in charge. The public prosecutor thereby relied on the comprehensive autopsy report and expert report issued by Dr H. (see paragraphs 30-33 above), which clearly stated that death through the use of force could be excluded, and that Y.C. had in fact died of dehydration, combined with the fact that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait (see paragraph 33 above).",

The IAP examined the evidence and delivered three decisions, two of which were quashed by the Administrative Court. While the IAP found that the authorities should have known that Y.C. came from a country whose inhabitants bore a high likelihood of being a carrier of sickle cell disease and therefore should have informed Y.C. of this potential risk after he had embarked upon his hunger strike, the Administrative Court found that the mere fact that a person came from a country with a high rate of sickle cell disease did not mean that the State had a duty to test every person from a certain area for this genetic predisposition. After obtaining a second expert report, the IAP eventually acted in accordance with the legal opinion of the Administrative Court and dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints.",

Relevant witnesses were heard, an additional expert report was obtained, and the applicant played an active role in those proceedings, was able to lodge requests, and had access to the case file. Again, the independence of the court-appointed expert was at no point called into question by the applicant. However, he did submit as evidence a statement which focused on the calculation of Y.C.\u2019s critical weight and possible mistakes which allegedly were made in that respect. The Court, contrary to the applicant\u2019s allegation in that respect (see paragraph 75 above), sees no indication from the documents at hand that the IAP did not take into account the statement. The applicant was able to submit it as evidence in the course of the IAP proceedings, and the question of Y.C.\u2019s critical weight was discussed with the expert Dr L. during the hearing of 21 June 2012 (see paragraph 55 above). In addition, the expert Dr H. concluded that the cause of Y.C.\u2019s death had been dehydration, combined with the fact that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait, and his death could therefore only have been prevented if he had been tested earlier for sickle cell trait, or if he had been aware that he was a carrier thereof. The expert Dr L. equally found that the calculation of the critical weight had had no bearing on Y.C.\u2019s death. In its subsequent decision, the IAP ultimately decided to follow Dr L.\u2019s expert report rather than the statement of Dr W.G. (see paragraph 44 above). The Court sees no reason to question the domestic courts\u2019 decision to ascribe decisive importance to these findings, rather than relying on the statement of Dr W.G. The Court recalls within this context that it is not its task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them (see, among other authorities, Edwards, cited above, \u00a7 34).",

Italy (no. 2) (dec.), no. 25498/94, ECHR\u00a01999V). In assessing whether such a measure may fall within the ambit of Article 3 in a given case, regard must be had to the particular conditions, the stringency of the measure and its duration, the objective pursued and the effects of the measure on the person concerned (see Van\u00a0der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2003II; and Lors\u00e9 and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 52750/99, \u00a7 63, 4 February 2003).

The Court sees no indication that these instructions were in themselves insufficient or unclear, or that overall in the instant case they were not sufficiently followed. When Y.C. announced his hunger strike to the authorities, he was handed an information sheet in his mother tongue detailing the risks associated with a hunger strike, and he was examined by a medical doctor without delay. A hunger strike form was filled out and certain medical measures were taken on a daily basis by the police doctor on duty (see paragraphs 12-14 above). There is no indication that any legal provision, internal order, recommendation or international material concerning medical care for detainees on hunger strike was disregarded. Furthermore there were no indications that Y.C. suffered from sickle cell disease and he was not aware of it himself. At the time, even hospitals did not conduct standardised tests for that blood anomaly (see paragraph 52 above). The Court therefore cannot blame the authorities for not having given appropriate instructions at the outset to conduct such a test for the applicant.",

During the administrative proceedings, all except one of the witnesses stated that even shortly before his death, Y.C. had still appeared to be athletic and strong (see paragraph 40 above). The police doctor Dr F.G. stated that on 3\u00a0October 2005 Y.C. had walked into the examination room without support, which is why he had not assumed that Y.C. was in a lifethreatening situation. However, because on 4 October 2005 it was noticed that Y.C. had a dry tongue and barky lips and had arrived at the examination room while being supported by two detainees (see paragraph\u00a016), Dr F.G. ordered the examination that day to be carried out at the hospital (see paragraph 41 above). During the examination at Linz General Hospital on the day of his death, he used a great deal of physical force, resisting the examination and kicking out at the hospital staff (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). The treating doctor, an experienced emergency doctor, observed Y.C.\u2019s dry lips, but after a further examination he could not find other symptoms of dehydration or other abnormalities (see paragraph 19 above). Nevertheless, a blood test was ordered to address that question.",

Even though the applicant\u2019s behaviour might, with hindsight, be considered as a sign of already advanced dehydration and a consequent disintegration of his blood cells owing to sickle cell disease (see paragraph 34 above), that was not foreseeable at the time of the events. That impression is confirmed by both experts\u2019 description of Y.C.\u2019s physical condition after his death.

When he informed the authorities of his hunger strike on 28 September 2005, Y.C.\u2019s weight was recorded as 67 kg, which was taken as the basis for calculation of his critical weight at 54 kg. When he died, Y.C. weighed 59 kg (see paragraphs 10-13 and 18 above). Based on the extensive investigation conducted at domestic level, there were no indications that Y.C.\u2019s weight had ever been wrongly calculated and that he had possibly reached his critical weight before he died on 4\u00a0October 2005. Dr L., appointed by the IAP to deal extensively with that issue, did not support the assumptions of Dr W.G., whom the applicant had engaged and who contended that Y.C. had started his hunger strike earlier than 27 September 2005 and had already fallen below his critical weight before his death (see paragraph 44 above). Dr L. found it likely that Y.C. had always been weighed properly and stated that the relatively high weight of 76.5 kg recorded on 12 September must have been an incorrect recording (see paragraph 55 above). The Court considers this possible mistake particularly regrettable because the correct recording of a detainee\u2019s weight may be critical for determining when and what medical care is made available during detention and the course of a hunger strike (see paragraphs\u00a064-65 above). Given the protocol in place in Austria for the treatment of detainees on hunger strike, it falls to the competent authorities to follow the instructions it contains with due diligence. However, on the basis of the experts\u2019 reports, which were examined in detail by the domestic investigative authorities, the Court cannot discern any causal link between the possible mistake in recording Y.C.\u2019s weight on 12\u00a0September, the calculation of his critical weight on 28 September and his death on 4\u00a0October 2005. As has been convincingly established in medical terms, the cause of Y.C.\u2019s death was dehydration whose effects were rapidly and unforeseeably exacerbated by the fact that he was a carrier of sickle cell disease (see paragraphs 32, 33 and 54). Neither Y.C.\u2019s appearance nor his behaviour at the hospital gave rise to an assumption that he could be suffering from acute, life-threatening dehydration. The fact that Y.C. was a carrier of sickle cell disease was only discovered through a blood test, of which the result only became available after his death. In addition, although Y.C. was returned to the detention centre before the result of the blood test was available, this was following a medical assessment of his condition.",
