According to the Italian Government, application of those two treaties in the instant case was optional, whereas in the submission of the applicant and the third-party intervener it was mandatory. The applicant also contested the legitimacy of using the procedure for rectification of an error to cure mistakes in the way his particulars were recorded in the judgment by which he was convicted.",
