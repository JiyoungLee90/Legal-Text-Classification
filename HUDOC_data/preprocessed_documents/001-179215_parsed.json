Moreover, his renouncement of the pension from the YPA Fund could not be considered a waiver of his right to a pension in Slovenia, as seems to have been suggested by the Government (see paragraph 32 above). In particular, he requested that the YPA Fund formally discontinue the payments of his pension after he had not received them for several months and with a view to claiming an advance on his pension payment from Slovenia (see paragraph 15 above). This had happened five years before the 1998 Act entered into force. Furthermore and most importantly, the applicant complained about the effect that the 1998 Act and the decisions adopted by the Slovenian authorities had had on his Convention rights, not the authorities of Serbia. Therefore the Court, without prejudging the merits of the case, cannot discern any elements which would call into question either his victim status or the responsibility of the respondent State for the measure complained of.\u00a0The application is therefore compatible ratione personae with the Convention.",

In particular, pursuant to section 18 of the 1991 Constitutional Act (see paragraph 25 above) Slovenia had been obliged to grant the protection of pension rights to foreigners already receiving military pensions under the SFRY military rules but not to YPA military personnel who had not been granted pension rights by 25 June 1991. The Government thus considered that all the rights granted by Slovenia to insured YPA military personnel after the SFRY\u2019s dissolution had been provided \u201cvoluntarily\u201d, pending the conclusion of the Agreement on Succession Issues. Relying on the Court\u2019s findings in Predojevi\u0107, Prokopovi\u0107, Prijovi\u0107 and Martinovi\u010d v. Slovenia ((dec.), nos. 43445/98 and 3 others, 7 June 2001), the Government maintained that the funding of military pension advances had constituted a unilateral commitment on the part of Slovenia. Furthermore, they submitted that the right to an old-age pension under the 1998 Act was not a right arising from pension and disability insurance. The applicant had been insured under a completely separate insurance system with the YPA Fund which had nothing to do with Slovenia and had no legitimate claim for the payment of a military pension against it.",

It has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to \u201cthe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\u201d safeguarded by those provisions. The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall \u201cwithin the ambit\u201d of one or more of the Convention Articles (see, among many other authorities, Andrejeva v.

The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

There were no exceptions to this requirement, and all potential beneficiaries could be subject to verification, including those of Slovenian nationality (see paragraph 29 above).

Moreover, the Constitutional Court has never examined the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint challenging the aforementioned dismissal of his citizenship application, finding an examination unnecessary because he had in the meantime acquired Slovenian citizenship under a different legal provision (see paragraphs 14 and 19 above). The Court further finds it particularly significant that the Slovenian authorities already in 1993 granted the applicant an advance on his military pension to which only those who were found not to have participated in the aggression against Slovenia were entitled (see paragraphs 15 and 28 above). The applicant was also granted an old-age pension, which was similarly conditional on non-participation in the aggression against Slovenia, as soon as he acquired Slovenian citizenship in 2003 (see paragraphs 20 and 63 above).",

At that time the applicant already had Slovenian citizenship and was receiving his old-age pension under the 1998 Act. Prior to the Agreement on Succession Issues there were only each State\u2019s domestic laws that regulated in their own way the pension rights of YPA military personnel. However, the Court again observes that the Government did not put forward any evidence that between November 1998 and April 2003 the applicant could have in fact received a pension for his employment in the YPA from another SFRY successor State (see paragraph 59 above). The Court, for its part, is fully aware that there might have been some uncertainty as to which successor State should have assumed responsibility for the pensions of retired YPA military personnel. Nonetheless, it reiterates that by ratifying the Convention, the respondent State undertook to secure \u201cto everyone within [its] jurisdiction\u201d the rights and freedoms guaranteed therein.

Furthermore, the indispensable condition for making an award in respect of pecuniary damage is the existence of a causal link between the damage alleged and the violation found (see, for instance, Andrejeva, cited above, \u00a7 111). In the light of the foregoing, the Court awards the applicant EUR 24,342 as compensation for fifty-two unpaid pension instalments to which he would have been entitled between December 1998 and April 2003 had the violation of Article 14 not occurred. To this some interest should be added, reflecting the inflation rates since the relevant period. It therefore awards him EUR 37,000 in respect of the pecuniary damage sustained.",
