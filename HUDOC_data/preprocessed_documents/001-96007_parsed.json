Furthermore, the fact that immunity has a place in the Constitution means that the rules and aims of immunity must be defined in the light of the rules and aims of the Constitution. There is no doubt that the intention, when immunity was provided for in Article 83, was to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure. In other words, the aim of parliamentary immunity is to ensure that MPs are not prevented, even temporarily, from fulfilling their functions by arbitrary criminal proceedings. So the powers of the legislature in the matter are limited by the purpose for which immunity was institutionalised in the Constitution.",

The restrictions upon the applicant\u2019s rights of access to a court and his right to a trial within a reasonable time are, in my view, in violation of Article 6. The vindication of such core rights, on the facts of this case, would not have undermined the importance of the principle of parliamentary immunity. I would add the following brief remarks.",

The case concerns whether the applicant ought to be entitled to lift the mantle of immunity which his public office confers upon him in order to have determined, within a reasonable time, outstanding criminal proceedings which were pending prior to his election and which are entirely unconnected with his work as a parliamentarian.",

Important as that institution is, however, one must never lose sight of the purpose for which it was intended. An uncritical and unnecessary extension of the principle to matters wholly dissociated from public office risks jeopardising public confidence in the system of parliamentary democracy itself. The more remote the shielded behaviour is from the duties of public office, the greater the justification must be for permitting the benefit of immunity to apply and, by extension, the more pressing the need to justify a refusal of its waiver where core human rights are at stake. Where the immunity operates in such a way as to afford protection from or bar access to the criminal courts in relation to matters that are entirely unconnected with public office then, in my view, the justification for refusing to waive it must be established, convincingly. Specific and objective criteria which could justify such a refusal are not to be found in this case.",

Essentially, he is obliged to choose between two rights. The suspension of justice is a serious matter and, in my view, should not be required unless strictly necessary. Such necessity has not been established in this case. The rights of the applicant are capable of being vindicated without damaging or undermining the general interest which parliamentary immunity seeks to preserve.",
