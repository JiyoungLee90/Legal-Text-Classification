According to that report, the F\u0131rat News Agency, a website controlled by the PKK (Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party, an armed illegal organisation), had published a declaration by the KCK (Koma Civak\u00ean Kurdistan \u2013 the Union of Communities in Kurdistan), containing instructions to hold meetings and marches, to start Serhildan (rebellion), and carry out acts of civil disobedience to show support for Abdullah \u00d6calan. As a result, on 11\u00a0December 2009, a press conference was held and around 500-550 people, including mayors and local politicians from the DTP (Party for a Democratic Society), a pro-Kurdish political party, as well as members of a number of non-governmental organisations, gathered in front of the DTP\u2019s Hakkari office. During the press conference, the crowd chanted slogans and carried banners praising Abdullah \u00d6calan and the PKK. That same day, the DTP\u2019s dissolution was ordered by the Constitutional Court and thirty-seven of its members were banned from carrying out political activities. As a result, the F\u0131rat News Agency published another article containing instructions for further Serhildan\u00a0acts\u00a0and for demonstrations. According to the police report, on 11\u00a0and\u00a012\u00a0December 2009 the security forces had intervened in several areas in the city where demonstrators had blocked the traffic, chanted slogans in favour of the PKK and its leader, and burned tyres or attacked cars, shops and administrative buildings. The report further stated that when the security forces had intervened, some demonstrators had responded by throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at the police officers. According to the report on the applicant\u2019s arrest, he had been apprehended after the police had moved against a group of 50-60 people who had been chanting slogans in favour of the PKK and its leader in the cemetery of the Bi\u00e7er neighbourhood.",

In his decision, the public prosecutor first summarised the content of the incident report dated 12 December 2009 (see paragraph 7 above). Secondly, he noted that the applicant had acted with a group of people who had chanted slogans in favour of the PKK and that he had been arrested after he had attempted to escape and had fallen. The public prosecutor noted in that respect that two police officers had identified the applicant. The public prosecutor then noted that the applicant had acted with groups of people who had blocked traffic, burned tyres, chanted slogans praising the PKK, carried out attacks with stones and Molotov cocktails, and that he had resisted the police by throwing stones when they tried to arrest him, and that he had fallen. The public prosecutor observed that although the applicant had sustained minor injuries on his face and body, he had failed to substantiate his claims that he had been beaten and insulted by the police officers. According to the public prosecutor, acts of \u201csocial terrorism\u201d led supporters of terrorism to resist or attack the security forces, in some cases with weapons, and so members of the security forces were obliged to use force within the limits of the law. The Hakkari public prosecutor considered that the applicant had acted upon the instructions of the PKK and that it was to be expected that such people would make claims of ill-treatment. Noting that, according to section 16 of Law no. 2559 on the Duties and Powers of the Police, the police officers had the authority to use force against PKK supporters, the public prosecutor considered that the police had used proportionate force against the applicant. He also noted that there was no evidence in the case file indicating any deficiency in the medical reports drafted by the doctors.

The Court accordingly finds it appropriate to examine whether the investigation carried out by the national authorities was capable of establishing the true circumstances of the applicant\u2019s arrest and ascertaining the cause of his injuries.",

In contrast, the incident and arrest reports, and the arresting officers\u2019 statements, stated that the applicant had acted with a group of people who had chanted slogans praising the PKK and its leader and burned tyres, and who had thrown stones at the police when the latter had intervened. The Hakkari public prosecutor not only failed to look into the wide disparities between the accounts of events by the applicant and the police officers, but also noted that the applicant had committed a number of reprehensible acts which did not appear in the police reports. According to the public prosecutor\u2019s decision, the applicant had not only burned tyres and chanted slogans praising the PKK, but had also blocked the traffic and carried out attacks with Molotov cocktails (see paragraph 23 above). Given that the public prosecutor\u2019s findings of fact leading to the applicant\u2019s arrest are not based on any of the evidence in the investigation file, the Court is unable to comprehend exactly what evidence or information formed the basis for those findings. In that regard, the Court must take note of the fact that the Government did not claim that the applicant appeared in any of the 818\u00a0photographs submitted to the Court.",

However, that fact did not spur the Hakkari public prosecutor into putting any questions to those officers. As a matter of fact, the public prosecutor neither obtained the arresting officers\u2019 statements nor asked for one from the applicant regarding his allegations, even though there had been an explicit request by the applicant\u2019s legal representative for such a statement (see paragraph 22 above). Nor did the public prosecutor conduct an on-site inspection at the scene of the incident or attempt to ascertain the sequence of events between 4\u00a0p.m. and 6.33\u00a0p.m., when the applicant was under the control of the police.",
