He had submitted evidence showing that the termination of his parental status would not be in V.\u2019s best interests, in particular evidence of his active participation in V.\u2019s life, of his wish to continue raising V. as his own child and of V.\u2019s attachment to him, such as photographs, videos, copies of instant messages, documents showing that he had bought clothes, medicine, sports equipment, books and toys for V. and had taken him to the theatre, the cinema, the pool and the amusement park. The appellate court had not taken that evidence into account, limiting its assessment to a finding that he was not V.\u2019s biological father. The applicant claimed that he had never refused to undergo a DNA paternity test but had simply been unable to appear on the appointed dates, the first time because his car had broken down on the way to the laboratory, and then because he had been sick. In any event, he did not care whether he was V.\u2019s biological father or not. He considered that the relevant facts were that he loved V. and that V. loved and needed him. He submitted that the termination of his parental status would result in his complete exclusion from V.\u2019s life. Given that V. was very attached to him, as confirmed by the expert report of 25\u00a0August 2016 (see paragraph 13 above), such exclusion would be psychologically traumatic for V. There was also no evidence that the supposed biological father wished to participate in V.\u2019s upbringing. The termination of his parental status would therefore leave V. fatherless. The applicant further complained that the judges had rejected his request to question V. and that the opinion of the childcare authorities had not been obtained. Lastly, the applicant submitted new evidence showing that even after the appellate judgment terminating his parental status he had still continued to see V. and to support him financially.",

The Court found that the complete and automatic exclusion of the applicant from the child\u2019s life after his parental status in respect of her had been terminated as a result of the inflexibility of the domestic legal provisions \u2013 in particular the denial of contact rights without giving proper consideration to the child\u2019s best interests \u2013 amounted to a failure to respect the applicant\u2019s family life (ibid., \u00a7\u00a068).",

That Ruling was published shortly before the appeal hearing in the present case and the applicant immediately relied on it. The appeal and cassation courts, however, summarily rejected that argument, finding no exceptional circumstances for the application of the Ruling, despite the fact that the applicant had submitted ample evidence of the circumstances mentioned in it as grounds for maintaining parental status, in particular, the long family relationship between him and V., V.\u2019s stable emotional attachment to him and his intention to continue taking care of V. and raising him as his own, as well as the lack of desire on the part of the biological father to participate in V.\u2019s life (see paragraphs\u00a019 and 21 above).",

No changes to the relevant domestic law were made following delivery of that judgment and, as confirmed by the present case, it still remains impossible for a person in the applicant\u2019s situation to obtain contact rights, irrespective of the best interests of the child. Indeed, after his parental status had been terminated, the applicant\u2019s application for contact rights was rejected on the ground that he was not V.\u2019s father or related to him in any other way and therefore had no standing to apply for contact rights (see paragraph 28 above). It is true that the appellate court also briefly referred to the absence of a close emotional tie between the applicant and V. in its judgment. There is, however, no evidence in the case file that the strength of the emotional tie between the applicant and V. was ever assessed in the course of the contact proceedings, either by the childcare authorities or the courts. Indeed, the childcare authorities\u2019 assessment was limited to the finding that the applicant was not entitled to contact rights because he was not V.\u2019s father (see paragraph 25 above), whereas the domestic courts, as stressed by the Supreme Court of the Bashkortostan Republic, did not examine the application for contact rights on the merits (see paragraph 30 above).",

In the present case, the Court has found a violation of the Convention on account of the complete and automatic exclusion of the applicant from his son\u2019s life after his parental status in respect of him was terminated. There is no causal link between that violation and the costs claimed for the legal fees in the domestic proceedings, which would have been incurred in any event (compare P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 56547/00, \u00a7 148, ECHR 2002VI, and Petrov and X v. Russia, no.\u00a023608/16, \u00a7 137, 23 October 2018). The Court therefore rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings.",
