Albania (no. 38222/02, 13 November 2007) and Dene\u015f and Others v. Romania (no. 25862/03, 3 March 2009), the applicant had not suffered an initial taking or loss of property which the State had undertaken to compensate for. The bonds of which the applicant was the holder were given to agricultural workers as an additional incentive to encourage them to sell their produce to the State, which had paid for it at fixed prices. Nor could these bonds be used as legal tender or a money substitute: they certified the bearer\u2019s right to purchase goods in high demand but the buyer still had to pay the full purchase price in cash or otherwise. These particular features of the bonds may be relevant for an assessment of the level of compensation which was eventually offered to the bond-holders, since the Court has already considered that a substantially reduced amount of compensation may be acceptable in a situation in which the compensatory entitlement does not arise from any previous taking of individual property by the respondent State but is designed to mitigate the effects of a taking or loss of property not attributable to the State (see Broniowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 182 and\u00a0186). However, the Court reiterates that the applicant\u2019s complaints in the instant case do not concern the amount of compensation recoverable under the Buyout Act passed in 2009; its grievances stemmed from the fact that, in passing the Commodity Bonds Act, the Russian State had voluntarily taken upon itself an obligation towards bearers of the bonds that had not been discharged for many years owing to the absence of a legislative framework for its implementation.",

In the context of the present case, those principles required the  to fulfil in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner, the legislative promises it had made in respect of claims arising out of the Urozhay-90 bonds. In particular, it was incumbent on the authorities to legislate on the conditions for implementation of the bond-bearers\u2019 entitlement with a view to satisfying the undertaking that had been created through the enactment of the Commodity Bonds Act. The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s submission that the recognition of the bonds as part of the State\u2019s internal debt had been \u201cmistaken\u201d. Even if this were so, no explanation was offered as to why that alleged mistake had not been promptly identified and corrected through an appropriate amendment of the Commodity Bonds Act. It could not have been due to a mere oversight or oblivion because the application of section 1 of the Commodity Bonds Act in the part concerning the Urozhay-90 bonds had been explicitly and repeatedly suspended for many years in the successive laws on the federal budget.",

The information available to the Court does not allow it to find that the Russian Government took any measures in that period with a view to satisfying the claims arising out of the bonds. No draft legislation governing the State\u2019s obligations under the bonds had been proposed or discussed in Parliament. The preparatory work which was essential for drafting such legislation had not been carried out. The inventory of the bonds, which had already been decided upon in the Government\u2019s Resolution of 10\u00a0August 1992 (see paragraph 28 above), had never been completed and, accordingly, the exact number and amount of the outstanding bonds could not have been known. The Court therefore finds that the Government\u2019s argument that the restrictions on redemption of the bonds had been necessary to prevent excessive expenditure from the federal budget is hardly persuasive. An appropriate balancing exercise determining the exact amount that would be required to settle the debt under the bonds in relation to other priority expenses could not have been possible in the absence of crucial figures, such as the quantity and total valuation of the remaining bonds. While the Court agrees that the radical reform of Russia\u2019s political and economic system, as well as the state of the country\u2019s finances, may have justified stringent financial limitations on rights of a purely pecuniary nature, it finds that the Russian Government were not able to adduce satisfactory grounds justifying, in terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the continuous failure over many years to implement an entitlement conferred on the applicant by Russian legislation.",

Russia, no.\u00a072701/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a019 et seq., 15\u00a0March 2005; Groshev v. Russia, no.\u00a069889/01, \u00a7\u00a7 27 et seq., 20\u00a0October 2005; and Mokrushina v. Russia, no. 23377/02, 5\u00a0October 2006). The situation in the present case was different. Counsel for the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing on 11\u00a0December 2001 by mail. The decision to adjourn the hearing until 17\u00a0December 2001 had been communicated to him in person. Thus, it transpires that he had been fully aware of the new hearing date but had not appeared at court, without giving a valid reason for his absence.",
