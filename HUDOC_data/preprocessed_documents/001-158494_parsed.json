For instance, in the case of Yeti\u015fen and Others v. Turkey ((dec.), no.\u00a021099/06, 10 July 2012), the applicants waited for four years after the disappearance before lodging an official complaint with the competent investigating authorities, and for eleven and a half years before bringing their application to Strasbourg; in the case of Findik and Omer v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 33898/11 and 35798/11, 9 October 2012, the applicants brought their applications to Strasbourg more than fifteen years after the events; and in the case of Ta\u015f\u00e7i and Duman v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 40787/10, 9 October 2012), the applicants applied to Strasbourg twenty-three years after the disappearance in question. In these cases, like in the case of A\u00e7\u0131\u015f v. Turkey (no. 7050/05, \u00a7\u00a7 41-42, 1 February 2011), where the applicants complained to Strasbourg more than twelve years after the pertinent disappearance, the Court rejected as out of time their complaints concerning the procedural aspect of Article 2 of the Convention for the failure to demonstrate any concrete progress in the domestic investigation to justify their delays of more than ten years.",

The Court notes that while the proceedings were dormant, even in the absence of official replies to their complaints, the applicant and her relatives communicated with the authorities trying to obtain information on the fate of Mr Magomed Bimuradov and expedite the proceedings.

The prima facie threshold has been reached primarily on the basis of witness statements, including the applicants\u2019 submissions to the Court and to the domestic authorities, and other evidence attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. Taking into account those elements, the Court has concluded that the areas in question had been within the exclusive control of the State authorities in view of the military or security operations being conducted there and of the presence of servicemen (see, for example, Ibragimov and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a082, 29\u00a0May 2008; Abdulkadyrova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a0120, 8\u00a0January 2009; and Kosumova and Others v. Russia, no. , \u00a7\u00a067, 7\u00a0June 2011). If the Government failed to rebut that presumption, this would entail a violation of Article 2 in its substantive part. However, where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (see, for example, Shaipova and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a010796/04, \u00a7 87, 6\u00a0November 2008; Tovsultanova v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 77-81, 17\u00a0June 2010; and Movsayevy v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 76, 14 June 2011).",

In the case at hand, as in many previous similar cases reviewed by the Court, the investigation has been pending for many years without bringing about any significant developments as to the fate of the applicant\u2019s missing brother. While the obligation to investigate effectively is one of means and not of results, the Court notes that the criminal investigation into the disappearance of Mr\u00a0Magomed Bimuradov has been plagued by a combination of defects similar to those enumerated in the Aslakhanova and Others judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123-25). The present case was the subject of several decisions to suspend the investigation, followed by periods of inactivity, which further diminished the prospects of elucidating the circumstances of the incident. No meaningful steps have been taken by the investigators to establish whether any special operations had been conducted on or around the date of the disappearance or whether anyone had been taken on that date to the local military commander\u2019s office or to the police station. The investigators failed to examine the crime scene or question either the servicemen who had been manning the checkpoints in the vicinity or the applicant\u2019s neighbours or any of her fellow villagers, save for questioning the head of the local administration almost three years after the events (see paragraph 23 above).",
