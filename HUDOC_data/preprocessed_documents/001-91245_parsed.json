In making this submission, the applicants relied on official statistics concerning telephone interception which indicated that in 2007 99.24% of a total of 2,372 requests for interception had been granted by investigating judges. In the applicants' opinion the statistics proved that the investigating judges did not examine the reasons advanced in support of the measure of interception and that manifestly illfounded criminal charges could serve as a basis for interception. The applicants further argued that approximately 60% of the criminal offences provided for in the Criminal Code were eligible for interception warrants. The limitation in time of telephone interception warrants was only theoretical because in practice, after the expiry of a period of six months, a new authorisation could be issued by an investigating judge. According to the applicants, the provision in Article 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning the obligation of the investigating judge to inform individuals whose telephone calls had been intercepted about the investigative measures taken, was not working in practice and no investigating judge had ever complied with that provision.",

In the present case only two applicants were lawyers with licences to practise issued by the Ministry of Justice. Moreover, the applicants had not adduced any evidence that among their clients there were persons who belonged to the categories of persons to whom the relevant law applied and in respect of whom there was a reasonable likelihood that their conversations would be intercepted.

According to Article 136 of the same Code, the investigating judge is also entitled to store \u201cthe original copies of the tapes along with the complete written transcript ... in a special place in a sealed envelope\u201d and to adopt \u201ca decision regarding the destruction of records which are not important for the criminal case\u201d. However, the law makes no provision for acquainting the investigating judge with the results of the surveillance and does not require him or her to review whether the requirements of the law have been complied with. On the contrary, section 19 of the Law on Operational Investigative Activities appears to place such supervision duties on the \u201cProsecutor General, his or her deputy, and the municipal and county prosecutors\u201d. Moreover, in respect of the actual carrying out of surveillance measures in the second stage, it would appear that the interception procedure and guarantees contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the Law on Operational Investigative Activities are applicable only in the context of pending criminal proceedings and do not cover the circumstances enumerated above.",

In the present case, while the Moldovan legislation, like the Swiss legislation, guarantees the secrecy of lawyer-client communications (see paragraph 18 above), it does not provide for any procedure which would give substance to the above provision. The Court is struck by the absence of clear rules defining what should happen when, for example, a phone call made by a client to his lawyer is intercepted.",

Since this is an uncommonly high number of authorisations, the Court considers it necessary to stress that telephone tapping is a very serious interference with a person's rights and that only very serious reasons based on a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in serious criminal activity should be taken as a basis for authorising it. The Court notes that the Moldovan legislation does not elaborate on the degree of reasonableness of the suspicion against a person for the purpose of authorising an interception. Nor does it contain safeguards other than the one provided for in section 6(1), namely that interception should take place only when it is otherwise impossible to achieve the aims. This, in the Court's opinion, is a matter of concern when looked at against the very high percentage of authorisations issued by investigating judges. For the Court, this could reasonably be taken to indicate that the investigating judges do not address themselves to the existence of compelling justification for authorising measures of secret surveillance.",

In this connection, the Court notes the statistical information contained in the letter of the Head of the President's Office of the Supreme Court of Justice (see paragraph 13 above). According to that information, in 2005 over 2,500 interception warrants were issued, in 2006 some 1,900 were issued and over 2,300 warrants were issued in 2007. These figures show that the system of secret surveillance in Moldova is, to say the least, overused, which may in part be due to the inadequacy of the safeguards contained in the law (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 92).",
