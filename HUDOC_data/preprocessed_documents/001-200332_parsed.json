Under the CAO the applicants had been convicted of disobeying a lawful order from a public official whereas under the Criminal Code they had been prosecuted in relation to the use of violence against a public official. The criminal case files contained copies of the judgments issued against the applicants under the CAO and so the criminal-court judges had been aware of their prosecution for administrative offences and had examined the related judgments in the course of the criminal trials. At the same time, the applicants had not put forward any specific arguments in that respect. Moreover, when accepting a friendly settlement and the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings, the applicants had acknowledged their guilt and had agreed to make good the damage caused to the victims.

The absence of such provisions in Russian law had prevented the criminal courts from applying this principle in respect of the applicants. The Government had not referred to any domestic legal provision or jurisprudence for their non-exhaustion argument which suggested that Russian law prohibited the institution of criminal proceedings after a final judgment had been delivered under the CAO. The applicants could have tried to obtain the discontinuation of the CAO case under Article 24.5 of the CAO (see paragraph 29 above). However, they had chosen not to do so, as that course of action would have automatically given way to criminal proceedings being instituted on the basis of the same facts, which would have had more serious consequences for them. Moreover, the domestic case-law was not settled as regards the possibility of annulling a final administrative conviction under Article 24.5 of the CAO. The Government had not made any submissions on that point. In any event, the thrust of the issue under Article 4 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No.\u00a07 had arisen because of the criminal proceedings, and the annulment of the CAO conviction would not constitute adequate redress. Similarly, in view of the Court\u2019s findings in Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia ([GC], no.\u00a014939/03, \u00a7 118, ECHR 2009), an appeal against the court decision upholding the friendly settlement in the criminal case offered no prospect of success for the issue under Article 4 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No.\u00a07.",

The court specified that it consisted in that the applicant had not complied with an order to present a valid document, \u201c[had] pushed [the] police officer away from the door\u201d, had entered the meeting room and had refused to leave it. So it is reasonable to conclude that in the administrative-offence proceedings against the first applicant the act of pushing a police officer could be and was actually classified on the facts of the case as a specific manifestation of the \u201cdisobedience\u201d to that official that was held against the applicant.",

Having said this, it appears that each of the elements held against the applicant in the CAO case, including the pushing of a police officer following an order to present a valid document, was in itself sufficient for prosecuting under Article\u00a019.3 of the CAO (as \u201cdisobedience\u201d or \u201cresisting the fulfilment of [his or her] official duties by a public official\u201d) (see paragraph\u00a031 above). Indeed, the Government have not argued otherwise. In the Court\u2019s view, the issue under Article 4 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No. 7 is not resolved on account on the fact that the criminal charge contained only one aspect of the facts held against the applicant in the CAO case, in which the conviction had also been based on his disobedience by way of continuing to be present in the meeting room of the legislative assembly despite Officer\u2019s M.\u2019s order to leave it. The fact remains that the applicant had already been convicted in the CAO case for pushing Officer M.
