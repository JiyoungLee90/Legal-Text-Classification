As to the applicant's claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Court recalls that the applicant eventually obtained a determination of the merits of her claim in the third set of proceedings (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). The case differs in this respect from earlier cases in which similar issues were raised (see, for example the Kreuz judgment, cited above), where the size of the court fees imposed deprived the applicant of any opportunity of obtaining a final decision on the merits of his or her claim. However, the Court observes that, at the time of lodging her application with the Court, her statement of claim in the second set of proceedings had been returned to her on the grounds that she had failed to pay the required court fees and that in order to obtain a determination of her claim she was obliged to commence fresh proceedings which were not finally concluded until January 2005, some four years after the second set proceedings had ended. In these circumstances the Court considers that, even though the applicant may eventually have had effective access to court to determine her claim, she must have suffered frustration and a feeling of injustice as a consequence of the domestic courts' refusal to exempt her from court fees in the second set of proceedings. It therefore finds that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage, which would not be adequately compensated by the mere finding of a violation. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the aplicant EUR\u00a06,000 under this head.",
