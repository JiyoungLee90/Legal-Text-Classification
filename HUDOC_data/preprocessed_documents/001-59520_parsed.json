The applicants maintained that Armand worked principally as a jewel trader, but that he did not keep written records because he systematically avoided paying taxes and duties in Brazil. The illegality of his jewel trading had motivated their lies during their initial interviews with customs officers. The applicants\u2019 defence centred around a dispute between Armand and a rival jewel trader based in Brazil called Rudi Steiner. They stated that Armand had paid Mr Steiner USD 200,000 in advance for diamonds, which Mr\u00a0Steiner had failed to deliver to the applicants as agreed in Copenhagen on three occasions: 28 August, 29 September and 3 November 1990. On this last occasion, since, as before, Mr Steiner did not appear, Thierry and Mr\u00a0Terrasson, who had gone together to collect the diamonds, returned immediately to Heathrow, where Thierry removed Mr Terrasson\u2019s, not Mr\u00a0Smolny\u2019s, suitcase from the carousel. The applicants contended that Mr\u00a0Steiner was an informer for Customs and Excise. They claimed that, in order to avoid repaying his debt and for fear that the applicants would discredit him amongst other Brazilian traders following the non-delivery of the diamonds, he had arranged falsely to implicate them in the importation of cocaine. However, they had no evidence to connect Mr Steiner to Mr\u00a0Molny\u2019s suitcase full of drugs or to substantiate the suggestion that he was a Customs and Excise informer.",

He got Morgan to send Smolny off with the suitcase ... with the drugs in it, believing it, of course, to be antiques and works of art.\t\n\tHe got Armand Atlan to believe that it was worthwhile going for the third time to Copenhagen for a delivery of the diamonds and he notified Customs of the itinerary of the various people which was to be foreseen from these arrangements, and that is how the incident you have heard about on the afternoon of that day and indeed the observations of that day, came about.\t\n\tIt follows from that account \u2013 if it is an accurate one \u2013 that Mr Steiner had some luck: firstly, Terrasson had a suitcase just like Morgan\u2019s. Possibly someone had observed Terrasson\u2019s suitcase and given a very exact description to Morgan or Steiner and they were able to get a duplicate. \t\n\tIt would be difficult for Steiner to ask the British Customs and Excise about Terrasson\u2019s suitcase for that purpose, you may think, without revealing that he himself was engaged in setting them up.\t\n\tYou may think that British Customs and Excise in Britain would agree \u2013 you may want to consider whether they would agree to co-operate on that basis in framing an innocent group of foreigners of good character at the behest of an unknown Brazilian businessman like Steiner. ...\t\n\tJust consider in your mind what it would be like to try and induce the British Customs Service, even as an English subject, to co-operate with you in such a way. ...\n\t[I]t is worth just looking at the costs to Mr Steiner if Mr Atlan\u2019s story is right ... to see what was in it for Mr Steiner.\t\n\tHis costs: he provided initially some samples [of diamonds] worth seven or eight thousand ... US dollars. ... He lost the cost of sending [his representative] diagonally across the world and back [with the sample] with a bit of time in a hotel. ...\t\n\tHe lost the cost of Mr Smolny\u2019s fare in the Euro-class Sao Paolo/Copenhagen/London return, and he lost the cost of Mr Smolny\u2019s London hotel\u00a0... .\t \n\t[T]he case is that he lost all those things and whatever is the cost of 18 kilograms of 90 plus percent pure cocaine in Brazil.\t\n\tNo doubt that cost is very, very much less than it would be in London, but ... you may think that 18 kilograms of high quality cocaine like that would cost a substantial sum, albeit nowhere near three million pounds, in the providing country.\t\n\tI put those bits and pieces of information together because it is not altogether obvious when one just runs through the story that that is what the information amounts to, but you may think it does, and it may be relevant to considering the likelihood of somebody behaving in the way Mr Steiner is said to have done.\u201d",

However, the Italian authorities were unwilling to assist the applicants without the backing of a formal letter of request from a competent authority. The applicants therefore applied to the Court of Appeal for a letter requesting the Italian authorities to give their solicitor access to the criminal proceedings there. On 10 June 1996 a different constitution of the Court of Appeal ruled that in principle it had jurisdiction to issue such a letter of request. On 19 July 1996, however, the originally constituted court decided that the applicants\u2019 proposed request to the Italian authorities was too wide-ranging and, even if more restrictively drawn, unlikely to elicit information which would be either admissible or of assistance in the appeal. It therefore decided that it was not in the public interest to issue a letter of request, and adjourned the case until after the conclusion of Mr Steiner\u2019s trial in Italy in the Autumn of 1996. In the event, however, Mr Steiner was released on bail and his whereabouts were unknown at the time of the applicants\u2019 appeal hearing in February 1997.",

That is not only because it is largely hearsay and unspecific as to events and dates, but simply because much of it is wholly irrelevant to the central issue in this case, namely whether British Customs and Excise officers conspired with Steiner to \u2018frame\u2019 the Atlans.\t\n\tHowever, in considering all the information put before us, we have not been able to avoid taking a view of its effect if, and to the extent that it were admissible and credible, on the outcome of this appeal, that is, whether ... it \u2018[might] afford any ground for allowing the appeal\u2019. We have tested that by assuming for the purpose:\t\t(1) that Steiner ... was charged in Italy, with others, on a charge of smuggling a large quantity of cocaine from South America to Italy in February 1995;\t\n\t(2) that his role in the importation of the drug to Italy is said to have been as a participating informer to the Italian police;\t\n\t(3) that since at least 1980 he had been concerned in the smuggling of large quantities of cocaine from Brazil to Europe;\t\n\t(4) that for many years before the November 1990 importation of cocaine he had been an informer to various law enforcement agencies in Europe, though there is nothing to suggest that he had any contact with the United Kingdom Customs and Excise before that importation;\t\n\t(5) that at the time of the November 1990 importation he had access to large quantities of cocaine in Brazil at little or no cost;\t\n\t(6) that he had provided information to a European law enforcement agency which led to the United Kingdom Customs and Excise observations of the Atlans before the November 1990 importation; and\t\n\t(7) that, as alleged by Armand at the trial, Steiner may have had a grudge against him arising out of some previous dealing between them. ...\t\n\t[Prosecuting counsel] suggested that the only way Steiner could have been sure of achieving such an end would have been to persuade the officers to \u2018plant\u2019 the drug on, or falsely attribute it to, Thierry or Terrasson. Such a conspiracy between Steiner and the officers would have been hard for them to organise to an assured outcome. ... [H]ow could they have organised it so that Terrasson had a suitcase almost identical to that of Smolny? And what possible motive or reason could the officers have had to lend themselves to such a disgraceful enterprise whether Steiner was a known informer or not?\t\n\tIn the Court\u2019s view, there is force and hard logic in those submissions. There are also a number of other questions indicating the impossibility of the Atlans\u2019 defence. Why, if they thought they were to collect diamonds from Steiner, not drugs, did Thierry and Terrasson immediately check their luggage onto the return flight without apparently enquiring by telephone why he had not turned up or whether he had been delayed? Why did Smolny and the two of them make no contact in Copenhagen and ignore each other on the plane to Heathrow? Why did Thierry and Terrasson separate as Terrasson boarded a taxi at Heathrow with the case containing the cocaine? Why did the Atlans tell so many lies on arrest and in interview about their activities together before the flight to Copenhagen and about the reason for it? Why did Thierry lyingly state that he had travelled on his own on the return flight to Copenhagen and that he did not know Terrasson? Why did they later give wholly different accounts in evidence at their trial? Why did Smolny make indirect telephone contact with someone on Armand\u2019s telephone number in Brazil on the day of the importation?\t\n\tIn the Court\u2019s view, none of its assumptions, some of which go well beyond the new information relied upon by the Atlans, detracts in any way from the overwhelming strength of the prosecution case identified in those various questions or provides any material support for the possibility of a conspiracy between the Customs and Excise officers and Steiner or anyone else to \u2018frame\u2019 the Atlans. The jury, by its verdict, clearly rejected Thierry and Terrasson\u2019s suggestion of it. Although Armand did not then suggest such a conspiracy, it was his only possible line of defence, though, for the reasons we have given, a wholly unrealistic one. \t\n\t[Prosecuting counsel\u2019s] submission, which echoes considerations voiced by the judge to the jury in the summing up, provides a logical and complete answer to the complaint based on Steiner\u2019s alleged role as an informer and drug smuggler. If the jury had had before it information matching our assumptions, it might have led them to conclude that Steiner may have provided some information, direct or indirect, to the United Kingdom Customs and Excise, but it could not have left them with any doubt as to the Atlans\u2019 knowing and deliberate involvement in the importation of cocaine into the United Kingdom. The evidence against them, which had been thoroughly and robustly tested at the trial, was overwhelming: the Customs and Excise officers\u2019 observation of their various and highly expensive international air flights, for which there was no plausible explanation or documentation suggesting any legitimate business; the officers\u2019 observation of their movements and meetings in London and of the two strange return trips to and from Copenhagen; their various handling of what was to become Terrasson\u2019s suitcase used for the switch; their lies on arrest and in interview. All that activity pointed only to their involvement in the high value and high risk activity of drug smuggling, not some black market dealing in gems under Brazilian law. Whatever Steiner\u2019s possible role as an informer, the Atlans\u2019 guilty participation in cocaine smuggling is clear. ...\u201d",

This followed from the fact that the Court of Appeal expressly linked the resolution of the disclosure and fresh evidence issues, and then decided that there was nothing in the fresh evidence which rendered the convictions unsafe. Secondly, the applicants only produced the Mato Grosso Report after the trial. To the extent that the disclosure issues were raised by the report, therefore, it would not have been possible for the trial judge to deal with them. Thirdly, the Court of Appeal held over the disclosure question pending submissions on and a resolution of the application to enter fresh evidence. The court therefore had a full understanding of the issues based on submissions from both prosecution and defence counsel. Finally, it was to be noted that the Court of Appeal considered the issues before it on the basis of a series of assumptions which were favourable to the defence.",
