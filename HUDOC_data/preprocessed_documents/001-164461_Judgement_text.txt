The case originated in an application (no. 5136/10) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Mr Manfred Naderhirn (“the applicant”), on 13 January 2010.
The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs.
On 6 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Leonding.
On 10 July 2001 the applicant applied to the Regional Governor (Landeshauptmann) of Upper Austria (Oberösterreich) for the granting of a licence to run a pharmacy in Leonding. On 25 September 2002 the Governor dismissed the application.
On 14 June 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Federal Minister for Health and Women (Bundesministerin für Gesundheit und Frauen, “the Minister”). On 14 June 2004 he filed a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) against the Minister’s failure to give a decision (Säumnisbeschwerde). On 30 September 2004 the Administrative Court set a time-limit of 31 March 2005 for the Minister to make a decision.
On 24 March 2005 the Minister dismissed the applicant’s appeal.
On 11 May 2005 the applicant filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) against that decision. On 12 October 2005 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the complaint and, upon the applicant’s request, referred the case to the Administrative Court.
Already on 22 April 2005 the applicant lodged a request for reopening of the proceedings with the Minister, who allowed the request on 10 May 2005.
Thereupon, a number of owners of other pharmacies in the area, who had been parties to the administrative proceedings, lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court challenging the Minister’s decision. While the complaints against the Minister’s decision of 24 March 2005 and concerning the re-opening decision of 10 May 2005 were still pending before the Administrative Court, the Minister granted the applicant a licence to run a pharmacy on 5 December 2005.
The applicant challenged parts of the Minister’s decision before the Constitutional Court, which dismissed his complaint on 27 February 2007. A request to transfer his complaint to the Administrative Court was dismissed.
On 16 July 2009 the Administrative Court, dealing with the complaints of the first and the second sets of proceedings at the same time, decided that neither of the Minister’s decisions of 24 March and 10 May 2005 had been lawful, and quashed them. As a consequence, the Administrative Court also had to quash the Minister’s decision of 5 December 2005. The proceedings were thus referred back to the Minister.
On 19 March 2010 the Minister granted the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the Regional Governor of Upper Austria of 25 September 2002. The applicant was granted a licence to establish and run a new public pharmacy in Leonding.
The complaint against that decision raised by the owners of an existing pharmacy was dismissed by the Administrative Court on 28 May 2013 and the applicant was awarded compensation for costs in the amount of 1,106.40 euros (EUR).
