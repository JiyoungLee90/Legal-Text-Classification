Milinchuk, former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights and subsequently by Mr\u00a0G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. In his original application form the applicant alleged that his pre-trial detention from 30 August to 16\u00a0September 2002 had been unjustified, that his detention on remand had been too long and that the conditions of his detention between 30 August and 16 September 2002 had been appalling. As regards the trial, he complained about the decision to conduct the court hearing in his case in camera, the late service of formal charges against him and that the criminal proceedings against him had been unfair. On 25 April 2004 the applicant further complained that the domestic authorities had not informed him or his counsel of appeal proceedings in respect of extension of his pre-trial detention, and had not ensured his presence or the presence of his counsel at those proceedings. He also alleged that the appeal examination of his complaints against certain detention orders had taken too long. On 25 April 2005 the applicant complained that his detention from 7 to 11 October 2004 had been unlawful and on 25 August 2005 he also complained about the conditions of his transportation between 31 August 2002 and 11 October 2004. Lastly, on 20 December 2008 the applicant submitted a complaint about the lack of any time-limits for his detention in April 2004.",

Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80 and 81, 26\u00a0July 2001). This is particularly true in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, \u00a7 180, ECHR 2005X (extracts)).",

Poland, no. , \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4 May 2006, and Ku\u010dera v. Slovakia, no. , \u00a7 95, ECHR 2007 (extracts)). The Court cannot agree, however, that the nature of those activities could form the basis of detention orders at an advanced stage of the proceedings. Nor was the Court provided with any evidence which would support the Government\u2019s own submission on that point. Thus, the above circumstances alone could not constitute a sufficient basis for holding the applicant for such a long period of time.",

However, after the evidence has been collected that ground becomes less justified. In particular, as regards the risk of pressure being put on witnesses, the Court reiterates that it is for the domestic courts to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist during the entire period of the applicant\u2019s detention. It does not suffice merely to refer to an abstract risk unsupported by any evidence. The courts should have analysed other pertinent factors, such as the advancement of the investigation or judicial proceedings, the applicant\u2019s character, his behaviour before and after arrest, and any other specific justifications for a fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by carrying out acts aimed at the falsification or destruction of evidence or the manipulation of witnesses (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 36, Series A no. 254A).",

The Court observes that the fact that the domestic authorities failed to provide any clarification as to which of those acts the applicant was likely to commit amounted to an interference with justice. When reasoning that he should be detained pending trial to minimise that risk, the courts did not refer to any specific matters which had allowed them to draw such an inference (see paragraphs 24, 30, 37 and 31 above). The Government also failed to point out any examples of the applicant\u2019s attempting to impede the administration of justice. In any event, it appears that the domestic authorities had sufficient time to take statements from witnesses in a manner which could have excluded any doubt as to their veracity and which would have eliminated the necessity to continue the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty on that ground. The Court therefore considers that the national authorities were not entitled to regard the circumstances of the case as justification for using the risk of obstructing justice as a ground for the applicant\u2019s detention (for similar reasoning see Solovyev v. Russia, no.\u00a0, \u00a7 115, 24 May 2007, and Gorovoy v. Russia, no. 54655/07, \u00a7\u00a066, 27 June 2013).",

There is no indication in the materials before the Court of anything which could have provided grounds to believe that a real risk of absconding existed.

In the court orders of 26 November and 24 December 2002 the District Court noted that the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention was warranted by the need to verify an alibi of his co-accused (see paragraphs\u00a013 and 14 above).

The administration of justice, including trials, derives its legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Gautrin and Others v.

The Court also observed that the danger which a defendant may present to other parties to proceedings cannot be gauged solely on the basis of the seriousness of the charges and severity of the sentence faced. It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors which may confirm the existence of a danger justifying the denial of public access to a trial (see Raks v. Russia, no. 20702/04, \u00a7 49, 11 October 2011, and Nevskaya v.\u00a0Russia, no. 24273/04, \u00a7 41, 11 October 2011).

Germany [GC], no. , \u00a7 94, ECHR 2006IX). The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole were fair.

The domestic courts are, in principle, better placed to judge the reliability of witnesses and the accuracy of investigation reports, as well as their formal compliance with domestic law. In these circumstances, the Court sees no reason to challenge the domestic courts\u2019 decisions to admit witness statements in evidence.
