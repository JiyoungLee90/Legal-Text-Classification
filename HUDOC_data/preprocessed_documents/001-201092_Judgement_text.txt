The case concerns a ban on family visits following the applicant’s conviction at first instance and the impossibility to obtain a judicial review of the ban.
The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in St Petersburg. He was represented before the Court by Mr E. Mezak, a human-rights defender from Syktyvkar, who was granted leave to represent the applicant in accordance with Rule 36 of the Rules of Court.
The Government were represented by Mr M. Galperin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 30 November 2016 the Oktyabrskiy District Court in St Petersburg convicted the applicant for conspiracy to commit fraud and sentenced him to one and a half years’ imprisonment. On the same day the applicant was taken into custody and placed in the SIZO-1 remand prison.
On 19 December 2016 the applicant asked the trial judge K. to authorise short-term visits from his wife and children and phone communications with them. He pointed out that his nine-year-old daughter suffered greatly from the separation from her father and convinced herself that he had died.
Judge K. refused the applicant’s request by a letter of 28 December 2016 which was delivered to the remand prison on 10 January 2017 and handed over to the applicant on 14 March 2017. The letter quoted the text of section 18 of the Defendants’ Detention Act and continued as follows:
“Since [the applicant’s wife] is a witness in criminal case no. [XXX] and [since] the judgment of 30 November 2016 has not yet become final, whereas the Defendants’ Detention Act makes no provision for prison visits by minors, there are no grounds for authorising visits by [the applicant’s wife and children].”
The letter was not a procedural act, and the applicant could not file an appeal against it.
On 26 June 2017 the applicant’s conviction became final. On 11 September 2017 he was transferred to a prison hospital.
Section 18 of the Defendants’ Detention Act (Federal Law no. 103FZ of 15 July 1995) provides as follows:
“Subject to written authorisation from the official or authority in charge of the criminal case, suspects and defendants may have no more than two visits per month from their family members and other persons ...”
The Constitutional Court held that the refusal of an application for a prison visit should take the form of a reasoned decision (мотивированное постановление). It could be challenged before a supervising prosecutor or a court of general jurisdiction which would be called upon to verify, in the light of factual circumstances of the case, whether or not the refusal was justified (see decisions no. 176-O of 13 June 2002, no. 351-O of 16 October 2003, and no. 807-O-O of 17 June 2010).
