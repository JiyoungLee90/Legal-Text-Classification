This entailed firstly that the judgment must make a clear distinction between the acquittal on the criminal charge and the decision on compensation. It ought to be made clear that the subject-matter for the two issues, respectively criminal and civil liability, are different and that the award of compensation did not weaken the acquittal. In this case, the High Court had failed to create the necessary distance between the two issues, since the reasoning in the judgment went on immediately thereafter to deal with the subject of compensation. Moreover, no express reservation had been stated with regard to the acquittal.",

This came so close to establishing that the conditions for criminal sexual assault had been fulfilled that the presumption of innocence must be deemed to have been violated.

This judgment was rendered after the guiding judgments by the European Court of 11 February 2003 in Y. v. Norway [cited above] and Ringvold v. Norway [no. 34964/97, ECHR 2003II]. Reference is made to the thorough discussion of the decisions \u2013 and past case-law of the  \u2013 contained therein. Therein it is stated that Article 6 \u00a7 2 protects any person suspected of a criminal offence against any affirmations being made in court decisions on other statements by public authorities that he is guilty of a criminal offence, without his having been convicted in a criminal case.",

However, where a person who has been acquitted of a criminal charge is ordered to pay compensation, it is a requirement that the grounds on which the compensation order is based must not be formulated in such a way as to cast doubts over the correctness of the acquittal. Moreover, provided that the compensation order is not formulated in this way, Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention [...] does not constitute an obstacle to the person acquitted of the criminal charge being ordered to pay compensation in the same case for the act to which the indictment related.",

The possibility to review the claim for compensation in the criminal case has clear advantages from the point of view of procedural economy and saves the victim from the financial and emotional burden of undergoing two trials. The evidentiary requirements in civil actions are less stringent than those that apply in criminal cases. An unavoidable consequence of this is that a person who has been acquitted of a criminal charge may be ordered to pay compensation in the same case, based on the finding that he committed the act in respect of which s/he had been acquitted. In order to enable this without creating doubts about the acquittal, strict requirements should apply to the reasoning contained in the judgment awarding compensation.",

In our case the basis for compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage is sections 3-3 and 3-5(1)(b)of the Damage Compensation Act 1969. It is a condition in both of these provisions that the tortfeasor has inflicted on the victim a violation of the type provided for in Article 192 of the Criminal Code. The court must therefore make it clear that it has found proven a fact which from an objective point of view constitutes a breach of this provision. The subjective conditions for liability also coincide to some extent, namely that compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage requires intent or gross negligence and that Article 192 (4) of the Criminal Code also makes sexual assault by gross negligence a criminal offence.",

The finding that, in objective terms, a breach of Article 192 has occurred cannot be avoided. The same applies to the subjective conditions for compensation. What must be avoided is casting doubt over the correctness of the acquittal, in view of the strict evidentiary requirements that apply in criminal cases.",

This cannot in my view be regarded as an attack on the acquittal. Nor does it go any further than what is necessary in order to establish that the conditions for compensation are present. The same applies when the majority of the High Court states that on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that [the applicant] realised that [Ms C.] did not want sexual intercourse with him and that \u2018[the applicant] by the use of violence has gained sexual intercourse with [Ms C.].\u2019",

Furthermore, as I have already noted, I do not find that expressions of a typically criminal- law character were used. Factors of this nature were found to be decisive when the Supreme Court ruled on 27 November 2003 that the presumption of innocence had been violated in that case, see paragraphs 36 and 38 of the decision. In our case, I am accordingly of the view that the High Court marked the necessary distance to the criminal case and that it did not cast doubt on the acquittal in other ways.",

The test is normally the balance of probabilities and the burden of proof lies with the claimant. However, in a landmark ruling of 1996 concerning civil liability for forced sexual intercourse (Norsk Retstidende 1996, p. 864, at p. 876; Ringvold v. , no.\u00a034964/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a016-19, ECHR 2003II) the Norwegian Supreme Court held that the requirement as to the strength of the evidence had to be stricter than that which applied to the test of the balance of probabilities, bearing in mind the burden which an allegation of reprehensible conduct might have for the defendant and the serious consequences it might have for his or her reputation. In a case of the kind under consideration, the test had to be whether on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that the alleged abuse had been committed (\u201cklar sannsynlighetsovervekt\u201d). This burden was heavier where liability may have serious consequences for the respondent\u2019s reputation, though it was less than for criminal liability.",

It may serve the interests of economy of procedure and also psychological stress may be saved by treating criminal charges and compensation claims in joint proceedings. In comparison with civil proceedings, such joint proceedings were cheap both for the accused and for the victim who would be able to benefit from free legal aid for the handling of the civil claims. If the compensation proceedings had to await a final outcome in the criminal case (at three levels of jurisdiction), it could take years before they could start. For the victim, and also for the acquitted, this could involve a considerable extra psychological burden. Moreover, in joint proceedings, the demands for thoroughness that were inherent in the criminal process would contribute to increasing the quality of the examination of the civil claim. Furthermore, the exonerating effect of an acquittal was not likely to be greater in split proceedings than in joint ones. On the contrary, in view of the problems related to examining the criminal evidence twice, the effect would tend to be more consistent under the latter. Finally, in criminal cases giving rise to more than one civil claim, deciding them all at the same time in connection with the criminal process would ensure a greater degree of \u201cprocedural equality\u201d and coherence (ibidem, Chapter 6, sub-chapter 6.3.1 and 6.3.2).",

This again could give a person who was acquitted of a criminal offence but would be considered liable according to the civil burden of proof the undue advantage of avoiding any responsibility for his or her actions.

In this respect, reference is also made to the arguments that might be adduced in favour of maintaining such an arrangement of joint proceedings in Norwegian law (see paragraph 27 of the judgment).

The case of Y. v. Norway (cited above) concerned a finding, on the matter of compensation, that it was clearly probable that the applicant \u201ccommitted the offences\u201d. Not surprisingly the Court found a violation. But not so in the other two cases even though in Reeves v. Norway (cited above) the impugned decision contained a finding directly connected with the indictment. The question being whether the fire of a house had been started deliberately or whether it was a mere accident, it was stated in the decision regarding civil liability that the defendant was \u201cguilty of setting the fire as described in the indictment\u201d when the defendant had already been acquitted on a criminal charge of arson. And yet the Court held that those words, read in context, left no doubt that they were meant to refer only to the question of compensation. In contrast, the decision complained of in the present case does not seem to me to contain anything that might, even remotely, hint at criminal responsibility.",

That sounds of course familiar. It was what the Commission decisions had said in the cases I have already cited. The Supreme Court stressed in this regard the need for care, so that a judgment on civil liability should not in any way cast doubt on the acquittal. It concluded that:",

I regard its judgment as clearly right. I also can see no fault, either in substance or in form, in the way that the High Court had dealt with the matter. It is not without significance that the majority judgment in the present case does not contain details of any particular fault. It takes exception to the use by the High Court of the word \u2018violence\u2019 but it does not amplify on that in order to explain its view. In fact the High Court appears to have been alive to the risk of misunderstanding and so it circumscribed the use of the word by explaining that what it meant was that the applicant had forced the complainant to have sexual intercourse by holding her arms. I am quite unable to understand how that can be interpreted as signifying or imputing criminal liability. I do not know how the violence used could be described in milder terms even if it were necessary to avoid calling things by their proper names. The final general statement of the majority, in its judgment, that it is not convinced that \u201cthe impugned reasoning did not \u2018set aside\u2019 the applicant\u2019s acquittal or \u2018cast doubt on the correctness of the acquittal\u2019\u201d remains, as I read it, totally unexplained.",
