The Court concludes from the documents at its disposal that those costs claimed by the applicant company which were aimed at preventing or putting right the violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement have already been reimbursed by the authorities. The remainder of the costs were not related to the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Therefore, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses concerning the domestic proceedings. As the applicant company made no claim for the costs incurred in the Convention proceedings, no award is made under this head either.",
