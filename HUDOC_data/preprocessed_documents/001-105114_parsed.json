First, the right at stake in both the main and the injunction proceedings should be \u201ccivil\u201d within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 of the Convention. Second, the nature of the interim measure, its object and purpose as well as its effects on the right in question should be scrutinised. Whenever an interim measure could be considered effectively to determine the civil right or obligation at stake, notwithstanding the length of time it is in force, Article 6 was applicable. However, the Court accepted that in exceptional cases - where, for example, the effectiveness of the measure sought depended upon a rapid decision-making process - it might not be possible immediately to comply with all of the requirements of Article 6 (see Micallef, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 84-86).",
