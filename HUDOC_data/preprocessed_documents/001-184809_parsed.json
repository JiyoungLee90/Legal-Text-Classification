A public notary\u2019s office did not comply with the aforementioned criteria because it was a place for a professional activity, open to the public during working hours and designed for a public activity. Moreover, the relevant domestic legislation concerning public notaries did not impose on interested individuals special rules in respect of entering a public notary\u2019s office.

Bulgaria, no.\u00a034529/10, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0221-222, ECHR 2013). Whether the respective conditions were met in the instant case, seems questionable. However, even assuming that this was the case, the Court is concerned that the provisions of the former Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time did not provide for access to a specific judicial remedy aimed at providing an ex post facto challenge to acts and measures carried out by police officers (ibid, \u00a7\u00a7 221-222) in respect of natural or legal persons finding themselves in a position similar to that of the applicant organisation, that is to say persons who were not actual parties to criminal investigation proceedings from which arose a need for the collection of evidence. This is particularly striking given that even in the event of an objection against the acts and measures taken by the police officers and an order issued by the prosecutor, it does not appear that under the provisions of the former Code of Criminal Procedure the applicant organisation would have been able to challenge the aforementioned prosecutor\u2019s order before the domestic courts. In these circumstances, the availability of such an ex post factum judicial review in order to counterbalance the absence of a prior judicial warrant, becomes especially important.",
