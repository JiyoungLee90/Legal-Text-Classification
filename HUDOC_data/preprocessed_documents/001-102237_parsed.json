On arrival at a detention facility all detainees must be subjected to preliminary medical examination before they are placed in cells shared by other inmates. The examination is performed with the aim of identifying individuals suffering from contagious diseases or in need of urgent medical assistance. Particular attention must be paid to individuals suffering from contagious conditions. No later than three days after the detainee's arrival at the detention facility, he should receive an in-depth medical examination, including fluorography. During the in-depth examination a doctor should record the detainee's complaints, study his medical and personal history, record injuries if present, and recent tattoos, and schedule additional medical procedures if necessary.

(a medical unit had been created, medicines purchased and maintenance work carried out). A prosecutor also had competence to open criminal proceedings against those responsible and his refusal to open such proceedings could be challenged before a court. In the alternative, it was open to the applicant to bring a court action in tort. To prove the effectiveness of that remedy, they cited the case of Shilbergs v. Russia (no. 20075/03, 17 December 2009), where the domestic courts had awarded adequate compensation to a detainee held in inhuman conditions. They also submitted copies of two judgments awarding Mr D. and Mr R. compensation for non-pecuniary damage.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective (see, among many other authorities, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0157, ECHR 2000-XI). Further, having regard to the \u201cclose affinity\u201d between Article\u00a013 and Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Mifsud v.

[GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002-VIII, and Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 152), the notion of \u201ceffective\u201d remedy has the same meaning in both provisions (see, mutatis mutandis, Davenport v.

Although they referred to several prosecutor's decisions and two court judgments concerning Mr S. and Mr M. which had allegedly provided redress for inadequate conditions of detention, they did not produce copies of those decisions and judgments. In the absence of documents supporting the Government's assertion, the Court is unable to identify the relevance of the impugned decisions and judgments to the issue of the effectiveness of a complaint to the prosecutor or a court action for damages as a remedy in the circumstances of the present case. As regards two court judgments copies of which were submitted by the Government, one of them, in respect of Mr R., did not concern detention in overcrowded cells but rather incompetent medical assistance resulting in blindness. The other judgment, by which an award was made in favour of Mr D., does not suffice, in the Court's view, to show the existence of settled domestic practice that would prove the effectiveness of the remedy (see, for a similar approach, Horvat v. , no. 51585/99, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2001VIII). Lastly, the Court takes note of the Government's reliance on the case of Shilbergs v. Russia which, in their view, provided an example of adequate compensation awarded by domestic courts to a detainee held in inhuman conditions. The Court, however, observes that it found that, taking into account that the amount of the award was substantially reduced by the domestic courts on account of the State's financial difficulties, the redress afforded to the applicant was insufficient and manifestly unreasonable in the light of its case-law (see Shilbergs, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-91). It follows that the Government did not point to any effective domestic remedy by which the applicant could have obtained appropriate redress for the allegedly inhuman and degrading conditions of his detention.",

IZ-71/1 in . In particular, they disagreed about the cell measurements and the number of inmates in the cells. The Court observes that the Government confined their supporting evidence to numerous certificates from the remand centre management issued on 23 October 2009, that is, long after the applicant had left the remand centre. They have not submitted any source materials on the basis of which the assertions contained in those certificates could be verified. The Court would reiterate that on several previous occasions it has declined to accept the validity of similar certificates on the ground that they could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable given the lapse of time involved and the absence of any supporting documentary evidence (see Kokoshkina v. , no. 2052/08, \u00a7 60, 28\u00a0May 2009; Sudarkov v.

By contrast, the applicant, who described the conditions of his detention in great detail, submitted written affidavits by his former cell-mates confirming his account. The Court is therefore inclined to give more credit to the applicant's description of the conditions of detention. However, there is no need for the Court to decide the disagreement between the parties and establish the truthfulness of each and every allegation, because it finds a violation of Article 3 on the basis of the facts that have been presented by the respondent Government, for the following reasons.",

Although in cell no. 17 his personal space was on some occasions as much as 3.5 sq. m, in cells nos. 76 and 17 it was at times reduced to less than 2 sq. m. The Court reiterates in this connection that in previous cases where the applicants disposed of less than 3 sq. m of personal space, it found that the overcrowding was so severe as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. Accordingly, it was not necessary to assess other aspects of the physical conditions of detention (see, for example, Lind v. Russia, no.\u00a025664/05, \u00a7 59, 6 December 2007; Kantyrev v.

That the applicant was obliged to live, sleep and use the toilet in the same cell with so many other inmates was itself sufficient to cause distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention, and arouse in him feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing him.",

The main dispute between the parties concerns whether antiretroviral therapy for HIV and antiviral therapy for hepatitis C should have been administered to the applicant while in detention. However, it is not the Court's task to rule on matters lying exclusively within medical specialists' field of expertise and establish whether the applicant in fact required such treatment. Instead, in order to determine whether Article 3 of the Convention has been complied with, the Court will focus on determining whether the domestic authorities provided the applicant with sufficient medical supervision capable of effectively assessing his condition and setting up an adequate course of treatment for his diseases. It considers that, given the nature and seriousness of the applicant's ailments, his condition required regular and specialised medical supervision for monitoring of the progression rate of his hepatitis C and HIV diseases, timely prescription of the requisite HIV and hepatitis C therapies and timely diagnosis and treatment of possible opportunistic infections (see, mutatis mutandis, Kats and Others v. Ukraine, no.\u00a029971/04, \u00a7 105, 18 December 2008, and Popov, cited above, \u00a7 211).",

In accordance with the Regulation, an HIV-positive detainee in clinical stage 3 of the disease must be examined by a doctor every twenty-four or twelve weeks, depending on his CD4 count. The Order provides that a person suffering from HIV must be regularly subjected to blood and urine tests, including a CD4 count test four times a year, as well as to other examinations, such as an abdominal ultrasound scan, electrocardiography and chest photofluorography. The importance of CD4 testing at least every six months to determine whether the affected person has become eligible for antiretroviral therapy has also been stressed by the World Health Organisation (see paragraph 77 above). Most important of all, recommendations for regular laboratory tests and regular consultations by specialist doctors were made during the applicant's examination by a doctor from an HIV-infection medical unit and in the treatment schedules prepared at the end of each year (see paragraphs 30, 44, 58 and 67 above). Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that the minimum scope of medical supervision required for the applicant's condition included examinations by a general physician, an infectious disease specialist and a tuberculosis specialist twice a year and laboratory examinations consisting of blood and urine tests, chest photofluorography and an abdominal ultrasound scan at least twice a year. The Court will now examine whether this scope of medical supervision was available to the applicant.",

While the applicant was repeatedly subjected to blood and urine tests and other laboratory examinations, his medical records reveal that these measures were insufficiently prompt, coherent and regular. Indeed, on many occasions the examination schedule was not adhered to and the tests were performed with notable delays. Thus, no general blood or urine tests were performed between April 2007 and January 2008 and between November 2008 and October 2009. CD4 count tests were even more irregular. The applicant was not subjected to CD4 count tests from February 2008 to November 2009, that is for about a year and nine months. The Court also notes with concern the irregularity of other laboratory examinations, such as chest photofluorography and abdominal ultrasound scans. During the four years the applicant has spent in detention the ultrasound scan was performed only three times, in February 2008, November 2009 and January 2010. As to the chest photofluorography, it was initially performed every six months in accordance with the examination schedule, but that laudable practice was subsequently abandoned and no chest photofluorography was made for two years and four months, from March 2007 to January 2010. Given that the above tests and examinations were essential for effective monitoring of the applicant's condition, timely diagnosis of possible opportunistic infections and identification of the point at which he became eligible for antiretroviral therapy for HIV, it is regrettable that they were performed haphazardly.",

Except for several consultations by a dentist, ophthalmologist, otolaryngologist, dermatologist, neuropathologist, surgeon and psychiatrist, none of whom had expertise in the treatment of HIV disease and hepatitis C, the applicant's condition was monitored by a physician assistant who apparently took all decisions concerning the applicant's diagnosis and treatment. The applicant was never examined by an infectious disease specialist or a tuberculosis specialist, although biannual consultations by these specialist doctors were repeatedly recommended to him. Having regard to the vulnerability of HIV-positive persons to other serious diseases, the Court finds the lack of expert medical attention to the applicant's condition unacceptable (see, for similar reasoning, Kats and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0107).",

It was for such a doctor to examine the applicant physically and to assess whether any additional laboratory examinations were necessary for the correct diagnosis of his condition and whether antiviral treatment was required in his situation. The Court is therefore not convinced by the Government's argument that the applicant did not require antiviral treatment for hepatitis C, because the materials in its possession do not allow it to establish with clarity which doctor made such a decision and on what date (see, for a similar reasoning, Mechenkov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 35421/05, \u00a7 108, 7 February 2008).",
