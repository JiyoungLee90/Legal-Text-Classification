Greece, no. 8415/02, \u00a7\u00a019, 27 May 2004). Where a judgment is against the State, the defendant State authority must be duly noti\ufb01ed thereof and is thus well placed to take all necessary initiatives to comply with it or to transmit it to another competent State authority responsible for compliance (see Akashev v.\u00a0Russia, no. 30616/05, \u00a7 21, 12\u00a0June 2008). The complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure or of the State budgetary system cannot relieve the State of its obligation under the Convention to guarantee to everyone the right to have a binding and enforceable judicial decision enforced within a reasonable time (Burdov (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a070).",

Russia, nos. 2701/04 et al., \u00a7\u00a011, 15\u00a0January 2009). It further observes that the applicant enabled the enforcement of the judgment debt by submitting the writ of enforcement to two State bodies and cannot be blamed for the State\u2019s subsequent failure to act. Indeed, once the authorities were in possession of the writ of enforcement, it was open to them to adopt a more practical approach and to forward the document to the responsible body. Consequently, despite the applicant\u2019s failure to submit the documents to the bailiff service after their return by the regional office of the Federal Treasury, the full responsibility for enforcement of the court judgment rests with the State (see, mutatis mutandis, Rozhnyatovskaya v. , no. 35002/05, \u00a7 19-20, 13 December 2011).",
