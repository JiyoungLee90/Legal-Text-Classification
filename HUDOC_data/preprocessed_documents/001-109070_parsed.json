Banco di Napoli, the domestic court upheld the claimants\u2019 arguments, holding that they had a right to remain under the system of perequazione aziendale even following the entry into force of Law no. 503/92. The same was confirmed in a number of other judgments in various jurisdictions, including the Court of Cassation (for example, judgments nos. 1388/00 and 12912/00) and more specifically the Court of Cassation in its ultimate formation, namely, sitting as a full court (Sezione Unite). The latter in its judgment (no. 9024/01) of 3\u00a0July 2001 upheld the claimants\u2019 argument on the basis of the interpretation of Law no. 503/92 and Laws nos. 497 and 449 of 1996 and 1997 respectively, which explicitly made reference to perequazione aziendale, confirming that it had not been abrogated by the 1992 laws. The impugned amendments applied solely to persons still employed and not to persons who had retired on or before 31 December 1990. In consequence, the contested right was legitimately due to the former Banco di Napoli employees who had retired by 31 December 1990, for the period between 1\u00a0January 1994 (date when a general suspension of pension adjustments ceased) to 26 July 1996 (date when a new suspension of such adjustments started in respect of the Banco di Napoli).",

Indeed, the interpretative nature of the norm was evident since it had confirmed one of the possible meanings of the original 1992 text, which had also been upheld in some jurisprudence. The impugned law had been reasonable because it aimed to achieve recognition of an equal and homogenous treatment of all pensioners under the current integrative regimes. Moreover, this law had not augmented contentious proceedings since it had rendered their outcome foreseeable. As to the other inconveniences mentioned by the Court of Cassation, it considered that these arose from a random number of circumstances and was not sufficient to consider the norm unconstitutional. It further considered that the legislator could enact interpretative laws, once they were based on one of the possible meanings of the original text even if there had been consistent jurisprudence about the matter, and this did not affect the role of the Court of Cassation.",

According to the applicants, its sole purpose was to thwart the consolidated interpretative orientation which had been adopted by the domestic courts (including the highest court \u2013 the Court of Cassation in its ultimate formation, sitting as a full court), namely that the relevant provisions of the 1992 law did not apply to persons who had retired by 13 December 1990. Following the enactment of Law no.\u00a0243/04 the domestic courts were bound to find against the applicants. Thus, the State had influenced the result of proceedings, defining their merit and rendering further hearings useless, violating the independence of the judiciary and interfering in the administration of justice. Indeed, the introduction of the 1997 law only confirmed that the 1992 law had not abolished harmonisation regarding long-standing pensioners. Otherwise there would have been no need to enact such law. Neither would there have been need to intervene again in 2004. The State had felt the need to introduce the 2004 legislation only because the courts had adopted a unanimous orientation in favour of the applicants and persons in their position.

Thus, the general public had not benefited in any way, it was solely the two private banks which had benefited since they were able to recover or save the sums which the domestic judges had deemed to be due to pensioners such as the applicants. Moreover, this law only affected pensioners from the two mentioned banks and thus was consciously directed to affect these specific disputes. It therefore had nothing to do with a general pension reform, namely the harmonisation following Law no. 449/97, and in fact the applicants were not contesting the effects of that law.",

While it was true that the Court of Cassation had reversed this decision on appeal, this had been done upon consideration that the laws that had allowed perequazione aziendale had been changed in 1992 by means of laws that aimed to limit public expenditure and to eliminate once and for all this type of perequazione in order to rationalise the novel social security system following the privatisation of banking entities. Moreover, it had been necessary to align national jurisprudence on the matter which had been conflicting. In particular, the State felt bound to satisfy the aim of having a homogenous pension system.",

Indeed, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, even assuming that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees benefits to persons who have contributed to a social insurance system, it cannot be interpreted as entitling that person to a pension of a particular amount (Kjartan \u00c1smundsson v.

Moreover, the Government noted that the applicants\u2019 salaries were still subject to adjustment according to the cost of living, thus safeguarding their purchasing power. They further submitted that the aim of the law was to harmonise the pension system, by treating equally all pensioners, and abolishing a distinction between those who had retired before 31 December 1990 and those who retired later.

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v.

Italy, nos. 46286/09, 52851/08, 53727/08, 54486/08 and 56001/08, \u00a7 60, 31 May 2011). It finds no reason to deem otherwise in the present case. Reiterating that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d, the Court accepts that the enactment of Law no. 243/04 pursued the public interest (harmonising the pension system by treating equally all pensioners).",

Such schemes are an expression of a society\u2019s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see, mutatis mutandis, Goudswaard-Van der Lans v. the  (dec.), no.\u00a075255/01, ECHR 2005-XI). Nevertheless, the Court notes that Law no. 243/04 did not affect the applicants\u2019 basic pension, and according to the laws in force their pension was still to be augmented over the years according to a perequazione legale. Accordingly, the applicants only lost the more favourable augmentation according to a perequazione aziendale. Thus, the Court considers that the applicants were obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction, rather than the total deprivation of their entitlements (see, conversely, Kjartan \u00c1smundsson, cited above \u00a7 45).",

Against this background, bearing in mind the State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation in regulating the pension system and the fact that the applicants endured commensurate reductions, the Court considers that the applicants were not made to bear an individual and excessive burden.",
