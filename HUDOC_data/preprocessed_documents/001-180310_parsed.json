Furthermore, although the principle of secrecy did not create any obligation on the voters\u2019 side, it nevertheless did not entitle them to abuse their situation, bearing in mind that voting secrecy could only be maintained with their cooperation.

However, the K\u00faria held that the posting of photographs of ballot papers had had no impact on either. As to the secrecy of the voting, the K\u00faria emphasised that the identity of voters could not be discovered through the anonymously uploaded photographs. It also held that although posting photographs of the ballot papers on the mobile telephone application had constituted an infringement of the principle of the proper exercise of rights, it had had no repercussion on the fair conduct of the elections.",
