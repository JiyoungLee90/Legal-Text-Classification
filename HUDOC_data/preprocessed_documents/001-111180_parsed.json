The judicial authorisation of placement in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article\u00a0108 of the CCrP and following a prosecutor\u2019s request for that person to be placed in custody (paragraph 34 of the Ruling). In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there were factual and legal grounds for the application of that preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court\u2019s authorisation (Article 466 \u00a7 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor\u2019s decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP.",

The Government also specified that the applicant\u2019s subsequent detention had been authorised by a Russian court, which verified that the essential conditions for such detention were complied with: that the alleged criminal acts were punishable under both Russian and Uzbek criminal law; that they could entail a sentence equal to or exceeding one year of imprisonment (as required by the Minsk Convention) and that the relevant limitation periods for prosecuting the relevant offences had not expired. The initial detention order had contained a time-limit, which was in compliance with the requirements of Article 466 and Chapter 13 of the Russian CCrP. The applicant\u2019s detention had been extended by a court on several occasions, within the time-limits specified in Article 109 of the CCrP.

In this connection, Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c): all that is required under sub-paragraph (f) is that \u201caction is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition\u201d.
