It is central to the concept of a fair trial, in civil as in criminal proceedings, that a litigant is not denied the opportunity to present his or her case effectively before the courts and that he or she is able to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side (see Steel and Morris v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2005II).",

Poland, no. 28249/95, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2001VI, and Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit v. Turkey, no. 52658/99, \u00a7 33, 17 July 2007). The institution of a legal aid scheme constitutes one of those means. It may therefore be acceptable to impose conditions on the grant of legal aid on the basis, inter alia, of the financial situation of the litigant or his or her prospects of success in the proceedings (see Steel and Morris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62, and Wieczorek v. Poland, no. 18176/05, \u00a7 37, 8 December 2009). The question whether the provision of legal aid is necessary for a fair hearing must be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of each case and will depend, inter alia, upon the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the proceedings, the complexity of the relevant law and procedure and the applicant\u2019s capacity to represent him or herself effectively.",

                                        "content": "29.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that the court fees that the applicant was required to pay were calculated on the basis of the value of the litigation and amounted to TRL 2,035,100,000, while the monthly minimum wage was TRL\u00a0423,000,000 at the time. It also observes that in rejecting the applicant\u2019s legal aid request, the  did not indicate a specific reason but merely referred to the relevant legislation. Accordingly, it was not established whether the legal aid request was rejected as a result of the applicant\u2019s failure to prove his poor financial situation or as his case lacked basis. The Court notes that it has already examined similar grievances in the past and has found a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the ground, inter alia, that the legal aid system in Turkey fails to offer individuals substantial guarantees to protect them from arbitrariness (see, in particular, Bakan v. Turkey, no. 50939/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07478, 12 June 2007; Mehmet and Suna Yi\u011fit, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03139; Ey\u00fcp Kaya v. Turkey, no. 17582/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-26, 23 September 2008; and Kaba v. Turkey, no. 1236/05, \u00a7\u00a7 19-25, 1 March 2011). It has also examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned cases. In this respect, it would once again note that pursuant to Article 469 of the CCP decisions regarding legal aid are binding and are delivered on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicants (Bakan, cited above, \u00a7 76). The Court further observes that the refusal of the applicant\u2019s legal aid request deprived him of the possibility of submitting his case to a tribunal.",
