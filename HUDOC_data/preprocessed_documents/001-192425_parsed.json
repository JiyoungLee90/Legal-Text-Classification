The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms does not depend on further, quantifiable unfairness flowing from a procedural inequality. It is a matter for the defence to assess whether a submission deserves a reaction. It is therefore unfair for the prosecution to make submissions to a court without the knowledge of the defence (see Zahirovi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 48; Loni\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 84, and Bulut v.

Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7 57, ECHR\u00a02002 V). To require the applicant\u2019s lawyer to take the initiative and inform himself periodically on whether any new elements have been included in the case file would amount to imposing a disproportionate burden on him and would not necessarily have guaranteed a real opportunity to comment on the opinion (ibid., and Milatov\u00e1 and Others v. the Czech Republic, no.\u00a061811/00, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005 V).",

The Court does not share this view since accepting that argument would in effect mean that the question of whether or not the defendant would be informed of the fact that observations regarding the merits of his case have been filed by the prosecution would entirely depend on the presence of the defence at the session of the appeal panel. This, in the Court\u2019s assessment, would likewise amount to imposing a disproportionate burden on the defence and would render meaningless the right of the defence to have knowledge of, and to comment on, the prosecution\u2019s submission in the appeal proceedings.",
