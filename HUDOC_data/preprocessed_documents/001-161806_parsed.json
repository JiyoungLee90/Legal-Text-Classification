The Government failed to expand on this statement and submit sufficient evidentiary basis in their further observations dated 12\u00a0January 2015. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that in 2010 and 2011 the Constitutional Court repealed as incompatible with the Constitution a number of the 2004 Property Act provisions, as amended, which empowered the Agency\u2019s director to re-examine, annul and repeal ex officio Commission decisions (see Manushaqe Puto and Others v.
