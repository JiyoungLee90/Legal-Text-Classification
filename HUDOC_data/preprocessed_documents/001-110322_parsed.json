He produced a medical opinion by Dr.\u00a0C-G.E., dated 5 February 2003, which stated that known risk factors for arteriosclerosis and heart attack were, among other factors, diabetes, smoking and high blood pressure. Recently, the feeling of severe stress, especially over a long period of time, had been shown to be an element that increased the risk of developing heart and vascular disorders as well. The interaction between various risk factors was complex but, in general, the more risk factors were present, the higher the risk of suffering a heart attack or developing vascular disorders.

The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires (Government Bill 1992/93:30, p. 20 and p. 36) state that this implies that the responsible authorities have to consider more extensively than previously whether the exposure to a harmful effect at work has been of such a degree, intensity and duration that, from this, it can be concluded that the existence of harmfulness is highly probable. Furthermore, the collected knowledge must indicate with a considerable degree of probability that a factor in the environment is harmful. The view that a certain factor is very likely to cause an injury has to be relatively generally accepted. This is the case where substantial knowledge exists, within medical or other science, that a certain factor has such harmful effects. If there is a lack of support, as when, for example, there are profound differences in expert opinions, this requirement cannot be considered fulfilled. Thus, the opinion of a specific researcher or medical doctor should not constitute sufficient basis for a positive decision on the issue of harmful effects. The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires also state that the more rigid requirement of harmfulness in many cases presupposes more careful investigations at workplaces regarding the harmful factors invoked and that the question of causes of certain diseases has to be discussed more thoroughly. This, in turn, will result in the authorities basing their decisions more extensively on different assessments of harmfulness within medical science.",

Firstly, such a hearing may be needed in order to examine a witness, expert or party or in cases where a party has difficulty expounding his or her claim in writing. Secondly, an oral hearing may be needed to clarify the positions taken by the parties in the case and perhaps eliminate unnecessary or meaningless points of dispute. In the latter case, the procedure is typically of a preparatory nature. Moreover, the oral form of procedure envisaged in the 1971 Act is not to be seen as an alternative to the written form, but rather as a complement to that form (see the Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).",

The question of whether a hearing is necessary should primarily be assessed in the light of the existing investigation of the case, but it should also be possible to accord significance to other factors, for example, if the case is very important for the party and a hearing would give him a better understanding of the import of the decision to be given in the case. One particular reason not to arrange an oral hearing could be that the case is of a trivial nature or that the costs of the hearing are high compared to the value of the object of dispute (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 537).",

The Supreme Court stated that the plaintiff\u2019s right to damages on account of a violation of Article 5 should be assessed in the first place under the Tort Liability Act and the Act on Compensation for Deprivation of Liberty and Other Coercive Measures (Lagen om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vanden och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder, 1998:714).

If \u2019s obligations under Article 5 \u00a7 5 could not be met by such an interpretation, the domestic courts should award compensation without the support of specific legal provisions. As concerned the determination of the level of compensation, the Supreme Court repeated that the Court\u2019s case-law was a natural point of departure but also noted that account must be taken of the fact that different national conditions may lead to variations from one country to another in what should be regarded as a reasonable level of compensation.",

Having found that compensation for the violation could not be awarded directly on the basis of the Tort Liability Act, the Supreme Court held that there was no reason to limit the scope of application of the principle established in the above-mentioned cases of 9 June 2005 and 21 September 2007 to violations of Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention. In view of this and with reference to, inter alia, Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law under these Articles, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs should be awarded non-pecuniary damages for the violation of Article 8. With regard to the levels of compensation, the Supreme Court concluded that they should not be too far removed from the levels which applied when awarding damages under the Tort Liability Act. Generally speaking these levels should, however, be compatible with the case-law of the Court. In the same case, Svea Court of Appeal had also concluded, in a judgment dated 12\u00a0January 2006, that there had been a violation of Article 8 and that an award for non-pecuniary damage should be made on the basis of the principle established in the case of 9 June 2005.",

Although the Government acknowledged that the legal position on this matter under domestic law had been less clear prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgments in 2005 and 2007, they submitted that following these judgments the legal position must have been considered sufficiently clear. Therefore, since the applicant lodged his application with the Court on 13 November 2008, he should have been aware of the Supreme Court judgments and that there was an effective domestic remedy available to him.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention \u2013 with which it has close affinity \u2013 that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made \u2013 at least in substance \u2013 to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Selmouni v.

In particular, the Court wishes to highlight the Supreme Court judgment of December 2009 (NJA 2009 N 70) which affirmed that it was now a general principle of law that compensation for Convention violations could be ordered without direct support in Swedish law, to the extent that Sweden has a duty to provide redress to victims of Convention violations through a right to compensation for damages. In the Court\u2019s view, this judgment shifts the Supreme Court\u2019s case-law from establishing precedent in specific matters to establishing a general principle for the domestic courts and the Chancellor of Justice to follow in cases relating to all claims for compensation for alleged violations of the Convention. This view is also supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in June 2010 in which it clarified that the State must provide an effective remedy in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention for alleged breaches of the Convention.",

In particular, it could not be said that the applicant\u2019s claim was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise lacking in foundation (see Rolf\u00a0Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 39 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV).

It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. For example, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v.\u00a0Switzerland, 24 June 1993, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 263; Salomonsson, cited above, \u00a7 38; Lundevall, cited above, \u00a7 38; D\u00f6ry, cited above, \u00a7 41; and Fexler, cited above, \u00a7 57).",
