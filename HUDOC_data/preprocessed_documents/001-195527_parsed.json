The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see Belevitskiy v.\u00a0Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7 91, 1 March 2007; Nakhmanovich v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a055669/00, \u00a7\u00a070, 2 March 2006; and Sta\u0161aitis v. Lithuania, no.\u00a047679/99, \u00a7 67, 21 March 2002).

The Court observes that the inquiry into alleged tax evasion, resulting in the criminal proceedings against Mr Magnitskiy, started in 2004, long before he complained that prosecuting officials had been involved in fraudulent acts (see paragraph 31 above). The decision to arrest him was only made after the investigating authority had learned of his application for an entry visa to the United Kingdom, and of his having booked tickets to Kyiv, and after it had been unable to find him at his place of residence (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). On the day following his arrest the first applicant was brought before a competent court, which had to decide on the preventive measure to be applied. That was enough to make his arrest compatible with the \u201cpurpose\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no.\u00a072508/13, \u00a7 188, 28\u00a0November 2017). The Court is also mindful of the fact that at the hearing on the preventive measure neither the first applicant nor his lawyer made any allegations of bad faith, or police pressure (see paragraph 39 above).",

It acknowledges that in view of the gravity of the accusations against the first applicant and the seriousness of the information submitted by the investigating authorities, the courts could justifiably have considered that an initial risk of the first applicant\u2019s absconding or witness tampering had been established. However, with the passage of time the mere availability of that information inevitably became less and less relevant, particularly when the first applicant persistently disputed his ability to abscond, alleging that there was no record of his application for a United Kingdom entry visa and referring to his poor health and family situation to confirm that there was no danger of his absconding (see, by contrast, W. v. Switzerland, 26\u00a0January 1993, \u00a7\u00a033, Series A no. 254A). The Court also does not lose sight of the fact that while authorising yet another extension of his detention the courts remained silent as to why those risks could not have been offset by any other means of ensuring his appearance at the trial (see Khayletdinov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a02763/13, \u00a7\u00a096, 12\u00a0January 2016; Zherebin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059; and Sergey Vasilyev v.

At the same time, the Court entertains doubts as to the validity of that argument to justify the first applicant\u2019s continued detention. For the domestic courts to demonstrate that a substantial risk of collusion existed and continued to exist during the entire period of the first applicant\u2019s detention, it did not suffice merely to refer to his official position. They should have analysed other pertinent factors, such as the advancement of the investigation or judicial proceedings, the first applicant\u2019s personality, his behaviour after the arrest and any other specific indications justifying the fear that he might abuse his regained liberty by carrying out acts aimed at the falsification or destruction of evidence or the manipulation of witnesses (see W. v.

For example, eyeball fluid and urine were not collected for toxicological examination, no such examination was performed in respect of the gallbladder and a puncture wound on the tongue, and the examination of the heart, brain and lungs was insufficiently thorough. Thus, important questions were unresolved (compare with Salman v.

While acknowledging the important role of the Russian Constitutional Court in laying down rules governing posthumous criminal proceedings, as well as not losing sight of the Constitutional Court\u2019s reliance on rehabilitation as the purpose of the continuation of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph\u00a0169 above), the Court does not consider it necessary to address the applicants\u2019 argument.
