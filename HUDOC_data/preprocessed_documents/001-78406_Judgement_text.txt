The case originated in an application (no. 29508/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Viktor Dmitriyevich Kozachek (“the applicant”), on 15 July 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 5 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in the , the Kharkiv Region.
On 24 July 1997 the labour disputes commission of the Joint Stock Company “Kupyanskiy Lyvarniy Zavod” (“the KLZ”), in which the State held 66.18% of the share capital, ordered the company to pay the applicant UAH 1,017 in salary arrears.
In August 1997 the Kupyansk Town Bailiffs' Service instituted enforcement proceedings.
On 14 December 2004 the Bailiffs' Service informed the applicant that the judgment could not be enforced due to the moratorium on the forced sale of property belonging to State enterprises introduced by the Law of 29 November 2001 and the debtor's lack of funds.
On 3 February 2006 the decision of 24 July 1997 was enforced in full.
On 24 September 2003 the  ordered the Joint Stock Company “Kupyanskiy Chavunolyvarniy Zavod”, in which the KLZ held 49% of the share capital, to pay the applicant UAH 920.16 in salary arrears.
On 28 November 2003 the same court rejected the applicant's request for leave to appeal against the judgment of 24 September 2003 for failure to comply with procedural formalities. On 20 February 2004 the court rejected the applicant's appeal in cassation on the ground that the judgment was not appealed against under the ordinary appeal procedure.
The applicant did not apply to the Bailiffs' Service for the execution of the judgment of 24 September 2003. It remains unenforced.
Article 18 § 1 (1) of the Law of Ukraine of 21 April 1999 “on Enforcement Proceedings” provides that a creditor must apply to the Bailiffs' Service with a writ of execution to enable the latter to initiate enforcement proceedings in respect of the decision given in the creditor's favour.
The Law aims at protecting State interests on the sale of assets belonging to undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital. A moratorium on the enforcement of judgment debts has been introduced until such time as the mechanism for the forced sale of the property of such undertakings has been improved. No time-limit has been set.
Under Article 2, the moratorium applies to immovable property and other capital (fixed) assets, which ensure the production, as well as to the shares which belong to the State.
