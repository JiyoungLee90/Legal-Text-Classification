Although she had attempted to justify some of her absences by submitting medical certificates, court-appointed medical experts had considered the absences unjustified and that she might have simulated the worsening of her illnesses (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 14 above). As a result, the court had doubts as to the truthfulness of her submissions regarding the fire at her company\u2019s premises and the breakdown of her car. It noted that she had places of residence in \u0160iauliai and Rietavas, and that she had claimed that on 7 November 2016 she had been coming to court from \u0160iauliai. However, the documents which she had provided to the court suggested that on the day in question her car had been transported from another town, Plung\u0117, to \u0160iauliai and back to Plung\u0117, and did not indicate that any repairs had been done to the car.

However, it considered that her participation in the proceedings at that time could be ensured by more lenient restrictive measures. The court observed that after the applicant had been placed in detention, the examination of the criminal case had not progressed significantly and hearings had been adjourned for reasons not attributable to her (see paragraphs 35 above). Accordingly, it considered that extending the detention in order to ensure her participation in the hearings was not proportionate. In addition, she was of advanced age and poor health, had a permanent place of residence, a family, her own business, and no previous convictions (see paragraphs 47 and 49 below). Even though she had previously failed to properly comply with the duty to appear before the court, that could be ensured by imposing a more lenient restrictive measure.

However, the Court is unable to agree with this argument as regards the period prior to 7 November 2016. During that period, the courts established that the applicant had submitted medical certificates which had been issued in breach of the relevant legal requirements and that, according to medical experts, she might have simulated the worsening of her medical conditions (see paragraphs 8, 10 and\u00a014 above). The Court takes due note of the applicant\u2019s state of health, which was not disputed by the parties (see paragraphs 8, 10 and 39 above). It also observes that it was never alleged that she herself had contributed to the unlawfulness of the medical certificates. At the same time, the Court emphasises that it is not its role to assess whether the applicant\u2019s health allowed her to attend the hearings or whether her doctor acted lawfully, and it does not consider the assessment of the domestic courts in this respect to be arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. Furthermore, the courts found that she had not provided any documents to prove that there had been a fire at her company\u2019s premises (see paragraph\u00a018 above) and that her absence from a hearing because of the planned absence of another co-accused\u2019s lawyer was not justified under domestic law (see paragraph 13 above). The Court is satisfied that the domestic courts reached their conclusions on the basis of the relevant documents in their possession, and has no reason to question their assessment.",

It nonetheless observes that other restrictive measures were available under domestic law, such as electronic monitoring, house arrest and bail, as well as the possibility of applying several of them at the same time (see paragraphs 45 and 46 above). However, the decisions of the Kretinga District Court and the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court did not contain any reference to any of the other measures or an explanation why they would not be sufficient to ensure the applicant\u2019s appearance at trial (see paragraphs\u00a017, 18, 22-24, 34 and 36 above and Ambruszkiewicz v.\u00a0Poland, no. 38797/03, \u00a7 32, 4\u00a0May 2006).",

In any event, the courts in their decisions did not explicitly address the question of the applicant\u2019s health and did not rule that it was compatible with detention, referring to either the findings of the court-appointed experts or to any other available information (see paragraphs 17, 18, 22-24, 34 and\u00a036 above and, mutatis mutandis, Korneykova v.

Furthermore, even though, following the applicant\u2019s admission to a psychiatric facility, the Kretinga District Court ordered an assessment to determine whether her mental health allowed her to be detained, she was placed in detention before that assessment was carried out (see paragraphs 28, 30 and 39 above).",

Indeed, in the decision replacing the detention with release on bail, the Klaip\u0117da Regional Court acknowledged that after the applicant had been detained, the examination of the criminal case \u201chad not progressed significantly\u201d and that hearings had been adjourned for reasons not attributable to her (see paragraph 38 above).",
