However, the Court is not persuaded that the domestic law provisions relied on by the Government constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. It notes that the provisions do not address the situation of an applicant who is ultimately acquitted of an offence. Moreover, an applicant is left in a state of uncertainty as to the time of application of the provisions given that he must await the stage of sentencing before any consideration can be given to reducing the length of the sentence in the light of the length of the criminal proceedings.",
