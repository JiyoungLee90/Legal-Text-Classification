It was true that both of these norms obliged a judge to refrain from taking part in the decision if there were a legitimate reason to doubt whether he offered the guarantees of impartiality to which every accused person was entitled. However, the Court held that the documents which it could take into account did not reveal that after the public prosecutor\u2019s department had received the covering note mentioned in the ground of appeal, Mr. Van de Walle, who was then a senior deputy to the Brussels procureur du Roi, had taken any decision or intervened in any manner whatsoever in the conduct of the prosecution relating to the facts in question. Admittedly, for a judge\u2019s impartiality to be regarded as compromised on account of his previous intervention in the capacity of judicial officer in the public prosecutor\u2019s department, it was not essential that such intervention should have consisted of adopting a personal standpoint in the matter or taking a specific step in the process of prosecution or investigation. Nevertheless, it could not be assumed that a judicial officer in the public prosecutor\u2019s department had intervened in a case in or on the occasion of the exercise of his functions as such an officer merely because there was a covering note which had been addressed to him personally by the investigating judge but which had not been shown by any evidence to have been received by the officer or to have caused him to take even an indirect interest in the case. In this connection, the Court of Cassation noted finally that it was not the senior deputy Van de Walle who had replied to the covering note.",

Article 292 of the 1967 Judicial Code prohibits the concurrent exercise of different judicial functions, except where otherwise provided by law; it lays down that \"any decision given by a judge who has previously dealt with the case in the exercise of some other judicial function\" shall be null and void. Article 127 specifies that \"proceedings before an assize court shall be null and void if they have been presided over by a judicial officer who has acted in the case as ... public prosecutor (minist\u00e8re public) or has delivered rulings on the conduct of the investigations\".",
