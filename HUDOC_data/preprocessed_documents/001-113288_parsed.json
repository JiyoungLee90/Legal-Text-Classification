Having extensively relied on the Court\u2019s case-law, the Government further submitted that the judgment had been issued against a private company for whose debts the State could not be held liable. They stressed that the State\u2019s responsibility did not go any further than to assist the applicants in the enforcement of the judgment, through bailiffs or by way of bankruptcy proceedings. The Government reiterated that this was not an obligation of result but of means, with the means of enforcement available to the present applicants having been adequate and effective. The State should only bear responsibility for very serious omissions committed by its officials which had negated the point of enforcing the judgment. The Government further stated that the Court should distinguish the present case from the case of Kunashko v. Russia (no.\u00a036337/03, 17 December 2009), in which it found a violation of Article\u00a06 of the Convention on account of the State\u2019s failure to effectively assist the applicant in recovering a judgment debt against a private legal entity.

They further noted that, as a result of their claim against the Company not being included on the list of creditors, a chance to have the judgment enforced had been missed as a result of negligence. Given that the bankruptcy proceedings had been opened in respect of the Company precisely in view of its inability to pay its debts to those creditors who had been put on the list, it was absurd to expect that the Company would retain any funds by the end of the bankruptcy proceedings to cover debts falling outside the list of its creditors.",

In particular, in the case of Kesyan v. Russia (no. 36496/02, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63, 19 October 2006), the Court dismissed the Government\u2019s objection of non-exhaustion, having reiterated that according to its settled case-law, complaints concerning the length of enforcement proceedings could be raised with the Court before the final termination of the proceedings in question. In the case of Kunashko (cited above, \u00a7\u00a047), the Court examined another angle of the Government\u2019s nonexhaustion objection. It noted that in a situation when an applicant had used various legal avenues provided for by Russian law to complain about bailiffs\u2019 conduct, including a complaint before a Russian court, the Court cannot reject for failure to exhaust domestic remedies an application concerning the quality of assistance afforded by the State for the purpose of obtaining enforcement of a final judgment against a private party.",

Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 1999V). However, the right of \u201caccess to court\u201d does not impose an obligation on a State to execute every judgment of a civil character without having regard to the particular circumstances of a case (see Sanglier v. France, no. 50342/99, \u00a7\u00a039, 27 May 2003). The State has a positive obligation to put in place a system for enforcement of judgments that is effective both in law and in practice and ensures their enforcement without undue delay (see Fuklev v. Ukraine, no. 71186/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 7 June 2005). In other words, when final judgments are issued against \u201cprivate\u201d defendants, the State\u2019s positive obligation consists of providing a legal arsenal allowing individuals to obtain, from their evading debtors, payment of sums awarded by those judgments (see Dachar v. France (dec.), no. 42338/98, 6 June 2000). When the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a judgment and they fail to do so, their inactivity can engage the State\u2019s responsibility on the basis of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention (see Scollo v. , 28 September 1995, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 315C). It is obvious that the State\u2019s positive obligation is not that of result, but one of means. Authorities have to take reasonably accessible steps to assist the recovery of any judgment debt. Consequently, when it is established that the measures taken by the authorities were adequate and sufficient, the State cannot be held responsible for a failure by a \u201cprivate\u201d defendant to pay the judgment debt (see Kunashko, cited above, \u00a7 38).",

While the ambiguity of the terms used in the judgment of 21 November 2001 does not escape the Court\u2019s attention, the subsequent developments in the case, as well as the interpretation of the judgment by the Russian courts (see paragraphs 12 and 21 above), do not leave room for any doubt that under the judgment of 21 November 2001 the Company was required to resettle the applicants from the housing premises they were occupying at the time to another flat. On 3 April 2002 the enforcement proceedings were instituted. In 2010 they were joined to the liquidation proceedings against the debtor company which are now pending.",

The materials before the Court show that the bailiffs remained passive most of the time and that when they decided to act, those actions were directed at rectification of their own omissions (see, for instance, paragraph 17 above, describing attempts to restore the lost execution writ). It appears that the bailiffs were unaware of the Company\u2019s fate and its financial situation to the extent that they missed the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings against it and subsequently failed to transfer the entire enforcement file to the Company\u2019s liquidator. The bailiffs\u2019 inactivity and their constant mistakes were also criticised by the Russian courts (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). It was the applicants who tried to push forward the enforcement proceedings, having attempted to amend the method of enforcement and having reminded the bailiffs of their obligations. One of those pleas made in 2006 led to an attempt by the bailiffs three years later to restore the misplaced enforcement file and to obtain a duplicate of the lost writ.",

It, however, finds it particularly important that the bailiffs did nothing to enforce the judgment award in the crucial period of almost seven years between April 2002 and March 2009, when the Company was not yet in a state of liquidation. Their failure to act during all those years led to the applicants now being compelled to await the outcome of the liquidation proceedings and to hope that the Company will, in the end, retain sufficient funds to comply with the judgment in their favour. In any event, the Court does not see how the unlikely possibility that the applicants, who, possibly through negligence on the part of the bailiffs, were not included on the list of the Company\u2019s creditors, will recover the judgment debt if and when the Company satisfies its liabilities to its creditors can remedy their grievances related to the lengthy and stale enforcement proceedings which lay at the heart of the present complaints (see, for similar reasoning, Kunashko, cited above, \u00a7 47).",
