The case originated in an application (no. 25279/06) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Csaba Jáhny (“the applicant”), on 12 June 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr I. Barbalics, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 7 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Ajka.
On 22 July 1990 the applicant and Pápa és Vidéke ÁFÉSZ, a legal person, concluded a lease contract concerning the property of the latter party.
The applicant apparently breached his contractual obligations and failed to pay the monthly rental fees between October 1993 and October 1994.
After several unsuccessful deadline extensions and requests for payment, Pápa és Vidéke ÁFÉSZ terminated the lease contract with immediate effect on 26 October 1994.
In November 1994 Pápa és Vidéke ÁFÉSZ lodged a compensation claim with the Veszprém County Regional Court against the applicant.
The first-instance court found for the plaintiff and ordered the applicant to pay the overdue rental fees (approximately 1,600 euros (EUR)) and accrued interests to the plaintiff.
On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal upheld the judgment on 2 December 2003.
The applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court, which rejected it on 8 December 2005. The decision was served on the applicant on 26 January 2006.
