Turning to the Government\u2019s argument that the declaratory decision of the Constitutional Court may subsequently form the basis for claiming damages in official liability proceedings, the Court notes firstly that the Government did not provide any details, nor did they refer to any specific examples of case-law. The Court is therefore not required to examine whether a remedy requiring the applicant to conduct two sets of proceedings, one to obtain a declaratory decision by the Constitutional Court and a second to obtain damages, could possibly be regarded as an effective one. Moreover, the Court notes that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court itself took more than two years. The possibility referred to by the Government can therefore not be regarded as an effective remedy (see, VR-Bank Stuttgart eG v. , no. 28571/06, \u00a7\u00a7 30-32, 20 May 2010).",

Austria (dec.), no. 74159/01, 9 October 2003). The applicant made use of the request for transfer of jurisdiction once. The Court has already held in similar cases that a detailed examination as to whether the applicants could have made more efficient use of that remedy by using it at other stages of the proceedings, would overstretch the duties incumbent on applicants pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kern v. , no. 14206/02, \u00a7 49, 24 February 2005 and Klug v. , no. 33928/05, \u00a7 31, 15 January 2009, both concerning land consolidation proceedings during which the applicants had successfully made use of the request for transfer of jurisdiction once or twice, respectively, and the Government had argued that, in addition, they should have done so at other stages of the proceedings).
