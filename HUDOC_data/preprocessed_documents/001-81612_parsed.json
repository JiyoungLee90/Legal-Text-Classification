However, in the Government's view, such an approach created confusion. If the sum awarded by a court was a pensioner's \u201cpossession\u201d, it should not be affected by any subsequent increase in pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant would have had to return the money she had already received from the Pension Fund by virtue of the more recent changes in the legislation on State pensions. They concluded that in order to avoid such situations the Court should not regard the pension amount awarded by the domestic courts as the claimant's \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

The Court thus considers that the Fund's request of 21 August 2000 to reopen the case owing to the discovery of new circumstances was in essence an attempt to re-argue the case on points which the Fund could have, but apparently failed, to raise when the case was heard for the first time. That being so, the Court considers the Fund's request to be an \u201cappeal in disguise\u201d rather than a conscientious effort to make good a miscarriage of justice (cf.

The Court notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article\u00a06 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position she would have been in had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v.\u00a0Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26\u00a0October 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a085, p.\u00a016, \u00a7\u00a012, and, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no.\u00a053431/99, \u00a7\u00a027, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that this principle applies as well in the present case, having regard to the violations found (cf. Poznakhirina v. Russia, no. 25964/02, \u00a7\u00a033, 24\u00a0February 2005). The applicant was prevented from receiving money she had legitimately expected to receive under the judgment of 22\u00a0November 1999. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant's entitlement to receive pension payments based on the IPC of more than 0.7 was never confirmed by any domestic court. In accordance with the judgment of 22\u00a0November 1999, as upheld on 25 January 2000, the applicant was entitled to a pension calculated with an IPC of 0.7 until an increased IPC was introduced under the Russian pension legislation. The Court therefore accepts the Government's calculation of the pension to which the applicant was entitled in accordance with the judgment of 22\u00a0November 1999 and awards the applicant RUR 3,309 plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.",
