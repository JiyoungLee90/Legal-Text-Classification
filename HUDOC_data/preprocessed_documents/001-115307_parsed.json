In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3.

In this connection the Court observes the following: whilst exclusively focusing on the applicant\u2019s injuries to his face, the Government simply overlooked the fact that the applicant had also suffered long-lasting damage to his health, such as an internal head injury and concussion, and that several other bruises had been found on different parts of his body (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above). The relevant national authorities in their domestic decisions failed to challenge the medical conclusion of 21\u00a0March\u00a02006 (see paragraphs 23 and 26 above), whilst the Government, in their pleadings before the Court, simply dismissed the forensic conclusion of 25\u00a0October 2006; they stated that this conclusion had not proved the fact of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment. Hence, by overlooking the relevant medical information, the Government did not take the trouble of contesting the expert\u2019s conclusion that the applicant\u2019s various injuries could not be explained by a single fall (see paragraph 12 above).",

The Court finds it inconceivable that the domestic authorities, rather than verifying the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment, relied on the very same confession, which, as he claimed, had been extracted from him under physical duress (see paragraph 26 above). Also, the prosecution and judicial authorities accepted the credibility of the police officers\u2019 testimonies without giving any convincing reasons for doing so, despite the fact that those officers\u2019 statements might have been subjective and aimed at evading criminal liability for the purported ill-treatment of the applicant. The credibility of the police officers\u2019 statements should also have been questioned, as the investigation was supposed to establish whether they were liable to face disciplinary or criminal charges (see Ognyanova and Choban v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a046317/99, \u00a7\u00a099, 23\u00a0February 2006, and Antipenkov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a033470/03, \u00a7\u00a069, 15\u00a0October 2009).
