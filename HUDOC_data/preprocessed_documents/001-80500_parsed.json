In addition, the Court observes that the applicant was diagnosed with hepatitis after his admission to facility no.

Although this fact in itself does not imply a violation of Article 3, given, in particular, the fact that the applicant received treatment (see Alver v. , no. 64812/01, \u00a7\u00a054, 8 November 2005 and, mutatis mutandis, Khokhlich v.
