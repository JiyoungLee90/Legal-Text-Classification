In addition, the [State Court Act 2000], the Agreement of 1 December 2004 and the decisions on [their] appointment created the prerequisites and mechanisms which secure the independence of [the] judges from interference or influence by the executive authority or international authorities. Judges appointed in this manner are obliged to respect and apply all the rules which generally apply in national criminal proceedings and which comply with international standards. Their term of office is defined and their activities are monitored during this period. The reasoning behind their appointment was the need to establish and strengthen national courts in the transitional period and to support the efforts of these courts in establishing responsibility for serious violations of human rights and ethnically motivated crimes. It is therefore aimed at securing the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and administering justice. Even the fact that the manner of appointment was changed by the subsequent Agreement of 26\u00a0September 2006, so that the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina has become responsible for the appointment of international judges, does not in itself automatically imply that their original appointments, in the manner provided for at the time of the contested verdicts, were contrary to the principles of independence of the court in terms of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention. The Constitutional Court holds that the appellant failed to submit convincing arguments and evidence in support of the allegations relating to a lack of independence on the part of the international judges. As to the appellant\u2019s allegations concerning the lack of independence of the national judge, on the ground that he is a person with \u2018insufficient experience\u2019, the Constitutional Court finds that these allegations are prima facie ill-founded and do not require any extensive examination. Taking all of the above into account, the Constitutional Court concludes that the appellant\u2019s allegations concerning the lack of independence and related violation of the standards relating to the right to a fair trial under Article II(3)(e) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 6 of the European Convention are unfounded.",

On 4 May 2000 the European Court of Human Rights issued a decision in the case of Naletili\u0107 v. the Republic of Croatia (no.\u00a051891/99). It follows from that decision that the applicant was charged by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia with war crimes committed in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that he submitted complaints that were identical to those of the appellant in the present case, i.e. he called for the application of \u2018more lenient law\u2019. He argued that the Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia stipulated a more lenient criminal sanction than the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and called for application of Article 7 of the European Convention. In its decision, the European Court of Human Rights considered the application of Article 7 and emphasised the following: \u2018As to the applicant\u2019s contention that he might receive a heavier punishment by the ICTY than he might have received by domestic courts if the latter exercised their jurisdiction to finalise the proceedings against him, the Court notes that, even assuming Article 7 of the Convention to apply to the present case, the specific provision that could be applicable to it would be paragraph 2 rather than paragraph 1 of Article 7 of the Convention. This means that the second sentence of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the Convention invoked by the applicant could not apply.

It is not easy to give an answer as to which law is more lenient, and this legal issue is much more complex than it appears. Taking into account around ten criteria that have been developed through theory and practice, one may conclude that in the instant case the prescribed penalty is a key factor which is relevant to the question of which law is the more lenient. Given that the same criminal offence existed (Article 142 of the [1976 Criminal Code]) under the criminal legislation of the former Yugoslavia, which Bosnia and Herzegovina inherited by its 1992 Decree, and which provided for a penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment or the death penalty, while the new criminal legislation applied in the instant case (Article 173 of the [2003 Criminal Code]) provides for a penalty of ten years\u2019 imprisonment or long-term imprisonment, the basic question is which law is more lenient. At first sight, the [2003 Criminal Code] is more lenient, since it does not provide for the death penalty. However, taking into account that subsequent to the entry into force of the Washington Agreement and the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994, the death penalty was abolished, as was merely confirmed by the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1995, and taking into account the positions of the ordinary courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Entities and the Br\u010dko District (Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Supreme Court of the Republika Srpska and Appellate Court of the Br\u010dko District) that the death penalty was not to be pronounced (this position was also taken by the Human Rights Chamber in the case of Damjanovi\u0107 and Herak v. Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), it appears that the 1992 law is more lenient. According to the above-mentioned court positions and the law, the maximum term of imprisonment that can be pronounced for this criminal offence is 20 years.",

In other words, this is the case where the legislature failed to include all of the elements characterising the said offences as referred to in the Geneva Conventions. This case does not raise that issue. The criminal offence in question existed in the domestic legislation, both when the offence was committed and at the time of trial, and therefore all of the mechanisms of criminal law and safeguarded constitutional rights should be consistently applied, including the rights guaranteed under the European Convention. The Naleteli\u0107 case is irrelevant here, because it concerned an international prosecutor who accused [the applicant] before an international tribunal which had been established on a special basis and is vested with the powers defined by the Resolution of the United Nations and its Statute; it does not apply national legislation, but rather its own procedures and sanctions/penalties.

In a 2003 document entitled \u2018Opinion on the Possibility of Retroactive Application of Some Provisions of the New Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019, Professor Cassese concluded as follows: \u2018Finally, let us deal with the issue whether the [State Court] should apply the more lenient sanction in the event of a crime for which the new criminal code prescribes a graver penalty than that envisaged by the former law. The reply to this question can only be affirmative. This conclusion rests on two legal bases: first, there is a general principle of international law according to which, if a single crime is envisaged in two successive provisions with one imposing a less strict penalty, that penalty should be determined according to the favor libertatis principle; secondly, this principle is explicitly mentioned in Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, wherein it is stated that no heavier penalty shall be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed. Accordingly, the [State Court] should always apply the more lenient penalty whenever there is a difference in length of penalty when the former is compared with the new criminal provision. It is clear that retroactive application of criminal code is related to the penalty only and not to other elements of this Article.\u2019",

Article 3 thereof provides that no punishment or other criminal sanction may be imposed on any person for an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law and for which a punishment was not prescribed by law. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 4 of that Code, the law that was in effect at the time when a criminal offence was committed applies to the offender; however, if the law has been amended after the commission of the offence, the law that is more lenient to the offender must be applied. In January 2005, Article 4a was added to the 2003 Criminal Code. Like Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, it stipulates that the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Criminal Code must not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of international law.",

In March 2009, however, the State Court began applying a new approach, which was to establish on a case-by-case basis which of the Codes was more lenient to the offender. It has since applied the 1976 Code to less serious instances of war crimes. At the same time, it has continued to apply the 2003 Code to more serious instances of war crimes, which were punishable by the death penalty under the 1976 Code, and whenever it held that the 2003 Code was more lenient to the offender for any reason. It should be noted that the new approach concerns only the appeals chambers of the State Court; the trial chambers have continued to apply the 2003 Code in all war crimes cases. According to figures provided by the Government (see paragraph 63 below), appeals chambers rendered 21 decisions in war crimes cases between March 2009, when the new approach was first applied, and November 2012. They applied the 1976 Code in five of them and the 2003 Code in 16 of them. However, the application of the 1976 Code by an appeals chamber did not always lead to a reduction of penalty (in two cases, the appeals chamber imposed the same penalty under the 1976 Code as the trial chamber had done under the 2003 Code; in one case, the penalty imposed by the appeals chamber under the 1976 Code was even heavier than that imposed by the trial chamber under the 2003 Code).",

In general, the cases in which the application of different codes undermines the principle of equality before the law are those in which the court, by applying the [2003] Code, could sentence the accused to a sentence higher than the 15 or 20 years maximum sentence prescribed under the [1976] Code.

The Committee is concerned that this might affect consistency in sentencing among entities (arts. 2 and\u00a014). The State party should expedite the prosecution of war crime cases. The State party should also continue to provide adequate psychological support to victims of sexual violence, particularly during the conduct of trials.

The irremovability of judges by the executive during their term of office is in general considered as a corollary of their independence and thus included in the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Campbell and Fell, cited above, \u00a7 80). Although the notion of the separation of powers between the political organs of government and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7\u00a078, ECHR 2002-IV), appointment of judges by the executive or the legislature is permissible, provided that appointees are free from influence or pressure when carrying out their adjudicatory role (see Flux v. Moldova (no. 2), no. 31001/03, \u00a7 27, 3 July 2007).",

The Court examined that case, inter alia, under Article 7 of the Convention and declared it manifestly ill-founded. It considered the fact that crimes against humanity had not been criminal offences under national law during the 1992-95 war to be irrelevant, since they had clearly constituted criminal offences under international law at that time.

The 2003\u00a0Criminal Code, being more severe than the 1976 Code with regard to the minimum sentences for war crimes, should not therefore have been applied in their case. In this regard, they referred to a small number of cases in which the State Court had considered the 1976 Code to be more lenient (see paragraph\u00a029 above), criticising at the same time the State Court for not applying that Code consistently. Given that their convictions had been based exclusively on national law, they submitted that the Government\u2019s reliance on the \u201cgeneral principles of law recognised by civilised nations\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 2 was misleading. They further submitted that their case should be distinguished from the cases to which the Government and the third party had referred (namely S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0November 1995, Series A no. 335B, and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.\u00a0Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, ECHR 2001II). In particular, the S.W. case concerned the gradual development of the criminal law through a line of case-law, over the course of several years, in order to take account of society\u2019s changing attitudes. This was clearly different from the enactment of new legislation prescribing heavier penalties for some criminal offences, as in the present case. The applicants added that the States should not change their laws after an event so as to punish perpetrators, no matter how controversial the offence in question.",

Bulgaria (dec.), no. 76965/01, 9 February 2006). That was indeed the opinion of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the present case (see paragraph 15 above). They further argued that even if the 2003 Code was not more lenient to the applicants, it was still justified to apply it in this case, for the following reasons. First, the Government claimed that Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the Convention provided an exception to the rule of non-retroactivity of crimes and punishments set out in Article 7 \u00a7 1 (they referred to Naletili\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no. 51891/99, ECHR 2000V). In other words, if an act was criminal at the time when it was committed both under \u201cthe general principles of law recognised by civilised nations\u201d and under national law, then a penalty even heavier than that which was applicable under national law might be imposed. It was clear that the acts committed by the present applicants were criminal under \u201cthe general principles of law recognised by civilised nations\u201d. As a result, the rule of non-retroactivity of punishments did not apply and, in the Government\u2019s opinion, any penalty could have been imposed on the applicants. Secondly, the Government submitted that the interests of justice required that the principle of non-retroactivity be set aside in this case (they referred in this connection to S.W., cited above; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above; and a duty under international humanitarian law to punish war crimes adequately). The rigidity of the principle of non-retroactivity, it was argued, had to be softened in certain historical situations so that this principle would not be to the detriment of the principle of equity.",

However, they contended that the 2003 Code was still applied in most cases. Specifically, the State Court issued 102\u00a0decisions between March 2009 and November 2012 (59 by trial chambers and 43 by appeals chambers). The trial chambers had always applied the 2003 Code. The appeals chambers had applied that Code in all the cases concerning crimes against humanity and genocide. As to war crimes, the appeals chambers had applied the 1976 Code in five cases and the 2003 Code in 16\u00a0cases. The Government criticised the approach adopted in those first five cases and argued that the State Court should always have applied the 2003\u00a0Code in war crimes cases.",

Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused\u2019s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused\u2019s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law.

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in certain Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

Pursuant to the 1976 Code, war crimes were punishable by imprisonment for a term of 5-15 years or, for the most serious cases, the death penalty (see Article 142 \u00a7 1 in conjunction with Articles 37 \u00a7 2 and 38 \u00a7 1 of the 1976 Code). A 20-year prison term could have also been imposed instead of the death penalty (see Article 38 \u00a7 2 thereof). Aiders and abettors of war crimes, like Mr Maktouf, were to be punished as if they themselves had committed the crimes, but their punishment could be reduced to one year\u2019s imprisonment (see Article\u00a042 of the same Code in conjunction with Articles 24 \u00a7 1 and 43 \u00a7 1 thereof). Pursuant to the 2003 Code, war crimes attract imprisonment for a term of 10-20 years or, for the most serious cases, long-term imprisonment for a term of 20-45 years (see Article 173 \u00a7 1 of the 2003 Code in conjunction with Article 42 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of that Code). Aiders and abettors of war crimes, such as Mr Maktouf, are to be punished as if they themselves had committed the crimes, but their punishment could be reduced to five years\u2019 imprisonment (Article 49 in conjunction with Articles 31 \u00a7 1 and 50 \u00a7 1 of that Code). While pointing out that his sentence should be reduced as far as possible (see paragraph 14 above), the State Court sentenced Mr\u00a0Maktouf to five years\u2019 imprisonment, the lowest possible sentence under the 2003 Code. In contrast, under the 1976 Code he could have been sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment. As regards Mr Damjanovi\u0107, he was sentenced to 11 years\u2019 imprisonment, slightly above the minimum of ten years. Under the 1976 Code, it would have been possible to impose a sentence of only five years.",

As neither of the applicants was held criminally liable for any loss of life, the crimes of which they were convicted clearly did not belong to that category. Indeed, as observed above, Mr Maktouf received the lowest sentence provided for and Mr Damjanovi\u0107 a sentence which was only slightly above the lowest level set by the 2003 Code for war crimes. In these circumstances, it is of particular relevance in the present case which Code was more lenient in respect of the minimum sentence, and this was without doubt the 1976 Code. Such an approach has been taken by at least some of the appeals chambers in the State Court in recent cases (see paragraph 29 above).",

France, 8 June 1995, Series A no. 317B; Gabarri Moreno v. Spain, no.\u00a068066/01, 22 July 2003; Scoppola, cited above). What is crucial, however, is that the applicants could have received lower sentences had that Code been applied in their cases. As already observed in paragraph 68 above, the State Court held, when imposing Mr Maktouf\u2019s sentence, that it should be reduced to the lowest possible level permitted by the 2003 Code. Similarly, Mr Damjanovi\u0107 received a sentence that was close to the minimum level. It should further be noted that, according to the approach followed in some more recent war crimes cases referred to in paragraph 29 above, the appeals chambers of the State Court had opted for the 1976 Code rather than the 2003 Code, specifically with a view to applying the most lenient sentencing rules. Accordingly, since there exists a real possibility that the retroactive application of the 2003 Code operated to the applicants\u2019 disadvantage as concerns the sentencing, it cannot be said that they were afforded effective safeguards against the imposition of a heavier penalty, in breach of Article 7 of the Convention.",

This argument is inconsistent with the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires which imply that Article 7 \u00a7 1 can be considered to contain the general rule of non-retroactivity and that Article 7 \u00a7 2 is only a contextual clarification of the liability limb of that rule, included so as to ensure that there was no doubt about the validity of prosecutions after the Second World War in respect of the crimes committed during that war (see Kononov, cited above, \u00a7 186). It is thus clear that the drafters of the Convention did not intend to allow for any general exception to the rule of non-retroactivity. Indeed, the Court has held in a number of cases that the two paragraphs of Article 7 are interlinked and are to be interpreted in a concordant manner (see, for example, Tess v. Latvia (dec.), no. 34854/02, 12 December 2002, and Kononov, cited above, \u00a7 186).",

As regards Mr\u00a0Maktouf\u2019s case, the Government argued that it was sensitive and complex, as it had been one of the first cases dealing with crimes committed by foreign mujahedin (the ICTY had dealt with that issue for the first time in 2006 in Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and Kubura). In addition, ritual beheadings, carried out at their camps, had caused alarm among the local population. The Government asserted that Mr Damjanovi\u0107\u2019s case was also sensitive given, inter alia, that it concerned the torture of a large number of victims. Another reason for the transfer of Mr Damjanovi\u0107\u2019s case to the State Court was that better facilities were available for the protection of witnesses at the State Court; there was thus a higher risk of witness intimidation at the Entity level.",

Admittedly, the respondent Government submitted that since the applicants were prosecuted and convicted for war crimes, as recognised under international law, the nulla poena sine lege principle did not apply. The Court refutes this proposition, holding that it provides far too broad a reading of the Article 7 \u00a7 2 exception. Firstly, even if the respondent Government submitted such an argument in their defence, the case does not really concern the retroactive application of law in the circumstances of this case. It is clear that the actions imputed to the applicants were crimes under both the 1976 and 2003 Criminal Codes. It is also clear that they were international crimes at the time they were committed (see paragraph 67 of the judgment). The principles clarified in the context of the Kononov v.\u00a0Latvia [GC] case (no. 36376/04, ECHR 2010), which concerned crimes committed during World War II that were prosecuted several decades later, and where the question thus clearly arose whether the applicant could have foreseen that his actions would be prosecuted under international or national law, are really not challenged in the case at hand.",

The ICC Statute defined for the first time the penalties that the Criminal Court could determine. The authorities in the field have generally commented that \u201cthe principles of legality in international criminal law are different from their counterparts in the national legal systems ... They are necessarily sui generis because they must balance between the preservation of justice and fairness for the accused and the preservation of world order ...\u201d (Bassiouni, cited above, p.\u00a0202).

It is here that the real problem lies. The main question for the Court is whether, in determining the applicants\u2019 cases, the State Court examined which Code provided for a more lenient sentence, given the crimes imputed to these applicants. As far as I can see the State Court was not in the habit of conducting such an assessment, at least at the time of the adjudication of these cases and prior to 2009, and it is on this limited ground that I find a violation of Article 7.

In this regard the majority\u2019s reasoning may be interpreted as embarking on a fourth-instance assessment as to what punishment might have been more appropriate. Moreover, the arguments as to the appropriateness of the imposed punishment seem more pertinent to the Article 6 complaints concerning the fairness of the domestic proceedings and their outcome.

This has been acknowledged in the provision of criminalisation based on \u201cinternational law\u201d in Article 11 \u00a7\u00a02 of the UDHR, which has also been inserted in Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the ECHR, Article 15 \u00a7 1 of the ICCPR and Article 40 \u00a7 2 (a) of the CRC, and in some national constitutions.

Italy (no. 2). The Court has adopted a clear position on the definition of lex mitior for the purpose of the application of successive penal laws: lex mitior is the one which is more favourable to the defendant, taking into account his or her characteristics, the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed. This means that Article\u00a07 \u00a7 1 of the ECHR presupposes a comparison in concreto of the penal laws applicable to the offender\u2019s case, including the law in force at the material time (the old law) and the law in force at the time of the judgment (the new law). Hence, the ECHR does not take into account the maximum limit of the penalty in abstracto. Nor does it take into consideration in abstracto the minimum limit of the penalty. Equally, it does not consider the maximum or minimum limits of the penalty on the basis of the domestic court\u2019s intention to impose a sentence closer to the maximum or the minimum. Instead, in the light of Scoppola, the lex mitior must be found in concreto, in other words the judge must test each of the applicable penal laws (the old and new laws) against the specific facts of the case in order to identify what would be the presumed penalty in the light of the new and the old law.

Conversely, a lighter penalty is to be imposed if, in the period since the criminal offence was committed, a new law has provided for a penalty lighter than that which was applicable at the time the offence was committed (the positive version of the principle of legality). These principles are part of the rules of customary international law, binding on all States, and are peremptory norms with the effect that no other rule of international or national law may derogate from them.

Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the ECHR and Article\u00a015 \u00a7\u00a02 of the ICCPR provide for such a case. Although historically created to justify the Nuremberg and Tokyo judgments, this protective provision also applies to other adjudication proceedings. It has its own field of application, since it refers to crimes which have not yet been crystallised into customary international law at the material time, nor been enshrined into treaty law applicable to the facts, but already represent an intolerable affront to the principles of justice, as reflected in the practice of a relevant number of nations. In order to avoid legal uncertainty and comply with the other facet of the principle of legality, that is to say the principle of specificity (nullum crimen sine lege certa et stricta), close scrutiny of the relevant State practice is required: only when the general principles of law reflect the treaty and domestic practices of a relevant number of States can they be recognised as expressing the will of the community of civilised nations to criminalise a particular form of conduct. It follows that the criminalisation of conduct based on the general principles of law is not an exception to the principle of the prohibition on retroactive penal law, in so far as the conduct already corresponded, from a substantive perspective, to criminal conduct when it occurred. Thus, the \u201cNuremberg/Tokyo clause\u201d does not apply when at the material time the conduct was punishable as a crime by national law, but with a lesser penalty than that enshrined in a subsequent law or treaty.",

And the conclusion is ineluctable: both applicants were subjected to an arbitrary criminal judgment which inflicted on them severe retroactive penalties. The evident proof of this arbitrariness is that the applicant Mr Damjanovi\u0107 was sentenced under the 2003 Code to eleven years\u2019 imprisonment by the State Court for beatings, more than double the lowest sentence admissible under the 1976 Code. This conclusion is even more forceful in the case of the applicant Mr Maktouf, who was sentenced under the 2003 Code to five years\u2019 imprisonment, that is to say five times the lowest sentence imposable under the 1976 Code.",

Had the courts applied the same mitigating sentencing criteria under the 1976 Code, as they could have done, they would necessarily have imposed much lower penalties on the applicants. This comparison in concreto between the penalties that the applicants received, and those that they could have expected under the 1976 Code, shows clearly that the 1976 Code was the lex mitior and the 2003 Code was the lex gravior. By acting in this manner, the national courts breached not only Article 4 \u00a7 2 of the 2003 Criminal Code of BiH, but also Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the ECHR.",

The legal effect of the finding of a violation of Article 7 is that the applicants\u2019 convictions must be declared null and void by the competent national court. Article 7 is a non-derogable right, as Article 15 of the ECHR clearly states. If the applicants\u2019 convictions remained valid in spite of a finding that they had violated Article 7, this would represent a de facto derogation from Article\u00a07. Such derogation would not only invalidate the finding of a violation in the Court\u2019s present judgment, but also Article 15. Should the respondent State still wish to adjudicate the alleged criminal acts committed by the applicants during the Bosnian war, a retrial is necessary. When Anselm von Feuerbach coined in \u00a7 24 of his Lehrbuch des gemeinen in Deutschland geltenden peinlichen Rechts of 1801 the Latin expression nulla poena sine lege, he also added that this principle allowed for no exceptions: it must benefit all offenders, be their crimes petty or brutal.",
