As to the remainder of the claims, it held that the applicant\u2019s right to reputation had been violated by the public prosecutor\u2019s statements and ordered the public prosecutor to present her apologies to the applicant. However, it dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim for compensation, stating that it was excessive and in any event he could not prove that he had suffered any actual damage. The court further applied section 39 of Act no.\u00a0XCIII of 1990 on Stamp Duties and ordered the applicant to pay HUF\u00a0879,000 (approximately EUR 2,900) in court fees. Under this rule, at the material time, the amount of stamp duty in civil cases was 6% of the claim but should attain a minimum of HUF\u00a015,000 (approximately EUR 50) and should not exceed a maximum of HUF 900,000 (approximately EUR\u00a03,000). In a subsequent supplementary decision on court costs, the court explained that the law required the payment of court fees proportionately to the dismissed part of the claim, and observed that the applicant\u2019s claim was far beyond the amounts normally awarded in similar cases.",

Similar considerations applied in the context of Article\u00a01\u00a0of\u00a0Protocol No. 1 where the State was under the obligation to pay compensation for expropriation, but the court fees were so high as to result in a total lack of compensation (see Perdig\u00e3o v.
