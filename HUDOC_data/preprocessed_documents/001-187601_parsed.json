First, the court explained that when the grounds listed in section 69(1) of the Imprisonment Act existed, it was the discretionary choice of the prison whether to apply any additional security measures and, if needed, to choose a specific measure. In the light of this, the court\u2019s control was limited to deciding whether mistakes had been made in the exercise of that discretion (the same was repeated by the Supreme Court in a judgment of 6 May 2015 in case no. 3-3-1-84-14). The court found that additional security measures served a preventive or deterrent purpose and in deciding to apply them the prison authorities were anticipating a future situation. In the light of this, it was not always necessary to first verify the circumstances serving as the basis for applying additional security measures within disciplinary, misdemeanour or criminal proceedings. In order to apply such security measures, it was sufficient that the prison had developed a justified fear of potential harm. The court also stressed that after the application of additional security measures, the prison had the duty to assess whether the application of the measures continued to be justified and \u2013 if new circumstances so warranted \u2013 decide whether to discontinue the measures.",

In assessing the applicant\u2019s overall criminal conduct, the Government noted that the applicant\u2019s crimes had become more severe over time, extending from crimes against property and hooliganism to those involving violence, physical abuse and extortion, including an aggravated murder, attacking a prison officer, and handling narcotic substances in prison. It was irrelevant whether the violations had become time-barred (see paragraph 55 above) as reference to them had primarily been made to demonstrate the applicant\u2019s character.

Not only had the applicant attacked another prisoner with a scissor blade, but \u2013 during the period under review in the present case when the security measures were already being applied \u2013 he had made threats over the telephone to a Ministry of Justice official about assaulting prison officers. Moreover, the prison had information that the applicant planned to \u201csettle scores\u201d with those he had had disagreements with (see paragraphs 8, 14, 25, 30 and 62 above). It should be noted that apart from those concrete incidents, the applicant had a history of violent behaviour and, in accordance with his personal risk assessment, he was considered to be aggressive and have a low tolerance to stress.",

The Government submitted that although the applicant was held in different cells during the relevant period, they were all of the same size, that is to say approximately 9.9\u00a0square metres (see paragraph 32 above). According to the security measures, the applicant was in his cell alone. Although the applicant asserted that the cell was smaller than suggested by the Government (see paragraph 40), he did not specify that claim or argue that the cell had been smaller than 6 square metres, the size the CPT considers advisable for single-occupancy cells (see paragraph\u00a051 above). Despite not being allowed to use the prison\u2019s other sports facilities, the applicant was allowed to spend one hour daily outdoors in the prison exercise yard.",

He claimed, in addition, that he had not been allowed to participate in any recreational activities or social events with families. The Court finds it convincing, based on the detailed information provided by the Government about the social reintegration programmes, that the applicant was able to participate in them on a regular, albeit individual, basis, and have discussions with a psychologist on those occasions (see paragraph 36 above). In the light of contradictory information submitted by the parties, the Court is unable to verify whether the applicant was allowed to participate in musical activity (see references to information provided by the Government in paragraph 37 and by the applicant in paragraph 42 above). The applicant did not contest the information provided by the Government that he was able to use the Internet (with access to limited websites) and borrow books in prison. Although the applicant claimed that he was not allowed to have a television in his cell, the Court does not find this claim convincing in the light of the information provided by the Government (see reference to a list of the items in the applicant\u2019s cell in paragraph 32 above) and the applicant himself (see reference in paragraph 40 above to the document submitted by the applicant from which it can be concluded that he had been authorised to have a television).",

He was also able to meet his lawyer (see paragraph 33 above). Against that background, the Court finds it established that the applicant could have regular contact with his family and does not consider it necessary to assess his claim that he had submitted more requests for social visits which had been turned down (see paragraph 57 above). In any event, the Government did not deny that the applicant had not been allowed to participate in the family day in 2012 (see paragraph 66 above).",

However, in the light of the information provided by the Government, the Court accepts that the applicant had been under regular medical supervision (see paragraph 38 above). Moreover, with regard to his references to a fear of forests, the Court notes that the applicant was not placed in a cell overlooking a forest during the relevant period (see paragraph 39 above). All the medical documents concerning this problem concerned a period outside the scope of the present case. In any event, although the medical specialists recommended not placing the applicant in a cell overlooking a forest, they did not ask for the additional security measures to be lifted altogether (see paragraph 41 above).",

The Court concludes that he cannot be considered to have been in complete sensory isolation or to have been totally isolated from social contact, and that his isolation was partial and relative (see Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, \u00a7 135; Rzakhanov, cited above, \u00a7 72; and Cs\u00fcll\u00f6g, cited above, \u00a7 33).",

Poland, no.\u00a013621/08, \u00a7 99, 17 April 2012, where the application of handcuffs was considered to be a matter of everyday procedure unrelated to any specific circumstances concerning the prisoner\u2019s past or current behaviour). The assumption of the applicant posing a risk of causing serious harm was based on the regular personal risk assessments and on his previous behaviour, which included violence or the threat of violence against other prisoners and prison officers (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 25 above; compare and contrast Rzakhanov, cited above, \u00a7 74, where the Government did not convincingly show why it was necessary to separate the applicant from other prisoners, and where one of the reasons cited was that the prisoner had sent unsubstantiated complaints to various authorities; and Cs\u00fcll\u00f6g, cited above, \u00a7 36, where there was no evidence that the measure had been applied on the basis of the applicant\u2019s personal characteristics). The decisions to prolong the application of such measures were based on objective concordant evidence specific to the applicant and cannot thus be considered to have been made arbitrarily. Against that background, the Court also finds convincing the Government\u2019s argument that as the aim of the security measures was to prevent the applicant harming either other prisoners or the prison officers, applying just one of the measures (for example placing him in a cell alone) would not have been effective without simultaneous application of the others (for example, limiting his free movement and communication with other prisoners).",

Cyprus, no.\u00a024407/04, \u00a7\u00a071, 7 January 2010). The decisions were reasoned and the application of additional security measures was reviewed on a regular basis every six months (see paragraphs 17 and 25 above). The Court highlights, in particular, that when deciding to prolong the security measures, the prison authorities did not simply rely on the same set of information about the applicant\u2019s past behaviour, but took into account new circumstances which had emerged while the security measures had been applied (see paragraphs\u00a014 and 25 above; compare and contrast Razvyazkin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a013579/09, \u00a7 105, 3 July 2012, and Cs\u00fcll\u00f6g, cited above, \u00a7 37).",
