The Government argued that, in relation to the Homebond appeal, she had contributed to the duration by failing to accept service of the notice of appeal. The Court notes that this added somewhat to the delay but did not have a significant impact on the case, as the Supreme Court granted Homebond an additional fourteen days to serve notice of its appeal, i.e. by the end of June 2013. There is no indication of any other activity in relation to that appeal until October 2014 when the applicant sought to have it struck out for want of prosecution. In that same month, however, the case was transferred to the new Court of Appeal. There it was rapidly subject to case management, leading to a hearing within four months of the transfer. The decision, delivered that same day, came twenty-three months after the decision of the High Court and marked the end of the case against Homebond.",

The Supreme Court responded by setting a ten-week deadline for the appellants to file their submissions. The appeal was transferred to the Court of Appeal where, as with the Homebond appeal, the parties quickly received directions from that court regarding the lodging of submissions, and the hearing took place within five months of the transfer. The decision on appeal came twenty-two months after that of the High Court. It is clear from the manner in which the appeals were dealt with by the Court of Appeal after they were transferred that it was alive to the issue of delay and prepared to take steps in order to dispose rapidly of the proceedings to the extent possible (see Beggs v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a025133/06, \u00a7\u00a0272, 6\u00a0November 2012).
