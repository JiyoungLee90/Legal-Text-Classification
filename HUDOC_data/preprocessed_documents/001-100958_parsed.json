Moreover, in assessing the applicant's personality, the domestic courts chose to rely exclusively on his unfavourable character reference and to disregard those in his favour (see paragraph 10 above). While relying on the gravity of the charges and the inherent risk that he would abscond, they failed to give any assessment to the applicant's undisputed compliance with the investigator's summonses for more than a month prior to his arrest, as well as the absence of any attempts from his side to influence the course of the investigation in any manner (see, conversely, Pavl\u00edk v.
