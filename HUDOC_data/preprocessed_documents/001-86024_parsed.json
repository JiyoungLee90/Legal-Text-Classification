It was noted, in particular, that SG had used his gun in accordance with instructions, had targeted the wheels of the car and had had recourse to his firearm only after the driver had committed a crime by hitting one of his colleagues. The driver, RM, had apparently been predisposed to escape by any means, threatening the safety of other people.

He had fired the shots after the driver had hit his colleague RZ, that is, after he had committed an offence punishable by the criminal law (Article 201-1 \u00a7 2 of the old Criminal Code), of which he had already been convicted.

The prosecution took account of RZ\u2019s statement that he had been hit by the car and thrown onto the bonnet and then the ground. For this reason the policemen could have reasonably considered it necessary to avert the danger which the car represented for other people, given in particular that RM had been drunk and had been seeking by dangerous means to escape arrest and punishment.",

The possible doubt in this respect is accentuated by the fact that no eyewitnesses to the chase were identified during the investigation. The Court therefore finds no obvious indication of danger posed by the escaping driver after he was trying to leave the site of the confrontation with the policemen.

It is conscious of the risks of imposing an impossible burden on the authorities (ibid.). Nevertheless, the risk to the lives of the car passengers, considered in the light of the absence of an immediate danger posed by the driver and the ensuing lack of urgency in stopping the car, points to a measure of impulsiveness in the way in which the police officers handled the situation.
