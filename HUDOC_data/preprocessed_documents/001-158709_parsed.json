On the latter point, they emphasised that the applicant\u2019s release on licence had caused much emotion not only among the victims\u2019 families but also, more broadly, within the local population, particularly because, on the one hand, on leaving the prison the applicant had given a speech in Basque stating that his joy at being free was not complete because the French State did not recognise the Basque\u00a0Country, and on the other hand, a few months later he had taken part in a demonstration in support of Basque prisoners, during which he had denounced the injustice of the situation of those political prisoners and stated that they should be released. According to the Government, therefore, the aim had been to prevent any act or comment likely to offend the victims\u2019 families and any further criminal activity. With reference to the judgment in the case of Leroy v. France (no. 36109/03, \u00a7\u00a036, 2 October 2008), the Government observed that in the Court\u2019s view, the legitimacy of the aims pursued by the interference should be assessed in the light of the sensitivity of the endeavour to combat terrorism and the need for the authorities to remain vigilant about acts liable to increase the attendant violence.",

As that aim required the person concerned to stand back from the offences which he had committed, it had not been disproportionate to expect the applicant to refrain from any circulation of writings or documents or any public speech amounting to commenting on or condoning offences which had offended large sections of the general public. Furthermore, regard should be had to the fact that the impugned obligation had been imposed on the applicant following his participation in a demonstration outside Agen Prison in support of Basque prisoners, which the domestic courts, availing themselves of their discretionary powers, had regarded as conduct incompatible with his rehabilitation as it had been liable to expose him to risks of recidivism and to cause public disorder. According to the Government, the obligation had been linked to the situation and conduct of the applicant, who had held a special position in the Basque terrorist organisation: owing to the influence of his words, it had been necessary to take precautions to ensure that others did not interpret his words and behaviour as a call to further violence.",

It observes, as stated by the Government, that the impugned measure was taken a few months after the beginning of the applicant\u2019s release on licence, following his participation in a peaceful demonstration outside Agen Prison in support of Basque prisoners who were held there, which participation had attracted media coverage. The Court also understands why, in that context, the judicial authorities might have feared that the applicant would place himself in a position conducive to possible recidivism. It therefore accepts, having regard to the situation prevailing in the Basque Country (see Association Ekin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048), that the restriction complained of pursued one of the aims listed in Article 10\u00a0\u00a7 2, namely \u201cprevention of disorder or crime\u201d.",
