The public broadcaster was obliged to support culture, science and education as well as to engage in the debate on matters of public concern. The main goal of these provisions was to prevent the commercialisation of programming and policy dictated first and foremost by commercial considerations. It was common knowledge in  that TVP had become increasingly commercialised. That had undermined its public-service rationale. It had often been the case that it had defined its policies primarily by reference to business efficiency rather than to its mission. Although gradual commercialisation of the programmes of public broadcasters could be said to be unavoidable, the laws on public television and radio, taken together with the fact that public broadcasters derived benefits from mandatory licence fees paid by all users, required keeping standards compatible with their public mission. Hence, actions taken by employees in order to enforce compliance with that mission should be afforded particularly strong legal protection.",

It is open to the competent State authorities to adopt measures intended to react appropriately and without excess to defamatory accusations devoid of foundation or formulated in bad faith (see Castells v.\u00a0Spain, 23\u00a0April 1992, \u00a7\u00a046, Series A no.\u00a0236, and Guja v.\u00a0Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a075). However, in the present case it was not asserted by the employer or later established by the courts that the applicant\u2019s comments had been devoid of any factual basis (compare and contrast De Diego Nafr\u00eda v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a046833/99, 14\u00a0March 2002, \u00a7\u00a040, where the Court found no violation of Article 10 of the Convention relying, inter alia, on the fact that the applicant\u2019s allegations lacked any factual basis). Moreover, not only the applicant\u2019s statements relied on a sufficient factual basis, but also, in part, amounted to value judgments, the truth of which is not susceptible of proof (see, for instance, Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR 2001-II; Soko\u0142owski v.\u00a0Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a048).",

The Court notes that the tone of the impugned statements was measured and that she did not make any personal accusations against named members of the management (compare and contrast, De Diego Nafr\u00eda v.\u00a0Spain, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-36). Furthermore, it is also relevant that the applicant\u2019s good faith was never challenged either by the employer or by the domestic authorities involved in the proceedings (see Guja v.\u00a0Moldova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a092\u201394, mutatis mutandis).",
