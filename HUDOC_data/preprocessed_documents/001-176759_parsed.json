While Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their rulings, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the ruling and must be determined in the light of the specific circumstances of the case (Ruiz Torija v.

However, neither during the appeal proceedings nor in the rectification proceedings did the Fifth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation consider the applicant\u2019s submissions, while concluding that the applicant did not have a right to compensation on the ground that her land was not controlled or in effect used by the University.
