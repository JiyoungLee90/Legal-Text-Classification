Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7 203, ECHR 2009). In the context of the review of a detainee person\u2019s continued detention pursuant to Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the proceedings must be adversarial and must ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties, namely the prosecutor vis-\u00e0-vis the detained person (see Nikolova v.

Taking into account these two principles, the Court has held that Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention does not require that a detained person be heard every time he lodges an appeal against a decision extending his detention but that it should be possible to exercise the right to be heard at reasonable intervals (see Alt\u0131nok, cited above, \u00a7 54, and Knebl v. the Czech Republic, no. 20157/05, \u00a7 85, 28\u00a0October 2010).",

Similarly, in a case where a defence lawyer had been ordered to leave the courtroom while the prosecutor remained and made further submissions in support of a detention order, the Court held that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected, despite an oral hearing having been held before the appeal court (see W\u0142och v.
