That person must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.

Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (ibid., \u00a7 143, with further references). In this respect, the Court has underlined that defamation laws, with their emphasis on honour and reputation, inevitably involve a degree of vagueness, and that this does not remove their \u201clegal\u201d character for purposes of Article 10 of the Convention (see Busuioc v.

The principal argument relied on by the applicant company in its submissions before the Court was that the concept of \u201cnegative information\u201d was not defined by the domestic law and was too vague. The Court notes the applicant company\u2019s indication that Article\u00a0277 \u00a7 3 of the Civil Code had been repealed in 2014 because, inter alia, the concept had been found to be problematic (paragraph 32 above). However, it observes that the information that was broadcast in the present case was about irrational and dangerous behaviour attributed to an on-duty police officer. Since the police officer concerned was named in the fourth broadcast (paragraph 13 above), the applicant company cannot pretend that it could not foresee that the domestic courts might find such information harmful to his reputation and therefore negative, and that, by broadcasting the information, it was risking a claim for retraction being filed against it under Article 277 of the Civil Code.",
