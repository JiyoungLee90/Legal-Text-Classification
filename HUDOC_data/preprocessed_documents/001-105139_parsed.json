The Court observes that in the present case the applicant did not provide any information or supporting documents in respect of his claim under the pecuniary damage head. Therefore, the Court rejects the applicant\u2019s claim in that part. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress and frustration as a result of the violation of his right to a fair trial.
