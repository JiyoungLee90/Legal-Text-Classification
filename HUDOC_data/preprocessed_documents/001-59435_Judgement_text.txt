The case originated in an application (no. 44970/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Luigi Arganese (“the applicant”), on 18 September 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. La Brocca and Mr S. Rando, two lawyers practising in Benevento. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 9 December 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1958 and is currently residing in Bucciano (Benevento). Until 1991, the applicant was a member of the Bucciano Town Council (Giunta municipale di Benevento).
On an unspecified date the Benevento Public Prosecutor’s Office commenced criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of aggravated abuse of public authority (abuso d’ufficio) in the course of his duties as a member of the Town Council.
On 28 June 1993 the Benevento Public Prosecutor requested that the applicant and nineteen other persons be committed for trial. By an act filed with the Registry on 29 June 1993, the Benevento investigating judge scheduled the date of the preliminary hearing for 1 March 1994. This act was subsequently served on all the accused, who were thus informed of the charges brought against them.
The preliminary hearing was adjourned until 20 September 1994. In an order of the same day, the investigating judge committed the applicant and eighteen other persons for trial, commencing on 18 May 1995 before the Benevento District Court. A new charge of forgery was brought against the applicant and four of his co-accused.
The hearing of 18 May 1995 was adjourned because the lawyers of the Benevento Bar association were on strike until 27 May 1995.
On 11 April 1996 the District Court declared that the order committing the accused for trial was null and void and ordered that the case-file be returned to the investigating judge.
On 18 June 1996 the Benevento investigating judge issued a fresh committal for trial and fixed the hearing before the Benevento District Court at 12 December 1996. On that date the proceedings were adjourned by reason of a legitimate impediment of one of the accused and of two lawyers.
On 14 April 1997 the District Court, observing that the order fixing the date of the hearing had not been served on some of the accused, adjourned the case until 20 October 1997. This hearing was subsequently postponed at the request of some of the accused.
On 15 January 1998 some witnesses were examined and the parties presented their final pleadings.
In a judgment of the same day, filed with the registry on 29 January 1998, the District Court acquitted the applicant and all his co-accused. This decision became final on 1 April 1998.
