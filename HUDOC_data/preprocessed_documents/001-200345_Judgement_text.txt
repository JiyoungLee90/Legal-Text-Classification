The case originated in two applications (nos. 43444/15 and 53441/15) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Hungarian nationals, Mr T. Kruchió (“the first applicant”) and Mr L. Lehóczki (“the second applicant”), on 28 August 2015 and 21 October 2015 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Ms L. Lakatos, a lawyer practising in Miskolc, and Mr A. Kovács, a lawyer practising in Szeged. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 8 December 2017 and 13 March 2018 the Government were given notice of the applications.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. Having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The first applicant was born in 1967 and is currently detained in Szeged.
On 26 September 2003 the Csongrád County Regional Court convicted the first applicant of premeditated murder, robbery and misuse of firearms. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of release on parole.
On 25 May 2004 the Szeged Court of Appeal upheld the judgment.
Following the Court’s judgment in the case of Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, ECHR 2013 (extracts)), the applicant lodged a request for review with the Kúria, arguing that his whole-life sentence constituted a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.
On 26 March 2015 the Kúria dismissed the application on the grounds that the Court’s judgment did not concern a decision or proceedings against the applicant, and Hungary had not been a party to the proceedings before the Court. It also pointed out that the domestic legislation had changed with the introduction of the “mandatory pardon procedure” (kötelező kegyelmi eljárás) for convicts serving whole-life sentences.
The second applicant was born in 1955 and is currently serving his prison sentence in Szeged.
On 9 December 2004 the Heves County Regional Court convicted the second applicant of aggravated murder. He was sentenced to whole-life imprisonment with no possibility of release on parole.
On 21 April 2006 the Budapest Court of Appeal upheld this judgment.
