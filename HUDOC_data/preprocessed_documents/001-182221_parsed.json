The appellate court noted that the first-instance court had not taken into account that criminal proceedings against Mr S. in connection with the negligent performance of his duties had not been instituted only on the formal ground that the pecuniary damage inflicted on the claimant company by his actions had been below the statutory limit established in Article 293 of the Russian Criminal Code.

The appellate court considered it established that the company had proven the circumstances in which it had sustained pecuniary losses in the amount of RUB 96,312, and awarded the company the full amount claimed in respect of pecuniary damage, as well as RUB 8,619.42 for costs and expenses to be recovered from the Russian Ministry of the Interior at the expense of the Federal Treasury.

On the other hand, the sole owner of a company can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in so far as the impugned measures taken in respect of his or her company are concerned, because in the case of a sole owner there is no risk of differences of opinion among shareholders or between shareholders and a board of directors as to the reality of infringement of Convention rights or the most appropriate way of reacting to such infringement (see Ankarcrona v.

They pointed out that the domestic commercial courts had examined the applicant\u2019s relevant claim and had explicitly acknowledged, at two higher levels of jurisdiction, that the negligent actions of Mr S., the investigator in charge of the criminal case concerning misappropriation of property belonging to the applicant\u2019s company, had resulted in the loss by the company of that property, and had awarded it compensation for pecuniary damage as well as reimbursement of costs and expenses. As regards the awarded amount, the Government argued that the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasus Circuit was justified in reducing the initial amount awarded to the applicant\u2019s company; the new amount had been calculated on the basis of the price at which the applicant\u2019s company had intended to sell the sugar before it had been lost, and had taken into account the intended profit. The Government also pointed out that the applicant\u2019s company had not alleged before the commercial courts that it had sustained any non-pecuniary damage in connection with the investigator\u2019s negligence and had not lodged a claim to that end; it had only sought compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of damage to its business reputation, which claim had been rejected in the absence of any causal link with the established negligence. The Government further stressed that the awarded amounts had been paid to the applicant\u2019s company in full. Lastly, they argued that Akvilon had received back the equivalent of the amount of sugar lost, as on 6 August 2002 it had been transferred to the company for safe storage.

The Court further notes that the original amount awarded to the applicant\u2019s company in respect of pecuniary damage by the Appellate Instance of the Commercial Court of the Stavropol Region on 30 November 2004 was then reduced by the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasus Circuit in its decision of 10 March 2005.

Moreover, a delay of less than one year in payment of a monetary judicial award is in principle compatible with the Convention, while any longer delay is prima facie unreasonable (see Gerasimov and Others v.

The Court observes that what is at stake in the present case is the delayed enforcement of the monetary award made by the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasus Circuit dated 10 March 2005, which remained unenforced until 4 July 2007, that is for more than two years.

It reiterates that where a judgment is against the State, the State must take the initiative to enforce it (see, for instance, Akashev v. Russia, no. 30616/05, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, 12 June 2008).

In the present case, the documents submitted by the applicant reveal that, in so far as the applicant sought reimbursement of the costs and expenses incurred at the domestic level, the costs related to the proceedings concerning the investigator\u2019s negligence were awarded to the applicant by the relevant decisions of the domestic commercial courts. The Court thus rejects this part of her claim. It further takes into account the Government\u2019s argument and considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR\u00a010 covering costs for the proceedings before the Court.",
