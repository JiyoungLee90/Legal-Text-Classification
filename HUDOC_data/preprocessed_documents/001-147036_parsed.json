The applicant specifically relied on the statement by witness O. L., who claimed that after the GAZ-66 truck driven by the applicant\u2019s daughter had been hit by a mortar, FSB officers had got in touch with the military and asked them to cease fire; the decision of the District Court of 14 April 2008 which pointed out the need to identify the person who had given the order to use heavy weapons without precisely calculating the target area or ensuring that the relevant area had been cordoned off beforehand; and the instructions issued by the head of forensics at the Investigative Committee on 4\u00a0July 2011, who requested the investigator to question all the FSB officers who had been involved in the events of 7\u00a0June 2003, since it followed from a number of witness statements that it had been FSB officers who had asked unidentified individuals for mortar fire support, and it had subsequently been at their request that the mortar shelling had been stopped. The applicant further submitted, with reference to the statement by witness S. M., that the version of events implying the involvement of members of the illegal armed group in the mortar fire had been abandoned. The applicant thus believed that it had been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the authorities had been responsible for the mortar fire on the Dyshne-Vedeno-Kharachoy road on 7\u00a0June 2003 resulting in the death of her daughter. The applicant further argued that the use of heavy ordnance in peacetime and with no precautions taken did not comply with the extent of diligence expected from lawenforcement bodies in a democratic society. Even if it were accepted that the operation had pursued a legal objective, by no means could it be agreed that the operation itself had been planned and carried out with due concern for the lives of civilians.

She submitted that the initial investigation had lasted from 7\u00a0June to 7 August 2003. During these two months the investigator had questioned her and granted her victim status in the proceedings and had sent out a number of requests, following which the investigation had been suspended. There had been no investigative activity between August 2003 and December 2006. The cooperation between the investigative and other State authorities had been insufficient. In particular, none of the requests addressed by the investigator to the military prosecutor, the central archives of the Ministry of Defence, the temporary district police, the commander of the UGA or the district military commandant with a view to establishing whether the mortar batteries used on 7 June 2003 belonged to the military units and divisions deployed in the Vedenskiy District had led to results capable of shedding light on the events in question. The applicant further pointed out that it had taken the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office nine months to comply with the court\u2019s decision of 14\u00a0April 2008 instructing it to resume the investigation. The decisions suspending the investigation had contained very scarce information as to the evidence collected. The applicant had had a feeling that the investigation process had been a mere formality with a predictable outcome, since over a span of several years the investigating authority had failed to carry out all the possible investigative measures that could have been taken in the absence of the accused. Not all eyewitnesses had been identified and questioned. The official who had given the order to use mortars without a precise calculation of the target area or cordons being formed around that area beforehand had also not been identified. As a result, many issues remained unascertained. Lastly, the applicant had been completely denied access to the case file until 2010. In view of the foregoing, the applicant concluded that the domestic authorities had not complied with their procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention.",

In the afternoon the operational investigative group went to the village to carry out investigative measures. When they had been completed, on the way back to Vedeno one of the vehicles carrying the members of the operational investigative group was blown up by an explosive device hidden by the road. The operational investigative group was subsequently subjected to shelling from automatic firearms coming from the forested area. The federals opened fire and called for reinforcements. After the reinforcements arrived, mortar shelling of the nearby area began. The mortars fired at the forested slopes exploded at the roadside near the scene of the explosion. One of them hit a GAZ-66 truck travelling in the direction of Kharachoy and killed the driver, the applicant\u2019s daughter.

Furthermore, none of the FSB officers who might have confirmed having asked for mortar fire support had been questioned.

These tasks were complicated by the fact that by 2006 to 2007 most of the witnesses and officers of the investigative group no longer served in the Vedenskiy District ROVD, Prosecutor\u2019s Office or UFSB, and, above all, by the fact that the events in question had happened too long ago for the witnesses to be expected to give sufficiently reliable statements. No attempt was made by the investigating authority to reconcile contradictions in the witness statements regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of the applicant\u2019s daughter and the nature of the firing. For example, while witness V. N. claimed that the applicant\u2019s daughter had stopped the truck as the road under shelling was blocked by the APC, witness O. L. claimed that the applicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s truck had continued past the shelling until a mortar exploded next to it (compare paragraph 37 and paragraphs 39 above).

The latter approach is exercised by the Court in view of the continuous nature of the psychological suffering of the applicants whose relatives disappeared and the applicants\u2019 inability for a prolonged period of time to find out what happened to them (see Udayeva and Yusupova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a036542/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-83, 21 December 2010, with further references).
