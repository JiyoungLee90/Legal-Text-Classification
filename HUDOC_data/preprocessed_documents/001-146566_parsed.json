In August 2008 a murder was committed there and the applicant was one of the suspects. In December 2008 he was taken to the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Central police station for questioning. According to him, he was told to confess to the murder and was ill-treated after refusing to do so. On 21 January 2009 the applicant was taken to the police station detention facility again. Since he refused to make a confession, he was subjected to such acts of violence as being struck and slapped all over, and was detained in a very cold cell. As a result, he attempted to commit suicide by cutting the veins in his wrist. On 23\u00a0January 2009 he was taken to hospital for medical treatment where, according to the documents in the case file, he was seen by a doctor and given stitches and a bandage. After returning from hospital the ill-treatment continued and intensified. According to the applicant, his arms and feet were tied together behind his back and he was suspended on a metal bar placed on two chairs. He was left in that position until he fainted. As a result, his right hand became numb and stopped functioning. He was also beaten on his lower back with a plastic bottle full of water. As a result, he suffered kidney pain and had blood in his urine. The Government disputed the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning ill-treatment.",

Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions, and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 \u00a7 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see Selmouni v.

Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 61, Reports 1996VI; Selmouni cited above \u00a7 87). Where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been ill-treated or tortured while at the hands of agents of the State, the notion of an \u201ceffective remedy\u201d entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, and without prejudice to any other remedy available in domestic law, a thorough and effective investigation. The kind of investigation that will achieve those purposes may vary according to the circumstances. However, whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged. Even when, strictly speaking, no complaint has been made, an investigation must be started if there are sufficiently clear indications that torture or ill-treatment has been used (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zbey v. Turkey (dec.), no. 31883/96, 8 March 2001). The authorities must take into account the particularly vulnerable situation of victims of torture and the fact that people who have been subjected to serious ill-treatment will often be less ready or willing to make a complaint (see Aksoy cited above \u00a7\u00a7 97-98).",

The initial diagnosis concerning the laceration to the applicant\u2019s ligament as a result of his cutting his wrist, made by a medical assistant from the police station detention facility, was not confirmed. The applicant\u2019s condition, which was not disputed by the Government, appeared to be consistent with his allegations concerning being tied up and suspended from a metal bar. Since the Government have failed to provide an explanation for this injury, the Court concludes that it was the result of ill-treatment while in police custody, namely a result of being tied up and suspended.",

In such circumstances, the Court considers that the violence inflicted upon the applicant was of a particularly serious nature, capable of provoking severe pain and cruel suffering, and that it falls to be treated as acts of torture. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention under its substantive head.",

In fact, the prosecutor\u2019s office did not undertake any decisive steps to investigate the applicant\u2019s complaint but was content to accept, without reservation, the statements of the accused police officers. It is therefore impossible for the Court to conclude that an effective official investigation took place. Thus, there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its procedural head as well.",
