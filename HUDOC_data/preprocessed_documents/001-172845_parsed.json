The court stated that V.V. had expressed a wish for his property rights to be restored to him in natura. The court also established that V.V. had been aware of the fact that there was no possibility of returning the land to him in natura because it was already being used by other people. V.V. had been asked several times by the national authorities to choose another form of restitution but he had insisted on restitution in natura. The court held that the national authorities had failed to inform V.V. about the time-limit for choosing the form of restitution, as the domestic law provided for such information to be sent before 1 March 2003 and the letter had only been sent to V.V. on 27 March 2003. The court however observed that that circumstance was not of major significance because V.V. had written on 1 March 2003 that he would never change his mind about the form of restitution. After V.V. had died, the applicant had been asked to choose the form of restitution but had persisted in asking to have the land returned to her in natura or to be provided with a plot of equivalent value. The court also held that the applicant had misinterpreted the provisions of the domestic law because she had required that she be provided with a plot of land of equivalent value and a preliminary agreement, and had stated that only then would she sign a document on the transfer of land. That had been contrary to the procedure established in the domestic law. The court also considered that although at some point the applicant had indicated that providing her with a plot of land of equivalent value was an alternative way to restore her property rights, she had tied that form to her own rules and requirements, which were not possible under the domestic law. The court further observed that the national authorities had decided to pay the applicant monetary compensation as the form of restitution. Lastly, the court held that the applicant\u2019s argument as to the amount of compensation was unsubstantiated because she had not provided specific arguments proving that the amount of compensation had been determined in breach of domestic requirements.",

This logic applies to such fundamental changes of a country\u2019s system as the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democratic form of government and the reform of the State\u2019s political, legal and economic structure, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation (see Pyrantien\u0117, \u00a7 46; and Pauk\u0161tis, \u00a7 80, both cited above,).",

This approach is not unreasonable. Moreover, although there was a possibility of providing her with a plot of land of equivalent value, the applicant had made it impossible for the authorities by tying that form of restitution to her own rules and requirements. In particular, the applicant firstly asked the authorities to conclude a preliminary agreement, which was not provided for by domestic law, and, secondly, asked to be provided with a plot of land before she had signed the document on the transfer of land, which the authorities were also unable to do (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). As a result, the authorities took the only decision possible \u2013 they themselves chose what form restitution should take. They were only required to take such measures as were appropriate to provide compensation for the applicant as set out in the domestic law.

It is true that in restitution proceedings the executive authorities are required in particular to carry out a complex set of actions under the domestic legislation on restitution of property, rather than to perform a clear one-off act, such as payment of a particular amount of money (see Nekvedavi\u010dius v.\u00a0Lithuania, no. 1471/05, \u00a7 62, 10\u00a0December 2013). It follows that certain impediments to the realisation of the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions are not in themselves open to criticism (see Aleksa v. Lithuania, no. 27576/05, \u00a7 86, 21\u00a0July 2009, Igarien\u0117 and Petrauskien\u0117 v. Lithuania, no. 26892/05, \u00a7 58, 21 July 2009, and Pauk\u0161tis, cited above, \u00a7 84). Even so, the Court has emphasised that that uncertainty \u2013 be it legislative, administrative or arising from the practices applied by the authorities \u2013 is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State\u2019s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Pauk\u0161tis, cited above, \u00a7 84).",
                                                "elements": []
                                            },

                                                "content": "71.\u00a0\u00a0In the present case the Court finds that the restitution process was indeed long. Active steps towards the restitution of V.V.\u2019s property rights began in 1999 (see paragraph 8 above) and compensation was paid to the applicant in 2016 (see paragraph 27 above). The restitution process thus lasted for around seventeen years. In this context, the Court notes that the authorities claimed there had been a mistake with the information they had given to the applicant that compensation had been paid (see paragraph\u00a027 above) and the Court finds such a mistake regrettable. However, in the first place, the Court does not consider that that mistake had a major impact on the overall length of the restitution process. Moreover, V.V., and later the applicant, contributed to a large extent to making the process protracted. Firstly, they kept changing their minds about the form of restitution (see paragraphs\u00a010-11, 14-15 above). In addition, although V.V. and the applicant stated that they did not understand why the authorities kept asking her to make a new choice on the form of restitution, the Court observes that the authorities based their requests on the provisions of the domestic law and that both V.V. and the applicant failed properly to express their wish on that issue. Secondly, although the decision to restore V.V.\u2019s property rights by paying monetary compensation was taken by the relevant authorities on 13 May 2008 and the applicant was duly informed, she failed to provide all the relevant documents to the notary, which would have allowed her to inherit the money. In particular, the Court cannot understand why it took the applicant eight years to make a request to the authorities for that money. It also appears that the applicant only started contacting the authorities after the case had been communicated to the Government. In that regard, the Court notes that as soon as the applicant provided the authorities with the relevant documents and her account number, they fulfilled their duty and paid the applicant her compensation (see paragraph\u00a027 above).",
