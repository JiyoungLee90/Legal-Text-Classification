Yet it appears that the flat was never visited by the prosecutor or the investigating police officers, let alone by any scene of crime experts. In this connection the Court is unable to understand how it is, as suggested by the Government (see paragraph 48 above), that photographing G\u00fclperi O.\u2019s body and \u201ccarrying out a crime scene investigation at the hospital\u201d might somehow be a substitute for a visit to the couple\u2019s flat where a fight had taken place.

That decision is not supported by any other evidence. No evidence exists, for example, to support the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that G\u00fclperi O. had taken an overdose because she had had an argument with O.O. Even the statement made by O.O. to the police officer does not mention that G\u00fclperi O. had taken an overdose, let alone her having done so because of the argument she had had with O.O. (see paragraph 10 above).

Nevertheless, when examined against the background of the serious failures in the investigation which are highlighted above and the misleading information provided by O.O. to the doctors \u2012 which should have generated serious doubts in the mind of the prosecutor about the suicide theory \u2012 the Court considers that a theoretical possibility is not sufficient to support the prosecutor\u2019s decision. To this end the Court must also draw attention to the conclusion reached in the above-mentioned reports that the cause of G\u00fclperi O.\u2019s death could not be established (see paragraph 33). That conclusion, in the opinion of the Court, further undermines the prosecutor\u2019s conclusion that G\u00fclperi O. died as a result of a drug overdose.",
