In December 2010 the working group submitted its report (Skadest\u00e5nd och Europakonventionen, SOU 2010:87) to the Government. In the report it is proposed that the Tort Liability Act be amended in order to allow natural and legal persons to obtain damages from the State or a municipality for violations of the Convention. Such an action against public authorities would be examined by a general court which would need first to establish that a right provided by the Convention has been violated. The aim of the proposal is to provide a legal basis for granting non-pecuniary damages arising from disregard of the Convention, and to fulfil, together with the other already existing legal remedies, \u2019s obligations under Article 13 of the Convention.",

They also pointed out that the Svea Court of Appeal had, in a judgment dated 12 January 2006, concluded that there had been a violation of Article 8 and that non-pecuniary damages should be awarded on the basis of the principle established in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment NJA 2005 p. 462. In the Government\u2019s opinion, Swedish law thus provided a remedy in the form of compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage in respect of any violation of the Convention, including under Article 8, at the time when the application was lodged with the Court. The application was lodged with the Court one and a half years after the delivery of the first of the mentioned Supreme Court judgments and one year after the Svea Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment concerning Article 8 in particular.

While the Court welcomes the development in Swedish law concerning the possibility to claim compensation on the basis of alleged violations of the Convention, it must be kept in mind that this development is a rather recent one. Consequently, it cannot generally be required of an individual applicant to pursue a compensation claim in respect of Convention issues that have not been determined by the domestic courts or are not closely related to issues that have been so determined. The reason for this is that, in many of these cases, the existence of the remedy cannot yet be considered as sufficiently certain (see, for example, Bladh v. Sweden (dec.), no.\u00a046125/06, \u00a7\u00a7 23-27, 10\u00a0November\u00a02009 and Fexler v. , no. 36801/06, \u00a7 44, 13 October 2011).",

The Hague Convention is very clear in this respect. The alleged wrongfulness of a removal has to be assessed in the light of the circumstances present at the time of the removal and not with regard to subsequent developments. If the Swedish courts had ordered the prompt return of the applicant\u2019s child to  in 2005/2006 then all issues in relation to custody or residence could have been determined within that jurisdiction having regard to what was in her best interests. Having failed entirely so to do, it proceeded to assess the custody proceedings, some five years later, in the light of the passage of time and of the practical difficulties faced by the applicant in exercising his provisional rights of contact. On this basis, it concluded that the advantages of a change in the child\u2019s domicile would not outweigh the disadvantages since she had not seen the applicant for several years and spoke no Swedish. This approach, in our view, stands in marked contrast to the entire philosophy upon which  Convention is founded, namely, the prevention of a later decision on a matter being influenced by a change of circumstances brought about through the unilateral action of one of the parties.",

Switzerland we can accept that the return of the applicant\u2019s child to  some five years after her removal from that jurisdiction may not have been in her best interests. However, it does not follow that the failure of the Swedish courts to assess, at the relevant time, the alleged wrongfulness of her initial removal and, if necessary, to order her return, did not violate the applicant\u2019s rights under Article\u00a08.",

That failure, in our view, contributed significantly to the situation in which the applicant finds himself today.",
