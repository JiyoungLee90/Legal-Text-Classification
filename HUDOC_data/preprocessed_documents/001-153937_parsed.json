He was not aware of any agreement with the town council, which was headed by a mayor with xenophobic views. The only reason for such an agreement might be, according to him, the intention to expel young Uzbeks from Osh. He also mentioned that the peaceful life of his relatives in Kyrgyzstan referred to by the Moscow migration authority presupposed only that they had not been arrested on absurd grounds. They had been constantly subjected to discrimination on the ground of their origin and the Kyrgyz authorities had extorted money from them on account of the crimes of which he had been accused.

On 12 September 2013 the UNHCR replied that after the events of 2010 the Kyrgyz authorities had continued to prosecute and arrest ethnic Uzbeks. The only conviction against an ethnic Kyrgyz had been quashed recently by a higher court.

The Committee is gravely concerned by the case of Azimjan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek human rights defender prosecuted on criminal charges in connection with the death of a police officer in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, which has been raised by several Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (A/HRC/22/47/Add.4, para.\u00a0248; A/HRC/19/55/Add.2, para.\u00a0212). Mr.\u00a0Askarov has alleged that he was beaten severely by police on numerous occasions immediately following his detention and throughout the course of the criminal proceedings against him, and that he was subjected to repeated violations of procedural safeguards such as prompt access to a lawyer and to an effective, independent medical examination. The Committee notes that independent forensic medical examinations appear to have substantiated Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s allegations of torture in police custody, and have confirmed resulting injuries including persistent visual loss, traumatic brain injury, and spinal injury. Information before the Committee suggests that Mr.\u00a0Askarov\u2019s complaints of torture have been raised on numerous occasions with the Prosecutor\u2019s office, as well as with the Kyrgyz Ombudsman\u2019s office, and with Bazar-Korgon District Court, the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court. To date, however, the State party\u2019s authorities have declined to open a full investigation into his claims, relying on allegedly coerced statements made by Mr.\u00a0Askarov while in police custody that he had no complaints. The Committee understands that the State party is presently considering the possibility of further investigating these claims. The Committee is concerned by the State party\u2019s refusal to undertake full investigations into allegations of torture regarding other cases raised during the review, including those of Nargiza Turdieva and Dilmurat Khaidarov (arts.\u00a02, 12, 13 and 16).",

At least nine ethnic Uzbeks continue to languish in pretrial detention, some for a third year. New convictions in August 2013 of three ethnic Uzbeks in Osh, and pending extradition orders of at least six others in Russia again point to judicial bias against ethnic Uzbeks.",

As for the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant should have lodged cassation appeals pursuant to Chapters 47.1 and 48.1 of the \u201cCCrP\u201d, the Court observes that they have previously accepted that such cassation appeals did not have an \u201cautomatic suspensive effect\u201d and, thus, there was no obligation to exhaust that remedy (see Gayratbek Saliyev v. Russia, no. 39093/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049 and 58, 17 April 2014). As for temporary asylum, the Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. Given that the applicant\u2019s refugee status application was rejected, there is nothing to suggest that an application for temporary asylum would have been more successful. Even if such an application were granted, the remedy would be only temporary and thus could not afford redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention.",

In a previous case concerning extradition to Kyrgyzstan it found that in 2012 the situation in the south of the country was characterised by torture and other illtreatment of ethnic Uzbeks by law-enforcement officers. Such incidences had increased in the aftermath of the events of June 2010 and remained widespread and rampant, being aggravated by the impunity of lawenforcement officers. Moreover, the Court established that the issue ought to be seen in the context of the rise of ethnonationalism in the politics of Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the south, the growing inter-ethnic tensions between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, continued discriminatory practices faced by Uzbeks at the institutional level and the underrepresentation of Uzbeks in, amongst others, law-enforcement bodies and the judiciary (see Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited above, \u00a7 72). As is clear from the reports by UN bodies and reputable NGOs, in 2012-13 the situation in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan had not improved. In particular, various reports are consistently in agreement when describing biased attitudes based on ethnicity in investigations, prosecutions, condemnations and sanctions imposed on ethnic Uzbeks charged and convicted in relation to the events in the Jalal-Abad Region. They also agree about the lack of full and effective investigations into the numerous allegations of torture and ill-treatment imputable to Kyrgyz law-enforcement agencies, arbitrary detention and excessive use of force against Uzbeks allegedly involved in the events of June 2010 (see paragraphs 40-45 above). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the current overall human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan remains highly problematic (see, mutatis mutandis, Klein v. Russia, no. 24268/08, \u00a7 51, 1\u00a0April 2010).",

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a073, ECHR 2005I). It reiterates in this respect that where an applicant alleges that he or she is a member of a group systematically exposed to a practice of ill-treatment, the protection of Article 3 enters into play when the applicant establishes, where necessary on the basis of information contained in recent reports by independent international human rights protection bodies or non-governmental organisations, that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned. In those circumstances the Court will not then insist that the applicant show the existence of further special distinguishing features (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 132, ECHR\u00a02008, and NA.\u00a0v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 116, 17\u00a0July 2008). The Court considers that this reasoning is of particular relevance in the present case, where the applicant, an ethnic Uzbek, is charged with a number of serious offences allegedly committed in the course of the violence of June 2010 (see, by contrast, Makhmudzhan Ergashev, cited\u00a0above, \u00a7 73). Given the widespread use by the Kyrgyz authorities of torture and ill-treatment in order to obtain confessions from ethnic Uzbeks charged with involvement in the inter-ethnic riots in the Jalal-Abad Region, which has been reported by both UN bodies (see paragraphs 40-41 above) and reputable NGOs (see paragraphs 42-45 above), the Court is satisfied that the applicant belongs to a particularly vulnerable group, the members of which are routinely subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the requesting country.",

The applicant\u2019s arguments in respect of the risk of ill-treatment were not addressed at all (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above). As for the extradition proceedings, the Court is struck by the summary reasoning put forward by the domestic courts in respect of materials originating from reliable sources, such as reports by international organisations and respected NGOs. In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the issue of the risk of ill-treatment was subjected to a rigorous scrutiny in the refugee status or extradition proceedings (see Abdulkhakov, cited above, \u00a7 148).",

Moreover, it has not been demonstrated before the Court that Kyrgyzstan\u2019s commitment to guaranteeing access to the applicant by Russian diplomatic staff would lead to effective protection against proscribed ill-treatment in practical terms, as it has not been shown that the aforementioned staff would be in possession of the expertise required for effective follow-up of the Kyrgyz authorities\u2019 compliance with their undertakings. Nor was there any guarantee that they would be able to speak to the applicant without witnesses. In addition, their potential involvement was not supported by any practical mechanism setting out, for instance, a procedure by which the applicant could lodge complaints with them or for their unfettered access to detention facilities (see, mutatis mutandis, Nizomkhon Dzhurayev v. Russia, no.\u00a031890/11, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013233, 3\u00a0October 2013). There is no evidence that Russian diplomatic staff have visited any individuals in Kyrgyzstan after their extradition.
