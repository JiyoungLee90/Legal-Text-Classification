As those dissenters did not fail to stress, the economy of the Convention supports this construction of the term \"case\" (\"affaire\"): the system of the Convention would appear to be that it is for the Commission (exercising a judicial function) to make a final decision on admissibility and (exercising an advisory function) to express an opinion \"as to whether the facts found disclose a breach by the State concerned of its obligations under the Convention\" (Article 31) (art. 31), whereupon the question \"whether there has been a violation of the Convention\" (Article 32) (art. 32) shall be finally decided either by the Committee of Ministers or by the Court. The Court's later case-law enhances this argument based on the system of the Convention by admitting that it is the Commission's decision on admissibility which \"determines the object of the case brought before the Court\" and by considerably qualifying its above-quoted ruling on the extent of its jurisdiction by the words \"it is only within the framework so traced that the Court ... may take cognisance of all questions of fact or of law ...\" (my italics). But neither this acknowledgement nor the repeated stressing that the \"framework\" or \"compass\" of the case is decisively \"delimited by the Commission's admissibility decision\" has induced the Court to abandon the aforementioned doctrine. Yet it would seem clear that this doctrine is hard to reconcile with the delimitative force of the Commission's decision on admissibility!",

It is true that in 1971, when the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment was rendered, the Court may have felt some uncertainty as to whether or not the Commission held the same views as the Court with regard to the interpretation and the application of the principle of prior exhaustion of domestic remedies. But at that time the case-load of the Court was nearly non-existent, so that for practical purposes it would have been without any importance if the Commission were to have interpreted and applied Article 26 (art. 26) more leniently than the Court deemed fit. And now, nearly twenty years later - when the proper functioning of the Court would, having regard to its present case-load, be seriously endangered by such interpretation and application -, experience has taught that in this respect there do not exist serious differences of opinion between the Commission and the Court: in all those years the Court has only twice come to a conclusion that differed from that of the Commission!",

I refer again to the continuing and rather alarming increase in the Court's case-load which, were the Commission to become a semi-permanent body, would only become worse. This increase should, in my opinion, prompt re-thinking of accepted doctrines. Abandonment of the doctrine under discussion would result in a considerable saving of time and energy. This is because preliminary objections are argued before the Court in many cases and quite often raise difficult and therefore time-consuming questions: firstly it may be necessary to go very carefully over the files of the Commission to ascertain whether or not the objection has already been raised - in substance (!) - before the Commission; then, questions may arise as to the interpretation of the many subtly connected rules that we conveniently, but with some over-simplification, designate as the exhaustion rule; and, lastly, it may be necessary to go into intricate questions of domestic law and to make difficult factual assessments. Moreover, most of these questions will already have been answered by the other Convention organ, which has far more practice and therefore experience in this field than the Court. The time and energy spent on these questions could and should be devoted to the Court's specific task of ensuring the observance of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Convention.",

And even if somewhere reliance was placed on such an expectation, it would not seem to deserve protection: at least I cannot see that real State interests which are seriously worthy of protection would be harmed if the Court were to decide that, once the case is brought before it, respondent States would no longer be afforded an opportunity to escape from having to answer as to the merits.",
