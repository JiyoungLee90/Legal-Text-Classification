It added that, furthermore, the case file contained no details of the place and conditions of the initial interrogation conducted on 21 October 1980, or the actual conditions of the interrogation of 26 October. It pointed out that even though the accused had stated that the deceased was not \u201ca significant suspect\u201d the fact that agents of the MIT had participated in his interrogation suggested the opposite. In the opinion of the court, the treatment subsequently inflicted on the party concerned confirmed this argument. The Court of Cassation concluded that given that C.A. had been interrogated and tortured during his detention on the gendarmerie premises and up until 2\u00a0November by the accused and other persons whose functions had not been ascertained, the omissions in the investigation had to be remedied and, in particular, the gendarmes, the members of the MIT and any other persons present at the material time and place should be questioned.",

Four of these witnesses stated that they had seen C.A. naked, attached to the radiator, wet and trembling, with injuries to his hands and wrists. Two of them stated that officer F.I. had threatened them, pointing at C.A. and saying \u201cLook at what has happened to him; if you don\u2019t sign, the same thing will happen to you.\u201d\u00a0 A detainee who had been in the neighbouring cell stated that he had heard C.A. moaning constantly, that in the evenings they would take him away for questioning naked, and that officers M.C. and F.I. and three men in civilian clothing would beat him in the middle of the room as a lesson to the others. Another witness stated that he had seen F.I. and others beat C.A. with truncheons while he was lying on the ground in a pool of water, all the while continuing to spray him with water. He stated that he had heard the sound of a magneto (a magneto-electric machine) and the delirious voice of C.A. uttering the names of his children, unable to walk, his body covered in wounds. These eyewitnesses stated that they had generally had their eyes covered but that sometimes the blindfold had come off, or they had recognized the officers\u2019 voices. Four other detainee witnesses stated that they had seen that the applicant had been tortured, but did not know who had done it. The court considered that the testimony of the co-detainees was only partially credible given their status as detainees and the fact that they would normally have had their eyes covered. In the reasons for the judgment, the court observed that the leave records relating to M.C. kept by the gendarmerie command had been falsified and declared that his statements were not credible. As for F.I., the court pointed out an inconsistency between his statement of 31 August 1983 (see paragraph 19 above) and his subsequent statements. According to the court, the accused were indirectly responsible for the death of C.A. It added that \u201ca team of three civilians\u201d had also taken part in the interrogations, but gave no details of the identity, function or action of these three individuals. It concluded that it had not been definitively established that the accused had themselves tortured the deceased but that they had acted as accomplices to the illegal act by issuing orders (talimat vermek), by procuring the premises (yer tedarik etmek) and by failing to intervene [to prevent the illegal act] (g\u00f6z yummak). It found that the accused, together with civilians, had participated in the interrogation of C.A. and that the latter had died as a result of his pre-existing condition (\u00f6nceki hastal\u0131\u011f\u0131) and as a result of the torture inflicted by one or more of these civilians whose identity could not be established. The court sentenced M.C. and F.I. to two years and one month\u2019s imprisonment under Articles 243 and 452 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. The court accepted two mitigating circumstances to reduce the sentences: the personality of the accused as evidenced by the case file (dosyadaki ki\u015filikleri) and the fact that they were mere accomplices (fer\u2019\u00ee fail) rather than the main perpetrators of the crime.",
