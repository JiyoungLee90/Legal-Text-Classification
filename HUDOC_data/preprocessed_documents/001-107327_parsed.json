France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, \u00a7\u00a015, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v. Hungary, no.\u00a047940/99, \u00a7\u00a030, 20\u00a0July\u00a02004).",
