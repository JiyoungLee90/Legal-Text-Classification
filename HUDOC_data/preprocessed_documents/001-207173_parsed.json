It unanimously declared admissible the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning Article\u00a05 \u00a7 1 (as to the alleged lack of reasonable suspicion), Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03, Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4 (as to the alleged lack of a speedy review before the Constitutional Court) and Article 18 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01. It declared further complaints under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 inadmissible by a majority, and under Article 5 \u00a7 4 inadmissible unanimously. The Chamber found, unanimously, that there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 and of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention and that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and of Article\u00a03 of Protocol No. 1. It held by six votes to one that there had been a violation of Article 18 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7\u00a03. It also found, unanimously, that there was no need to examine separately the admissibility and merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention. Lastly, the Chamber held, unanimously, that the respondent State had not failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention and that it was to take all necessary measures to put an end to the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. The partly dissenting opinion of Judge Karaka\u015f was annexed to the judgment.",

A series of reforms aimed at improving the protection of human rights in Turkey were implemented. A delegation of members of parliament, including the applicant, made several visits to \u0130mral\u0131 island, the site of the prison holding Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the PKK, who had been convicted in 1999 of carrying out acts designed to bring about the secession of part of Turkey\u2019s territory and forming and leading a terrorist organisation for that purpose, and who had also called in 2013 for an end to the armed struggle. On 28 February 2015 the delegation, together with the then Deputy Prime Minister, presented the \u201cDolmabah\u00e7e consensus\u201d, a ten-point reconciliation declaration. The then Prime Minister stated that the consensus meant that significant steps were being taken towards halting terrorist activities in Turkey. However, shortly after the announcement, the President of Turkey said that it was out of the question that the government would reach an agreement with a terrorist organisation. That statement appears to have marked the end of the consensus. Subsequently, several weeks before the parliamentary elections of 7 June 2015, the Deputy Prime Minister made the following statement to the press: \u201cIf the HDP exceeds the threshold [for representation in Parliament] and the AKP government loses power, there will be no solution process.\u201d",

Nowadays, if you have enough experience to resist [and] prevail using non-violent methods, it is not morally [and] politically right to use weapons. Today, those who criticise us also say that the Kurdish people would not exist, at least in Turkish Kurdistan, without the PKK movement. You could not speak of the existence of Kurds in Turkish Kurdistan. Without the coup in 1984 [the year of the first PKK attacks], without the guerrillas, no one today could speak of the existence of the Kurdish people; the Kurds had no other choice. At the time of the initial resistance in \u015eemdinli [and] Eruh [the first terrorist attacks by the PKK, carried out in the \u015eemdinli district in Hakkari and the Eruh district in Siirt on 15 August 1984], no one was aware of what was happening but the resistance has today created [the] reality of the [Kurdish] people.

Furthermore, with regard to the \u201ctrench events\u201d, the Constitutional Court held that, bearing in mind the statements made by the applicant, the places where he had made them and his position as co-chair of the HDP, his pre-trial detention in connection with a terrorism-related offence was not devoid of justification. In the same vein, having regard to the contents of the two speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21 April 2013 (see paragraph 79 above), it held that there was undeniably an indication that an offence had been committed. Lastly, taking into account the contents of the conversations among presumed senior officials of the PKK and between them and the applicant (see paragraph 79 above), it found that it had been legitimate to consider that the applicant might have acted in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of a terrorist organisation.

Referring to several Constitutional Court judgments concerning the pre-trial detention of members of parliament, he had argued that his detention was disproportionate to the aim pursued, in view of his status as a member of parliament. In that connection, the Constitutional Court stated firstly that, contrary to what the applicant had maintained, it had never given a judgment in which it had found that the pre-trial detention of a member of parliament whose immunity had been lifted amounted in itself to a breach of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court further noted that as the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention a long time after the alleged offences had been committed, it had to examine whether or not his pre-trial detention could have been regarded as necessary. In that context, it pointed out that, in accordance with Article 83 of the Constitution, the applicant could not have been placed in pre-trial detention while he enjoyed parliamentary immunity. It observed that the investigation reports concerning him had been sent to the competent public prosecutors after the entry into force of the constitutional amendment introducing an exception to parliamentary immunity, and that he had been placed in pretrial detention some five months afterwards. It was therefore clear from the evidence in the case file that the investigating authorities had not remained inactive during that period. The Constitutional Court added that it was unable to conclude that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had been disproportionate and arbitrary, notably in view of the severity of the sentence prescribed for the offences in question.

In his opinion, the reasons why the application of an alternative measure to detention would have been insufficient had not been explained by the judicial authorities. Turning to the risk of absconding, he noted firstly that two main reasons had been put forward to substantiate that risk, namely the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for the offences in question and the fact that the applicant had refused to appear before the investigating authorities. In the dissenting judge\u2019s view, however, the severity of a sentence could not per se justify a person\u2019s pre-trial detention. Similarly, it could not be concluded that the applicant\u2019s refusal to appear before the investigating authorities could form a basis for establishing such a risk, since the applicant had continued to carry out his political activities without demonstrating the slightest intention of absconding. The dissenting judge added that between the entry into force of the amendment to the Constitution lifting the applicant\u2019s parliamentary immunity and the date of his initial pre-trial detention, the applicant had travelled abroad more than ten times and had never attempted to flee. For these reasons, he was of the view that there had been a violation of Article\u00a019 of the Constitution in the applicant\u2019s case. Noting in addition that the applicant was a member of parliament and co-chair of a political party that had obtained more than five million votes, the dissenting judge considered that his pre-trial detention without relevant and sufficient reasons also amounted to a breach of the right to be elected and to carry out political activities as safeguarded by Article 67 of the Constitution.",

The case concerned the pre-trial detention of Mr Balbay, who had been elected as a member of the National Assembly following the parliamentary elections held on 12 June 2011. On 5 August 2013, while his application was still pending before the Constitutional Court, Mr Balbay had been sentenced to sixteen years\u2019 imprisonment. In its judgment, the Constitutional Court found not only a violation of the right to liberty, but also a violation of the right to be elected on account of the excessive duration of Mr Balbay\u2019s pre-trial detention following his election (more than two years and one month, out of a total duration of four years and five months).

In that respect, neither the applicant\u2019s prosecution nor his pre-trial detention constituted an obstacle to his election as a member of parliament ... Since he was not provisionally released after his election, the applicant was unable to take the oath or to sit in Parliament. It is beyond doubt that the detention in question, which made it impossible to perform his parliamentary duties, constituted an interference with [the applicant\u2019s] right to be elected, because [the measure in issue] hindered all political activity and [the performance of his duties] as a member of parliament.",

Having been unreasonably kept in pre-trial detention, the applicant was unable to take part in legislative activities.

In case E. 2010/2839, K. 2012/1406 of 6\u00a0February 2012, the suspects who were constantly providing shelter to new candidates willing to become members of a terrorist organisation, providing them with falsified identity cards and introducing them to the organisation and looking for other new members for the organisation, were convicted for being members of an armed organisation. Acquiring a code name (within the organisation) in order to hide his/her real identity and hiding in his/her apartment a bomb delivered by the members of a terrorist organisation; giving courses on the aims and structure of the organisation to the new members, contacting again the organisation after having been released from prison and trying to collect money for the organisation and to find new members, delivering his/her \u2018CV report\u2019 to the organisation in order to become its member or driving new comers willing to become members of the organisation, to the camping place of the organisation, collecting money for the organisation under the guise of collecting tax for the organisation or organising the medical treatment of the new members before they were sent to the camping place of the organisation, etc. were all considered by the Court of Cassation as proving the membership of the defendant to an armed organisation under Article 314 of the [Criminal] Code, as the continuity, diversity and intensity of the acts attributed to the defendants showed that they were acting knowingly and willingly within the hierarchical structure of the armed organisation.",

Similarly, Freedom House in its 2015 Report on Freedom of Press in Turkey noted that \u2018Article 314 of the [Criminal] Code, with its broad definition of ... membership in an armed organization, continued to be invoked against journalists, especially Kurds and those associated with the political left\u2019. Also, Amnesty International, in its 2013 Report on Turkey, considered that conduct, which is not in itself criminal, as for instance an activity related to the exercise of the rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression, is considered as evidence of membership of the defendants in an armed organisation. The reason for this approach, according to the Report, is that the prosecution services perceive those activities as having the same overall objective as a terrorist group and as a result, \u2018individuals have been prosecuted for membership of terrorist organisation on charges relating solely to their engagement in peaceful and, in themselves, lawful pro-Kurdish activities\u2019. The examples of concrete cases provided by Amnesty International in which the evidence was considered to link the defendants to a terrorist organisation included, attendance at six different demonstrations allegedly organised by a terrorist organisation and a speech made at one of those demonstrations, or, in another case, the participation of the defendant in the \u2018Political Academy\u2019 organised by the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP \u2013 a recognised pro-Kurdish political party) and his diverse activities in the framework of this Academy.",

It is important to stress once again in this respect that the President will no more be a pouvoir neutre, but will be engaged in party politics: his choice of the members of the CJP will not have to be politically neutral. The remaining 7 members would be appointed by the Grand National Assembly. If the party of the President has a three-fifths majority in the Assembly, it will be able to fill all positions in the Council. If it has, as is almost guaranteed under the system of simultaneous elections, at least two-fifths of the seats, it will be able to obtain several seats, forming a majority together with the presidential appointees. That would place the independence of the judiciary in serious jeopardy, because the CJP is the main self-governing body overseeing appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplining and dismissal of judges and public prosecutors. Getting control over this body thus means getting control over judges and public prosecutors, especially in a country where the dismissal of judges has become frequent and where transfers of judges are a common practice. In this context it seems significant that the draft amendments provide for elections to the CJP within 30 days following the entry into force of the amendments and that the political forces supporting the amendments control more than three-fifths of the seats in the TGNA, enabling them to fill all seats in the CJP.",

A particularly disturbing manifestation of this situation is the lifting of the immunities of parliamentarians. In a move that the Venice Commission described as an ad hoc, \u2018one shot\u2019 and \u2018ad homines\u2019 measure, as well as a misuse of the constitutional amendment procedure, the majority in the Turkish Parliament lifted the immunities of 139 of its members who were subject to pending prosecution requests submitted to the Parliament. One of the most worrying aspects of this measure was the fact that the majority of impugned acts concerned statements made by these MPs, for example for insulting the President or other public officials, terrorist propaganda or incitement to hatred. The preamble of the constitutional amendment itself stated that its purpose was to address public indignation about, inter alia, \u2018statements of certain deputies constituting emotional and moral support to terrorism\u2019. As the Venice Commission highlighted, nearly all MPs of a particular opposition party, the HDP, were concerned by the measure. As a result of this measure, prosecutions are on-going against a large number of opposition MPs. Several members of HDP, including its co-Chairs, were arrested in November 2016. The Turkish authorities have stated that the reason of the arrests was the refusal of the MPs to comply with the order to personally appear before the prosecutor. However, even after having forcibly been made to give evidence, 11 MPs are still in prison and cannot carry out their parliamentary mandate at a crucial juncture.",

Accordingly, interferences with the freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament ... call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court.\u2019 The Commissioner also recalls the ECtHR\u2019s judgment concerning DTP, a precursor party of the HDP, which was unduly closed, mainly for statements of its members which were protected under Article 10.

If a political group was considered to be supporting terrorism, merely by advocating those principles, that would reduce the possibility of dealing with relate[d] issues in the context of a democratic debate and would allow armed movements to monopolise support for the principles in question. In the current climate, the Commissioner considers that the lifting of the immunities of MPs and their subsequent arrest and detention not only disenfranchised millions of voters, but sent an extremely dangerous and chilling message to the entire Turkish population, and significantly reduced the scope of democratic debate, including on human rights.\u201d",

The complaint had subsequently been amended with the addition of grievances relating to the pre-trial detention of the members of parliament concerned, and included allegations of violations of their human rights. They had complained above all of an infringement of their parliamentary immunity; they had also alleged a violation of their right to freedom of expression and freedom of association on account of the criminal investigations and proceedings instituted in respect of them, and had complained that some of them had been placed in pre-trial detention and that the criminal proceedings had been unfair. Subsequently, the IPU Committee had drawn up a number of reports and the IPU Governing Council had adopted decisions relating to the case. In particular, in April 2019 the IPU Governing Council had also asked the IPU Committee to continue examining the case on a regular basis in order to address the latest developments and concerns, and to report back to it in due course.

They provided an overall assessment of the lifting of parliamentary immunity, freedom of expression and association and the judiciary in Turkey. The applicant submitted that the decisions adopted by the UN Human Rights Committee or the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention were different in form and content from the IPU report and that the latter did not provide a basis for a legal determination of a violation of the relevant rights. The report in his case had criticised the Government for not allowing the IPU to visit the members of parliament in pre-trial detention, had also been critical of the prison sentences they had received and, noting that half of the members of parliament who had been detained and four of the five who had been removed from office were women, had highlighted the IPU\u2019s concerns that this state of affairs might weaken the representation of women within the National Assembly.",

Instead, the Court will focus its examination on whether the procedure before the IPU Committee is similar, in terms of its particular features and potential effects, to individual applications lodged under Article 34 of the Convention. To that end, it will carry out an assessment of the nature of the procedure before the IPU Committee in order to decide whether it satisfies the criteria set out above.",

In fact, as is indicated in the Rules and Practices of the IPU Committee, adopted in February 1989 and revised in May 2007, March 2014, April 2015 and April 2017, the IPU Committee objective is to defend the human rights of current and, in certain circumstances, former members of parliament generally whenever their rights are at risk or appear to have been violated. Its aims are to prevent possible violations, put an end to ongoing violations, and/or promote State action to offer effective redress for violations by doing \u201ceverything possible to foster a dialogue with the authorities of the countries concerned, first and foremost their parliament, in the pursuit of a satisfactory settlement\u201d.

It noted that he had first alleged a violation on that account when responding to the observations of the Ministry of Justice. Accordingly, pointing out in addition that the applicant could lodge a fresh individual application with it, the Constitutional Court decided not to examine this part of the application. However, the Court observes from the copy of his initial form that has been included in the case file that in paragraphs 21-30 of it the applicant expressly raised a complaint under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. In the relevant part, he first of all cited Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (paragraph 21). He then submitted that a person deprived of his liberty should be brought promptly before a judge and that the duration of his deprivation of liberty should not exceed a reasonable time (paragraph 22). He further contended that the severity of the potential sentence could not form the basis for establishing any risk of absconding (paragraph 28). In addition, he complained that no alternative measure to pre-trial detention had been applied (paragraph 29). Lastly, he complained that no specific reasons had been given to justify his pre-trial detention (paragraph 30). In those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s initial application set forth his complaints under Article\u00a05 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and those under Article 18 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. Contrary to the conclusions of the Constitutional Court, his subsequent observations therefore related not to a fact that had not been mentioned in his initial application, but to factual developments in the context of his continued pre-trial detention, (see, mutatis mutandis, Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, no. 15172/13, \u00a7 78, 22 May 2014).",

Moreover, on 4 January 2018, some two weeks after the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment, the Government submitted additional observations, in which they pointed out that the Constitutional Court had ruled on the applications brought by the applicant and another member of parliament from his party, Mr Ayhan Bilgen. After summarising the judgments in question, the Government submitted that the Court should declare the application by Mr Bilgen inadmissible as he had lost his victim status. However, in their additional observations they did not raise any objection of non-exhaustion in relation to the applicant. In other words, the Government did not raise a preliminary objection of this kind in their observations before the Chamber\u2019s decision on the admissibility of the application. Yet there was nothing to prevent the Government from raising their plea of inadmissibility concerning Article 5 \u00a7 3 and Article 18 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 before the Chamber, which ruled on the admissibility and merits of the application on 20 November 2018, more than eleven months after the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision. The Court therefore considers that the Government are in any event estopped from raising this objection at this stage of the proceedings (see Svinarenko and Slyadnev v.

Since the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had ended following his conviction in separate criminal proceedings, he could and should have brought a compensation claim on the basis of those provisions. In that context, the Government submitted that according to the well-established case-law of the Court of Cassation, it was not necessary to wait for a final decision on the merits of the case before ruling on a compensation claim lodged under Article\u00a0141 of the CCP on account of the excessive length of pre-trial detention.",

The Court\u2019s case-law in this area indicates that where the applicant complains that he or she was detained in breach of domestic law and where the detention has come to an end, a compensation claim capable of leading to an acknowledgment of the alleged violation and an award of compensation is in principle an effective remedy which needs to be pursued if its effectiveness in practice has been convincingly established.",

This protection also covered situations where members of parliament repeated and disseminated the contents of their opinions outside Parliament.

As stated in the explanatory memorandum on the constitutional amendment, it was brought forward because \u201cat a time when Turkey [was] waging the strongest and most intensive campaign against terrorism in its history, certain members of parliament, whether before or after their election, [had] made speeches voicing moral support for terrorism\u201d, which had \u201caroused public indignation\u201d (see paragraph\u00a056 above). The aim of the constitutional amendment was therefore to limit the political speech of the members of parliament in question, including the applicant. Following the amendment, the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor decided to merge thirty-one criminal investigations in respect of the applicant into a single case. The applicant was then arrested, on 4\u00a0November 2016. In its order given on the same day for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court relied mainly on the following evidence: the tweets published on behalf of the HDP central executive board and the events of 6 to 8 October 2014; the speeches in which the applicant had described certain acts by PKK members, such as digging trenches and putting up barricades in towns, as \u201cresistance\u201d; and the fact that he had participated in activities of the Democratic Society Congress (see paragraph 70 above).

In particular, it would be contrary to the rule of law for the discretion granted to the competent authorities to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. The law must therefore indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on them and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, \u00a7\u00a7 228 and 230, ECHR\u00a02015; Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, \u00a7 67, Series A no.\u00a082; Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 130; and Navalnyy, cited above, \u00a7 115). In that context, it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among other authorities, Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a026083/94, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-I, and Kar\u00e1csony and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0123).

The expression \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in the second paragraph of Article 10 also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the persons concerned and foreseeable as to its effects (see, among many other authorities, Rotaru v.

In the Court\u2019s view, a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable people to regulate their conduct; they must be able \u2013\u00a0if need be with appropriate advice\u00a0\u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. While certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos.\u00a021279/02 and\u00a036448/02, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2007-IV; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano, cited above, \u00a7 141; and Delfi AS, cited above, \u00a7 121). The criterion of foreseeability cannot be interpreted as requiring that all detailed conditions and procedures governing the application of a law should be laid down in the text of the law itself; it may be satisfied if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of domestic law are set out in enactments of lower rank than statutes. A law which confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with the requirement of foreseeability, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see Magyar K\u00e9tfark\u00fa Kutya P\u00e1rt v.

Indeed, this was one of his main arguments (see, in particular, paragraph 70 above). In that context, he lodged several objections with a view to securing his release (see, in particular, paragraphs 77 and 80 above). Furthermore, on 3 April 2018 he asked the Ankara 19th Assize Court to examine the speeches he had given in the course of parliamentary proceedings and to compare their content with that of the impugned speeches. To that end, he also requested that an expert be appointed to determine whether those speeches were protected under the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution (see paragraph\u00a091 above). However, it appears from the documents produced by the parties that no such examination was carried out. When ordering the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court quite simply observed that the constitutional amendment had had the effect of lifting the applicant\u2019s parliamentary immunity for the offences in question.

Next, taking into account a number of speeches by the applicant and the fact that he was the subject of several criminal investigations being carried out by the competent prosecuting authorities for terrorism-related offences (see paragraph 70 above), the magistrate concluded that there was strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of membership of an armed terrorist organisation (Article\u00a0314 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code). Furthermore, in view of the nature of the offence of forming and leading an armed terrorist organisation \u2013\u00a0of which the applicant was not accused until 11 January 2017, when the indictment was filed\u00a0\u2013 and the fact that it featured among the offences listed in Article 100 \u00a7 3 of the CCP, the magistrate found that there was also a strong suspicion regarding the commission of that offence (Article 314 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Criminal Code). Accordingly, the decision given on 4\u00a0November 2016 by the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court does not give a clear indication of which offence(s) formed the basis for the applicant\u2019s detention. This uncertainty was exacerbated by the decisions on the extension of his pre-trial detention. In its decision of 11 November 2016 the Diyarbak\u0131r 3rd Magistrate\u2019s Court stated that the applicant was being detained in connection with two offences: membership of a terrorist organisation and public incitement to commit an offence. Yet the Diyarbak\u0131r 1st Magistrate\u2019s Court stated in a decision of 6\u00a0December 2016 that the applicant was being detained only on suspicion of membership of an armed terrorist organisation.",

The qualifying criteria for a criminal organisation have been set out in the case-law of the Court of Cassation: such an organisation has to have at least three members; there should be a hierarchical connection between the members; they should have a common intention to commit crimes; the group has to display continuity in time; and the structure of the group, the number of its members, its tools and its equipment should be appropriate for the commission of the crimes envisaged. Regarding \u201cmembership of an armed organisation\u201d, the Court of Cassation takes into account the continuity, diversity and intensity of the acts attributed to the suspects in order to determine whether those acts prove that the suspect had an \u201corganic relationship\u201d with the organisation or whether the acts may be considered to have been committed knowingly and willingly within the \u201chierarchical structure\u201d of the organisation (see paragraph 160 above).",

To conclude otherwise would defeat the purpose of Article 5 of the Convention, namely to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty (see Alparslan Altan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0139).",

On the same day, the applicant was brought before the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court, which ordered his pre-trial detention. In making that order, the magistrate observed firstly that the constitutional amendment had had the effect of lifting the applicant\u2019s parliamentary immunity in relation to the offences concerned. He then observed that during the escalation of clashes between Daesh and the PYD in Syria in October 2014, the PKK leaders had issued several calls for people to take to the streets. He added that almost simultaneously, three tweets had been posted on behalf of the HDP central executive board, of which the applicant was a member and co-chair, likewise urging people to go out into the streets. The magistrate further noted that during the events of 6 to 8 October 2014, PKK supporters had committed a number of offences, and in particular had caused the death of fifty people, injuries to 678\u00a0others and damage to 1,113 buildings. In the magistrate\u2019s view, the tweets posted on the HDP Twitter account established a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of public incitement to commit an offence, in discharging his duties within the party in question. The magistrate further observed that the applicant had given several speeches in which he had described certain acts by PKK members, such as digging trenches and putting up barricades in towns, as \u201cresistance\u201d, and had participated in activities of the Democratic Society Congress. He added that the applicant was the subject of several ongoing criminal investigations by the public prosecutor\u2019s office, some of which concerned terrorism-related offences. In the magistrate\u2019s view, those facts were a sufficient basis for a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of membership of an armed terrorist organisation. The magistrate also noted that the offence of forming and leading an armed terrorist organisation \u2013 in connection with which the applicant had not been questioned \u2013 was among the offences listed in Article 100 \u00a7 3 of the CCP. Lastly, taking into account the significance of the case and the severity of the sentences prescribed by law for the offences in question, he held that the measure of pre-trial detention was necessary and proportionate and that alternative measures to detention appeared insufficient.",

Next, with regard to the \u201ctrench events\u201d, the Constitutional Court held that, bearing in mind the statements made by the applicant, the places where he had made them and his position as co-chair of the HDP, his pre-trial detention in connection with a terrorism-related offence was not devoid of justification. Thus, referring to the contents of two speeches given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 and 21 April 2013, the Constitutional Court observed that there was an indication that an offence had been committed in the case before it. Lastly, having regard to the documents seized during the search of A.D.\u2019s home and the contents of the conversations among presumed senior officials of the PKK and between them and the applicant, it found that it had been legitimate to consider that the applicant might have acted in accordance with the instructions of the leaders of an armed terrorist organisation.

Those items of evidence were not presented to the courts until after the indictment had been filed on 11 January 2017, more than two months after the applicant\u2019s initial pre-trial detention. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to examine the items of evidence in question in order to establish whether the suspicion giving rise to the initial order for applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was reasonable, given that they had no bearing on the decision issued on 4 November 2016 by the Diyarbak\u0131r 2nd Magistrate\u2019s Court.

In the three tweets in question, the HDP called for solidarity with the people of Kobani, who at the time were faced with a military offensive launched by members of the armed terrorist organisation Daesh. The Court is prepared to take into account the difficulties faced by Turkey on account of the threat posed by terrorist attacks, particularly in the aftermath of the crisis in Syria. During October 2014, the internal conflict in Syria posed a threat to national security in Turkey. It was against that sensitive background that the HDP posted the tweets in question, calling on the people to take to the streets. Such calls undoubtedly created a difficult situation, particularly in south-eastern Turkey. Indeed, a series of extremely violent incidents occurred after the calls were issued (see paragraphs\u00a023 and\u00a025 above). The Court nevertheless considers that these calls remained within the limits of political speech, in so far as they cannot be construed as a call for violence. The acts of violence that took place between 6 and 8\u00a0October 2014, regrettable though they were, cannot be seen as a direct consequence of the tweets in question and cannot justify the applicant\u2019s pretrial detention in relation to the offences in question.",

They may also offend, shock or disturb them. However, in the speeches in issue the applicant did not call for the use of violent methods and his statements certainly did not amount to terrorist indoctrination, praise for the perpetrator of an attack, the denigration of victims of an attack, a call for funding for terrorist organisations or other similar behaviour (see, for example, Yavuz and Yaylal\u0131 v.

Whatever the reason for this statement may have been, the Court accepts that it could be regarded as offensive, shocking, disturbing or polemical by a large proportion of the Turkish population. In this connection, it has previously found that the particular extent and impact of the terrorist activities of the PKK, led by Abdullah \u00d6calan, in south-eastern Turkey had undoubtedly created a \u201cpublic emergency threatening the life of the nation\u201d (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, \u00a7 70, Reports 1996-VI). However, as the applicant maintained, the comments were made in a specific context, namely the \u201csolution process\u201d, during which the national authorities had initiated negotiations with PKK leaders, including Abdullah \u00d6calan, with a view to finding a lasting, peaceful solution to the Kurdish question. The applicant explained that in making the statements in question, he had intended to say that those who were bringing about peace through the solution process deserved to have their success highlighted. In this connection, until the end of the \u201csolution process\u201d, no significant steps were taken against the applicant on account of those comments. Only after the end of the process, more than four years after the speech in question, did the judicial authorities find that it constituted a sufficient basis to justify the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, without seeking to ascertain what his intention had been. In the absence of any other grounds and evidence warranting such a measure, the Court is accordingly not persuaded that the speech given by the applicant on 13 November 2012 could justify a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question.",

Next, he stated that it was wrong to use weapons, since it was possible to resist and succeed using non-violent methods. He added that without the PKK movement, the Kurdish people would not exist in Turkey. The applicant\u2019s statements show that he believed that the Kurdish people in Turkey owed its existence partly to the armed struggle led by that terrorist organisation. This comment may be understood as a description of historical facts linked to the Kurdish question in Turkey, as interpreted by the applicant. It is true that in his speech the applicant referred to the \u201ccoup in 1984\u201d and the \u201cresistance in \u015eemdinli [and] Eruh\u201d as acts that had created the reality of the Kurdish people.

The Court considers, however, that this speech must likewise be set against the general background of the \u201csolution process\u201d, during which Turkish society openly discussed the origins of the Kurdish question. In the Court\u2019s view, the statements in issue can be seen as the applicant\u2019s assessment of the armed clashes in Turkey rather than as incitement to violence and glorification of terrorism.

The applicant disputed the authenticity of these records. He submitted in that connection that all his requests to have the authenticity of the recordings verified had been rejected by the Assize Court. With regard to the interception of telephone calls, the Court is aware of the importance of such evidence in the fight against organised crime.

In the present case, however, the domestic courts do not appear to have sought to verify the authenticity of the records presented by the public prosecutor. However, even assuming that the records are trustworthy, the Court considers that it cannot ascertain from the material in the case file whether the applicant did indeed obey the \u201cinstructions\u201d in question.

In particular, they had established that there was a risk of the applicant\u2019s absconding. In that connection, the Government submitted that several HDP members of parliament whose immunity had been lifted and who were under criminal investigation had fled abroad. On that account, and also in view of the potential prison sentence faced by the applicant (between forty-three and 142 years), it had not been unreasonable for the domestic courts to find that there was a flight risk. For example, the applicant had refused to appear before the investigating authorities despite the summonses issued by the competent public prosecutors. Moreover, since the start of the criminal investigation, the applicant had sought to obstruct the procedure, in particular by refusing to give evidence. He had attempted to slow down the criminal proceedings.

The legitimacy of an accused\u2019s continued detention had to be assessed in each case according to its specific features. In the applicant\u2019s case, the judicial authorities had displayed special diligence in conducting the proceedings, and had not been responsible for any inactivity or delays. Specifically, the public prosecutor had filed the bill of indictment approximately three months after the applicant\u2019s arrest, and the first hearing had been held on 7 December 2017, thirteen months after he had first been placed in pre-trial detention. The delays in the proceedings, which had resulted in prolonging the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty, had been caused by the transfer of the trial for security reasons, procedural issues linked to the merging of several criminal investigations, the applicant\u2019s requests for an extension of the time allowed to file defence submissions, his requests for judges to withdraw and his refusal to give evidence. Bearing in mind the complexity of the case, in which thirty-one separate criminal investigations in respect of the applicant had been merged together into a single case, the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention did not appear unreasonable to the Government in the context of a major terrorism-related criminal trial.",

In that context, the Government submitted, for example, that he had been able to submit written questions to the Council of Ministers, as he had done on 17 April 2018. He had thus been able to continue performing an important function in terms of scrutiny of the executive. The fact that it had become more difficult, if not impossible, for the applicant to exercise his rights as a member of parliament should be regarded as an unintended consequence of his pre-trial detention, and not as interference with the exercise of his right to sit in Parliament.",

The rights enshrined in Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention were not absolute. In particular, that Article did not preclude either the prosecution or the pre-trial detention of a member of parliament. The Government also reiterated their argument that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention had not been arbitrary. On the contrary, the question of his pre-trial detention had been examined on a total of twenty-three occasions between 17 November 2016 and 21 December 2017 in proceedings affording appropriate judicial safeguards against arbitrariness. The detention had had a legal basis and had pursued the legitimate aim of preventing the applicant from absconding. It had therefore been proportionate, bearing in mind the nature of his alleged offences. In that connection, the Government noted that the domestic courts, including the Constitutional Court, had held that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was necessary after weighing up his interests as safeguarded by Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01 against the interests of the proper administration of justice.

In this connection, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not preclude the imposition of a measure depriving a member of parliament or a candidate in parliamentary elections of his or her liberty. In other words, the imposition of such a measure does not automatically constitute a violation of that Article. Nevertheless, in view of the importance in a democratic society of the right to liberty and security of a member of parliament, the domestic courts must show, while exercising their discretion, that in ordering a person\u2019s initial and/or continued pre-trial detention, they have weighed up the relevant interests, in particular those of the person concerned as safeguarded by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 against the public interest depriving that person of his or her liberty where required in the context of criminal proceedings. An important element in this balancing exercise is whether the charges have a political basis (see Uspaskich v. Lithuania, no.\u00a014737/08, \u00a7 94, 20 December 2016). The Court\u2019s role is then to review the decisions of the national courts from the standpoint of the Convention, without taking the place of the relevant domestic authorities.",

In the present case, between 4 November 2016 and 24 June 2018, the applicant was unable to participate in the proceedings of the National Assembly as a result of his pre-trial detention. In other words, he was prevented from taking part in the activities of the legislature for one year, seven months and twenty days.

This interdependence is particularly pronounced in the case of democratically elected representatives who have been kept in pre-trial detention for expressing their political opinions. Members of parliaments represent their electorate and their freedom of expression therefore requires increased protection. In view of the importance it attaches to the freedom of expression of members of parliament, especially those from opposition parties, in line with the requirements of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, the Court considers that where the detention of a member of parliament cannot be deemed compatible with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, it will also breach Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01.",

Bulgaria [GC], no. 36760/06, \u00a7 143, ECHR 2012). Indeed, pre-trial detention is a temporary measure and its duration must be as short as possible. Those considerations apply a fortiori to the detention of a member of parliament. In a democracy, Parliament is an essential forum for political debate, of which the performance of parliamentary duties forms part (see, mutatis mutandis, Cordova (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a059). While serving their term of office, members of parliament represent their electorate, draw attention to their concerns and defend their interests.",

It has already held under Article 10 that the interference with the exercise of the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression, in the form of his pre-trial detention for expressing his views as a politician, was not \u201cprescribed by law\u201d in that it did not satisfy the requirement of foreseeability. It has found, in particular, that the domestic courts did not carry out any examination of whether the speeches in issue were covered by the applicant\u2019s parliamentary nonliability as enshrined in the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Constitution. It has also found that there was no reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence, as required by Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. These findings are equally relevant for the purposes of Article\u00a03 of Protocol No. 1. Indeed, the Court reiterates that parliamentary immunity is a privilege granted not to members of parliament on an individual basis but to the institution of Parliament, to guarantee its smooth operation (see Kart, cited above, \u00a7 53). In that context, if a State provides for parliamentary immunity from prosecution and from deprivation of liberty, the domestic courts must first ensure that the member of parliament concerned is not entitled to parliamentary immunity for the acts of which he or she has been accused. In the present case, however, although the applicant asked the Assize Court to examine whether the impugned speeches were protected under the first paragraph of Article 83 of the Turkish Constitution, the domestic courts did not carry out any such examination, thus failing to comply with their procedural obligations under Article\u00a03 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 70, 77, 80 and 91 above).",

In particular, they must ensure that the alleged offence is not directly linked to his or her political activity. In this connection, the member States\u2019 legal systems must offer a remedy by which a member of parliament who has been placed in detention can effectively challenge that measure and have his or her complaints examined on the merits. In the present case, however, the Government have been unable to show that the domestic courts with competence to review the pre-trial detention of the applicant performed a balancing exercise from the standpoint of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 when ruling on the lawfulness of his initial and continued pre-trial detention. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court did not examine whether the offences in question were directly linked to the applicant\u2019s political activities. In its judgment of 21 December 2017 it rejected as inadmissible the applicant\u2019s complaint that, given his status as a member of parliament, his placement in pre-trial detention was in violation of his right to free elections. In its recent judgment of 9 June 2020, it held that the lower courts had failed to consider the applicant\u2019s allegations that his continuing detention was unreasonable given his status as a member of parliament, the co-chair of a political party and a candidate in the presidential election, a finding that, as the Constitutional Court saw it, only concerned his complaint regarding the duration of his pre-trial detention. The Court concludes that the judicial authorities did not effectively take into account the fact that the applicant was not only a member of parliament but also one of the leaders of the political opposition in Turkey, whose performance of his parliamentary duties called for a high level of protection.",

He argued that the real reason for his detention had been the severity of his criticism of the policies pursued by the government and the President of Turkey. In that connection at a rally held on 7 March 2015, several months before the elections of 7 June 2015, the President of Turkey had stated: \u201c[G]ive me 400\u00a0members of parliament and everything will be settled peacefully\u201d, comments which the applicant saw as a call by the President for change to the country\u2019s constitutional system. In response, on 18 March 2015, at a meeting of his party\u2019s parliamentary group, the applicant had given a brief speech in which he had said: \u201cDear Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, we will not make you President, we will not make you President, we will not make you President\u201d. In the applicant\u2019s submission, this speech had quickly gone viral and had influenced the overall political climate in the run-up to the June 2015 elections, becoming a key HDP slogan and positioning the party and himself in direct opposition to the President. In that regard, the applicant submitted that the crackdown against members of his party had become more visible, notably after he had stated that he would never support a presidential system with Mr Erdo\u011fan as president.",

In addition, several sets of criminal proceedings were currently pending against him, all of them relating to his political activities. However, no criminal investigations had been instituted in respect of any AKP or MHP members of parliament, even though their parliamentary immunity had likewise been lifted. The criminal investigations \u2013\u00a0which in his view were political in nature\u00a0\u2013 had intensified following the end of the \u201csolution process\u201d. In that connection, the applicant noted that he had been the subject of forty-eight criminal investigations between 2007 and 2014 but that from 2014 until the lifting of his parliamentary immunity, a further forty-eight criminal investigations had been initiated in respect of him. The number of these investigations had to be viewed alongside the number of criminal investigations in respect of other members of parliament from his party. In that connection, according to statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice, as at 15 December 2015 a total of 330 investigation reports had been submitted to Parliament, including 182 relating to HDP members of parliament. Following the speech given by the President of Turkey on 2 January 2016 (see paragraph\u00a049 above), the number of investigation reports submitted to the National Assembly in respect of HDP members of parliament had almost tripled, with the result that as at 20\u00a0May 2016, the date on which the constitutional amendment had been adopted, there had been a total of 510\u00a0investigation reports relating to HDP members of parliament. The number of criminal investigations had thus increased following the speeches by the President, who had openly targeted HDP members of parliament as terrorist collaborators.",

Moreover, although it was natural that the applicant might have suspicions as to the real reasons for his continued detention on account of his role on the political scene, such suspicions could not suffice for the Court to conclude that the judiciary had been misused ab initio and that the domestic courts had consistently acted in bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention. The same applied to the statements by the President of Turkey and by the leaders of the ruling party concerning the applicant; such statements could not be regarded as proof of the existence of an ulterior purpose underlying a judicial decision unless it was established that the courts had not been sufficiently independent from the executive. However, no evidence had been produced in the present case to substantiate any such allegations, and the Chamber judgment had not corroborated them either, instead simply stating that the tense political climate in Turkey during recent years had created an environment capable of influencing the national courts. The Government, moreover, contested the Chamber\u2019s conclusion on this point. In their submission, the contention that the judicial authorities had reacted harshly to the applicant\u2019s conduct had scarcely been substantiated. On the contrary, in November 2017 and January 2018 the applicant had been acquitted following three sets of criminal proceedings instituted against him for incitement to hatred and hostility on account of insults directed at the government or the President and the Minister of the Interior. Furthermore, in a judgment of 11 July 2018 the court in Diyarbak\u0131r had awarded the applicant compensation under Article 141 of the CCP, finding that the courts had not examined of their own motion the question of his detention between 31 July and 3 October 2017. In addition, only eight of the fifteen HDP members of parliament who had been placed in pre-trial detention in November 2016 were still being detained.",

In this connection, in the light of the memorandum by the Commissioner for Human Rights following his visits to Turkey in 2016, the opinion issued by the Venice Commission on the amendments to the Constitution, the report by Amnesty International and the observations by the intervening third parties, the Court observes that in view of the applicant\u2019s role as one of the emblematic leaders of the political opposition in Turkey, the tense political climate since 2014 and the speeches by the applicant\u2019s political opponents, among them the President of Turkey, it is understandable that an objective observer might suspect that the applicant\u2019s initial pre-trial detention and its extension were politically motivated.

Further to this, fourteen members of parliament from the applicant\u2019s party, including both of its co-chairs, were placed in pre-trial detention. The Court observes that, contrary to what the applicant alleged, the Government maintained that the HDP members of parliament were not the only ones to have been convicted in criminal proceedings. In their submission, five members from the AKP, nine from the CHP and one from the MHP had also been convicted after their parliamentary immunity had been lifted. At the hearing on 18\u00a0September 2019, a specific question was put to the parties on this issue of contention. The Government, while repeating their argument, were unable to show that members of parliament belonging to the bloc of the ruling parties, namely the AKP and the MHP, had also been convicted and/or deprived of their liberty. Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence produced to support it, the Court is unable to give any weight to this argument by the Government. It therefore considers it established that members of parliament from the opposition parties, namely the CHP and the HDP, were the only ones to have been detained and/or convicted following the institution of criminal proceedings against them. In other words, members of the National Assembly from the opposition parties were the only ones who were actually affected by the constitutional amendment of 20 May 2016.",

Yet while debate was ongoing among the Turkish public about what was probably one of the most significant constitutional reforms since the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the applicant was in pre-trial detention, in breach of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 and Article 10 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol\u00a0No.\u00a01. As the Court has held, free elections and freedom of expression, and particularly the freedom of political debate, form the foundation of any democracy (see paragraph 383 above). This applies equally in the context of a constitutional referendum. In the Court\u2019s view, the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention undoubtedly prevented him from contributing effectively to the campaign against the introduction of a presidential system in Turkey.",

It observes in this connection that on 2 September 2019 the Ankara Assize Court ordered his release. Despite that decision, he remained in detention as a result of his conviction following the criminal proceedings in the Istanbul Assize Court. On 20 September 2019 the Istanbul 26th Assize Court ruled that the days spent by the applicant in pre-trial detention in connection with his trial in the Ankara Assize Court should be deducted from his final sentence. As a result of that decision, the applicant would have been eligible for conditional release. However, later that day and notwithstanding the criminal proceedings pending before the Ankara Assize Court, the Ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office applied to the Ankara Magistrate\u2019s Court to have the applicant and his fellow co-chair returned to pre-trial detention in connection with a separate criminal investigation initiated in 2014 concerning the events of 6 to 8 October 2014. Also on 20 September 2019, the Ankara Magistrate\u2019s Court, granting the public prosecutor\u2019s application, ordered the pre-trial detention of the applicant and the other former co-chair of the HDP. The following day, the President of Turkey made a statement to the press in which he accused the applicant of being the \u201ckiller\u201d of fifty-three people. He also said that he was following the matter and that the two co-chairs could not be \u201clet go\u201d (see paragraph 118 above). Accordingly, although the Istanbul Assize Court decided on 31 October 2019 to suspend the execution of the applicant\u2019s sentence of four years and eight months\u2019 imprisonment, he remained deprived of his liberty, this time as a result of his return to pre-trial detention.",

Considering these aspects together with the close temporal links between the applicant\u2019s release from detention, ordered by the Ankara Assize Court on 2 September 2019 (see paragraph 114 above) and the Istanbul 26th Assize Court\u2019s decision of 20 September 2019 (see paragraph\u00a0115 above), his immediate return to pre-trial detention on the same day (see paragraph 117 above) and the speech given by the President immediately afterwards (see paragraph 118 above), the Court is of the view that the domestic authorities do not appear to be particularly interested in the applicant\u2019s suspected involvement in an offence allegedly committed between 6 and 8 October 2014, some five years previously, but rather in keeping him detained, thereby preventing him from carrying out his political activities.",

In opinion no. 875/2017 on amendments to the Constitution, adopted at its 110th plenary session (see paragraph\u00a0162 above), the Venice Commission pointed out that under the new constitutional system, the President would have the power to appoint six of the thirteen members of the Supreme Council, the remaining seven members being appointed by the National Assembly. It noted in that connection that the draft amendments provided for elections to the Supreme Council within thirty days following the entry into force of the constitutional reform. The Venice Commission expressed the view that the proposed new composition of the Supreme Council was \u201cextremely problematic\u201d. It pointed out that under the new constitutional system, the President was not a neutral branch of power but belonged to a political faction. Furthermore, bearing in mind the prospect of the President\u2019s party enjoying a majority in Parliament, which was practically guaranteed under the system of simultaneous elections, the Venice Commission took the view that the composition of the Supreme Council would seriously endanger the independence of the judiciary, because it was the main self-governing body of the judiciary, overseeing appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary measures and the dismissal of judges and public prosecutors. It added that \u201c[g]etting control over [the Supreme Council] thus means getting control over judges and public prosecutors, especially in a country where the dismissal of judges has become frequent and where transfers of judges are a common practice\u201d. The reports and opinions by international observers, in particular the comments by the Commissioner for Human Rights, indicate that the tense political climate in Turkey during recent years has created an environment capable of influencing certain decisions by the national courts, especially during the state of emergency, when hundreds of judges were dismissed, and especially in relation to criminal proceedings instituted against dissenters.",

Lastly, they added that only eight of the fifteen HDP members of parliament who had been placed in pre-trial detention in November 2016 were still being detained. In the Court\u2019s view, the facts as set out by the Government might indicate that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State was not systematically misused and that the judicial authorities did not continually act in bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention in all cases concerning dissenting voices (see, mutatis mutandis, N\u0103stase v.\u00a0Romania (dec.), no.\u00a080563/12, \u00a7\u00a0109, 18 November 2014).

The applicant\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention not only deprived thousands of voters of representation in the National Assembly, but also sent a dangerous message to the entire population, significantly reducing the scope of free democratic debate.

In this connection, it has already considered that in the light of the various factual elements and their close temporal and substantive connection, taken as a whole, the authorities associated with the applicant\u2019s initial and continued pre-trial detention did not appear to be primarily interested in the investigation of his suspected involvement in an offence allegedly committed in 2014 (see paragraphs 426-433 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the ultimate aim of the judicial authorities was to deprive the applicant of his liberty notwithstanding the decision by the Ankara Assize Court ordering his release (see paragraph 93 above).The Government argued that the offences for which the applicant had been placed in pre-trial detention on 20 September 2019 (summarised at paragraphs 116 and\u00a0117 above) were different from those forming the subject matter of the present application because the latter concerned not only the incidents which had taken place from 6 to 8 October 2014, but also included \u201cacts and incidents\u201d indicated in several other investigation reports (see paragraph 415 above). Thus, according to the Government themselves, the detention order of 20 September 2019 also related to the incidents occurring between 6 and 8\u00a0October 2014, although it was framed in narrower terms than the charges leading to the applicant\u2019s initial detention. However, instituting new criminal investigations in relation to facts previously considered insufficient to justify detention, by means of a new legal classification, would make it possible for the authorities to circumvent the right to liberty.",

In particular, paragraph 3 of Article 43 provides that the Grand Chamber is to \u2018decide the case\u2019 \u2013 that is the whole case and not simply the \u2018serious question\u2019 or \u2018serious issue\u2019 mentioned in paragraph 2 \u2013 \u2018by means of a judgment\u2019. The wording of Article 43 makes it clear that, whilst the existence of \u2018a serious question affecting the interpretation or application of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, or a serious issue of general importance\u2019 (paragraph 2) is a prerequisite for acceptance of a party\u2019s request, the consequence of acceptance is that the whole \u2018case\u2019 is referred to the Grand Chamber to be decided afresh by means of a new judgment (paragraph 3). The same term \u2018the case\u2019 (\u2018l\u2019affaire\u2019) is also used in Article 44 \u00a7 2 which defines the conditions under which the judgments of a Chamber become final. If a request by a party for referral under Article 43 has been accepted, Article 44 can only be understood as meaning that the entire judgment of the Chamber will be set aside in order to be replaced by the new judgment of the Grand Chamber envisaged by Article\u00a043 \u00a7 3. This being so, the \u2018case\u2019 referred to the Grand Chamber necessarily embraces all aspects of the application previously examined by the Chamber in its judgment, and not only the serious \u2018question\u2019 or \u2018issue\u2019 at the basis of the referral.

It was therefore necessary to examine thoroughly all the written and unwritten constitutional limitations upon the exercise of the pouvoir constituant in Turkey, recognised in the domestic legal system.

In that connection, it follows from the Court\u2019s case-law that where the national authorities have awarded compensation to an applicant by way of redress for the violation found, the Court should examine the amount of the award (see Hebat Aslan and Firas Aslan v. Turkey, no. 15048/09, \u00a7\u00a044, 28\u00a0October 2014). In doing so, the Court will have regard to its own practice in similar cases and will consider, on the basis of the material in its possession, what it would have awarded in a comparable situation, although this does not mean that the two amounts must necessarily correspond. It will also take into account the circumstances of the case as a whole, including the type of remedy chosen and the speed with which the national authorities have provided the redress in question, given that it is primarily for those authorities to secure the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention (see Vedat Do\u011fru v. Turkey, no. 2469/10, \u00a7 40, 5 April 2016). Nevertheless, the amount awarded at national level must not be manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of the case under examination (see \u017d\u00fabor v. Slovakia, no.\u00a07711/06, \u00a7 63, 6 December 2011). In the present case, the Constitutional Court held, on the basis of its findings of a violation, that the applicant was to be awarded 50,000 Turkish liras (TRY \u2013 approximately 6,500\u00a0euros (EUR) at the material time) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and TRY 4,436.30 (approximately EUR 575 at the material time) in respect of costs and expenses. I consider that those amounts cannot be regarded as inadequate and disproportionate. As such, I find it difficult to argue that the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 9 June 2020 did not afford him appropriate and sufficient redress.",

As can be seen from the judgment, the offences forming the subject of the two detention orders were in fact different (see paragraphs 70 and 116 of the judgment).

In other words, the majority\u2019s conclusion under Article 46 of the Convention does not appear to have been aimed at putting an end to a violation that has been found to exist, given that the Grand Chamber was not called upon to examine the applicant\u2019s second detention from the point of view of Article 5 of the Convention, a question that is, I repeat, pending before the Constitutional Court. Indeed, an examination of the Grand Chamber cases in which the Court has indicated under Article 46 of the Convention that an applicant should be released shows that in all those judgments, such as Del R\u00edo Prada v.

In that connection, I am prepared to accept that the legitimate aims pursued by the interference were those of combating terrorism and protecting national security and public safety, in pursuance of Article 10. As for necessity, it is true that there is little scope under Article 10 \u00a7 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate of questions of public interest. In fact, interferences with the freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 236). However, I harbour doubts that the applicant\u2019s impugned speeches cannot be viewed as glorifying and praising the use of violence and can be seen as entirely peaceful and as contributing to a debate in the public interest, regard being had in particular to the tense situation prevailing in the region at the time as a result of the armed clashes between the Turkish security forces and the PKK (see S\u00fcrek v.

On this point, I am respectfully not able to follow the majority\u2019s conclusion regarding the alleged lack of reasonable suspicion under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention. I see no reason requiring the Grand Chamber to depart from the Chamber\u2019s decision on this issue, which was based on the Court\u2019s well-established case-law (see, among many other authorities, Fox, Campbell and Hartley v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182; O\u2019Hara v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, no. 37555/97, ECHR\u00a02001-X; and \u00c7i\u00e7ek v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a072774/10, \u00a7 62, 3 March 2015). I specifically refer to the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention does not presuppose that the investigating authorities have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges at the time of arrest. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation (see Murray v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom, 28\u00a0October 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 300-A, and Y\u00fcksel and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 55835/09 and 2 others, \u00a7 52, 31 May 2016). In this context, the Court must examine, as the Constitutional Court and the Chamber did, all the relevant evidence in the criminal case file that may confirm or dispel the concrete suspicion grounding the initial detention, and it cannot be bound only by the evidence adduced at first instance (see, mutatis mutandis, Y\u00fcksel and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-59, Tekin v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a03501/09, \u00a7\u00a7 5562, 18 November 2014; and Metin v. Turkey (dec.), no.\u00a077479/11, \u00a7\u00a7 5364, 3 March 2015).",

In other words, the applicant was deprived of his liberty for a purpose prescribed by Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01 (c) of the Convention. Therefore, I cannot share the majority\u2019s view that \u201cthe purposes put forward by the authorities for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention were merely cover for an ulterior political purpose\u201d. In that connection, I would first point out that Turkish law has a higher standard of protection concerning the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d criterion under Article 5 \u00a7 1. In the present case, the national courts, including the Constitutional Court, examined the applicant\u2019s detention and held that there were sufficient grounds for a strong suspicion that he had committed an offence. In other words, they ascertained the existence of a higher level of suspicion than that of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d required under Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(c). Secondly, the fact that the majority have reached the aforementioned view after meticulously subjecting the grounds of the applicant\u2019s detention to scrutiny implies that those grounds were not devoid of any basis or otherwise fabricated. I would like to point out that the Chamber also carried out an examination of the applicant\u2019s detention and concluded that \u201c... there was sufficient information in the criminal case file to satisfy an objective observer that the applicant might have committed at least some of the offences for which he had been prosecuted\u201d (see paragraph 169 of the Chamber judgment). Having regard to these factors, I am not entirely convinced that cogent reasons were put forward to justify a departure from the domestic courts\u2019 and Chamber\u2019s conclusions as regards the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d requirement under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). These circumstances have led me to conclude that the applicant\u2019s detention was in pursuance of a legitimate aim that was prescribed by the Convention. It is thus difficult for me to accept the majority\u2019s view that the applicant\u2019s detention was a mere cover for an ulterior purpose.",

In this connection, it appears from the case file that the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was examined on several occasions by the domestic judges, either of their own motion or at the request of the applicant. In fact, the domestic courts examined the question of the applicant\u2019s detention regularly and in a speedy manner from 4 November 2016 onwards. Furthermore, in a judgment of 9\u00a0June 2020, the Constitutional Court unanimously held that there had been a violation of Article 19 of the Constitution, finding that in extending the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the national judicial authorities had failed to put forward relevant and sufficient reasons in respect of his arguments concerning his right to stand for election and to carry out political activities. Nevertheless, the fact that certain aspects of the judicial review of the applicant\u2019s detention were found to have disclosed a breach of Article 19 of the Constitution is not sufficient in itself to warrant the conclusion that the applicant was detained for purposes other than those provided for by the Convention. Moreover, in a judgment of 11 July 2018, the applicant was awarded compensation under Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Whilst the majority\u2019s approach might arguably imply that the applicant\u2019s second detention is in effect the continuation of his first detention, given that both detention orders were purportedly based on the same factual context, I am unable to agree with that view for the reasons that I indicated in my separate opinion under Article\u00a046 of the Convention, and also for the following reasons. It is true that circumstantial evidence which is information about the primary facts, or contextual facts or sequences of events, may be taken into account in assessing the general and wider context when the Court examines complaints under Article 18 (see Merabishvili, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0317). However, where the circumstantial evidence takes the form of legal questions relating to the applicant, the Court\u2019s approach may be different. Indeed, in Navalnyy v. Russia ([GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a0171, 15\u00a0November 2018), the Court took into account the two sets of criminal proceedings contemporaneous to the criminal proceedings against the applicant in its assessment under Article 18 (regarding the general context of the case) by referring to previous judgments in which it had established the relevant facts and determined the legal questions raised in those two sets of proceedings (reference was made to Navalnyy and Ofitserov v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a046632/13 and 28671/14, \u00a7\u00a7 116-19, 23 February 2016, and to Navalnyye v. Russia, no. 101/15, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, 17 October 2017).",

                                "content": "32.\u00a0\u00a0In the light of the above, the applicant\u2019s second detention in the present case is not, from my perspective, merely circumstantial evidence; it is a legal question pending before the domestic courts and does not form part of the Court\u2019s examination under Article 5, in conjunction with which the complaint under Article 18 was examined. Under these circumstances, the majority\u2019s approach may risk widening the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber in an unprecedented way and I am hesitant to accept that position. In addition to such a novel approach, the majority also went on to examine the grounds of the applicant\u2019s second detention not under Article 5 (owing to the fact that the second detention was not included in the scope of its examination under that Article), but under Article 18 of the Convention, only to conclude that \u201c... the domestic authorities do not appear to be particularly interested in the applicant\u2019s suspected involvement in an offence allegedly committed between 6 and 8 October 2014, some five years previously, but rather in keeping him detained, thereby preventing him from carrying out his political activities\u201d (see paragraph 433 of the judgment). With all due respect, I remain sceptical as to whether such finding, stemming from a legal problem that is pending before the domestic courts and not covered by the complaint under Article 5, is in conformity with the principle that the Court must base its decision on evidence in the legal sense. Therefore, I can neither accept the majority\u2019s approach nor their conclusion.",
