This was a breach of regulation 13(11). The chairman failed to stop him doing this, but contented herself, according to the notes provided subsequently, with instructing her colleagues on the panel after they had retired that \u2018a lot of unnecessary information had been presented\u2019 and advising them \u2018to confine their discussion to the issues which had been considered by the previous panel and those which Dr Malik had been notified of\u2019.

Those related to matters not the subject of prior information. In any event, the matters raised must inevitably have prejudiced the claimant and the failure to exclude them at the hearing was itself unfair. Added to this, there was the failure to have [a relevant witness] attend despite the promise that he would and the observations of the presenting officer, compounded by the chairman, that the meeting was to review the decision to suspend the claimant.

Where such clientele/goodwill exists, measures that diminish its value, as, for example in Van Marle, interference with professional practice, may engage Article 1.

Equally, any consideration of a further category of Article 1 possession based on a notion of legitimate expectation in this context would unacceptably blur that distinction of principle. It would also, as I have indicated, lead to great difficulties of practical application in the next stages of the Article 1 exercise of identifying precisely what legitimately expected \u2018possession\u2019 had been interfered with and to what extent, and in considering the \u2018legitimacy\u2019 of the expectation against considerations of the general interest on the issue of justification.\u201d",

The judge said that inclusion on the list had \u2018an intrinsic value\u2019 in that it enabled the doctor to practise and he went on immediately to explain that because the amount of remuneration would be affected by patient numbers, \u2018suspension may well affect the economic value of his practice\u2019 ...

First, his position on the Performers List was not an \u201casset\u201d in any sense. It was personal and non-transferable, and had been obtained after he had satisfied the PCT of his suitability to perform medical services. Second, his inclusion on the list was not akin to a licence to perform an economic activity: he remained entitled to practise as a doctor in NHS and private hospitals, and as a general practitioner to private patients by virtue of his registration with the GMC. Third, he could not rely on an underlying interest in the value of his NHS practice as the rule which prevented him from disposing of any goodwill in the practice deprived it of a value which would have the nature of private right. As a consequence of the above, the value of the applicant\u2019s NHS practice lay only in its capacity to generate future income for him, a matter which fell outside the scope of Article 1.",

In a case involving an alleged interference with an applicant\u2019s medical practice, the Commission noted that the \u201cvested interests\u201d in the applicant\u2019s medical practice could be regarded as \u201cpossessions\u201d (see Karni v. Sweden, no. 11540/85, Commission decision of 8 March 1988, Decisions and Reports 55, p. 157). In later cases, the Court explained that law practices and their clientele were entities of a certain worth that had in many respects the nature of a private right and thus constituted assets and therefore possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 (see Olbertz v. Germany (dec.), no. 37592/97, 25 May 1999; D\u00f6ring v. Germany (dec.), no. 37595/97, 9 November 1999; and Wendenburg v. Germany, cited above). The Court has also indicated that it did not matter whether the applicants acquired the possessions by taking advantage of a favourable position, or solely through their own activities. It found that when dealing with the protection of privileges accorded by law, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was applicable where such privileges led to a legitimate expectation of acquiring certain possessions (see Wendenburg, cited above).",

In so far as he complains about loss suffered as a consequence of the reduction in the amount paid or the failure of the PCT to continue to pay rent, the Court observes that he has failed to avail himself of the procedure set out in regulation 13(19) and (20) of the Performers List Regulations to challenge the determination of the sums due (see paragraph 74 above).",

In particular, it is not evident from the data submitted that the fluctuation in numbers between January 2005 and May 2006 was unusual and could be attributed to his suspension. In this regard, the Court notes that the PCT took steps to preserve the applicant\u2019s medical practice and engaged a locum doctor to provide medical services in the applicant\u2019s stead to patients on his list instead of distributing them among other doctors, a matter to which the Court of Appeal also referred in its judgment (see paragraphs 11 and 49 above).",
