They considered that this case concerned neither the violation of a universal principle of law, nor the punishment for its violation. This case raised the issue of the violation of a contractual obligation, and thus the application of a penalty stipulated in the contract. The aim of this penalty was not the punishment of the person who had breached the terms for the import of the goods and other items, but compensation for the amount of the non-paid customs duties for the goods imported into the .

In the Court\u2019s view, the primary purpose of the Customs Code is to regulate economic issues, but, as it appears from its provisions referred to in the Relevant domestic law (see paragraph 14 above), it also covers customs-related offences. The Court notes that part VII deals with smuggling and refers to the criminal law, and that part VIII, whose provisions are pertinent to the present case, deals with infringements of customs regulations. In this connection, it should be noted that section 2 of the Code on Administrative Offences clearly mentions administrative liability for infringement of customs regulations and section 139 of the Customs Code talks about administrative penalties in form of a warning, a fine or confiscation. The latter two are sanctions for infringements of customs regulations under sections 112 and 113 of the Customs Code. In the light of these considerations, the Court does not see any substantial difference between the Code on Administrative Offences, whose punitive, criminal law nature the Government admitted, and part VIII of the Customs Code, which refers to particular types of customs-related offences, which can also be described as administrative offences. The Court therefore does not share the Government\u2019s view that the pertinent provisions of the Customs Code deal with contractual obligations. The Court notes that the relevant provisions of the Customs Code are directed towards all citizens who cross the border and regulate their conduct by means of sanctions (a fine and confiscation), which are punitive as well as deterring. Thus the customs offences in question had elements pertaining to a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a073, \u00a7\u00a7 53). As regards the actual measure imposed on the applicant (a confiscation order), the Court notes that it was provided by both the Code on Administrative Offences and the Customs Code as one of the penalties (main or supplementary) imposed on the offenders. In any case, whatever the characterisation of the measure in issue, the facts remains that the applicant faced a serious detriment due to its application (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 9 February 1995, Series\u00a0A no. 307-A, \u00a7 34).",

Introduction of this direct reference further clarified the relations between the Code on Administrative Offences and the Customs Code, but, in the Court\u2019s opinion, does not warrant the conclusion that prior to such clarification the procedural provisions of the Customs Code could not apply to cases concerning customs-related offences. Moreover, the Customs Code constituted lex specialis and lex posterior in relation to the Code on Administrative Offences, since it was adopted later and its section 121 clearly provided that proceedings concerning infringements of customs regulations should be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Code, and in accordance with other relevant legislation on administrative offences only where not regulated by the Code itself. In fact, section 139 of the Customs Code clearly provided for confiscation regardless of the time of the offence and of the ownership of the item to be confiscated. Section 149 of the Customs Code provided for replacement of the confiscation by the reimbursement of the item\u2019s value, if the item could not be confiscated (see paragraph 14 above).",
