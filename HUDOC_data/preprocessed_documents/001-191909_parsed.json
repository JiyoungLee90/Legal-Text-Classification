He submitted that the rectified appellate decision had been contrary to the final decision of the Supreme Court dated 20\u00a0February 2008 which had set a different starting date for his cumulative sentence, and would have resulted in a release date of 29\u00a0September 2010. He further submitted that the rectification had lacked any legal basis and had gone beyond the scope of Article\u00a0615 of the CCP, as it had substantially affected the duration of his sentence. Maintaining that his appeal had been the sole basis for the appellate court\u2019s judgment of 3\u00a0December 2008, the applicant submitted that the rectified appellate decision, made by that very court, had been in violation of Article\u00a0540 \u00a7\u00a01 of the CCP which had provided a guarantee for an appellant against a worsening of his or her position in the proceedings in the absence of an appeal from the prosecuting authorities. The applicant further indicated that, in addition to the foregoing arguments, taking into account the reduction of his sentence by the Supreme Court on 7\u00a0April 2009, his sentence should have expired on 29\u00a0March 2009 and that accordingly he was to be released from prison immediately.",

Furthermore, considering the applicant\u2019s reasoned arguments raised at domestic level (see paragraph\u00a016 above), the question of whether the error made in the earlier judgments and decisions had been sufficiently obvious and had been capable of being remedied by means of the rectification procedure appears, at the very least, to have been open to interpretation.

Furthermore, considering that the Supreme Court had decided the matter without holding an oral hearing (see paragraph\u00a015 above), the applicant had effectively been precluded from becoming aware of the rectified appellate decision and from presenting his arguments, as part of his appeal or separately, regarding the revised starting date of his cumulative sentence and its compliance with domestic law. When becoming aware of it and requesting the rectification of the decision of the Supreme Court of 7\u00a0April 2009 he was not heard by a judge. His request was first rejected by the Head of the Registry of the Chamber of Criminal Cases of the Supreme Court on 24\u00a0April 2009 with the argument that the Supreme Court was not in a position to address the applicant\u2019s complaint (see paragraph\u00a017 above) and then by the assistant to the Chairman of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal on 15\u00a0June 2009 with the argument that the interlocutory appeal on points of law could not be accepted for consideration (see paragraph\u00a019 above).",

Sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty, and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds (see\u00a0Khlaifia and Others v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, \u00a7\u00a088, 15\u00a0December 2016).\u00a0It is well established in the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 5 \u00a7 1 that all deprivation of liberty must not only be based on one of the exceptions listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) but must also be \u201clawful\u201d. Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question of whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see\u00a0Mozer v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], no.\u00a011138/10, \u00a7\u00a0134, 23 February 2016).\u00a0The \u201cquality of the law\u201d implies that where a national law authorises a deprivation of liberty, it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application to avoid all risk of arbitrariness. The standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Del\u00a0R\u00edo Prada v.

The Court applies a different approach towards the principle that there should be no arbitrariness in cases of detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), where in the absence of bad faith or deception, as long as the detention follows and has a sufficient causal connection with a lawful conviction, the decision to impose a sentence of detention and the length of that sentence are matters for the national authorities rather than for the Court under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see\u00a0T. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0103; Stafford v. the United Kingdom\u00a0[GC], no.\u00a046295/99, \u00a7 64, ECHR 2002IV; and Saadi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069 and 71).",

However, the Court is called upon to determine whether the earlier alteration of the starting date of the applicant\u2019s cumulative sentence by an appellate court, by means of a procedure that it has already been determined amounted to a breach of Article\u00a06 of the Convention (see paragraphs\u00a035-40 and\u00a044 above), was in breach of the \u201clawfulness\u201d requirement under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Convention.",

In that connection the Court takes note of the applicant\u2019s submission that, in the absence of an appeal by the prosecution, the rectification of the appellate court\u2019s judgment in respect of the starting date of his cumulative sentence had been in breach of the principle of reformatio in peius set out in Article\u00a0540 of the CCP (see paragraph\u00a023 above). However, the strength of the applicant\u2019s argument hinges on another legal issue. In particular, the question of domestic legality and the applicability of Article\u00a0540 of the CCP is linked to the question of whether the error made by the domestic courts regarding the starting date of the cumulative sentence had been obvious and the rectification therefore both expected and permitted by law and practice in force at the material time, or whether the rectification had gone beyond the confines of the law in that respect.",

On the other hand, the subsequent rectification appears to have been based, albeit implicitly, on Article\u00a059 of the Criminal Code as amended on 29\u00a0December 2006, which clearly set the date of the imposition of the later sentence as the starting date for any cumulative sentence (see paragraph\u00a021 above). In that connection, the Court further takes note of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 20\u00a0January 2009 in a different case, clarifying that Article\u00a059 of the Code could have retroactive effect (see paragraph\u00a025 above). That decision predated both the rectification decision of the appellate court dated 3\u00a0April 2009 and the final decision of the Supreme Court in the applicant\u2019s case dated 7\u00a0April 2009 (compare paragraphs 14-15 and 25 above). Therefore, while the question regarding the foreseeability of the law in respect of the starting date of a cumulative sentence was not addressed by the domestic courts, the rectification appears to have followed a clarification offered by the Supreme Court in another case. In such circumstances, it is not for the Court to speculate on the legality of the applicant\u2019s detention beyond 29\u00a0September 2010, which was ordered by the Supreme Court in accordance with the law and practice in force at the material time.

Furthermore, in so far as the applicant\u2019s argument can be understood to mean that he had been convicted and sentenced as a result of proceedings which were a \u201cflagrant denial of justice\u201d that had affected the lawfulness of his detention under Article\u00a05, the Court reiterates that the \u201cflagrant denial of justice\u201d test is a stringent one (ibid., \u00a7\u00a099). What is required is a breach of the principles of fair trial that is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article (see\u00a0Othman (Abu Qatada) v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a08139/09, \u00a7\u00a0260, ECHR 2012 (extracts), and Tsonyo Tsonev v.\u00a0Bulgaria (no. 3), no.\u00a021124/04, \u00a7\u00a059, 16\u00a0October 2012, with further references). While the Court has found a violation of Article\u00a06 of the Convention in the present case (see paragraphs\u00a035-40 above), it does not consider that the violation is of such a nature as to have destroyed the very essence of the right guaranteed by that Article (contrast, Tsonyo Tsonev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a059, and Hammerton, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a099 and 119). Accordingly, the Court finds that the violation of Article 6 in the present case did not amount to a flagrant denial of justice.",
