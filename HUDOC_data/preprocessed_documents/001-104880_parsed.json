In this context, the Court reiterates that an accused in criminal proceedings should be entitled to have his case conducted with special diligence, having a particular regard to any restrictions on liberty imposed pending the conclusion of the proceedings (see Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, \u00a7\u00a089, 2 March 2006, and Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 71). Article 6 of the Convention requires the courts to employ available procedural remedies in order to determine a person\u2019s guilt or innocence without undue delay. This requirement is aimed at removing as soon as practicable the uncertainty concerning the accused\u2019s legal position which remains throughout the entire duration of the proceedings, irrespective of whether they are pending or suspended.

Neither did he submit any proof that he had tried to accelerate the commercial proceedings which, on their own, were not lengthy having regard to the complexity of the tax matters \u2013 three and half years before three levels of jurisdiction.",

He was under an undertaking not to abscond and I do not see a sufficient logic in finding no violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 on the length of imposed restriction on liberty of movement, with a view of its proportionality in the circumstances, whilst the length of proceedings was still found disproportionate.",
