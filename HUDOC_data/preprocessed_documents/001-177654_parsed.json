He further complained, without providing dates or copies of the final domestic decisions, about the prosecutor\u2019s participation in the first-instance civil proceedings of 27\u00a0December 2010 and the subsequent appeal proceedings. As in several previous cases, the Court does not find it appropriate to examine any new matters raised by the applicant after communication of the application to the Government, as long as they do not constitute an elaboration upon the applicant\u2019s original complaints to the Court (see Yefimova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a039786/09, \u00a7\u00a0177, 19\u00a0February 2013, with further references). Given that no complaints in connection with those proceedings were raised before the communication of the application, and having regard to the decision to examine its merits at the same time as its admissibility, the Court considers that the scope of the present case is limited to the facts as they stood at the time of the communication. However, the applicant has the opportunity to lodge new applications in respect of any other complaints relating to the subsequent events (see Rafig Aliyev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a045875/06, \u00a7\u00a070, 6\u00a0December 2011).",
