In its reasoning, the Immigration Service accepted as established facts the account of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s background, his employment history and the incidents that had taken place in Iraq (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). There was no issue of credibility. Concerning Mr A., the Service found that the disagreement had been between two private individuals and that the allegation that Mr A. belonged to the Badr Organisation was only based on hearsay. Moreover, the Service accepted that the shooting at the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s car and the car bomb attack had taken place, but concluded that those incidents had nothing to do with his personal circumstances or background. As regards the work performed for an American company, the Service considered that this could have given rise to problems before 2011, but since the applicant\u2019s father had later been able to obtain a post in the Ministry of the Interior, there was no indication that he was the subject of any special interest from the authorities. The Service acknowledged that Sunni Arab men were unlikely to obtain protection from the authorities in Iraq. However, the applicant\u2019s father had not brought up any problems relating to his Sunni background, other than the argument with Mr A. In conclusion, the Service did not accept that the applicant\u2019s father would be in danger of persecution upon return to Iraq.",

It found that people who had worked for Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime were no longer subject to systematic persecution. The applicant\u2019s father had also stopped working for the American company in question more than ten years earlier. This part of his work history alone did not make it likely that he would be subject to persecution by non-State actors. The court considered it improbable that the applicant\u2019s father would be at serious risk upon return to Iraq due to his earlier work history. As to his work at the Ministry of the Interior, the court noted that the applicant\u2019s father had lived for several months in Baghdad after his disagreement with Mr A. and that the latter had not threatened him after the first incident. The shooting at the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s car, the car bomb and the alleged link between these incidents and the grounds invoked to justify his fear of persecution had only been based on his own conclusions. He did not know who the perpetrators had been, nor had he received any new threats during those three and a half months he had spent in Iraq after the shooting and the explosion. The court concluded that the shooting and the explosion had had nothing to do with him personally but with the general security situation in Baghdad. It was therefore improbable that the applicant\u2019s father would be at serious risk upon return to Iraq due to his work at the Ministry of the Interior. His Sunni Arab background gave no reason to believe that he would be at real risk of persecution upon return to Iraq.",

The applicant\u2019s father had then returned voluntarily to his country of origin while his case was still pending before the Supreme Administrative Court, and his death had taken place in Iraq. The Finnish authorities had not exposed him to a risk of ill-treatment. Given his voluntary departure from Finland, there was no causal connection between the subsequent removal order and the exposure of the applicant\u2019s father to an alleged risk in Iraq, where he had chosen to return. In any event, a sending State could be held responsible under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention only at the time when a measure was taken to remove an individual from its territory. Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention did not create a general positive obligation for the Contracting States to protect people from voluntarily exposing themselves to potential risks outside their jurisdiction.

The removal order was thus enforceable. At that point, he opted for voluntary return, a possibility available for him under section 147a, subsection 1, of the Aliens Act. His situation was therefore different from the circumstances underlying the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision KHO:2017:165 referred to by the Government (see paragraph 32 above). For the Court the fact that the applicant\u2019s father had first lodged an application under the voluntary returns programme before submitting his application for leave to appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court cannot be regarded as decisive, either. In the light of the circumstances of the case, in particular the factual background of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s flight from Iraq as acknowledged by the domestic authorities, the Court sees no reason to doubt that he would not have returned there under the scheme of \u201cassisted voluntary return\u201d had it not been for the enforceable removal order issued against him. Consequently, his departure was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d in terms of his free choice. The circumstances of the present case are thus different from those in the case of Abdul Wahab Khan, cited in paragraph 54 above.

In these circumstances the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s father did not have a genuinely free choice between these options, which renders his supposed waiver invalid.

Italy [GC], no. , \u00a7 113, ECHR 2012; \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006-XII; and F.G. v. Sweden [GC], no.\u00a0, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2016). However, it would hardly be compatible with the \u201ccommon heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law\u201d to which the Preamble refers, were a Contracting State knowingly to surrender a person to another State where there were substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (see Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7\u00a068, ECHR 2005I, and Soering, cited above, \u00a7 88). Consequently, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. , \u00a7\u00a7 124-125, ECHR 2008).",

The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s father consistently claimed before the domestic authorities that the reasons invoked by him and regarding his personal background, professional history and events preceding his flight from Iraq, gave rise to a real risk of death or ill-treatment if he were removed back there. He provided the domestic authorities with specific information about his personal situation and the reasons for his fear of ill-treatment and death. The applicant\u2019s father thus clearly adduced evidence capable of proving that there were substantial grounds for believing that, upon removal, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Articles 2 and/or 3. It was thus for the Government to dispel any doubts about this.",

They thus accepted that the applicant\u2019s father could be of interest to the Iraqi authorities and/or non-State actors. In their decisions, the domestic authorities and courts extensively referred to relevant country information on Iraq. The Court observes that, as can be seen from the country information and materials publicly available to the domestic authorities and courts at the relevant time, there were then, inter alia, sectarian tensions between the Shia militia and the Sunni (Arab) Muslims; a number of incidents had been reported where Iraqis who had worked for Americans had been killed; and there was a heightened security situation in Baghdad which did not reach the level of indiscriminate violence but which in any case required decision makers to consider whether deportees\u2019 individual circumstances might nevertheless place them at increased risk. Moreover, in general, the Iraqi authorities in Baghdad were unable and unwilling to provide sufficient protection for Sunni Muslims (see paragraphs 38-42 above). The Court observes that any of these individual factors may not, when considered separately, necessarily have given rise to a real risk. However, when taken cumulatively and when considered in a situation of general violence and heightened security concerns in Iraq at the relevant time, they could have given rise to such risk (see paragraph 77 above). It appears from the domestic decisions that such a cumulative assessment was not made at any stage by the domestic authorities and courts.",

The Court reiterates in this context that past ill-treatment may be relevant for assessing the level of risk of future ill-treatment. Both the incident in February 2015 when the applicant\u2019s father was shot at when leaving the Office with his driver and the car bomb which exploded in his car in April 2015 were acknowledged as facts by the Finnish authorities. However, the latter did not accept the contention that these acts were targeted at the applicant\u2019s father. Instead, these incidents were placed exclusively in the context of the general security situation in Baghdad. Given the circumstances relating to the personal background and professional profile of the applicant\u2019s father (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above), the Court does not see any plausible explanation as to why two serious incidents of this nature were not more carefully and specifically assessed in terms of the risk of the applicant\u2019s father having been targeted personally. In this context, the Court also notes that the altercation between the applicant\u2019s father and his colleague (see paragraph 9 above), was dismissed by the domestic authorities as a mere dispute between individuals, and not assessed in terms of its possible links with their respective religious affiliations and the tensions between the Shia and Sunni groups, nor with the subsequent violent events mentioned above.",
