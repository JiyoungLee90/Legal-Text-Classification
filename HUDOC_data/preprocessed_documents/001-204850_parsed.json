Therefore, given the suspicious circumstances surrounding his death, the domestic authorities were required to conduct a criminal investigation attaining the minimum threshold of effectiveness in order to shed light on the circumstances of the death regardless of whether the presumed perpetrator had been a State agent or not. The fact that the investigation ultimately accepts the hypothesis of an accident has no bearing on this issue, since the obligation to investigate is specifically intended to refute or confirm one or other hypothesis (see Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 24014/05, \u00a7\u00a7 133 and 171, 14 April 2015, and Nicolae\u00a0Virgiliu T\u0103nase, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 160-61).
