As stated by the Bakulev hospital, it was impracticable to ensure the permanent presence of convoy officers during and after the surgery to supervise the applicant (see paragraph 40 above).\u00a0At the same time, the Government conceded that the applicant\u2019s medical condition did not require early release from detention on health grounds.\u00a0In this connection, the Court cannot but reiterate the principle under which it is for the national authorities to organise the internal legal system in such a way as to ensure compliance with the State\u2019s Convention obligations. This also applies to the issue of medical care in the context of the practical demands of imprisonment.\u00a0The national authorities must ensure that diagnosis and care in detention facilities are prompt and accurate, and that, where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy (see Sakhvadze, cited above, \u00a7 83).",
