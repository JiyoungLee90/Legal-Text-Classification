The case originated in an application (no. 40058/98) against the Slovak Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovakian national, Mr Štefan Gajdúšek (“the applicant”), on 19 February 1998.
The Slovakian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Vršanský.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that his right to a hearing within a reasonable time was violated in proceedings concerning termination of co-ownership.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 8 March 2001 the Court declared admissible the applicant’s complaint about the length of the proceedings. It declared inadmissible the applicant’s complaint that he was not able to use the property which he jointly owns with his brother.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
In 1988 the applicant and his brother became co-owners of real property which had belonged to their late parents.
On 18 April 1989 the applicant’s brother brought proceedings before the Senica District Court (Okresný súd) with a view to having the co-ownership terminated. The plaintiff requested that the house should be transferred to his exclusive ownership and that the applicant should be compensated.
On 6 April 1990 the Senica District Court granted the action. Upon the applicant’s appeal the Bratislava Regional Court (Krajský súd) quashed the first instance judgment on 18 June 1990 and ordered that further evidence should be taken.
In the course of 1991 the District Court held several hearings and obtained a supplementary expert opinion. The judge also inspected the real property in question. An attempt to settle the case failed as the parties had different positions as regards the value of the property.
On 30 March 1992 an expert submitted his second supplementary opinion which the District Court had requested on 17 March 1992.
On 28 April 1992 the District Court heard the parties and the expert. The latter was ordered to supplement his opinion. The expert complied with the request on 21 May 1992.
On 8 June 1992 the District Court ordered the parties to pay an advance on the fees of the expert. The parties appealed on 12 and 16 June 1992 respectively. For this reason a hearing scheduled for 25 June 1992 was adjourned. On 13 July 1992 the Bratislava Regional Court upheld the decision on the advance payment of expert’s fees. The case file was returned to the District Court on 21 July 1992.
In the meantime, on 1 July 1992, the applicant complained to the president of the Senica District Court that the judge dealing with the case lacked impartiality.
On 24 November 1992 the District Court delivered a decision on reimbursement of the costs of two witnesses who had been heard in 1990.
On 20 January 1993 the president of the District Court informed the applicant that his request for exclusion of the judge of 1 July 1992 had not been duly registered and invited him to submit a copy. The applicant did so on 4 February 1993.
On 27 January 1993 the District Court adjourned the case pending the decision on the applicant’s request for exclusion of the judge. The Bratislava Regional Court dismissed the request on 18 March 1993. The case file was returned to the District Court on 26 April 1993.
On 10 June 1993 the applicant’s brother requested the District Court to adjourn the case until 1994 as he had health problems.
On 12 August 1993 the District Court heard the applicant and adjourned the case.
On 27 September 1993 the president of the Senica District Court admitted, in a reply to the applicant’s complaint addressed to the Ministry of Justice, that the proceedings had lasted long. The president expressed the view that the delays were mainly due to the plaintiff’s health problems.
On 16 December 1993 the District Court heard the parties and decided to appoint an expert with a view to evaluating the property.
On 26 April 1994 the applicant complained about the length of the proceedings to the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd). The latter requested the District Court to submit the case-file on 30 May and 21 June 1994. In a letter of 5 October 1994 a judge of the Constitutional Court informed the applicant that, in his view, there had been no excessive delays in the proceedings.
On 28 June 1994 the District Court appointed an expert and invited the parties to pay his fees. On 12 July 1994 the applicant’s brother challenged the expert.
The District Court unsuccessfully tried to hear the expert on 17 and 24 October 1994. On 8 November 1994 the expert appeared and was heard.
On 17 January 1995 the District Court dismissed the plaintiff’s request for exclusion of the expert of 12 July 1994. On 2 February 1995 the plaintiff appealed.
On 3 February 1995 the District Court delivered a decision on the expert’s fees. On 6 and 22 February 1995 the plaintiff challenged this decision.
On 30 March 1995 the District Court transmitted the case file to the Bratislava Regional Court. On 29 September 1995 the latter upheld the District Court’s decisions of 17 January and of 3 February 1995. The case file was returned to the District Court on 10 November 1995.
On 5 December 1995 the District Court invited the expert to submit his opinion. On 15 January 1996 the expert informed the court that he was not qualified in evaluation of construction works.
On 30 January 1996 the applicant informed the Senica District Court about his readiness to settle the case.
On 15 February 1996 the District Court appointed another expert. The plaintiff did not allow the expert to examine the property on 1 March 1996. The plaintiff asked the court to postpone the examination as he was ill. On 25 April 1996 a doctor informed the judge that the plaintiff could not attend an examination of the property and that his health was unlikely to improve.
On 30 May 1996 the president of the Senica District Court dismissed the applicant’s complaints about the length of the proceedings. The applicant was further invited to specify whether he challenged the District Court judges.
On 12 June 1996 the applicant again complained about the length of the proceedings to the president of the Senica District Court. He also requested that the case should be transferred to another court.
On the same day the District Court instructed the expert to examine the property. In a separate letter the court invited the plaintiff to let the expert carry out his job and informed him that he could be represented by his lawyer on that occasion should he be unable to attend. The letter further stated that the plaintiff was obliged to allow the examination of the property and that a procedural fine could be imposed on him under Section 53 of the Code of Civil Procedure should he obstruct the conduct of the proceedings.
On 1 July 1996 the plaintiff requested that the examination of the property be postponed until 1997 with reference to his health problems.
On 22 July 1996 the expert informed the District Court that he had not been able to examine the property because of the plaintiff’s disagreement.
On 20 November 1996 the expert returned the file to the District Court. He explained that the plaintiff had excluded the possibility of having the property examined in the next few months.
On 20 January 1997 the District Court asked the plaintiff’s lawyer to indicate when the plaintiff would allow the property to be examined. On 24 February and on 2 May 1997 the judge reiterated the request. On 23 May 1997 the lawyer replied that he was not in a position to indicate when the plaintiff’s health would improve so that he could attend the examination. A hearing was scheduled for 14 January 1998.
On 8 January 1998 the plaintiff requested the District Court to exempt him from the obligation to pay court fees. On 13 January 1998 the plaintiff informed the District Court that he had terminated the authority of his lawyer as he was indigent. He requested that the same lawyer be appointed to represent him at the court’s expenses.
On 12 January 1998 the applicant challenged the Senica District Court judges for bias and proposed to transfer the case to another court.
On 14 January 1998 the District Court heard the plaintiff. The applicant failed to appear. On 27 May 1998 the case file was transmitted to the Trnava Regional Court. On 11 June 1998 the latter dismissed the applicant’s request for exclusion of the District Court judges. The case file was returned to the District Court on 10 July 1998.
On 2 September 1998 the District Court appointed a lawyer to represent the plaintiff in the proceedings. By another decision of 23 October 1998 the District Court exempted the plaintiff from the obligation to pay the court fees.
On 6 November 1998 the plaintiff’s lawyer requested that another lawyer be appointed. On 2 December 1998 the District Court appointed another lawyer to represent the plaintiff. The latter appealed on 28 December 1999.
On 3 December 1999 the District Court again invited the plaintiff to indicate when the property could be examined. The plaintiff was informed that his lawyer could represent him during the examination.
The expert examined the property in question in February 2000. He submitted his opinion on 15 March 2000. It was sent to the parties for comments.
On 11 April 2000 the court adjourned the case as both the plaintiff and the legal representative of the applicant failed to appear.
The District Court held hearings on 25 April 2000 and on 18 May 2000.
On 22 May 2000 the District Court delivered a judgment by which it assigned the house to the plaintiff’s ownership and granted the applicant financial compensation. The judgment was served on the applicant on 16 February 2001. On 23 February and 2 March 2001 respectively the parties appealed. On 12 and 15 March 2001 respectively the applicant and the plaintiff submitted comments on the appeal of the other party.
On 13 November 2001 the Trnava Regional Court upheld the Senica District Court’s judgment of 22 May 2000. It is not clear whether the decision has become final.
