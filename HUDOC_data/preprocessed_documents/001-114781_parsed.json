The Court considers that some costs and expenses related to the proceedings before the domestic courts were undoubtedly expended with a view to their failure to forward to the applicant the defendant\u2019s observations submitted in reply to his appeals. However, in the absence of any supporting document the Court is unable to assess which costs were incurred in order to seek prevention or redress before the national courts of the violation found on that ground (see, a contrario, Stoimenov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 17995/02, \u00a7 56, 5 April 2007). The same concerns the applicant\u2019s claim concerning the reimbursement of legal fees in respect of the proceedings before the Court. Accordingly, the Court makes no award in this respect (see Petkoski and Others v. the , no. 27736/03, \u00a7 56, 8\u00a0January 2009). On the other hand and in view of the supporting documents submitted, the Court awards EUR 120 for mailing and copying expenses incurred in the proceedings before it.",
