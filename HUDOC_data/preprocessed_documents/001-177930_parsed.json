The investigator\u2019s most recent decision of 29\u00a0November 2005 maintained the same findings and had the same defects as the earlier decisions, for example those in the decision of 7 February 2004, which had been annulled by the senior prosecutor of the Adygeya Republic prosecutor\u2019s office on 27\u00a0February 2004. In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that a proper appeal to a court by the applicant against the investigator\u2019s decision of 29\u00a0November 2005, which could only have had the same effect, that is the annulment of the decision, would have offered the applicant any redress.

Russia, no. 46956/09, \u00a7 129, 24 July 2014). The Court reiterates its finding that merely carrying out a preinvestigation inquiry under Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation is insufficient if the authorities are to comply with the standards established under Article 3 of the Convention for an effective investigation into credible allegations of ill-treatment in police custody. It is incumbent on the authorities to institute criminal proceedings and conduct a proper criminal investigation in which the whole range of investigative measures are implemented (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 129 and 132-36).\u00a0The Court has no reason to hold otherwise in the present case, which involves credible allegations of ill-treatment of which the authorities were promptly made aware.
