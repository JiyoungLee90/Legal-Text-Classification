In its view, the absence of any specific regulation of detention matters in Article 466 \u00a7 1 did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with the Constitution. Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Minsk Convention provided that, in executing a request for legal assistance, the requested party would apply its domestic law, which in the case of Russia was the procedure laid down in the CCrP. Such procedure comprised, in particular, Article 466 \u00a7\u00a01 of the Code and the norms in its Chapter 13 (\u201cMeasures of restraint\u201d) which, by virtue of their general character and position in Part I of the Code (\u201cGeneral provisions\u201d), applied to all stages and forms of criminal proceedings, including proceedings for the examination of extradition requests.

The Constitutional Court held that Article\u00a0466 \u00a7 1 of the CCrP, read in conjunction with the Minsk Convention, could not be construed as permitting the detention of an individual for more than forty-eight hours on the basis of a request for his or her extradition without a decision by a Russian court.

It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see, with further references, Nachova and Others v.

A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations (see, among other authorities, Fadeyeva\u00a0v.

The establishment of such responsibility inevitably involves an assessment of conditions in the requesting country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention. Nonetheless, there is no question of adjudicating on or establishing the responsibility of the requesting country, whether under general international law, under the Convention or otherwise. In so far as any responsibility under the Convention is or may be incurred, it is responsibility incurred by the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 89-91, Series A no. 161).",

Since the nature of the Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under Article 3 in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the extradition (see Cruz Varas and Others v.

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see Amuur\u00a0v.

This is incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Yudayev v. , no. 40258/03, \u00a7 59, 15 January 2009, and Baranowski v. , no.\u00a028358/95,\u00a0\u00a7 56, ECHR 2000-III).

It is not excluded that a system of automatic periodic review of the lawfulness of detention by a court may ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Megyeri v. , 12 May 1992, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 237-A, and Reinprecht v. , no. 67175/01, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2005XII).

The rationale underlying the requirements of speediness and periodic judicial review at reasonable intervals within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 4 and the Court\u2019s case-law is that a detainee should not run the risk of remaining in detention long after the time when his deprivation of liberty has become unjustified (see, Shishkov v. , no. 38822/97, \u00a7\u00a088, ECHR 2003I (extracts), with further references).",

It is important to note that in the interval between the extension hearings the applicant was unable to lodge an application for judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention. Indeed, the Court has already found that Articles 108, 109 and 110 of the CCrP, to which the Government referred, did not entitle a detainee to initiate proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention would be examined by a court (see Nasrulloyev, cited above, \u00a7 88; Ismoilov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0151; and Elmuratov, cited above, \u00a7 115).

Thus, as regards detention after conviction by a competent court in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), the Court has accepted as \u201creasonable\u201d periods of less than a year between reviews of detention of discretionary life prisoners and rejected periods of more than one year (see Oldham v. the , no. 36273/97, \u00a7 31, ECHR 2000X; Hirst v. the , no. 40787/98, \u00a7 39, 24 July 2001; and Blackstock, cited above, \u00a7 44). Similarly, as regards detention of persons of unsound mind under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) ordered at the close of criminal proceedings during which the charges against them had been proved but they had been found not criminally responsible for their actions due to a mental illness, intervals between reviews of less than a year have usually been considered acceptable, while longer intervals have not been considered \u201creasonable\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, \u00a7 77; Silva Rocha v.

Italy, 25\u00a0October 1989, \u00a7 21, Series A no. 164, and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 162, Reports 1998VIII). Thus, the Court has found that the Austrian system of automatic periodic review of pre-trial detention establishing a maximum interval between reviews of two months was compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Reinprecht, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 33). In another case, a period of three months and eight days during which the applicant could not obtain judicial review of his pre-trial detention was found to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d (see Jurjevs v. , no. 70923/01, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63, 15 June 2006).",

Bulgaria, no. 20116/08, \u00a7\u00a078, 10 May 2012). It therefore considers that shorter intervals between reviews are necessary for detention pending deportation or extradition as compared to detention after conviction by a competent court or detention of persons of unsound mind. Indeed, the factors affecting the lawfulness of detention are likely to evolve faster in situations where the proceedings are continuing (as in cases of detention with a view to extradition) than in situations where the proceedings have been closed after the establishment of all relevant circumstances (as in cases where a conviction has been pronounced by a competent court or compulsory psychiatric treatment ordered by a court on the basis of medical reports confirming the person\u2019s dangerousness). At the same time, given the limited scope of the review of the lawfulness of detention required under Article 5 \u00a7 4 in extradition cases \u2013 which does not extend, for example, to the questions whether the detention was \u201cnecessary\u201d for the prevention of crime or fleeing \u2013 the review need not be as frequent as in cases of deprivation of liberty under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01 (c) (see Taylor v.  (dec.), no. 37038/09, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 55, 26 June 2012). Thus, in two recent Russian cases the Court has found that intervals between periodic reviews of detention ranging from two to four months were compatible with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Soliyev v. , no. 62400/10, \u00a7\u00a7 57-62, 5 June 2012, and Khodzhamberdiyev v. , no. 64809/10, \u00a7\u00a7 108-114, 5 June 2012).",
