In the above-mentioned case, the Supreme Court dealt with the claimant's argument that it would be more appropriate to make an estimate of the amount in dispute. The court noted that as a general rule there was no scope for making an estimate of the amount in dispute where the subject of the action for a declaratory decision was a pecuniary claim. The question of whether a claim was recoverable or not was not material for fixing the amount in dispute, and in that respect there was no difference between proceedings under section 110 of the Insolvency Act and other civil proceedings.

Claimants in the latter could not generally expect to receive the full amount claimed either.

However, the applicant, although asserting that the court fees were excessive, did not claim that he was actually unable to pay them. Indeed, he paid the court fees in their entirety (see paragraph 20). In addition, the applicant pointed out that exemption from court fees was only provisional and could be revoked if the party's financial situation changed.",

They did not refer to any specific decision showing that a person in the applicant's situation could benefit from exemption or respite from court fees. In contrast, the applicant referred to the case-law of the , which only accepted in cases of default of payment that the collection of court fees would cause special hardship. As the applicant had actually been able to pay the fees, I fail to see how the measures foreseen in section 9 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Judicial Collection Act could have provided effective relief in his case.",

In that connection I reiterate that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective. This is particularly so of the right of access to the courts in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see Kreuz, cited above, \u00a7 57, and Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, Series\u00a0A no. 32, \u00a7 24).",
