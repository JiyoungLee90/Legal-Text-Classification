The case originated in an application (no. 43536/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Stefano Schiappacasse (“the applicant”), on 11 September 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr Marco Valerio Santonocito, a lawyer practising in Rome. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 9 December 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1961 and is currently residing in Turin. He is an officer in the Italian Army.
On 7 August 1990 Mr G.B. filed a criminal complaint against the applicant, stating that in December 1989 the latter, in his capacity as officer, had forced two recruits to give him money. On 20 August 1990, however, Mr G.B. withdrew his complaint, considering that the recruits’ version was not credible.
In an order of 25 May 1992, the Cosenza investigating judge committed the applicant for trial, commencing on 13 May 1993 before the Cosenza District Court on a charge of extortion.
A number of hearings took place. They were postponed either by reason of legitimate impediment of the applicant, or because of witnesses’ absence, or finally because of lawyer’s strikes. On 17 September 1996 the two recruits were examined. On 18 December 1997 and 5 February 1998, Mr G.B. and three other witnesses were examined.
In a judgment of 5 February 1998, filed with the registry on 25 February 1998, the Cosenza District Court acquitted the applicant. This decision became final on 19 April 1998.
