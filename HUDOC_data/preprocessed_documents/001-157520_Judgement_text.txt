The case originated in an application (no. 34230/07) against the Republic of Albania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Greek company, Valio Shipping Company (“the applicant company”), on 1 August 2007.
The applicant company was represented by Mr G. Papadimitriou and Mr C. Tzimas, lawyers practising in Athens. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agents, Ms S. Mëneri of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, subsequently, by Mrs E. Hajro of the State Advocate’s Office.
On 8 December 2008 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant company is a shipping company in liquidation incorporated under Greek Law in 1991, with its legal seat in Kallithea, Greece.
On 13 March 1995 the Vlora District Court decided that the applicant company’s vessel had been unlawfully seized. This decision was upheld on appeal and it became final at the latest on 1 August 1995.
On 1 December 1995 the applicant company brought a civil action against the local Treasury office (“Seksioni i Financës - Dega e Thesarit Vlorë”), the district prosecutor’s office (“Prokuroria e Rrethit Vlorë”) and the local Customs Administration (“Dogana e Rrethit Vlorë”), seeking compensation in respect of the damage caused by the unlawful seizure. The Customs Administration lodged a counter action requesting payment of expenses for keeping the vessel.
On 4 July 1996 the Vlora District Court dismissed both civil actions.
On 14 November 1996 the Tirana Court of Appeal quashed that decision. It ordered the local Treasury office to pay the applicant company 1,621,575 United States dollars (“USD”) for damages. It further ordered the applicant company to pay the Customs Administration USD 333,120 to cover the expenses incurred for the keeping of the vessel.
On 30 July 1997 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision. After this had become final, on 27 October 1997 an enforcement writ was issued at the request of the applicant company.
On 22 April 1999 the Customs Administration and the district prosecutor lodged a request for supervisory review (“rekurs në interes të ligjit”) against the Supreme Court’s decision. On 29 March 2000 the Supreme Court requested the appellants to resubmit the request as well as supplementary documents. On 28 April 2000 the appellants resubmitted the request. It would appear that the request was never examined by the Supreme Court.
On three occasions, namely on 10 November 1999, in 2003 and on 21 June 2006 the applicant company requested the bailiff to enforce the Court of Appeal’s decision, as upheld by the Supreme Court. It accordingly paid the bailiff tax in part.
On 8 August 2000 the bailiff discontinued the enforcement proceedings, having regard to the impossibility of the Savings Bank to freeze the local Treasury’s bank account.
On 3 February 2005 the applicant company withdrew its enforcement request.
From 2006 to 2008 the bailiff unsuccessfully sought the enforcement of the decision from the local Treasury office and the Ministry of Finance. The bailiff further fined the director of the local Treasury office for failure to enforce the decision. On 10 March 2008 it discontinued the enforcement on the grounds that the enforcement writ did not specify the nature of the obligation that had to be enforced and the applicant company had failed to pay the bailiff tax in full.
To date, the final decision remains unenforced.
Article 525 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) provides that the expenses relating to enforcement of a decision should be borne by the creditor. The expenses are subsequently recoverable through payment of the debt by the debtor. Article 616 of the CCP enumerates instances when the bailiff may discontinue the enforcement. Under Article 617 the bailiff’s decision to discontinue the proceedings is amenable to appeal before a court.
Articles 320 of the Criminal Code (“CC”) provides for the criminal offence of obstructing the enforcement of a court decision, which is punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to two years.
