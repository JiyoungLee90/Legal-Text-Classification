It is true that the judgments of 2\u00a0August 2006 and 27\u00a0May 2010 did not specify a method of indexation (see paragraphs\u00a06 and 15 above).

It is not the Court\u2019s task to decide whether the method referred to by the Town Court was correct in terms of domestic law. It is sufficient for the Court to note that the required calculation could be effectively performed using those coefficients, and that the courts had no difficulty in applying them for the period between the initial judgment and November 2009 (see paragraphs\u00a010 and 13 above; see further, for the courts\u2019 acceptance of the applicant\u2019s method of calculation in 2011, paragraphs\u00a020-21 above).",

The Court sees no reason to depart from these findings. It therefore considers that the judgment of 2\u00a0August 2006, as subsequently clarified, contained the information necessary to calculate the amounts due to the applicant as a result of indexation (see, mutatis mutandis, Bulgakova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a069524/01, \u00a7\u00a029, 18\u00a0January 2007, and Shakhirzyanov v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a039888/02, \u00a7\u00a023, 20\u00a0November 2008). In the Court\u2019s view, and as appears from the debtor authority\u2019s submissions to the domestic courts (see paragraphs\u00a07, 9 and 20 above), it was not the lack of clarity of the operative parts of the relevant judicial decisions, but rather the absence of a corresponding financial mechanism at the debtor\u2019s level which prevented enforcement of the judgment. The Court further notes that, despite an apparent disagreement with the Town Court\u2019s findings, the debtor authority, for unknown reasons, chose not to appeal against either the judgments of 2\u00a0August 2006 and 27\u00a0May 2010 or the clarification of 30\u00a0June 2009 to a higher court (see paragraphs\u00a07, 12 and 15 above), but preferred to raise their objections to the enforceability of the judicial awards at the enforcement stage.",

The Court further considers that there existed \u201ca genuine and serious dispute\u201d over a \u201ccivil right\u201d which could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, and that the outcome was decisive for the applicant, as required for the applicability of the civil limb of Article\u00a06 of the Convention (see Denisov v.\u00a0Ukraine [GC], no.\u00a076639/11, \u00a7\u00a044, 25\u00a0September 2018).

In the light of the adoption of the new domestic remedy and in line with its previous decisions, the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine separately the admissibility and merits of the complaint under Article\u00a013 (see, mutatis mutandis, Tkhyegepso and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a044387/04 and 11\u00a0others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021-24, 25\u00a0October 2011).",

However, the Court further notes that it has found established that the periodic payments in the applicant\u2019s favour had not been index-linked between November 2009 and at least February 2013 (see paragraph\u00a037 above). Therefore, the applicant was prevented from receiving the amounts he had legitimately expected to receive under the binding and enforceable judicial decisions. Accordingly, in the Court\u2019s view, the State has an outstanding obligation to enforce, by appropriate means, the domestic judicial decisions which remain unenforced in so far as the arrears in index-linked periodic payments for the impugned period are concerned (see, among others, Pridatchenko and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos.\u00a02191/03 and 3 others, \u00a7\u00a068, 21\u00a0June 2007).
