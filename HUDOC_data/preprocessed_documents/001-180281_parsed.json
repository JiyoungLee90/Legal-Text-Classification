It noted that Dr B\u2019s opinion at the time was that the applicant had a serious condition that required treatment. As surgery was not possible, the only alternative was medication. It was, the Court of Appeal held, reasonably open to him to hold that view. He had explained to the applicant the expected benefits of the drug prescribed, as well as the unpleasant side effects. As for the argument that the doctor should have also presented a \u201cdo nothing\u201d option, the Court of Appeal described this as \u201csomewhat unreal\u201d.

A 2009 working group report had proposed the creation of the Court of Appeal as the best option. The working group had also given consideration to simply increasing the number of judges on the Supreme Court, but had concluded that the idea was inherently problematic. The creation of additional judicial formations in the Supreme Court could lead to judicial inconsistency and would also obscure the true role of a court of last resort. The Government of the day had accepted the report, which necessitated the organisation of a referendum to amend the Constitution, and subsequently the enactment of legislation establishing the new court. It was the first such reform in the history of the Irish State and inevitably took time to complete. The Government regarded the applicant\u2019s proposed solution as simplistic and misleading. They emphasised the right of the respondent State to carefully consider which reforms to make to its judicial system, satisfying the concerns regarding the role and functioning of the Supreme Court and the need for legal certainty.",

As the Court has often stated, it is for the Contracting States to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts are able to guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision on disputes concerning civil rights and obligations within a reasonable time (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no.\u00a030979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII, and Superwood Holdings Plc and Others v. Ireland, no. 7812/04, \u00a7 34, 8 September 2011). A temporary backlog of court business does not entail a Contracting State\u2019s international liability if it takes appropriate remedial action with the requisite promptness. However, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law, a chronic overload of cases within the domestic system cannot justify an excessive length of proceedings (Probstmeier v. Germany, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 64, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV), nor can the fact that backlog situations have become commonplace (Uni\u00f3n Alimentaria Sanders S.A. v.

As the Government recognised in its submissions, during those years the domestic system lacked the capacity to deal with appeals from the High Court within a reasonable timeframe. While the Supreme Court was effectively unable to deal with the applicant\u2019s case for a prolonged period, the Court should also have regard, more broadly, to the actions of the respondent State in seeking to devise a solution to the problem. It is clear that the authorities were conscious of their responsibilities in the matter (see Buchholz v.\u00a0Germany, 6\u00a0May 1981, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 42). Furthermore, the Government have explained why the option of creating a new court was preferred to that of increasing the size of the Supreme Court. The creation of the Court of Appeal represented a significant modification of the domestic legal system, involving amendment of the Constitution by referendum, the passage of legislation and the allocation of the necessary resources to the new court (see also in this respect Brennan v.

The Nash judgment had not clarified the scope of any remedy for a failure to decide a case in a timely manner. Instead, it had underlined just how complex it would be to obtain a remedy in such circumstances. She objected that to require her to bring such an action at the domestic level would mean obliging her to continue with litigation towards an uncertain outcome, involving further substantial delay and major expense. She considered that the respondent State should have responded to earlier judgments against it by this Court regarding the excessive length of proceedings by introducing a statutory remedy.",

Ireland, no.\u00a050389/99, ECHR 2003X (extracts) it has consistently found the domestic legal system to lack a remedy for complaints of excessive length of proceedings. The objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies could not therefore be raised in such cases, and the Court found a violation of Article 13 each time such a complaint was raised in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see as the most recent example involving civil proceedings Rooney v. Ireland, no. 32614/10, 31 October 2013). More recently again, the Court struck out an application in light of the respondent Government\u2019s acceptance, in a unilateral declaration dated 19 January 2017, that \u201cthe length of the proceedings and the lack of an effective remedy in that regard was incompatible with the reasonable time requirement contained in Article\u00a06(1) and Article 13 of the Convention\u201d (see Blehein v. Ireland (dec.) [Committee], no.\u00a014704/16, 25 April 2017). It therefore takes note with interest of this first example brought to its attention of an action in damages for excessive length of proceedings, and of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of this issue in light of the relevant principles of the Constitution and the Convention.",

This refers in particular to the enactment of new legislation by States to remedy the systemic problem of length of judicial proceedings (see the cases referred to in Valada Matos das Neves, cited above, at \u00a7 102). Where the change in domestic law comes about through case-law, the Court\u2019s approach has been, for reasons of fairness, to allow a certain time for applicants to familiarise themselves with the new jurisprudence, the exact period depending on the circumstances of each case, especially the publicity given to the decision in question (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 104-105). Periods ranging from one and a half months (see Poulain v. France (dec.), no. 16470/15, \u00a7 29, 21\u00a0March 2017) to eight months (see Leandro Da Silva v. Luxembourg, no.\u00a030273/07, \u00a7 50, 11 February 2010) have been allowed. It follows that even were the Court to modify its assessment of the domestic system in this regard, this would not have any bearing on its conclusion on the complaint raised in the present case. Accordingly, the Court will refrain on this occasion from determining the significance of the Nash decision for the purposes of Articles 35 \u00a7 1 and 13.",
