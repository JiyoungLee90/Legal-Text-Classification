The Court further observes that where a supreme court refuses to accept a case on the basis that the legal grounds for such a case are not made out, very limited reasoning may satisfy the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see mutatis mutandis Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42295/98, 11\u00a0July 2000).
