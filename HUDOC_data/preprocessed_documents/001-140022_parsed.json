The applicant submitted that he had been working at the private tutoring centre since its establishment in 1985 and that his right to work was breached on account of this unlawful administrative decision.

The court further noted that the administrative authorities had been requested to provide information on the reasons for the termination of his contract. In a document sent to the court by the Governor\u2019s Office, it was stated that the applicant had been involved in a number of ideological activities before 1980; that the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka police had instituted proceedings against him for having committed an offence against the \u201cnational legal personality of the State\u201d; that he had been sentenced to ten months\u2019 imprisonment; and that he had been the representative of the Diyarbak\u0131r branch of E\u011fit-Sen (a trade union) in 1991. The court considered that the applicant had worked in State schools for a number of years and had been known to the administrative authorities when he began working at the private tutoring centre. It therefore concluded that the decision to terminate his contract, which had been taken on the basis of intelligence information known to the authorities from the outset, had been unlawful.",

These were the reasons for which he had been dismissed from his post.

[The Court] notes that private life \u201cencompasses the right for an individual to form and develop relationships with other human beings, including relationships of a professional or business nature\u201d (see C. v.\u00a0Belgium, 7 August 1996, \u00a7 25, Reports 1996III). Article 8 of the Convention \u201cprotects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world\u201d (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, \u00a7\u00a061, ECHR 2002III). The notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d does not exclude in principle activities of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity of developing relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz v.\u00a0Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no. 251B). Therefore, restrictions imposed on access to profession have been found to affect \u201cprivate life\u201d (see Sidabras and D\u017eiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, \u00a7\u00a047, ECHR 2004VIII, and Bigaeva v. Greece, no. 26713/05, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022-25, 28 May 2009). Likewise, dismissal from office has been found to interfere with the right to respect for private life (see \u00d6zp\u0131nar v. Turkey, no.\u00a020999/04, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-48, 19 October 2010). Finally, Article 8 deals with the issues of protection of honour and reputation as part of the right to respect for private life (see Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7\u00a035, 15\u00a0November 2007 and A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a063 and 64, 9\u00a0April 2009).\u201d",

Moreover, the reasons for the termination of his contract certainly affected his reputation. Specifically in respect of the protection of an individual\u2019s reputation, the Court notes that it has been acknowledged as an interest guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention (see Taliadorou and Stylianou v.\u00a0Cyprus, no. 39627/05 and 39631/05, \u00a7 45, 16 October 2008).

The Governor\u2019s office further noted that\u00a0the applicant had been the representative of the Diyarbak\u0131r branch of E\u011fit-Sen (a trade union) in 1991 (see paragraph 9 above). The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the administrative decision considering that the applicant had committed a crime against the State and that there was information to suggest that he had been involved in ideological activities for illegal organisations. The Supreme Administrative Court also took into account the particularities of the region (south-east of Turkey) where he had worked (see paragraphs 11, 14 and 16 above). In this connection, the Court cannot but notice the ambiguity in the domestic authorities\u2019 decisions (both administrative and judicial) and in the Government\u2019s observations, as there is no precision in either as to the specific offence of which the applicant had been convicted. Besides, neither section 48(A)(5) of Law no. 657 nor Section 39(1) of the Regulation on Private Tutoring Centres allowed for dismissal of teachers from their posts on the basis of involvement in ideological activities of illegal organisations and in trade unions or taking into account the particularities of a specific region.",

In this connection, the Court observes that these provisions were repealed on 12 April 1991 (see paragraph 17 above) and that the applicant\u2019s criminal conviction on the basis of these articles was erased by a court order on 22 August 1991 (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). The Court further observes that the applicant put these facts before the domestic courts, in particular, the Supreme Administrative Court, which failed to give any reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s claims. The Court reiterates in this regard that the obligation to provide reasons for a decision is an essential procedural safeguard, as it demonstrates to the parties that their arguments have been heard, affords them the possibility of objecting to or appealing against the decision, and also serves to justify the reasons for a judicial decision to the public (see, mutatis mutandis, Cumhuriyet Vakfi and Others, cited above, \u00a7 67, and Suominen v. Finland, no. 37801/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03637, 1 July 2003).
