The case originated in an application (no. 19949/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mrs Anna Vasilyevna Glivuk (“the applicant”), on 9 June 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska and Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 7 September 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the lengthy non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
In accordance with Article 36 § 1 of the Convention, the Russian Government were invited to exercise their right to intervene in the proceedings, but they declined to do so.
The applicant was born in 1962 and resides in the town of Shakhty, Rostov region, .
At the material time the applicant lived in .
In 1979, as a result of an accident, for which a State-owned mine was deemed liable, the applicant had her arms amputated.
On 23 September 1980 the Sverdlovskyy District Court awarded the applicant 80 Soviet roubles in life monthly compensation from the “Sverdlovskantratsyt” mining enterprise (Виробниче об'єднання «Свердловськантрацит»). The applicant had been receiving these payments until 2001.
In 2000 the applicant moved to .
On 11 September 2000, following the applicant's request to review the amount of compensation due to her, the  awarded the applicant a lump sum of 2,748.60 and 152.28 Ukrainian hryvnas in monthly payments from the State Krasnodonsko-Sverdlovske Mine Liquidation Department (Краснодонсько-Свердловське управління по ліквідації шахт).
In October 2001 the court sent the writs of enforcement to the Voroshylovskyy Bailiffs' Service. The applicant informed the Court that her written requests about the course of the enforcement proceedings remained unanswered.
By letters of 28 November and 9 December 2003, the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, and the Donetsk State Administration, respectively, informed the applicant that, since April 2001, the monthly payments were to be made by the Social Security Fund. However, at the time of the accident the applicant was not employed by the mine, and the legislation in force did not foresee social security payments in such cases.
In their submissions of 11 December 2006 the Government stated that on 5 December 2001 the payment order for the lump sum of UAH 2,748.60 had been submitted to the Department of the State Treasury in Donetsk Region. On an unspecified date this amount was transferred to the Bailiffs' Service banking account since the applicant's whereabouts were allegedly unknown.
The applicant informed the Court that in November 2006 she had been requested to provide her bank account details with a view to transfer her an above amount. The parties did not inform the Court whether the judgment of 11 September 2000 had been finally enforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).
