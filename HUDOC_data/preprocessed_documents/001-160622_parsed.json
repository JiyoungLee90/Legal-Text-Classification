In this respect the Court notes that the present case differs from that of Piechowicz in that the applicant was not charged with participating in an organised criminal group and therefore the regime could not be automatically imposed on him on the grounds of Article 212a \u00a7 3 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (see and compare ibid, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0105 and 168). The circumstances relied on by the authorities could indeed justify the imposition of the regime on the applicant for a certain time. However they could not suffice as the sole justification for extending the regime over such a long period. With the passage of time the procedure for review of the applicant\u2019s dangerous detainee status became a pure formality, limited only to indicating whether the progress of the applicant\u2019s behaviour was \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d. The decisions given by the Penitentiary Commission in 2011 and in 2012 submitted to the Court do not contain a proper reasoning. Only on appeal did the courts refer to the grounds originally relied on by the Commission (see paragraphs 11, 14 and 19 above).",
