In the same way as material goods, certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as \u201cproperty rights\u201d and thus as \u201cpossessions\u201d for the purposes of this provision (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999II). The concept of \u201cpossessions\u201d is not limited to \u201cexisting possessions\u201d but may also cover assets, including claims, in respect of which the applicant can argue that he or she has at least a reasonable and \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of obtaining effective enjoyment of a property right.

Thus, an individual can have a building in his ownership while the land remains in State or municipal ownership.

On 8 October 2005 the ownership certificate was issued to the applicant by the BCEA itself (more precisely, the Technical Inventory and Ownership Rights Registration Department of the BCEA; see paragraph 7 above).

As noted above, this order was never formally notified to the applicant, as a resident of the area, prior to the actual destruction of the house. The order contained no provisions either relating to the alienation of private property or referring to any decisions taken with regard to the resettlement of residents of the area, whether they lived in privately owned or State-owned houses. In fact, the order explicitly stated that \u201cit [formed] the basis solely for preparing the project design\u201d and for the relevant documentation to be obtained by the project developer. In such circumstances, and in the absence of any subsequent formal decisions by the BCEA or any other State authority in respect of expropriation of the private houses affected, the Court finds that the BCEA order of 14 May 2004, by itself, cannot be equated to a legal instrument expressly authorising the alienation of any privately owned properties located in the area in question.",

In this connection, the Court agrees with the applicant that those provisions were either irrelevant or inapplicable. In particular, Article 10 \u00a7 4 of the 1982 Housing Code was a provision of a general character that did not prescribe any specific cases of permissible interference with property or housing rights. Article 40 \u00a7 1 of the same Code concerned a \u201cliving space quota\u201d in State or publicly owned housing and was irrelevant in the context of privately owned housing. Articles 41, 89, 90 \u00a7 1, 91, 94 \u00a7 1 and 96 \u00a7 1 concerned the eviction and relocation of residents of houses belonging to the \u201cState or public housing fund\u201d and were therefore inapplicable to privately owned houses. Article 135 was the only provision of the old 1982 Housing Code mentioned by the domestic courts which concerned privately owned housing; however, it merely dealt in general terms with the requirement for compensation to be paid to the owners in the event of expropriation (it also appears that this provision was later superseded by other, lex specialis, legislation on compensation for expropriation). Neither Article 135 nor any of the other above-mentioned provisions laid down a procedure for the expropriation of private property or designated any State authority as being competent to conduct such a procedure. None of the above provisions vested competence in local executive authorities such as the BCEA or NDEA to expropriate private property or to evict private owners from their homes without a court decision.",
