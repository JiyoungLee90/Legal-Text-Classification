The application was based, inter alia, on the Cypriot Rules of Civil Procedure, Articles 30, 33, 34 and 35 of the Cypriot Constitution and Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The applicant complained that there had been an inordinate delay both in the filing of the action by the plaintiff and in the hearing of the case. As a result he claimed that deciding the issue of delay at a later stage would infringe the relevant Constitutional and Convention provisions and deprive him of his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time. The applicant maintained that the continuation of the proceedings would be vexatious and would constitute an abuse of the process of the court. In this context, he requested the court to consider the delay on the part of the plaintiffs in filing the action and the fact that, according to the Limitation of Actions Law (Cap. 115) the action would have been statute-barred several years before its filing, had the operation of this Law not been suspended by the Law of Suspension of Limitation of Actions (no. 57/64 of 1964), the constitutionality of which was challenged. Further, he noted that he had suffered damage because of the protracted length of the proceedings. In this connection he alleged, among other things, that important witnesses had died and that he would not be able to initiate compensation proceedings since one of the co-guarantors had died and Hellas Eurotrade Ltd had been dissolved.",

On 1 August 1995 the district court rejected the application. It noted amongst others that it had not been argued that the action itself and its continuation were frivolous or vexatious and thus, under the applicable rules, the application could not be dismissed on that ground. Furthermore, it concluded that the delays in the proceedings \u2013amounting to five and nine months- were not significant and did have any adverse effects on the applicant so as to justify the dismissal of the action. On the contrary it was more likely that the delays in the presentation of oral and/or written evidence caused prejudice to the plaintiffs who had the burden of proof in the action. Finally, the Supreme Court found that, in line with its jurisprudence, the Law of Suspension of Limitation of Actions was constitutional.",

Only in the latter context would it be possible to determine whether or not the trial had been fair. The protection of rights aimed at securing a fair trial and not hampering it. The Supreme Court further rejected the contention that the Law of Suspension of Limitation of Actions which permitted the filing of an action without any time limitation was unconstitutional as decided in its judgment in the case of Michael Paporis v. the National Bank of Greece (civil appeal no. 6897, judgment of 18 December 1986).

They stated that the Supreme Court had on several occasions on its own motion fixed appeals for hearing on an expedited basis, thus by-passing the usual pre-trial hearing stage and the filing of written outline addresses. The Government gave two examples of civil appeals in which the proceedings were expedited. Firstly, in civil appeal no. 11006 they noted that following the application by the appellant for an expedited hearing, the Supreme Court allowed the application and fixed the case directly for oral hearing upon preparation of the transcribed record, thus circumventing the usual procedure of fixing the case for a pre-trial hearing. Secondly, in civil appeal no. 11013 the Supreme Court on its own motion accelerated the hearing of the appeal allowing the appeal process to be completed in a period of five months. The Government also pointed out that in the instant case during the proceedings concerning appeal no. 10341 the Supreme Court had on its own motion fixed an expedited oral hearing and in appeal no. 9520 the applicant\u2019s lawyer had applied to the court for a hearing date to be fixed.

However, the Government pointed out that the overall delay caused by the de novo hearing of the case due to appointments of the presiding judges to the Supreme Court was very short and the case had been set for hearing promptly. Further, the delay before the Supreme Court as regards appeal no. 9520 had not affected the main proceedings since the latter had not been stayed but had continued in parallel with the appeal proceedings. Moreover, although the Government admitted that there had been inertia and unreasonable delay in appeal no. 7804, they noted that the Court should bear in mind that appellate proceedings were slower and that a hearing date had to be normally fixed for about nine months after the filing of the appeal. Thus, only the period thereafter could be considered as delay in the proceedings.

Furthermore, a delay of approximately four months took place because of the appointment of two of the presiding judges to the Supreme Court. In addition it is observed that it took the district court more than two years to deliver its judgment. This appears to be unreasonably long even taking into consideration the complexity of the case. In the appeal proceedings there were two considerable periods of delay. Firstly, in appeal no. 7804 a period of approximately thirteen months passed until the appeal was fixed for hearing and then, following an adjournment at the applicant\u2019s request, it took the Supreme Court Registry approximately one year and seven months to re-set the appeal for hearing. Secondly, in appeal no. 9520, it took the court approximately two years and five months to set the appeal for hearing. Although for part of this period the main and/or interlocutory proceedings before the district court were still continuing the Court cannot ignore the significant delays that occurred during the examination of the interim appeals.",
