In the present case, the need to grant anonymity to the witnesses had arisen as early as 24\u00a0April 1997 when a person, addicted to heroin at that time and later examined under the name \u201cJana Charv\u00e1tov\u00e1\u201d, had clearly declared that she had been ready to testify provided she was granted anonymity. Both witnesses \u201cJana Charv\u00e1tov\u00e1\u201d and \u201cJan Novotn\u00fd\u201d had insisted on maintaining their anonymity during their interviews on 11 July 1997, when they had expressed their fears of suffering reprisals at the hands of drug dealers and the risk of personal injury. Since drug dealing had been involved and dealers frequently use threats or actual violence against persons who testify against them, the witnesses\u2019 fears could not be considered groundless, even if the applicant had maintained that he had not threatened them. The Government pointed out that the need to obtain testimony from a specific person as evidence in criminal proceedings had been recognised by the Court as a relevant ground for allowing the witness\u2019s anonymity (Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, \u00a7 71), while at the same time protecting the witness against the possibility of reprisal by the applicant. In the Government\u2019s view, the situation of witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 in the Doorson case was similar to the situation of the present anonymous witnesses. The fact that the drug dealer had not assaulted \u201cJana Charv\u00e1tov\u00e1\u201d because she had testified against him, but because she had owed money for the drugs, was not a reason for assessing the potential threat as being any less serious.",

Accordingly, even if he could not see them, he could assess what the witnesses had been saying and the manner in which they had testified. He could also register the witnesses\u2019 emotions.

It is normally for the domestic courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see S.N. v. Sweden, no. 34209/96, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2002-V, with further references to Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series\u00a0A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89). Furthermore, evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3\u00a0(d) of Article 6 require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see L\u00fcdi v.

However, if the anonymity of prosecution witnesses is maintained, the defence will be faced with unusual difficulties. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that in such cases Article 6 \u00a7 1, taken together with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d), require that the handicaps under which the defence operates should be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities. With this in mind, an applicant should not be prevented from testing the anonymous witness\u2019s reliability (see also Kostowski v. the Netherlands, judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, \u00a7 42).
