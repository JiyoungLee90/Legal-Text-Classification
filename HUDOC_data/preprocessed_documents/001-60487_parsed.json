He delivered three separate judgments in respect of the applicant's appeal. The first judgment dealt with the scope of the phrase \u201ca fit and proper person\u201d in Schedule 5 of the 1968 Act. The second judgment considered the applicant's claim that he had a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d that the Gaming Board would be precluded from taking account of any breaches of its guidelines unless the breaches were unlawful. The third judgment, which dealt with \u201cWednesbury\u201d challenges and allegations of bias, ran to 165 pages. Mr Justice Jowitt stated that the scope of the judicial review was such that he was not concerned to review findings of fact, as for an appeal, but rather to assess whether the findings of the Panel disclosed illegality, irrationality (\u201cWednesbury unreasonableness\u201d) or procedural impropriety.

Thus where, as here, complaint is made of a lack of impartiality on the part of the decision-making body, the concept of 'full jurisdiction' implies that the reviewing court not only considers the complaint but has the ability to quash the impugned decision and to remit the case for a new decision by an impartial body.

There may be cases where the mere statement that a violation has occurred is sufficient to outweigh the frustration of the applicant, in particular when this statement may have consequences at the domestic level. That is the case when the applicant is able to seek redress of the violation found by the European Court of Human Rights through national proceedings or where he can seek compensation for non-pecuniary damage on the basis of such a finding at the national level.

The applicant, confronted with the legal regulations in England, found himself in a rather difficult position. He could of course have argued that the Panel of the Gaming Board was biased or gave the appearance of being biased. In the course of the judicial review proceedings, Mr\u00a0Justice Jowitt, dealing with the applicant's \u201cWednesbury\u201d challenges, dealt quite extensively with the problem of bias. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the decision to revoke the applicant's section 19 certificates should be quashed because the Panel was biased. Mr Justice Jowitt then stated that, even if there was unconscious bias on the part of the Panel, its decision would nevertheless stand because of the doctrine of necessity. This judge therefore gave the impression that the whole endeavour to look more deeply into the question whether unconscious bias was established was futile, as it was not decisive for the outcome of the case because the doctrine of necessity prevented any challenge in this respect to the decision of the Panel. The Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion, even if it assumed in favour of the applicant that he would have an arguable claim sufficient to justify leave to appeal that there was a real risk that the decision of the Panel had been actuated by bias. If the decision whether Mr Kingsley was a fit and proper person could not be delegated to an independent court, the decision of the panel under the doctrine of necessity could not be revoked or quashed. When domestic law does not provide any remedy to a situation where a biased board cannot be replaced by an independent tribunal or any other body, the situation of the applicant or any other person in his position becomes rather desperate.",

The situation is rather similar to that in Kud\u0142a v. Poland ([GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a0147, ECHR 2000-XI), where the Court stated that besides a violation of Article 6 a separate violation of Article 13 is possible in cases of length of proceedings if there is no effective remedy at the domestic level. There is only an overlap of the two Articles where the Convention right asserted by the individual is a civil right recognised under domestic law. In such circumstances the safeguards of Article 6 \u00a7 1 implying the full panoply of a judicial procedure are stricter than, and absorb those of Article\u00a013. But here the right asserted was the right to have an impartial tribunal. That is a separate legal issue from whether there was available to the applicant under domestic law an effective remedy to ventilate a complaint on that ground. In the present case a violation of Article 6 has been found by the Court and no effective remedy at the domestic level is available. Such a situation should either lead to a recomposition of the Panel of the Gaming Board or to a delegation of power to the High Court or to the Court of Appeal. The doctrine of necessity cannot justify in my view a perpetuation of the situation of violation. Under these circumstances, an exception to the doctrine of necessity has to be made with the result that a delegation of power from the Panel to the courts is acceptable. In such a situation, the only possible reparation is to grant the applicant a certain sum in respect of non-pecuniary damage, not for loss of opportunities but on an equitable basis for being in a position where he cannot find any redress under domestic law for this kind of violation of Article 6.",

With regard to breaches of procedural guarantees, the almost invariable practice of the Court is to refuse to award compensation for pecuniary damage on the ground that it cannot speculate as what the outcome of domestic proceedings would have been had the breach not occurred. I agree with such a conclusion. However, where a violation of the Convention is found, it is that violation itself which \u2013 beyond any possible pecuniary damage \u2013 causes the applicant non-pecuniary damage, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings. That is my view.",

Italy, judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89; B\u00f6nisch v. Austria (Article 50), judgment of 2 June 1986, Series A no. 10; de Geouffre de la Pradelle v. France, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 253-B; Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191-A; and, more recently, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, ECHR 1999-II, and Dulaurans v. France, no. 34553/97, 21 March 2000, the last two concerning specifically the guarantees of a fair trial (Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention)], seems to me to be an adequate and fair solution. In Doustaly v. France, judgment of 23 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, despite the lack of a causal connection between the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 and the alleged pecuniary damage, the Court awarded the applicant a substantial sum under the head of loss of clients and an amount in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. Otherwise, if the Court does not want to follow the \u201closs of opportunity\u201d approach, it can always acknowledge the existence of non-pecuniary damage arising from uncertainty (see Guincho v. Portugal, judgment of 10 July 1984, Series A no. 81), anxiety (see Keegan v. Ireland, judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290), feelings of helplessness and frustration (see Papamichalopoulos and Others v. Greece (Article 50), judgment of 31 October 1995, Series A no. 330-B) or damage to the applicant's reputation (see Doustaly, cited above) caused by the violation.",

In any event, in the light of the decision adopted by the majority, I have difficulty understanding why the panel of five judges agreed to refer this case to the Grand Chamber (see paragraphs 36 and 37 of the present judgment).",
