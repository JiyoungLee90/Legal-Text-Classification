The reasons, in so far as relevant in the context of the present case, were as follows. As to the applicant\u2019s claim that he was represented at his trial by counsel (H.) who had a conflict of interest, the court noted that the applicant had been informed of his rights but had insisted on being represented by counsel H. Finally, he had executed a written waiver retaining H. as counsel and confirming that he had been fully advised and had considered the possible adverse consequences for his defence. Since counsel H. had only informed the court in vague terms that he feared being charged or called as a witness in the applicant\u2019s case, the District Court was justified in accepting the waiver. In any event, the applicant was represented by a second, conflict-free counsel, D. As to the applicant\u2019s complaint that he had had no hearing in the forfeiture proceedings, the appellate court noted that the applicant, represented by counsel, had waived his right to a jury hearing in the separate forfeiture proceedings on the ground that they purely concerned matters of legal argument. The case had been heard on 26 March 1993 in the presence of the applicant\u2019s counsel. The applicant had not been present since he had to appear before another court. Counsel had requested that the applicant be heard but had refused the court\u2019s offer to have a further hearing in the presence of the applicant before the delivery of the judgment.",

Between 1\u00a0January 1990 and 2 April 1991 he had transferred more than USD 136 million of drug-related money from the account of a sham company to various foreign bank accounts. Thus, there were good reasons to assume that the applicant\u2019s Austrian assets were monies received for or derived from the commission of a crime and subject to withdrawal of enrichment under Article 20 of the Criminal Code, or monies directly obtained through drug dealing, subject to forfeiture under Article 20b of the Criminal Code, in the version in force since its 1996 amendment. The final forfeiture order made a clear link between the offence of money laundering of which the applicant had been convicted and the forfeiture of all monies obtained thereby.",

It has already held that measures, which are designed to block movements of suspect capital, are an effective and necessary weapon in that fight (see Raimondo v. , 22 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a030, Series A no. 281A). Thus the execution of the forfeiture order served the general interest of combating drug trafficking. However, a fair balance has to be struck between these demands of the general interest and the applicant\u2019s interest in the protection of his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. In making this assessment due regard is to be had to the wide margin of appreciation the respondent State enjoys in such matters (see AGOSI, cited above, \u00a7 52, and , cited above).",

The applicant was represented by a lawyer throughout the proceedings and had the opportunity, of which he made ample use, to submit his arguments. He was therefore in a position to effectively challenge the measures interfering with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Moreover, bearing in mind the respondent State\u2019s wide margin of appreciation in this area, the Court finds that the execution of the forfeiture order does not disclose a failure to strike a fair balance between respect for the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and the general interest of the community.",
