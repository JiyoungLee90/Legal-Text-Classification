Even in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct (see Labita v.  [GC], no.\u00a026772/95, \u00a7\u00a0119, ECHR 2000IV, and Chahal v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p.\u00a01855, \u00a7 79). Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, \u00a7 34, and Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2000-VII). In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7\u00a0161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch, \u00a7 34, and Salman, \u00a7 100, both cited above).",

It is also important to note that at the time when Officer S. was applying handcuffs to the applicant, Officer B.'s attention was diverted to disarming Mr K. and he could hardly follow in detail the events around him. The statement of Officer S. who had actually immobilised the applicant does not refer to any use of physical force against him. Before the trial court, all three officers \u2013 B., M., and S., as well as Officer Shch. who had been an eyewitness to the applicant's arrest, denied having had recourse to any physical force against the applicant.

For the investigation to be regarded as \u201ceffective\u201d, it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but one of means. The investigation into serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. This means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 103 et seq., Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). They must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard, and a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context (see, among many authorities, Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a0107 et seq., 26 January 2006, and Assenov, cited above, \u00a7 102 et seq.). Further, the investigation must be expeditious. The Court has often assessed whether the authorities reacted promptly to the complaints at the relevant time (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 133 et seq., ECHR 2000-IV). It has also given consideration to the promptness in opening investigations, delays in taking statements and to the length of time taken for the initial inquiry (see Indelicato v. Italy, no. 31143/96, \u00a7 37, 18 October 2001).",

The first decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings was issued just three days after the applicant's arrest, even before the forensic examination had been completed. A second decision was given two months later, on 19 June 2003, but its text repeated verbatim the text of the first one, without taking account of the newly available medical evidence and the statements by the police officer who denied having used any physical force on the applicant during the arrest. Neither decision mentioned the applicant's version of the events. It does not appear that the investigator heard him in person or arranged a confrontation between him and the police officers from the Shatskoye police station who had been allegedly involved in the ill-treatment. These failures alone, for which no explanation has been provided to the Court, suffice to render the investigation ineffective.",

Higher prosecutors rejected his complaints on several occasions in summary fashion and the courts of the Tula Region declared them inadmissible on the ground that the refusal of an inquiry into his allegations of ill-treatment had not impaired his constitutional rights. Their refusal to rule on the merits of his complaints was obviously at variance with the explicit guarantee against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment in Article 21 of the Russian Constitution and also with the established practice of other Russian courts. The Court has already found that in the Russian legal system, the power of a court to reverse a decision not to institute criminal proceedings is a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of powers by the investigating authorities (see Belevitskiy v. , no. 72967/01, \u00a7 61, 1 March 2007, and Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). Although in these proceedings the court of general jurisdiction is not competent to pursue an independent investigation or make any findings of fact, judicial review of a complaint has the benefit of providing a forum guaranteeing the due process of law. In public and adversarial proceedings an independent tribunal is called upon to assess whether the applicant has a prima facie case of ill-treatment and, if he has, to reverse the prosecutor's decision and order a criminal investigation (idem.). In the instant case the judicial avenue was foreclosed to the applicant. It cannot therefore be said that the applicant's right to participate effectively in the investigation was secured (compare Denis Vasilyev, cited above, \u00a7 126).",

Even though in 2005 the  had found that that practice was tainted with arbitrariness and therefore incompatible with the Constitution, at the material time such interpretation of Article 255 had been valid and endorsed by all Russian courts, including the Supreme Court. For that reason, the applicant's detention after the date on which the case file had been referred to the trial court (10 April 2004) was lawful in domestic terms. The decision of 13 May 2004 did not breach the requirements of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness because it had established that the prosecutor was to return the case within five days. After the case had been returned to the trial court on 17 May 2004, the applicant's detention had again been governed by the same interpretation of Article 255 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Finally, the Government claimed that the return of a case to the prosecutor interrupted the running of the six-month period.",

It has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without judicial authorisation or clear rules governing their situation was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Isayev v. , no.\u00a020756/04, \u00a7\u00a7 131-133, 22 October 2009; Yudayev v. , no.\u00a040258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61, 15 January 2009; Belov v.

Russia, no. 38031/04, \u00a7\u00a7 34-45, 17 June 2010). The Court's findings in the above cases are applicable in the instant case, as the Government did not advance any argument warranting a departure from the established case-law. Following the expiry of the detention order on 10 April 2004, the applicant's detention was not covered by a judicial authorisation. The Town Court's decision of 23 April 2004 did not mention the applicant's detention and its subsequent decision of 13 May 2004 merely rejected an application for release rather than constituting a formal detention order required under the domestic law. As the Court has emphasised on many occasions, applications for release filed by a defendant in custody do not exempt the domestic authorities from the obligation to authorise his or her detention \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d by issuing a formal detention order, as provided by Article 5 \u00a7 1. Finding otherwise would place on the defendant, rather than on the authorities, the burden of ensuring a lawful basis for his or her continued detention (see, e.g., Melnikova v. Russia, no. 24552/02, \u00a7 61, 21 June 2007).",

                                        "content": "72.\u00a0\u00a0It is further noted that on 31 May 2004 the  set the opening date for the trial and held that the defendants \u201cshould remain in custody\u201d. It did not, however, give any grounds for maintaining the custodial measure or fix a time-limit for the extended detention. This situation has also been examined in many cases against Russia, including that of the applicant's co-defendant Mr Shulenkov, in which the Court found that the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time was incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 1. Permitting a prisoner to languish in detention without a judicial decision based on concrete grounds and without setting a specific time-limit would be tantamount to overriding Article 5, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Avdeyev and Veryayev v. Russia, no. 2737/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-47, 9 July 2009; Bakhmutskiy v. Russia, no. 36932/02, \u00a7\u00a7 112-114, 25 June 2009; Gubkin v.

The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. It considers that the decision of 31 May 2004 did not comply with the requirements of clarity, foreseeability and protection from arbitrariness and that the ensuing period of the applicant's detention was not \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine whether the applicant's detention was also unlawful after 9 October 2004 on account of its being in excess of the maximum six-month period of detention \u201cduring the trial\u201d.",
