However, no steps were taken either to obtain further details from the applicant or to question the police officers who were involved in the arrest of the applicant about his allegations. The national authorities instead confined the case to the offence allegedly committed by the applicant and dismissed his allegations without further enquiry. Nor did the national courts elaborate on the evidence given by the applicant\u2019s witnesses or give any response to the applicant\u2019s allegations (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above).",

The inertia displayed by the authorities in response to his allegations was inconsistent with the procedural obligation which devolves on them under Article 3 of the Convention.
