However, the applicant was detained on charges of having committed several burglaries and sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. Even though the applicant was eventually found guilty of the numerous offences and the proceedings were directed against eleven co-accused, there is no indication that he was a member of an organised criminal group. It does not appear therefore that his case presented particular difficulties for the investigation authorities and for the courts to determine the facts and mount a case against the perpetrator, as would undoubtedly have been the case had the proceedings concerned organised crime (see Celejewski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037, and Malik v. , no.\u00a057477/00, \u00a7\u00a049, 4 April 2006).",

Even assuming that this ground justified keeping him in custody in the initial stages of the proceedings, it gradually lost its force and relevance as the proceedings progressed. Given the absence of any further attempt on the part of the applicant to obstruct the proceedings, it is difficult to accept that it could justify the conclusion that the risk of his tampering with evidence or going into hiding persisted during the entire period that he spent in custody (see Harazin v.

With respect to the second letter, of 10 January 2005, the Court considers that, even if there is no separate stamp on the letter as such, there is a reasonable likelihood that the envelope had been opened by the domestic authorities. The Court has held on many occasions that as long as the Polish authorities continue the practice of marking detainees\u2019 letters with the \u201ccensored\u201d stamp, the Court has no alternative but to presume that those letters have been opened and their contents read (see Matwiejczuk v.\u00a0Poland, no. 37641/97, \u00a7 99, 2\u00a0December 2003; Pisk-Piskowski v.

Accordingly, the prohibition of censorship of correspondence with the European Court of Human Rights contained in Article 103 of the same Code, which expressly relates to convicted persons, was also applicable to detained persons (see Michta, cited above, \u00a7 61, and Kwiek v.\u00a0, no.\u00a051895/99, \u00a7 44, 30 May 2006).
