The court found that the \u0160iauliai Health Care Centre had examined cell no. 101 on 7 January 2011, while the applicant had been detained there from 5 January 2011 to 3\u00a0February 2011 and from 14 February 2011 to 28 April 2011. The cell had been dirty, the toilet doors broken, and there was mould on the walls and ceiling. The health centre also examined cell no. 101 on 27 April 2011 and established that there was no longer any mould and the temperature was satisfactory, but the lighting was still insufficient. The court thus held that the applicant had proven that the conditions in cell no. 101 had been unsanitary. However, the court noted that the applicant had not proven the existence of unsanitary conditions in the other cells. The court further noted that the inmates were responsible for keeping the cells clean, but that the remand prison had not proven that it had provided the applicant with cleaning materials for at least six months. As regards the applicant\u2019s health, the court observed that he had been prescribed several drugs for spinal osteochondrosis, but that there was no relation between his illness and the unsanitary conditions in cell no. 101. The court also noted that during the hearing the applicant had claimed that all the cells had been overcrowded but he had failed to mention this in his written complaint. The court thus held that the case concerned sanitary conditions and not overcrowding.",

A\u0161mys, as indicated in the authority form, but by Mr S. Tomas. However, on 8 July 2014 the Court decided that Mr S. Tomas was not qualified as an advocate for the purposes of Rule 36 \u00a7 4 (a) of the Rules of Court and could thus no longer represent the applicants before it (see also the Government\u2019s pleas in Mironovas and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7 161, and Bagdonavi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no.\u00a041252/12, \u00a7\u00a058, 19 April 2016). It was the Government\u2019s view that Mr\u00a0S. Tomas was seeking to mislead the Court by formally using the other lawyer\u2019s name, while de facto continuing to represent the applicants. The Government argued that in those exceptional circumstances the applicants, who had been informed about the Court\u2019s decision on Mr S. Tomas, should have sought alternative representation under Rule 36 \u00a7 4 (b) of the Rules of Court. In the alternative, the Government argued that the sums requested were excessive, ungrounded and unsubstantiated. In addition, as copies of the payment order for those sums had not been included, some doubts could arise as to whether the applicants had in fact paid them.",
