The case originated in an application (no. 75567/01) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Slovenian nationals, Mr Jože Oberwalder, Mr Jože Oberwalder junior (“jr.”) and Mr Andrej Oberwalder (“the applicants”), on 10 February 2000.
The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General.
The applicants alleged inter alia under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the length of the civil proceedings before the domestic courts to which they were a party was excessive.
On 24 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the second set of proceedings to the Government and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible. Under Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the remaining complaint at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1931, 1959 and 1967 respectively and live in Domžale.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 8 July 1970 and 11 March 1971 respectively, four plots of land were sold to the Municipality by H.O., the late wife of the first applicant J.O. and the mother of the second and third applicants, J.O. jr. and A.O.
On 5 July 1973 and 4 June 1974, respectively, three plots of land were sold to the Municipality by the second applicant (J.O. jr.) and his brother (A.O.), the third applicant.
On 23 November 1973 and 10 September 1976 two plots of land were sold to the Municipality by J.O.
On 6 May 1992 the applicants lodged a request for the return of nine plots of land with the Domžale Administrative Unit on the basis of the 1991 Denationalisation Act, claiming that they had signed the contracts of sale under duress which was tantamount to expropriation.
On 7 June 1993 the Administrative Unit transferred their request to the  (Okrajno sodišče v Domžalah) as the competent authority.
On 13 July 1994 a hearing was held. The court requested the applicants to complete their request and submit further documents.
On 28 September and 29 November 1994, 16 February 1995, 23 March, 23 May and 17 July 1995 the court sent a letter to the applicants' lawyer, reiterating its request. The court also informed the new lawyer representing the applicants that it had received no reply.
On 18 September 1997 the court summoned the applicants to complete their request within 30 days, or else it would reject it or consider it withdrawn.
On 3 November 1997 the applicants filed the requested document through their representative and enlarged their claim, directing it also against the Slovenian Compensation Corporation (the “SCC”). On 20 January 1998 the latter replied to the applicants.
Further to their reply, on 10 December 1998, 11 February and 26 April 1999 the court requested the lawyer to submit further documents.
On 14 May 1999 the applicants through their representative filed the requested documents which were forwarded to the SCC. The latter replied on 5 July 1999.
On 7 February 2001 the applicants specified the amount of compensation claimed.
