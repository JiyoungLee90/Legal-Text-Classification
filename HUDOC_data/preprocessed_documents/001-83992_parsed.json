In its judgment the Federal Court considered whether there was an omission in the Civil Code with regard to the adoption by a cohabitant of his or her partner's child. It pointed out that the adoption of the spouse's child, whether considered as a form of joint adoption or as adoption by a single person, created a legal parent-child relationship between the child and the adoptive parent without severing the existing relationship between the child and its parent. It also pointed out that adoption should be in the interest of the child, so that joint adoption should be the rule and adoption by a single person the exception. The Federal Court noted that adoption by a single person was not subject to any condition other than that of the child's welfare. It concluded that adoption could satisfy that condition only if the link between the partners was strong and lasting, which in principle excluded cohabiting partners, between whom relationships were less stable than between married couples. That was also the reasoning behind the adoption of section 3, paragraph 3, of the Federal Medically Assisted Procreation Act of 18\u00a0December 1998, which entered into force on 1 January 2001 and restricted sperm donation to married couples only. The Federal Court reiterated in this connection that the Federal Council had explicitly stated that the requirements in respect of sperm donation could not be less strict than those concerning joint adoption, a possibility which was open only to married couples, that a stable and lasting relationship between the parents was essential to the child's healthy development, and that common-law partnerships were generally less solid than marriages and, unlike marriage, did not guarantee durability and could therefore not be compared with marriage. The Federal Court thus held that Article\u00a0264\u00a0a)\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 of the Civil Code could not be applied by analogy, and that there was no omission in the law that needed to be remedied. That court considered that the situation was that provided for in Article 264 b)\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Civil Code (see \u201cRelevant domestic and international law\u201d, paragraph 20 below). Concerning the Convention, the Federal Court considered that Article\u00a08 did not embody the right to demand a form of adoption that was not provided for by law. Furthermore, the very essence of adoption being the forging of new family ties, prohibiting the accumulation of parent-child relationships was not at variance with Article 8. As to Article 12 of the Convention, the Federal Court repeated that it referred only to marriage and did not confer a right to adopt. The Federal Court also considered the complaint concerning the applicants' unwillingness to accept the legal consequences of the adoption, and found that they could bring proceedings to have the adoption annulled for lack of consent. The judgment was served on the applicants on 3 October 2003.",

Even in those States which legally recognised cohabitation, the situation varied from one to another: the most flexible legislation authorised adoption by the child's parent's cohabiting partner, establishing a legal parent-child relationship by adoption without the other parent losing his or her legal status vis-\u00e0-vis the child (in England, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Luxembourg, for example). In other countries (such as France, Italy, Ireland and ) this type of adoption was prohibited.

Even though the first applicant is an adult, she needs care and emotional support. By adopting her, the other two applicants, who provide that care and support, hoped to make the de facto family they formed a real family in the eyes of the law. In that setting, the Court considers that \u201cadditional factors of dependence, other than normal emotional ties\u201d exist here which exceptionally bring into play the guarantees that derive from Article 8 between adults (see, mutatis mutandis, Kwakye-Nti and Dufie (dec.), cited above).",

Before the Court, the applicant party raised that complaint only at the public hearing held on 7\u00a0June 2007. However, in the eyes of the Court the Government's argument that the institution of marriage guaranteed the adopted person greater stability than adoption by an unmarried couple who lived together is not necessarily relevant nowadays.",

As it pointed out earlier, the concept of \u201cfamily\u201d under Article 8 of the Convention is not confined to marriage-based relationships and can encompass other \u201cfamily\u201d ties (see case-law cited in paragraph 34 above). In this case, the Court having found a \u201cfamily\u201d life to exist, the national authorities were under an obligation to take action to allow those family ties to develop (see, mutatis mutandis, Keegan, cited above, \u00a7 50; Pini and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 150 et seq.; and Kroon and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a032).",

However, even on the highly unlikely assumption that that Convention does apply to the present case, the Court notes that only 18\u00a0Council of Europe member States have ratified it and three signed it (situation at 1 July 2007). Furthermore, the draft revised Convention stipulates that the law may provide for the spouse or registered partner of the adopter to retain his or her rights and obligations in respect of the adopted child if the latter is his or her child (Article 11 \u00a7 2 of the draft revised convention, see \u201cRelevant domestic and international law\u201d, paragraph 25 above).

The Court has already found (paragraph\u00a073 above) that Article 267 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (see \u201cRelevant domestic and international law\u201d, paragraph 20 above) is particularly clear and unambiguous about the effects of adoption.

In addition, the applicants were represented by a lawyer before the domestic authorities. However, they cannot be criticised \u2013 and indeed the Federal Court did not really blame them \u2013 for not realising how far-reaching the consequences of their adoption request would be, resulting as they did in the severing of the legal mother-daughter relationship between the first two applicants.",
