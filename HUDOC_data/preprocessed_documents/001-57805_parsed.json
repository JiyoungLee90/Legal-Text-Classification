The interferences further reflected a lack of discrimination on the part of the customs officers, who took possession of purely private papers and correspondence and lawyer\u2019s letters and subsequently returned a very large number of the documents seized, which they deemed unnecessary for the investigation. Lastly, the interferences illustrated the authorities\u2019 hounding of the applicant, with the customs searches (visites domiciliaires) being turned into thoroughgoing general searches (perquisitions).",

In such fields there was a corpus delicti only very rarely if at all; the \"physical manifestation\" of the offence therefore lay mainly in documents which a guilty party could easily conceal or destroy. Such persons, however, had the benefit of substantial safeguards, strengthened by very rigorous judicial supervision: decision-making by the head of the customs district concerned, the rank of the officers authorised to establish offences, the presence of a senior police officer (officier de police judiciaire), the timing of searches, the preservation of lawyers\u2019 and doctors\u2019 professional secrecy, the possibility of invoking the liability of the public authorities, etc. In short, even before the reform of 1986-89, the French system had ensured that there was a proper balance between the requirements of law enforcement and the protection of the rights of the individual.",
