This interpretation was confirmed by the Court in Co\u00ebme and others v. Belgium (cited in paragraph\u00a023). The Court has also found that a court is not established by law where the rules governing the composition of a court have not been respected (as, for example, in Posokhov v. Russia, no. 63486/00, ECHR\u00a02003IV, judgment of 4 March 2003, and Fedotova v. Russia, no.\u00a073225/01, 13 April 2006).

None are to be seen in this respect. After quashing the resolution of the  the decisions of the lower courts were valid again. As the Supreme Court found them to be in accordance with the relevant law there was no reason to quash them, too.
