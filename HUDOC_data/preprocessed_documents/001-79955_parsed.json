The Government further submitted that they were not in possession of any documents showing the number of inmates in the cells in which the applicant had been detained. However, they considered that the fact that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells could not by itself serve as a basis for finding a violation of Article 3 of the Convention because the remaining aspects of the applicant's detention were satisfactory.
