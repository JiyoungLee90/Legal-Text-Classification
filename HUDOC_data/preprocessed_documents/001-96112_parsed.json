Administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Belashev v.

France, 10\u00a0February\u00a01995, \u00a7\u00a035, Series A no. 308). It does not only prohibit the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d is guilty before he has been so proved according to law, but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe that the suspect is guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (for a recapitulation of the relevant case-law, see, for example, Khuzhin and Others v. Russia, no. 13470/02, \u00a7\u00a093, 23\u00a0October\u00a02008). It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty (see B\u00f6hmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, \u00a7\u00a054, 3 October 2002). In this regard the Court has emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see\u00a0Daktaras v.\u00a0Lithuania, no.\u00a042095/98, \u00a7\u00a041, ECHR 2000-X). Thus, a fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question (see Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, no. 2947/06, \u00a7\u00a0166, 24 April 2008). Whether a statement by a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 43).",

However, it requires that they do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, \u00a7\u00a038). At the same time, the investigation and police authorities cannot be held responsible for the actions of the media (see Y.B. and Others v.
