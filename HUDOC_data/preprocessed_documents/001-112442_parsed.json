Then the applicant had pushed his victims into the rear compartment of a car belonging to Mr\u00a0P., had locked them up and kept them there for a half an hour. He had then demanded money in the amount of 3,000 US dollars as compensation for the damage to his car, threatening them with reprisals.

The District Court observed that the applicant was suspected of having committed aggravated robbery and hooliganism. It further stated that the applicant had absconded from the investigating authority and that a summons for a hearing on 6 October 2002 had not been handed over to him because he had not been residing at the address indicated by him as his place of his residence. His parents who were residing at that address had not seen the applicant for a long time. However, since the applicant was currently undergoing in-patient treatment, the District Court considered that there had been a valid reason for his failure to appear before it, that he had currently no possibility to exert influence over victims and witnesses, and that the decision on whether or not to remand him in custody could not be taken in his absence. It was also noted that the applicant had not been tried by a court in the earlier criminal proceedings against him. The application was rejected.",

The records drawn up by a hospital cardiologist who had examined the applicant were not complete and lacked essential information. There had been no medical ground for the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation on 25 September 2002. He could have undergone outpatient treatment instead. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s stay in the hospital had been delayed for no good reason. As regards the applicant\u2019s second hospitalisation on 10 October 2002, the experts concluded that by 17 October 2002 his state of health had normalised and he could have been discharged from hospital. The remaining faeces analysis did not require his stay in the hospital. The experts held that the applicant\u2019s current state of health was compatible with participation in the investigative activities and detention in a remand prison, provided that he was supervised by a medical unit in the remand prison until the results of his further tests had been obtained.",

The investigator stated that the applicant had been clearly delaying the examination of the case file. Thus, on 30 May 2003 he had acquainted himself with only nine pages of the case file, on 4 June with seven pages, on 24\u00a0June five pages, on 4 July six pages, from 7 to 9 July twentyseven pages, of which nineteen pages were incorporation documents of a company which he himself had founded, on 14 and 29 July with eleven pages on each day, and one day to view a thirty-five-minute video recording. During the period from 23 May to 8\u00a0August 2003 his two lawyers had often failed to appear for examination of the case file without any valid excuse. The Town Court established that the applicant, who had been examining five to eleven pages during periods of two to three hours each time, and had often requested to postpone examination in order to go have a bath or meet a visitor, and his two lawyers, who had repeatedly failed to appear at the investigator\u2019s requests, had been abusing their rights and deliberately delaying the examination of the case file and its transfer to court for trial, thus violating the victims\u2019 rights.

Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2000III). There is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7 76, 4 October 2001).",

At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7\u00a04 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are less concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would not be concerned, to the same extent, with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid).",

Nothing suggests that the applicant, having lodged the appeals, caused delays in their examination. The Government did not claim that complex issues had been involved in the examination of the applicant\u2019s appeals by the second-instance court. The Court considers that these four periods cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article\u00a05 \u00a7 4, especially taking into account that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see, for example, Lebedev, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0102 and 108, and Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7 96, 1 June 2006, in which periods of twenty-six, twenty-nine and thirty-six days were found to be incompatible with Article 5 \u00a7 4). The Court also deplores the fact that the appeals against the detention orders of 14\u00a0September 2007 and 24\u00a0February 2009 were examined after the relevant detention periods had elapsed and, in the last case, more than a month after the applicant\u2019s release.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (with which it has close affinity), that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system, whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7\u00a0December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 24).",

It considers, according to its case-law, that only those costs and expenses which were reasonable as to quantum and which had been actually and necessarily incurred in order to seek through the domestic legal system redress of the aforesaid violations and to have the same established by the Convention institutions are recoverable (see, for example, I.J.L. and Others v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos.\u00a029522/95, 30056/96 and 30574/96, \u00a7\u00a018, 25 September 2001). It is apparent from the material submitted that the applicant incurred legal costs in connection with his attempts to secure his release in the proceedings concerning his detention on remand, which are therefore related to the violation found under Article 5 \u00a7 3. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of EUR\u00a02,000 for the legal costs in the domestic proceedings. In addition to the EUR 850 already received in legal aid from the Council of Europe, the Court further awards the applicant EUR 500 covering the expenses in the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant on those amounts.",
