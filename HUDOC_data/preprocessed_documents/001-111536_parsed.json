The idea was to broadcast the film of the interview in the \u201cRundschau\u201d programme, in a feature about the trial of another person accused in the same murder case. It argued that the interview with A., who had consented to it, was a subject of public interest given that, even after her conviction, her case continued to attract a great deal of media attention. \u201cRundschau\u201d is a weekly Swiss television programme covering political and economic questions. Created in 1968, it is one of the longest-running programmes on Swiss television, and is currently aired on Wednesday evenings.",

Nor was the presence of a single cameraman and a female journalist likely to disturb the smooth functioning of the establishment or represent a security risk, especially as the filming should not last more than two or three hours and could take place at a time when the other prisoners were working. In any event the precise practical arrangements for the filming had yet to be finalised.",

Like the lower court, without denying the considerable media interest generated by A.\u2019s case in Switzerland, it rejected the appeal on the basis of section 5 of the order relating to the Criminal Code and section 48 of the law of the Canton of Bern on the execution of penalties and measures (see paragraph 18 below). It indicated that Article 16 \u00a7 3 of the Federal Constitution (paragraph 16 below) authorised access only to generally accessible sources. It considered that while representatives of the media were ordinarily allowed to visit prisons, the organisational and supervisory effort required for a television film crew was well beyond what might reasonably be expected of the prison authorities. It also considered that there was nothing to stop the applicant company from broadcasting a programme about A.\u2019s case using just an audio recording or a simple interview. It reasoned that for the purposes of a news programme on this particular theme (\u201cSachinformation\u201d), pictures of the prisoner were not necessary.",

It submitted that there was considerable public interest in the murder trial in Switzerland. Considering that the use of modern, light equipment would have limited any disruption of the smooth functioning of the prison, it argued that the court below had given insufficient reasons for the technical and security grounds on which its request to film in the prison had been refused. The filming could have taken place in the room set aside for prison visits, which could have been closed to the other prisoners. It also alleged that the principle of equal treatment had been breached, in so far as it had been placed at a disadvantage compared with other media.",

It considered that the same must apply to Article 10 of the Convention. It added that giving the applicant company access to the prison might infringe the other prisoners\u2019 personality rights. As to the applicant company\u2019s argument that giving some media access to the prison but not television crews amounted to discriminatory treatment, it held that the principle of equal treatment did not apply to the present case, as television productions bore no comparison with audio recordings or simple interviews.",

There is therefore no doubt that a report about A., who had been convicted in the same murder case and had always protested her innocence, would have attracted public interest, especially if it included an interview filmed in the prison where she was serving her sentence. The fact that the sequences in question were to be shown in \u201cRundschau\u201d, a current affairs programme with a serious reputation, shows how much interest there was in the subject at the origin of the applicant company\u2019s request (see, mutatis mutandis, Monnat v.

That being so, as what was at stake was freedom of expression in the context of a television programme raising a matter of major public concern, the Swiss authorities had only a limited margin of appreciation in determining whether there was a \u201cpressing social need\u201d to take the measure in question. Consequently, the Court will examine in scrupulous detail whether that measure was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued under Article 10 \u00a7 2 (see Monnat cited above, \u00a7 61, and Radio France and Others v.

Indeed, in order for a measure to be considered proportionate and necessary in a democratic society, there must be no other means of achieving the same end that would interfere less seriously with the fundamental right concerned (see, mutatis mutandis, Glor v. Switzerland, no. 13444/04, \u00a7 94, 30 April 2009; see also, along the same lines, Women On Waves and Others v. Portugal, no. 31276/05, \u00a7\u00a041, 3 February 2009).

It notes in this connection that in its appeal of 21\u00a0March 2005 the applicant company added that the precise practical arrangements for the filming had yet to be finalised. In spite of that remark, which can be seen as a sign of flexibility on the part of the applicant company, its request was purely and simply rejected by the authorities. Regard being had to the principle drawn from the Glor judgment cited above, and without wishing to speculate about the outcome of such negotiations, the competent authorities should have allowed the applicant company to submit practical proposals to make sure the filming could go ahead without disturbing the smooth functioning of the prison or order and security there. As to the Government\u2019s affirmation that the applicant company had only stated its willingness to film the interview in a specific place in its appeal to the Federal Court, it is important to note that that court rejected this argument on the merits, not because it was submitted out of time.",

However, the Court is unconvinced by this argument. Without having to comment on the merits of the argument, it reiterates that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed. It is therefore not for the national courts or indeed for the Court to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists (on the question of freedom of the press, see, among other authorities and mutatis mutandis, Jersild, cited above, \u00a7 31, and De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997I, \u00a7\u00a048). So the fact that a telephone interview with A. was included in the applicant company\u2019s \u201cSchweiz aktuell\u201d programme on 19 August 2004, available on its internet site, is not in itself relevant as it used different techniques and means, had a less direct impact on viewers and was broadcast in a different programme.

However, in view of the importance of the media in a democratic society and of the reduced margin of appreciation the domestic authorities have in respect of a television programme on a subject of considerable public interest, the Court considers that the need for restrictions on freedom of expression must be convincingly established and that the reasons given by the domestic authorities to justify them must appear \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d. In the present case, considering the rather summary reasoning put forward by the domestic authorities and the absence in their decisions of any real balancing of the interests in issue, in the Court\u2019s opinion the domestic authorities have failed to demonstrate convincingly that the refusal of permission to film inside the prison, which was an absolute refusal, was strictly proportionate to the aims pursued and thus met a \u201cpressing social need\u201d within the meaning of the case-law cited above.",

The Swiss authorities did not simply settle for reproducing stereotyped reasons: they pointed out that the organisational and supervisory efforts required for a television film crew were well beyond what might reasonably be expected of the prison authorities (\u00a7\u00a011). We fail to see what additional information might have been considered necessary.

Of course other details or points could always have been added. It is legitimate, however, for the reasons given by the domestic authorities for their decisions to be reasonably succinct. European supervision should be limited to ensuring that the reasons adduced are relevant and convincing and all the important considerations have been taken into account. What matters is whether the result of the courts\u2019 analysis is reasonable and justifiable vis-\u00e0-vis the Convention. The form of the reasoning, however, may vary from one legal culture to another, in keeping with the well-established traditions of the highest courts of the Council of Europe\u2019s member States.

However, such considerations cannot be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of a restrictive measure. In the present case the domestic authorities simply refused to allow an audiovisual recording which would have meant filming inside a prison. As to the proportionality of the refusal, allowance should be made for the fact that the added value of film footage of the prisoner would have served more to satisfy people\u2019s curiosity than to contribute to a general interest debate.",
