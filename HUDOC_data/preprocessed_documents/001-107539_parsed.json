Indeed, it was only the  who could institute proceedings according to domestic law. The fact that recently the law had been applied to allow the applicants to take up proceedings requesting a court to order the latter to act within a time-limit did not detract from the fact that it ultimately remained the duty of the CoL to take up these proceedings, and the affected individuals had no obligation to solicit such an action. Moreover, even in the event that ownership of land was at issue, it referred to the Civil Court\u2019s earlier reasoning in this respect (see paragraph 11 above) and, moreover, considered that the CoL could have instituted proceedings by means of a curator. It awarded them EUR 100,000 by way of damages and dismissed the remainder of their claims. It held that the taking of the two plots of land which were being used for the  had been in the public interest, the latter being an important economic venture for the country. The fact that it was later privatised did not take away the element of public interest, despite the fact that the deed of expropriation had not yet been finalised. Moreover, the one-tenth of the two plots which was outside the  zone which had remained unused could have been used for future development. It failed to take cognisance of the complaint regarding compensation, holding that this had not yet been determined by the LAB. As to the complaint about the length of the proceedings, namely thirty years for the CoL to initiate proceedings, the court held that apart from the fact that this had been related to the previous complaint under Article 6, the provision referred to proceedings which had already begun and had taken an unreasonable time to be finally decided; therefore it was not applicable in the present case which was still pending. Lastly, since the law had been changed, the composition of the LAB clearly satisfied the Article 6 requirements.",

However, it notes that in the Constitutional Court\u2019s view this breach was limited to the period after 1987. The Court observes that, in the absence of an express limitation, the Maltese declaration of 30 April 1987 is retrospective and the Court is therefore competent to examine facts which occurred between 1967, the year of ratification, and 1987, the year in which the State\u2019s declaration under former Article 25 became effective (see Bezzina Wettinger and Others v. Malta, no. 15091/06, \u00a7 54, 8 April 2008).

The fact that a schedule of deposit had been deposited by the Government in respect of Plot 2 does not detract from this conclusion. In respect of Plot 3, the Court finds it surprising that the Government\u2019s argument (see paragraph 32 above) has never been brought before the ordinary courts, particularly since the latter ordered the CoL to institute proceedings even in respect of that plot, and given that the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicants\u2019 right also in relation to this plot. In the light of the foregoing, the Court cannot but follow the domestic courts which have taken positive action also in respect of Plot 3 (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). The Court notes that not only was the offer accepted by some and not all of the applicants at the time, but moreover, in forty years the transfer of property has not yet been concluded, it follows that any such arrangement cannot be considered to be enforceable today.",

Sweden, 23 September 1982, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 52). The first, which is expressed in the first sentence of the first paragraph and is of a general nature, lays down the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property. The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. However, the rules are not \u201cdistinct\u201d in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. They must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Air Canada v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 30, Series A no. 316-A).",

The Court reiterates that because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d. Furthermore, the notion of \u201cpublic interest\u201d is necessarily extensive. In\u00a0particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is \u201cin the public interest\u201d unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos.\u00a046720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, \u00a7\u00a091, ECHR 2005-VI; Immobiliare Saffi v.

Nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review the Court must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the individual\u2019s right of property (see Abdilla v. Malta (dec.), no 38244/03, 3\u00a0November 2005).",

A similar situation obtained in the cases of Ke\u00e7ecio\u011flu and Others v. Turkey (no. 37546/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 8 April 2008) and Motais de Narbonne v. France (no. 48161/99, \u00a7 19, 2 July 2002). In the latter case the Court found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of a significant delay between a decision to expropriate property and the actual undertaking of a project in the public interest which had formed the basis of the expropriation. While the placing in reserve of expropriated property, even for a long period of time, does not necessarily entail a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, there is clearly an issue under that provision where such an action is not itself based on public-interest grounds and where, during that period, the property in question generates a significant increase in value of which the former owners are deprived (ibid., \u00a7 21).",

It reiterates that while deprivation of property effected for no reason other than to confer a private benefit on a private party cannot be \u201cin the public interest\u201d, the compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another may, depending on the circumstances, constitute a legitimate means of promoting the public interest (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7\u00a040, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a098). Moreover, the taking of property effected in pursuance of legitimate social, economic or other policies may be in \u201cin the public interest\u201d, even if the community at large has no direct use or enjoyment of the property taken (ibid., \u00a7\u00a045).

The Government considered that it was appropriate for a project of this scale to earmark land for future development. The Court is convinced that a project of this scale may require further expansion; however, it is of the view that the Government, when expropriating the relevant land, should have had some concrete plans at least for its forthcoming, if not for its imminent, development. Any further expansion after the start of the project or, as in the present case, one which might have been necessary four decades after the initiation of the project, may require further expropriation of land at later stages. In consequence, it cannot be said that the delay in making use of Plots 3, 41, and part of Plot 53 was itself based on any public-interest concern (see Motais de Narbonne, cited above, \u00a7 22, in fine). Moreover, the Government themselves acknowledged that the value of the land at issue had substantially increased over the years that followed the taking of the land, although they claimed that such an increase in value was entirely due to the project which the authorities had undertaken.

The Court observes, in this context, that although the  had been ordered to start proceedings and the proceedings were instituted in respect of two of the plots of land, the case is still pending today, eleven years after the institution of those proceedings before the LAB. The Government attributed this latter delay to the fact that constitutional proceedings were eventually taken up by the owners, and in consequence the proceedings before the LAB were suspended, and to the fact that following the end of the constitutional proceedings, the applicants failed to appear at the relevant hearings. The Court reiterates that the judicial authorities remain responsible for the conduct of the proceedings before them and ought to weigh the advantages of continued adjournments pending the outcome of other cases against the requirement of promptness (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq, cited above, \u00a7 43).

The Court has already held that awarding compensation reflecting values applicable decades before and deferring payment for decades, without taking into account this delay, is inadequate and constitutes a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see Schembri and Others v. Malta, no. 42583/06, \u00a7 45, 10\u00a0November 2009). Save for the interest, the LAB is constrained by law to keep to 1969 values, and it has not been shown that any account can be taken of such delays. While it is true that the constitutional jurisdictions awarded an amount in damages to the applicants, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s argument that such awards covered both currency depreciation and non-pecuniary damage for the violations suffered at the domestic level, the wording of the judgment clearly referring to \u201cmoral damage\u201d.",

Thus, while pecuniary claims in respect of Plot 41 and Plot 53 were premature, since the matter was still pending before the LAB, the Government contended that the compensation for Plot 2 should be that set out in the schedule of deposit filed with the domestic courts and that of Plot 3, the amount which they alleged had been accepted by the applicants in 1969. Lastly, the sums granted by the constitutional courts, namely EUR\u00a047,000, sufficed as an award for non-pecuniary damage and no further award by the Court was necessary. The Government submitted that, while it was unclear whether any fees were being claimed, the sum of EUR 1,000 would suffice to cover the legal expenses before the Court.",

It reiterates that it has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 6 under multiple heads. The Court considers that by awarding amounts for damage at this stage there is no risk that the applicants will receive the said dues twice, as the national jurisdictions would inevitably take note of this award when deciding the case (see Serghides and Christoforou\u00a0v. Cyprus (just satisfaction), no. 44730/98, \u00a7\u00a029, 12\u00a0June\u00a02003). Moreover, in view of the fact that the domestic proceedings relating to the payment of compensation have lasted for more than forty years, the Court considers that it would be unreasonable to wait for the outcome of those proceedings (see Serrilli v. Italy (just satisfaction), no.\u00a077822/01, \u00a7\u00a017, 17 July 2008, and Mason and Others v.  (just satisfaction), no.\u00a043663/98, \u00a7 31, 24 July 2007). However, in view of the submissions made by the parties at this stage, in particular the lack of any detailed calculations along the lines of Schembri and Others v. Malta ((just satisfaction), no. 42583/06, 28 September 2010)) with respect to pecuniary damage, the question of the application of Article 41 is not ready for decision. That question must accordingly be reserved as a whole and the subsequent procedure fixed, having due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicants (Rule\u00a075\u00a0\u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court).",
