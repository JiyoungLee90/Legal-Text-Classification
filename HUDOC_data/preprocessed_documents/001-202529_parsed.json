Moreover, the applicant company put forward that it had learned of the criminal acts committed by the supplier and the subsequent proceedings against its owner only in the course of the proceedings before the Court (see paragraph 16 above), which was not contested by the Government. Furthermore, the Court observes that the Government have also failed to show that the applicant company had known, or should have known at the relevant time, that the supplier had committed tax evasion. The applicant company therefore had no reason at any relevant time to suspect the supplier of any unlawful actions. On the basis of the above, the Court concludes that in the particular circumstances of the case, the applicant company had no reasonably available means to monitor, control or secure the compliance of its supplier with its VAT obligations (see \u201cBulves\u201d AD v.
