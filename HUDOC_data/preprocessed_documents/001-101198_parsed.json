The Court accepts the District Court's findings of 7\u00a0June 2004 (see paragraph 15 above) that, when arriving at his decision to refuse to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, the investigator confined himself to questioning the police officers involved. Even assuming that the applicant had indeed refused to talk to the investigator, the Court finds the latter's effort for establishment of the facts insufficient. In particular, at no point did he organise a confrontation between the applicant and the police officers to verify the truthfulness of the testimony provided by the alleged perpetrators.",
