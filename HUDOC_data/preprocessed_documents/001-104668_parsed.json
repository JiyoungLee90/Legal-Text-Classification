The applicant stated that on 6 January 2003 her relative Visadi Shokkarov and another man had been taken from the camp in Ordzhenikidzovskaya by armed masked men to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD in Ingushetia. After that she, her husband Visita and other relatives had gone to the ROVD to find out the reasons for Visadi\u2019s arrest. Near the ROVD her husband Visita had been approached by two men, who had come out of the ROVD building. They had taken Visita into the police station. The applicant had attempted to follow Visita, but she had been stopped at the entrance by the deputy head of the ROVD, Mr I.M., who had told her that Visita had been taken in for questioning and would be released shortly afterwards. The applicant had seen through a crack in the fence that her husband Visita and his brother Visadi had been put by police officers into a UAZ car and after that the car had driven away. After that the ROVD policemen had told her that Visita had been taken from the ROVD to Znamenskoye, in the Nadterechniy district, , by representatives of the Chechnya FSB. On the seventh day after Visita\u2019s abduction, the applicant and her relatives had gone to Znamenskoye, where the investigator of the Nadterechniy prosecutor\u2019s office Mr V.P. had informed her, having been in touch with the local branch of the FSB, that on the third day after the arrest Visita Shokkarov had been released from the FSB and apparently had gone home. After that the applicant had requested information concerning Visita\u2019s whereabouts at the Nadterechniy ROVD, where she had been informed that he had not been detained there.",

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article\u00a035 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and timelimits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v.

Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54, Reports 1996IV, and Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7\u00a082, ECHR 1999IV).",

The Government submitted that the applicants had not applied to the domestic courts. The Court considers that it is not necessary to establish whether the applicants did indeed challenge the decision to terminate the investigation into Visadi Shokkarov\u2019s death in all three courts as they in any event failed to comply with the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies for the following reasons. Firstly, even assuming that they did indeed appeal against the impugned decision to all three courts, the Court notes that the applicants, who were represented by experienced human-rights lawyers, did not inform themselves about the outcome of any of these proceedings in a timely manner (see paragraphs 21 and 22) and failed to provide the courts with appropriate information concerning their address or that of their representatives (see paragraph 21 above). From the documents submitted to the Court it follows that the applicants\u2019 representatives were able to receive correspondence concerning the applicants\u2019 complaints in the autumn of 2003 (see paragraph 37 above). Secondly, even after the receipt of the letters from the domestic courts (see paragraphs 23, 24 and 25 above), the applicants failed to provide the Court with a plausible explanation of their failure to pursue their appeals further with the appellate courts, or to apply to the district courts for restoration of procedural time-limits. Thirdly, the applicants did not furnish the Court with any evidence demonstrating that there existed special circumstances absolving them from the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies (see paragraph 23 above; see also Akdivar and Others, cited above, \u00a7 68).",

The investigation in the criminal case was instituted on 9 August 2003, that is, more than four months after the authorities were informed about the incident. Such a postponement per se was liable to affect the investigation of a kidnapping in life-threatening circumstances, where crucial action has to be taken in the first days after the event. It appears that after that a number of essential steps were either delayed or were not taken at all. For instance, the investigators did not take such crucial steps as questioning the deputy head of the ROVD, Mr I.M. (see paragraph 63 above), and police officer \u201cMagomed\u201d (see paragraph 65 above), who had assured the applicants about the release of Visita Shokkarov from the police station. In addition, it does not appear, in spite of the applicants\u2019 witness statements to this effect, that the investigators attempted to either identify and question the applicants\u2019 relatives or neighbours with whom they had gone to the ROVD on 6 January 2003 (see paragraphs 50, 63 and 65 above) or to question any of the employees of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD, the Nadterechniy prosecutor\u2019s office and the Nadterechniy FSB (see paragraph 65 above) about their possible involvement in the abduction. It is obvious that these investigative measures, if they were to produce any meaningful results, should have been taken immediately after the crime was reported to the authorities, and as soon as the investigation commenced. Such delays, for which there has been no explanation in the instant case, not only demonstrate the authorities\u2019 failure to act of their own motion but also constitute a breach of the obligation to exercise exemplary diligence and promptness in dealing with such a serious crime (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

But it concludes that this complaint is inadmissible as it was lodged outside the prescribed time-limit. From the factual circumstances of the present case it follows that on 7 April 2003 at the latest the applicants were informed that Visadi Shokkarov\u2019s detention had been authorised by the District Court more than two weeks after the date of his actual arrest (see paragraph 31 above). More than nineteen months passed from the date on which they learnt of the unlawfulness of Visadi Shokkarov\u2019s detention on remand and the date on which they lodged their complaint to the Court.
