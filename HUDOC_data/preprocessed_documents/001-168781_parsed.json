It argued that M.K.\u2019s involuntary placement in the psychiatric institution on 19 March 2010 had been necessary as he had not been aware of his mental illness and had refused to be treated. At the time, he had been utterly confused and it had not been possible to reason with him. Because of the threat he posed to himself and others, he had repeatedly had his freedom of movement restricted whilst in hospital and had had to be medicated parenterally. On 25 March 2010 he had left the acute station without permission and went to his parents\u2019 place. When the police and the ambulance brought him back to the hospital, he had had to be sedated intravenously because of the highly psychotic state he was in. On 29\u00a0March 2010, only four days later, he escaped again from the acute station, but was apprehended by the hospital\u2019s security staff on the premises of the hospital. However, from 2\u00a0April 2010, M.K.\u2019s attitude changed and he became willing to take oral medication. From that day on, his freedom of movement was no longer restricted. He had appeared well-adjusted and friendly. In view of the progress in his treatment, and as he appeared more reasonable and able to abide by agreements, he had been transferred from the acute station to the subacute ward on 20 April 2010. However, he had then succumbed to socalled \u201cdynamic exhaustion\u201d (dynamische Entleerung), which manifested itself in a noticeable loss of drive and the desire for a quiet environment. The hospital staff had therefore tried to animate M.K. through occupational therapy and recreational walks in the hospital grounds, which \u2212 on the basis of a well-documented medical order \u2212 he had been allowed to take on his own as of 21 April 2010. This medical order had taken into account the fact that M.K. had twice before escaped from his ward. Thereafter, however, M.K. had continued to receive treatment for over three weeks and there had been a considerable improvement in his condition. Moreover, he had been made aware that he was not allowed to leave the hospital premises and had to notify the staff before going out for a walk and again upon his return. He had also been permitted to leave the building to smoke a cigarette. The hospital had maintained detailed documentary records of his medical treatment and progress. There had been no indication of suicidal thoughts. However, on 12\u00a0May 2010 at 5.15pm the doctor on duty was informed by the hospital staff that the applicant\u2019s son had not returned from an authorised walk in the hospital grounds and had apparently taken his personal clothing with him. A search operation had immediately been initiated on the premises and at the same time the police had been asked to search for him. At approximately 9pm the police informed the hospital that M.K. had been killed in a subway train accident at around 4\u00a0pm.",

Self-harming behaviour could occur outside the hospital environment, due to overstimulation, even in patients who had shown progress after a psychosis. It was no longer possible to determine whether the applicant\u2019s son had jumped in front of the subway train in order to deliberately commit suicide, or whether he followed a spontaneous impulse or a delusional thought to that end. In any event the hospital should have made sure that he was not able to leave the hospital grounds, even if therapeutic walks were medically indicated and permissible in the circumstances.",

At the material time, the applicant\u2019s son had been lawfully hospitalised by a decision of the F\u00fcnfhaus District Court of 7 April 2010, which remained valid until 21 May 2010. Sections 3 and 33 of the Hospitalisation Act in force at the time provided that, in cases where hospitalisation had been ordered, it was also necessary to guard against threats potentially posed by the patient. Accordingly, the hospital was obliged to ensure restriction of the patient\u2019s freedom of movement in order to protect against potential damage. In the instant case, M.K. was allowed to take walks on the hospital premises because such walks were medically indicated. However, no measures were taken to ensure that he respected the restrictions on his freedom of movement. There was no effective supervision of his walks or their duration. By disregarding its duty of supervision, the hospital had implemented the Hospitalisation Act incorrectly. It was immaterial that the applicant\u2019s son had not shown any signs of suicidal tendencies because the hospitalisation was originally effected because of the danger he posed to himself and to others. Therefore, even if he did not pose a threat to himself anymore, the requirement for hospitalisation was still valid because of the threat he posed to others. In the instant case, the lack of supervision of M.K. resulted in the applicant having to suffer the shock of the death of her son. The court concluded that the civil claim was justified and granted the applicant EUR 15,000 plus interest by way of compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

In its view, there had been no causal link between the wholly unexpected suicide of the applicant\u2019s son and the alleged dereliction of the hospital\u2019s duty of supervision under the Hospitalisation Act. Although it was stated in the hospital admission report that there was a danger of M.K.\u2019s putting himself and others at risk due to his disoriented state, it was also explicitly mentioned that he had no suicidal thoughts. According to the expert opinion by Dr P of 25 May 2012, the continuation of M.K.\u2019s hospitalisation on 12\u00a0May 2010 was indicated only because of the threat he posed to others, in particular to his mother, but no longer to himself. This was the reason why his freedom of movement at that point had been restricted to the hospital premises rather than just the closed ward. The court found that in the light of the improvement in his symptoms, it was not unusual that he had been allowed to take walks for therapeutic purposes, even if it might have been advisable to allow these walks only when accompanied by hospital staff.",

It could not be established whether his jumping in front of the subway train was a suicide which he had planned even before he left the hospital premises, or whether it had been a spontaneous act of self-harm resulting from his psychosis. Naturally, M.K. would not have been able to commit suicide if he had been prevented from leaving the hospital grounds. Even with patients whose psychotic symptoms had improved, the phenomenon of overstimulation could occur if they left the therapeutic environment, whereas such a situation was much less likely to occur within the confines of a hospital. Section 3 \u00a7 1 of the Hospitalisation Act referred, as its purpose, only to the protection of the life and limb of the mental patient himself and third parties. The behaviour of M.K. had not been foreseeable because there had no longer been any indication of possible self-harm at the material time and his action was therefore not attributable to the hospital. The fact that the risk of self-harm could never be entirely excluded in the case of psychotic patients did not change this assessment.",

No new expert opinion had been obtained, and the hospital had not informed the guardianship court (Pflegschaftsgericht) that the threat of selfharm had ceased to exist.

M.K.\u2019s hospitalisation had therefore not been unlawful, even though he had been placed in the open ward from 20 April 2010. Contrary to the applicant\u2019s line of argumentation, the Otto Wagner Hospital had not had a duty to implement the F\u00fcnfhaus District Court\u2019s decision on M.K.\u2019s hospitalisation in a manner which compelled it to restrict his movement. This followed from section 32 of the Hospitalisation Act \u2013 according to which a hospitalisation order could be lifted at any time by the head of the institution \u2013 and section 33, which stated that restriction of movement was permissible in limited cases only. The District Court\u2019s decision had not defined the extent or duration of any specific restriction of movement. Section 33 of the Hospitalisation Act provided that a restriction of freedom of movement might only be used as an exceptional measure and \u201clast resort\u201d. Also, Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention restricted the permissibility of isolating mentally ill patients. Even within a closed ward, mentally ill patients had to have the widest possible amount of freedom of movement.

This was expressed through the provisions of the Hospitalisation Act and its explanatory reports and was in accordance with the development of psychiatric care reform movements that have been ongoing in Europe since the 1980s. The coercive approach to psychiatric treatment had been reduced, and it was intended to treat patients on a socio-psychiatric basis and, as far as possible, in a natural atmosphere. Unlike in \u201cclosed\u201d wards, where the measures restricting the patients\u2019 freedom of movement were laid down in general and externally recognisable organisational structures, the characteristic features of an \u201copen\u201d type of hospitalisation were individual restrictions on a patient\u2019s freedom of movement, which were effected in ways other than that of confinement to permanently closed areas. That this \u201copen\u201d approach would in practice inevitably result in more escapes was accepted, since the advantages of open hospitalisation outweighed the disadvantages of \u201cclosed\u201d hospitalisation. According to the literature on the subject, the frequency of escape from open psychiatric wards or institutions was in any event overestimated.",

Therapeutic walks outside the hospital premises in order to prepare for the patient\u2019s release after several weeks of inpatient treatment were subject to a particularly careful decision-making process and would only be permitted if they posed no acute danger to the patient or to others. The decision as to whether and when such preparations for an actual release could start was up to the doctor treating the patient in question. In determining this question, the doctor also took into account the assessment of the nursing staff, the psychologists and the therapists involved in the treatment and care process of the patient concerned.

It was rather the case that any restriction was admissible only in so far as it was strictly necessary and proportionate. This included, if appropriate, allowing the patient to temporarily leave the hospital premises. It followed from section 33 \u00a7 1 of the Hospitalisation Act that a patient\u2019s freedom of movement had to be restored as soon as the circumstance necessitating its restriction ceased to exist.

The third escape, which resulted in his suicide, took place on 12 May 2010, thus about one and a half months later, when he had already been transferred to an open ward. According to the comprehensive findings of the national courts \u2013 which were based on witness statements and an expert opinion \u2013 both M.K.\u2019s willingness to comply with hospital orders and his condition had significantly improved after 2 April 2010. From that time on, the national authorities considered that it would no longer have been proportionate to keep him in the closed ward, even though his last escape had only taken place a few days earlier. M.K. had successively been given more personal freedom, in particular because of the need to animate him to counteract the dynamic exhaustion which afflicted him, and in order to facilitate his re-integration into society. The domestic authorities had not found any counter-indication as he had at no point in his entire stay expressed any suicidal thoughts or demonstrated such behaviour. According to the expert opinion of Dr P (see paragraph 20 above), at the time of his fatal escape, hospitalisation was indicated only because of the threat he still posed to others, but not to himself any more.",

In Renolde v. France, cited above, the Court found a violation of Article 2 because the authorities had known from a previous suicide attempt that the applicant\u2019s brother was suffering from an acute psychotic disorder capable of resulting in self-harm. In the instant case, it appears from the hospital records that there had been no signs of suicidal thoughts or attempts throughout M.K.\u2019s entire stay at the institution. In these circumstances, it would not have been lawful under the Hospitalisation Act for the hospital to keep him in the closed ward any longer (see paragraphs 27 and 30 above). During the weeks preceding M.K.\u2019s death, that is to say from the beginning of April 2010 until 12\u00a0May\u00a02010, he had been calm, inconspicuous and had taken his medicine voluntarily. When he was given the freedom to take walks by himself from 21 April 2010 \u2013 more than three weeks after his previous escape \u2013 he had always returned from his walks as agreed. He notified the hospital staff that he was taking a walk before leaving and informed them again upon his return and \u2013 as instructed \u2013 never left the hospital grounds.",

In the instant case, from the documents at hand and from the fact that the hospital kept a detailed record of his treatment, the Court is convinced that the hospital staff could not at any point have had any reason to expect that M.K. would commit suicide, either on the day of his commitment to the hospital or on any of the other days during which he remained within their sphere of responsibility. The Court finds the above elements sufficient to allow it to conclude, just like the domestic courts, that M.K.\u2019s escape and subsequent suicide had not been foreseeable for the hospital and was not therefore attributable to it.",

As evident from the international law sources pertaining to the issue (see paragraphs 32-37 above) and as the Government has comprehensively argued, today\u2019s paradigm in mental health care is to give persons with mental disabilities the greatest possible personal freedom in order to facilitate their re-integration into society. The Court considers that from a Convention point of view, it is not only permissible to grant hospitalised persons the maximum freedom of movement but also desirable in order to preserve as much as possible their dignity and their right to self-determination. It also follows from the caselaw on Article 5 of the Convention that a deprivation of liberty must be lifted immediately if the circumstances necessitating it cease to exist or change (see, for example, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 33; Johnson v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1997, \u00a7\u00a060, Reports 1997VII; X v.

In the instant case, M.K. continued to be deprived of his liberty within the meaning of the Court\u2019s case-law even after he was transferred to the open ward, in so far as he was required to give notice of his walks and return to the hospital afterwards, amongst other things. However, the hospital had scaled down the extent of the deprivation of his liberty without delay when his medication started to work and he was compliant with the hospital rules. In the circumstances of the present case, the Court agrees with the Government that the advantages of an open hospitalisation of M.K. clearly outweighed the disadvantages of the closed option.",

In the circumstances of the forced hospitalisation of a mentally-ill person, Article 2 implies a positive obligation on the hospital authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from others or from him- or herself. The general duty of these authorities in cases concerning their obligation to protect the life of the person in their custody is to take all necessary and reasonable steps in the circumstances (see Keenan, cited above, \u00a7 91). The majority upholds the Austrian Government\u2019s argument that the hospital authorities had indeed done all that was reasonable and necessary, since they did not and could not have known that M.K. was at risk of committing suicide at the relevant time. But this question is a truncated version of that posed in Keenan. The broader question, which is relevant in these circumstances, relates to the duty of the hospital authorities to know whether, at the time of the unsupervised walks, M.K. posed a real and immediate risk to his own life in general (and not merely at risk of deliberately committing suicide). I argue that his medical condition clearly indicated that he was at such a risk, and that in such circumstances giving him wide freedom of movement was not what could reasonably have been expected of the medical authority.",

It is stated repeatedly in the applicant\u2019s claim and acknowledged in the Government\u2019s counter-claim that self-harming behaviour is likely to occur outside the hospital environment due to overstimulation, especially in patients with M.K.\u2019s condition. Thus, I cannot agree with the finding of the Court of Appeal, endorsed by both the Supreme Court and the majority of my colleagues, that \u201cthere is no causal link between the wholly unexpected suicide of the applicant\u2019s son and the alleged dereliction of the hospital\u2019s duty of supervision\u201d (see paragraph\u00a020 of the majority judgment). If the national courts were really to have taken the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia into consideration, they would naturally have contemplated whether a delusional patient might put himself in harm\u2019s way as a result of a psychotic episode, without any intention of actually taking his own life. Once this is established, the State authorities are under an operational obligation to take reasonable measures and to act with due diligence.",

The majority argued that the hospital was reasonable in allowing the patient to go on unsupervised walks and to report back at his convenience, in view of his seemingly improved state which gave no indication of suicidal thoughts. If the envisaged consequences of M.K.\u2019s freedom are not suicide-related but escape-related, then I would argue that the total lack of supervision represents a complete forfeiture of any obligational duty to implement reasonable measures. Although the patient showed signs of improvement, he had already tried to escape on two previous occasions. This cannot be completely disregarded when weighing the benefits of open treatment against its downfalls. As unfamiliar environments are likely to trigger delusional fits in patients with M.K.\u2019s diagnosis, his escape should have been a real issue for the hospital authorities and should have implied at least some minimal procedural obligations. The medical authorities failed to carry out such a balancing exercise, and by giving the patient such wide exposure to new surrounding they placed him in a dangerous environment which eased the triggering of his delusions and paranoid state (see Reynolds v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a02694/08, 13 March 2012).",

                        "content": "I also disagree with the Austrian Government\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he behaviour of M.K. had not been foreseeable ... and the fact that the risk of self-harm could never be entirely excluded in the case of psychotic patients did not change this assessment\u201d (see paragraph\u00a021 of the judgment). Article\u00a02 of the Convention also implies a duty to investigate in circumstances where a patient such as M.K. takes his or her own life. It is evident that it is no longer possible to determine whether the applicant\u2019s son deliberately committed suicide or followed a delusional impulse. Nevertheless, an investigation into the patient\u2019s vulnerability and the level of risk he posed to himself on account of his condition could have been conducted to determine the degree of control the hospital ought to have exercised over him in order to guarantee his safety during his walks. Thus, the fact that a psychotic patient faces a risk of self-harm is highly relevant to the circumstances at hand. It, firstly, implies a need for medical examinations into the patient\u2019s specific condition and, secondly, indicates that the hospital should be cautious, so as to ensure that it does not unduly provoke a psychotic episode which would increase the patient\u2019s chances of self-harming. M.K.\u2019s therapeutic walks could still have assisted his recovery even had some additional supervisory measures been put in place by the authorities. Thus, a balance could have been achieved, by granting him the freedom of movement that was deemed beneficial, while still policing against his foreseeable tendency to escape, which could have been anticipated to have destructive consequences.",

I cannot disagree with the findings of the majority, to the effect that the advantages of an open hospitalisation regime are far greater in the treatment of persons in M.K.\u2019s state than an entirely restricted hospital regime. Nevertheless, a balance must be struck in providing this \u201copen\u201d medical care, while still ensuring that the hospital authority imposes certain safeguards in order to comply with its positive obligations under Article 2.
