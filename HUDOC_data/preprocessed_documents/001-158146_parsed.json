The members of the Board regularly visited various divisions of the prison and received complaints from inmates; however, they were also competent to deal with complaints other than those made directly to them during the visits. The Government contended that complaints to the Board were not limited, thus there was no impediment to an applicant complaining about the material conditions of his or her cell. They emphasised that the Board had a duty to reply to such complaints (Regulation 107) and even though their decisions were not binding (Regulation 108(2)), where the director, or any other prison officer acting on his behalf, was of the opinion that the recommendations of the Board could not be implemented for reasons which were in the best interests of the prison administration, a written explanation of those reasons had to be forwarded to the chairman of the Board and copied to the Minister, or to a person delegated by him, within one month of the date of receipt of the Board\u2019s recommendations. The Minister, or the person delegated by him, may confirm or vary the decision of the director. According to the Government, that regulation thus imposed on the director the duty to issue a decision, which could be challenged in court through an action of judicial review (Article 469 A of the COCP), which the applicants could have brought with the assistance of a legal aid lawyer, in the event that they did not have sufficient funds to appoint their own lawyer.",

For example, in the case of Richard John Bridge vs Attorney General, the case (in connection with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction proceedings) had been decided by two levels of jurisdiction in approximately a month and a half (from 6 July to 24\u00a0August 2012). Although the Court had previously criticised the duration of such proceedings, in the Government\u2019s view any delays in constitutional proceedings were counterbalanced by the fact that those jurisdictions could issue interim orders pending proceedings. They cited for example a decree in the case of Emanuel Camilleri vs Inspector Louise Callejja and the Commissioner of Police (no. 50/2013), where the Civil Court (First Hall), in its constitutional jurisdiction, had released a sentenced person from prison pending the proceedings. In the particular circumstances of that case, the main witness who had testified in the applicant\u2019s trial, at which a guilty verdict had ultimately been returned, was subsequently put on trial for perjury in connection with her testimony. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, in the absence of speedy proceedings there nevertheless existed a speedy interim remedy which could be decreed by the constitutional jurisdictions under Article 46(2) of the Constitution and Article 4(2) of the European Convention Act.",

If an applicant has been held in conditions in breach of Article\u00a03, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the on-going violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is of the greatest value. However, once the applicant has left the facility in which he or she has endured the inadequate conditions, what remains relevant is that he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see Ananyev and Others v.

In such proceedings, courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. Such courts can also make an award of compensation for non-pecuniary damage and there is no limit on the amount which can be granted to an applicant for such a violation.

It follows that, once again, the Government have been unable to prove that constitutional redress proceedings, a remedy that is effective in principle, are currently also effective in practice, due to their duration.",

In the absence of any other comparable examples, the Court finds no indication that the constitutional jurisdictions would be willing on a regular basis to release convicted prisoners pending a decision on their claims on conditions of detention. Indeed, the Court has doubts as to the adequacy of such measures.

That standard should be \u201ccompatible with the human dignity\u201d of a detainee, but should also take into account \u201cthe practical demands of imprisonment\u201d (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, \u00a7 140, 22 December 2008). The \u201cadequacy\u201d of medical care in this respect remains the most difficult element to determine. The mere fact that a detainee is seen by a doctor and prescribed a certain form of treatment cannot automatically lead to the conclusion that the medical care provided was adequate (see Hummatov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, \u00a7 116, 29 November 2007). The authorities must ensure that a comprehensive record is kept of the detainee\u2019s state of health and his treatment while in detention (see, for example, Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, \u00a7 83, ECHR 2006-XII), that the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115, and Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, \u00a7\u00a7 104-06, 28 March 2006), and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at curing the detainee\u2019s diseases or preventing their aggravation, rather than addressing them on a symptomatic basis (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 109 and 114; Sarban v. Moldova, no.\u00a03456/05, \u00a7\u00a079, 4 October 2005; and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, \u00a7\u00a0211, 13\u00a0July 2006). The authorities must also show that the necessary conditions were created for the prescribed treatment to be actually followed through (see Hummatov, cited above, \u00a7 116, and Holomiov v. Moldova, no.\u00a030649/05, \u00a7\u00a0117, 7 November 2006). Failure to provide proper medical aid to a detainee would not fall under Article 3 unless there was an actual detriment to his physical or mental condition, or avoidable suffering of a certain intensity, or an immediate risk of such detriment or suffering (see Lebedev v.\u00a0Russia (dec.), no.13772/05, \u00a7 176, 27 May 2010).",

It would be of even more concern if, contrary to the Government\u2019s submission, the prison authorities were not making available the required equipment (be it a two-foot arm, or any other appropriate tool) to open and keep open high windows, as detainees should not have to put themselves in peril by having to climb on beds or sinks, or be dependent on other detainees to lift them up in order to access such windows.",

The Court reiterates, as it did in the Mikalauskas judgment, that it is uneasy about the fact that no heating whatsoever was available in the prison, in particular in Division 3. It is undeniable that in the winter months the country suffers from great humidity, with temperatures which can drop to a few degrees above zero, as was the case in December 2014, a period during which the applicants were in detention. The Court also observes that the applicants\u2019 allegations that other inmates were allowed heaters contradict the Government\u2019s claim that heaters were not allowed in cells for security reasons. The Court considers that, while the absence of a heating system (or alternatively a dehumidifying system) remains regrettable - as it would particularly help in connection with any mould or dampness present in the cells - in the current circumstances, detainees should at least make requests for further blankets or warmer clothing, which the authorities should be in a position to supply promptly.",

This is even more so if, as stated by the applicants, water was not always readily available to enable them to flush by using a bucket (see also CPT comments, at paragraph 61 above). This matter raises particular concern to the Court as this may cause unpleasant smells but also a perilous hygiene situation, particularly given that the toilets were situated in the vicinity of the applicants\u2019 beds without any partition. The Court has already held that the absence of a flush, accompanied by various other factors, such as dampness and filth in a cell, rusty washbasins and beds, as well as worn-out and dirty linen amounted to degrading conditions which were unfit for decent habitation (see, for example, Zakharkin v. Russia, no.\u00a01555/04, \u00a7\u00a0126, 10 June 2010). The same concerns arose in respect of toilets in cells with no water supply, accompanied by other sanitary issues (see Iacov Stanciu v. Romania, no. 35972/05, \u00a7 175, 24 July 2012). It is thus imperative that running water is available at all times, together with the relevant cleaning materials to ensure the required hygienic standards in each cell. The Court reiterates that it is incumbent on the respondent Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of financial or logistical difficulties (see, mutatis mutandis, Bazjaks v. Latvia, no.\u00a071572/01, \u00a7 111, 19\u00a0October 2010).",

Hungary, nos. 14097/12, 45135/12, 73712/12, 34001/13, 44055/13, and 64586/13, \u00a7 32, 10 March 2015). Nevertheless, the applicants\u2019 allegations made in 2013 concerning the actual functionality of the showers are supported by the CPT report (see paragraph 60 above) concerning the situation in 2011, and similar allegations continue to be made by detainees in Division 3, to date, as transpires from applications introduced with the Court in 2015 (see reference at paragraph 107). While the Government submit that the showers may be temporarily unavailable, it is surely inexcusable that over a span of five years the situation concerning the functionality of showers appears to remain problematic. However, even if, as stated by the first applicant, only one shower out of the four available was fully functional for an unspecified period of time, given that the shower room was open for approximately twelve hours daily to serve fifty-five detainees (allowing more than a ten-minute daily shower each), this cannot by itself raise an issue under Article 3. Moreover, it is not excluded that on a more regular basis the applicants had at least three showers at their disposal.",

The latter factors have a bearing on the general assessment of the conditions of detention (compare, Iacov Stanciu, cited above, \u00a7 175) and in this respect the Court will remain vigilant in future cases.",

The Prison Standards developed by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture make specific mention of outdoor exercise and consider it a basic safeguard of prisoners\u2019 well-being that all of them, without exception, be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day and preferably as part of a broader programme of outofcell activities (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, \u00a7 150). In examining the cumulative effect of the above factors, the Court cannot but take account of the fact that cells were unlocked at 7.30 a.m. and left open until 12.30\u00a0p.m.; they were unlocked again at 2 p.m. and locked at 8.30\u00a0p.m. Therefore inmates were free to move around and access the exercise yard, as well as other recreational facilities, for more than ten hours a day. Such a favourable situation has a particular bearing when assessing the applicants\u2019 conditions of detention. In relation to the second applicant\u2019s claim that he was not allowed access to the yard (paragraph 41 above), again, in the absence of a detailed and consistent account of such occurrences, the Court cannot but consider the allegation as unsubstantiated.",

Furthermore, there is no evidence of threats or other concrete attempts to dissuade the applicants from applying to the Court.

With all due respect, I find somewhat shocking the arguments put forward to reject those complaints. As regards the humidity in the cells (paragraph 114) the majority\u2019s argument is based on the photographs provided by the Government, which are clearly at odds with the CPT\u2019s report finding the contrary (see paragraph 61 of the judgment, cited above). The natural and artificial light \u201cwhile not ideal\u201d and \u201cwhile it is rather unfortunate\u201d (paragraph 115), does not seem to raise an issue. The same applies to the opening of windows \u2013 it could have been worse, according to the majority (paragraph 116). The lack of a heating system \u201cremains regrettable \u2013 as it would particularly help in connection with any mould or dampness present in the cells\u201d, but can be compensated for by additional blankets (paragraph 117)! As to the access to toilets, there is no problem either, even though \u201c... close proximity and exposure (to the toilet) is objectionable also from a hygiene perspective\u201d (paragraph 120). As regards the poor state of the showers, it is \u201csurely inexcusable that over a span of five years the situation concerning the functionality of showers appears to remain problematic\u201d (paragraph 122) and the lack of hot water is \u201cunfortunate\u201d but \u2013 luckily \u2013 \u201cin this respect the Court will remain vigilant in future cases\u201d (paragraph 123). What vigilance is being referred to here exactly?",

On the contrary, it merely states that it is not convinced that the general conditions of detention, although \u201cfar below any acceptable standard\u201d to use the words of the CPT, exceeded the level of suffering inherent in any deprivation of liberty. It adds that it takes into consideration the \u201cmedical treatment received by the applicants\u201d, as if medical treatment (which must necessarily be provided to any prisoner) could provide some compensation for all the aspects of the poor conditions endured in the prison.",
