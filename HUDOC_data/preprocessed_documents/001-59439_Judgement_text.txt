The case originated in an application (no. 45264/98) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Tommaso Palumbo (“the applicant”), on 11 September 1998.
The applicant was represented by Mr A. Nardone, a lawyer practising in Benevento. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 21 October 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant was born in 1970 and is currently residing in Benevento.
On 1 April 1992, the applicant, charged with sale of drugs (detenzione di sostanze stupefacienti a fine di spaccio), was arrested in Benevento. On 3 April 1992, the Benevento investigating judge ordered that the applicant be released.
In an order of 17 November 1992, the Benevento investigating judge committed the applicant and a certain Mr M. for trial, commencing on 24 June 1993, before the Benevento District Court.
The hearing of 24 June 1993 was postponed until 2 June 1994 because of a lawyers’ strike of indefinite duration. On the latter date one witness was heard.
On 27 April 1995, the case was adjourned to 21 March 1996 because the lawyers of the Benevento Bar Association were on strike until 6 May 1995. However, by reason of the political elections of 21 March 1996, no hearing took place until 28 November 1996. On the latter date the proceedings concerning the applicant were separated from those concerning Mr M. and adjourned because the witnesses summoned to appear were absent.
On 2 June 1997, the District Court ordered that a fresh summons be served on the applicant. The proceedings were adjourned until 9 February 1998, when two witnesses and the applicant were heard and the parties presented their final pleadings.
In a judgment of 9 February 1998, filed with the registry on 13 February 1998, the Benevento District Court acquitted the applicant. This decision became final on 27 March 1998.
