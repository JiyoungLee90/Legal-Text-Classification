Likewise, the open-ended nature of the list of confidential information contained in section 11 of the Information Act does not necessarily raise a question in itself. It is indeed true that work history, unlike education, is not explicitly mentioned in that provision. However, that provision is of a general nature. There may well be certain contexts in which it may be reasonable and, indeed, even imperative to interpret such a general provision as preventing disclosure of information about work history of an individual, so as to respect his or her right to privacy.",

For the reasons set out in paragraph\u00a0117 (old) below, the disclosure of that information would not have subjected the political leaders to public exposure to a degree surpassing that which they could possibly have foreseen when registering as candidates at the top of the lists of the parties contesting the parliamentary elections (compare ibid., \u00a7\u00a0195).",

Nonetheless, the protection of personal information of the political leaders constitutes a legitimate aim permitting a restriction on freedom of expression under paragraph 2 of that provision. Thus, the salient question is whether the means used to protect those interests were proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved (compare ibid., \u00a7 196).",

Moreover, they did so in the context where domestic law at the time designated information they submitted to the CEC as \u201copen\u201d (see paragraphs 38 above), even though the domestic courts interpreted that provision restrictively (see paragraphs 107 and 109 above respectively).",

They apparently attempted to take the latter aspect of the balancing exercise into account, concluding that the need for disclosure in terms of effective exercise of voting rights had not been shown. However, there was no attempt to assess the former aspect of the balancing exercise: the degree of potential harmful impact on the politicians\u2019 privacy. It was not even explained how the privacy of those two politicians who of their own will had published their CVs could have been harmed under the circumstances (see paragraph 24 above).",

However, it has to be taken into account that reasons were not a required element of an information request under domestic law (see paragraph 34 above) and, once it received a refusal, the applicant organisation explained its reasons in the proceedings before the domestic courts (see paragraphs 16 and 97 above). There is no indication that the domestic courts were prevented, by any rules of the domestic law or other considerations, from taking that additional information into account and possibly reassessing the CEC\u2019s conclusions in that light (compare, mutatis mutandis, Les Authentiks and Supras Auteuil 91 v.
