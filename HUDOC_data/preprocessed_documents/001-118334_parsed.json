As regards the Government\u2019s objection, the Court observes that, by its letter of 4 October 2011, the Registry gave notice of the present application to the Government. In a corresponding letter of the same date, the applicant was notified by the Registry that, pursuant to Rule 36 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 4 of the Rules of Court, he was required to appoint an \u201cadvocate\u201d at that stage of the proceedings and, in that regard, to complete and return an enclosed authority form to the Court by 28 October 2011. The applicant did so on 11 November 2011, claiming that the delivery of the Registry\u2019s letter of 4 October 2011 had been delayed. In addition, he submitted another copy of the application form with the words \u201calready served on the Court on 22 November 2007\u201d noted under each relevant field. The Court emphasises that the applicant\u2019s further submission of additional documents, including another copy of the application form, did not change the original date of introduction. Since the final decision in the present case was adopted on 3 September 2007, and the application was lodged with the Court on 22 November 2007, this objection by the Government must be dismissed.",

The first-instance court established certain facts and found that the applicant had a legal entitlement to the holiday pay claimed. The District Court overturned that judgment on appeal and rejected the applicant\u2019s claim without even making reference to the facts and the labour law as presented by the first-instance court. Nor did it refer in the impugned judgment to what the law was, how it should have been applied to the applicant\u2019s case or whether the conditions stipulated in the applicable collective and enterprise bargaining agreements had been met in the applicant\u2019s case. The District Court, while disregarding applicable employment law, rejected the applicant\u2019s claim on the sole ground that \u201cto accept the applicant\u2019s claim would mean that the applicant would be treated more favourably than his colleagues, who had not received payment of outstanding holiday pay from their employer either\u201d (see paragraph 8 above). This reasoning had no legal foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, De Moor v. Belgium, 23 June 1994, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 292A) and was based on what appears to be an abstract assertion quite outside of any reasonable judicial discretion. Furthermore, a connection between the established facts, the applicable law and the outcome of the proceedings is wholly absent from the impugned judgment. The Court therefore finds that such an arbitrary District Court\u2019s ruling has amounted to a denial of justice in the applicant\u2019s case (see, albeit in the context of assessment of evidence, Khamidov v. Russia, no. 72118/01, \u00a7 175, 15 November 2007, and contrast to Camilleri v. Malta (dec.), no. 51760/99, 16 March 2000).",
