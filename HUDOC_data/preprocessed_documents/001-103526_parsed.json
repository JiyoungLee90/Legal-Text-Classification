Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2006III). That being said, the Court has held that the procedural obligation arising from a disappearance will generally remain as long as the whereabouts and fate of the person are unaccounted for and it is thus of a continuing nature (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, \u00a7\u00a7 147-49, ECHR 2009...). Furthermore, that obligation does not come to an end even on discovery of the body or the presumption of death. This only casts light on one aspect of the fate of the missing person and the obligation to account for the disappearance and death, as well as to identify and prosecute any perpetrator of unlawful acts in that connection, will generally remain (ibid., \u00a7 145).",

Where there are initiatives being pursued in regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided.

While it is true that the domestic authorities made slow progress in the years immediately after the war, they have since made significant efforts to locate and identify persons missing as a consequence of the war and combat the impunity. To start with,  has carried out comprehensive vetting of the appointment of police and judiciary: the United Nations Mission vetted approximately 24,000 police officers between 1999 and 2002 and the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Councils screened the appointments of approximately 1,000 judges and prosecutors between 2002 and 2004. Secondly, the domestic Missing Persons Institute was set up pursuant to the Missing Persons Act 2004 (see paragraph 40 above). It has so far carried out many exhumations and identifications; for example, in seven months of 2009 the Missing Persons Institute identified 883 persons. Thirdly, the creation of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002 and its War Crimes Sections in 2005 gave new impetus to domestic prosecutions of war crimes. That court has so far sentenced more than 40 people. Moreover, the number of convictions by the Entity and District courts, which retain jurisdiction over less sensitive cases, has considerably increased. Fourthly, in December 2008 the domestic authorities adopted the National War Crimes Strategy which provides a systematic approach to solving the problem of the large number of war crimes cases. It defines the time-frames, capacities, criteria and mechanisms for managing those cases, standardisation of court practices, issues of regional cooperation, protection and support to victims and witnesses, as well as financial aspects, and supervision over the implementation of the Strategy. One of its objectives is to process the most complex and top priority cases within seven years (that is, by the end of 2015) and other war crimes cases within fifteen years (that is, by the end of 2023), a not unreasonable period of time considering the numbers involved. Lastly, domestic authorities contribute to the successful work of the international bodies set up to deal with disappearances and other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina (see paragraphs 7-8 above).",

Moldova and  [GC], no.\u00a048787/99, \u00a7\u00a7 330-31, ECHR 2004VII) given that the applicant could have reported this case herself to the Serbia\u2019s War Crimes Prosecutor who has jurisdiction over serious violations of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in the former Yugoslavia (see paragraph 41 above). Moreover, it is open to the applicant to lodge an application against Serbia if she considers that she is the victim of a breach by  of her Convention rights. The applicant also referred to the case of Mr Vlahovi\u0107 (see paragraph 61 above). However, Mr Vlahovi\u0107 is not a Spanish citizen and there were accordingly no obstacles to his extradition. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the domestic criminal investigation was effective in the sense that it was capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the disappearance and death of Mr Pali\u0107, notwithstanding the fact that there have not yet been any convictions in this connection. The procedural obligation under Article 2 is indeed not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among many authorities, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2001III).",

It is equally possible that he could have obtained this information from anyone on the ad hoc commissions or from any other source.

While there is no proof that Mr Bukva had indeed attended the impugned meeting, it is regrettable that the respondent Government did not respond to these allegations. Nevertheless, given that in the circumstances of this case an effective and independent criminal investigation was the key requirement to ensure the respondent State\u2019s compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 2 (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.

Some steps were then taken in early 2002, but the criminal investigation effectively started only in late 2005. It is nevertheless the case that the Court is only competent ratione temporis to look at the period after the ratification of the Convention by  (that is, after 12 July 2002), while taking into consideration the state of the case at that date. It should also be reiterated that the obligations under Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, although in a different context, Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VIII). The Court takes into account the complex situation in , notably in the first ten years following the war. In such a post-conflict situation, what amounts to an impossible and/or disproportionate burden must be measured by the very particular facts and context. In this connection, the Court notes that more than 100,000 people were killed, almost 30,000 people went missing and more than two million people were displaced during the war in . Inevitably choices had to be made in terms of post-war priorities and resources. Furthermore, after a long and brutal war, Bosnia and Herzegovina underwent fundamental overhaul of its internal structure and political system: Entities and Cantons were set up pursuant to the Dayton Peace Agreement, power-sharing arrangements were introduced in order to ensure effective equality between the \u201cconstituent peoples\u201d in the post-conflict society (see Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v.  [GC], nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06, ECHR 2009...), new institutions had to be created and the existing ones had to be restructured. Some reluctance on the part of the former warring parties to work with those new institutions could be expected in the post-war period, as evidenced in the present case. While it is difficult to pinpoint when exactly this process ended, the Court considers that the domestic legal system should have become capable of dealing effectively with disappearances and other serious violations of international humanitarian law by 2005, following comprehensive vetting of the appointment of police and judiciary and the establishment of the War Crimes Sections within the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (see paragraph 51 above). All this considered and since there has been no substantial period of inactivity post-2005 on the part of the domestic authorities in the present case, the Court concludes that, in the circumstances obtaining at the material time, the domestic criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted with reasonable promptness and expedition.",

The essence of the violation is not that there has been a serious human rights violation concerning the missing person; it lies in the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it has been brought to their attention. Other relevant factors include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, and the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person. The finding of such a violation is not limited to cases where the respondent State has been held responsible for the disappearance, but can arise where the failure of the authorities to respond to the quest for information by the relatives or the obstacles placed in their way, leaving them to bear the brunt of the efforts to uncover any facts, may be regarded as disclosing a flagrant, continuous and callous disregard of an obligation to account for the whereabouts and fate of a missing person (see Varnava and Others, cited above, \u00a7 200, and the authorities cited therein).",

In addition, the investigation ultimately led to the identification of persons suspected of having been responsible for the enforced disappearance of Mr Pali\u0107: a domestic arrest warrant was issued by the authorities of the Republika Srpska in February 2002 against Mr Pe\u0107anac, a security officer of the main staff of the VRS who had taken Mr Pali\u0107 from Vanekov mlin prison; in April 2006, the report of the second ad hoc commission established that on capture Mr Pali\u0107 had been handed over to Mr Tolimir, Assistant Commander for Intelligence and Security of the Main Staff of the VRS and that Mr Pe\u0107anac and his driver, Mr Mijatovi\u0107, had taken Mr Pali\u0107 from the prison on the night of 4-5 September 1995; in December 2006, international arrest warrants were issued against Mr Pe\u0107anac and Mr Mijatovi\u0107 by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and in December 2009 Mr Tolomir was charged before the ICTY with the murder of Mr Pali\u0107 as part of a joint criminal enterprise.",

The identification of the body of Mr Pali\u0107 occurred over fourteen years after his disappearance and some three years after the applicant had requested the respondent Government to examine the mortal remains discovered at the same site to determine if they were those of her husband. The international arrest warrants against two of those suspected of direct involvement in the disappearance were issued eleven and a half years after the disappearance and neither of the suspects has, as yet, been brought to justice, both having moved to Serbia where they currently live. These very substantial periods of delay would of themselves call into question whether the investigation satisfied the requirements of promptness in Article 2. These doubts are, in our view, strongly reinforced when seen in the context of the assessments made of the effectiveness of the investigation by the national tribunals and other official bodies of the respondent State.",

Nearly a year elapsed before the authorities of the Entity, which had in the proceedings before the Chamber continued to deny any knowledge of the arrest of Mr Pali\u0107, eventually acknowledged in November 2001 that he had been held in Vanekov mlin, a military prison administered by the VRS forces and that he had been taken from that prison by Mr Pe\u0107anac. It took a further three months for a domestic arrest warrant to be issued against Mr Pe\u0107anac, who had by then settled in . In the subsequent months, the entire war-time personnel of Vanekov mlin, including the governor were interviewed. However, the questions put to the personnel of the prison were subsequently found by the Human Rights Commission to have been inappropriate and irrelevant in the context of the investigation, being questions of a general nature and not directed to the events of the relevant days when Mr Pali\u0107 had been detained there.",

In July 2005, the High Representative wrote to the Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska to complain that the applicant had never received any results of a satisfactory investigation, let alone her husband\u2019s mortal remains. In September of that year, the Human Rights Commission, which had replaced the Human Rights Chamber, rendered a further decision in the case, holding that the judgment of 9 December 2000 had not yet been fully enforced and granting the Republika Srpska an additional three-months period in which to do so. This led to the interviewing of 18 people in connection with the case, including Mr Pe\u0107anac, by the authorities of the Republika Srpska and by those of , at the request of the Entity. However, on 16 January 2006 the Commission repeated that the core element of the decision of December 2000 had still not been complied with: Mr Pali\u0107 had not been released if he was still alive and, if he had been killed, his mortal remains had not been made available and no prosecution had been brought. In a letter written three days later, the High Representative once again complained of the failure of the Republika Srpska to comply with the Chamber\u2019s decision and required the establishment of a Government commission to implement the decision and assemble the facts necessary to provide the applicant with the information she had been denied.",

The first ad hoc commission adopted its report on 20\u00a0April 2006, in which it established that Mr Pali\u0107 had been captured by the VRS forces and handed over to Mr Tolimir, that he had been held in Vanekov mlin and interrogated daily by security officers of the VRS and that he had been removed by Mr Pe\u0107anac from the prison on the night of 4-5 September 1995. Doubts were cast on the veracity of the account given by Mr Pe\u0107anac that Mr Pali\u0107 had been taken to Han Pijesak and there handed over to Mr Jovo Mari\u0107, since the report established that Mr Mari\u0107 had not been in Han Pijesak at that time.",

A second ad hoc commission was created in December 2006, six years after the Chamber\u2019s decision, which in March 2007 established for the first time that Mr Pali\u0107 had been buried in a mass grave in Rasadnik and that, since a search of that area had proved fruitless, his body might have been transferred to a secondary mass grave in Vragolovi, where nine unidentified bodies had been exhumed in November 2001.

As to the requirement of independence, despite the doubts which are raised in paragraph 66 of the judgment, we are willing to accept that the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office acted independently. However, the independence of the ad hoc commissions is open to serious doubt and we share the concern of the majority that the respondent Government have failed to respond to the allegation that one of the members of the commission played a role in the actual disappearance of the applicant\u2019s husband. Where we cannot agree with the majority is in their view that it is not necessary to examine the question of the independence of the commissions since they had no influence on the conduct of the ongoing criminal investigation which was in their view the \u201ckey requirement\u201d to ensure compliance with the procedural obligations under Article 2. This, in our view, is to place too narrow an interpretation on the requirements of that Article in the case of enforced disappearances, which are not confined to the conduct of criminal investigations but include other forms of investigation designed to establish the circumstances of the disappearance and the fate of the person concerned. The independence of the ad hoc commissions, which the judgment accepts played an important role in the establishment of the facts of the case, is, we consider, of evident importance in assessing the effectiveness of the investigation.",

The judgment acknowledges that there were \u201cinitial delays\u201d in the investigation, the admission that Mr Pali\u0107 had been held in a military prison and removed from there having only been made in November 2001 and the criminal investigation having only effectively started in late 2005. It is also acknowledged that, although the Court is only competent ratione temporis to examine the period after the ratification of the Convention by the respondent State on 12 July 2002, it is entitled to take into consideration the state of the case at that date. However, in concluding that the domestic criminal investigation could be considered to have been conducted with reasonable promptness and expedition, reliance is placed in the judgment on the fact that Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the national authorities. It is said that the situation in , notably in the 10 years following the war, was a complex one and that in a post-conflict situation in which many thousands had been killed or had disappeared and two million had been displaced, choices had inevitably to be made in terms of post-war priorities and resources. It is the view of the majority that it was only in 2005 that the domestic legal system should have become capable of dealing effectively with disappearances and that there had been no substantial period of inactivity post-2005 on the part of the national authorities in the present case.",

We accept, too, that what would amount to an impossible or disproportionate burden must be measured in the light of the particular facts and context, which in the present case differ in their nature and complexity from those examined by the Court in other cases, including that of Varnava and Others. However, as pointed out in that case (paragraph 191), even where there may be obstacles which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts .In the present case, we are unable to ignore not only the serious delays which had occurred in the investigation in the years prior to 2006, which may well have prejudiced the possibility of bringing those responsible to justice, but the fact that the authorities remained virtually supine despite the clear findings and orders of the national tribunals which had been set up with the specific purpose of ensuring the effective protection of human rights. The case of Mr Pali\u0107 was no ordinary case. His disappearance in the circumstances in which it had occurred was an incident of particular notoriety and the urgency and importance of its investigation (whether criminal or otherwise) was underlined by the repeated decisions of the Human Rights Chamber and Commission, as well as by the letters of the successive High Representatives. It may well be, as suggested in the judgment, that part of the explanation for the lack of activity was the reluctance of the former warring parties to work with the new institutions. But, while this may explain, it cannot justify, non-compliance with the orders of such institutions. Nor, in our view, can such non-compliance be justified by the need to make choices in terms of priorities or resources. We would, in any event, find it difficult to accept that the carrying out of a prompt and effective investigation into Mr. Palic\u2019s disappearance could be said to have imposed an impossible or disproportionate burden on the national authorities, when the national tribunals of the respondent State itself considered this to be not only possible but essential.",

In our view, they did not do so for the reasons given and consequently there has been a violation of that Article.
