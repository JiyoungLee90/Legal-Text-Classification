The court then examined the documents provided by the prison administration and found that, during the entire remaining period, the applicant had had more than 3.6 sq. m of personal space, in line with the domestic law. It also dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning insufficient furniture in the cells, inadequate ventilation and lack of cleaning equipment. However, the court considered that the prison administration had failed to refute the applicant\u2019s allegations that there had been fungus in the cells, that the lighting had been insufficient and that there had been no toilets in the prison gym. Furthermore, the court found that the sanitary units in the cells had been separated from the rest of the cells by a 1.5-metre partition, which had not ensured sufficient privacy for the applicant when using the facilities because he could have been seen by other detainees and prison guards. Accordingly, the court concluded that the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention had not complied with the domestic requirements, and awarded him EUR 200 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.",

As for the cells which had not been examined by the public health authorities, the Government submitted that renovation works had been carried out at Luki\u0161k\u0117s Remand Prison since 2012 and that the prison administration took all the necessary measures in order to meet the domestic hygiene requirements.",

The Court has also stressed that in cases where a detainee disposed of more than 4 sq. m of personal space in multi-occupancy accommodation in prison and where therefore no issue with regard to the question of personal space arises, other aspects of physical conditions of detention remain relevant for the Court\u2019s assessment of adequacy of an applicant\u2019s conditions of detention under Article 3 of the Convention (see Mur\u0161i\u0107 v.
