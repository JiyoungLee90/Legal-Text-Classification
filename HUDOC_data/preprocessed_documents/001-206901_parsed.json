Furthermore, he challenged the lawfulness of the termination of his employment contract and submitted that he had been dismissed for no valid reason. As regards the provision relied upon to justify his dismissal, that is to say section 4\u00a0(1)\u00a0(g) of Emergency Legislative Decree No.\u00a0667, he categorically denied having any kind of link with the FET\u00d6/PDY (\u201cFetullahist Terrorist Organisation/Parallel State structure\u201d), which the Turkish authorities considered as an armed terrorist organisation which had premediated the failed military coup. He also described it as a terrorist organisation, submitting that his employer had deliberately circumvented the applicable legal provisions in order to deprive him of the minimum procedural safeguards, such as accepting his defence submissions. He considered that his dismissal had amounted to a breach of his right to presumption of innocence in that it had been based on a subjective assessment that he had links with the terrorist organisation in question. In particular, he submitted that his employer had been unable to provide any explanation or criterion for considering him as someone linked to a terrorist organisation. In his view, the fact that the assessment in question had been left to the arbitrary discretion of the secretary general of the Ankara Agency showed that he had suffered an injustice. The applicant considered that in its observations in response (no copy of which was supplied to the Court by the parties), the Ankara Agency had claimed that it had not needed any evidence in order to make the assessment in question. The applicant stated that such an approach was contrary to his constitutional rights. He also pointed out the following: he had never met any of the members of the Agency\u2019s governing board, and consequently the only administrative officer who could have made such an assessment was the secretary general; yet the latter would have required specific information in order to form his opinion; the fact was that there was no evidence \u2013 such as the fact of holding a bank account in the Asya Bank, membership of an association, a foundation, a trade union, or some kind of body affiliated to the structure in question, or again a subscription to certain publications \u2013 capable of justifying the assessment in question; that being the case, in the absence of any such evidence, the fact of making such an assessment could only be described as arbitrary and manifestly unfair. Finally, the applicant requested a hearing of the secretary general of the Ankara Agency and the gathering of the evidence on which the assessment in question had been based.",

Unlike termination with a valid reason, termination with a just reason is set forth in separate terms for the employee and the employer: section\u00a024 of Law No. 4857 regulates the employee\u2019s right to terminate [the contract] immediately for a just reason, while section 25 of that Law deals with the employer\u2019s right to terminate the employment contract immediately for a just reason.

Moreover, although the employer is not required to grant the employee severance pay and a length-of-service indemnity in the event of termination of employment with a just reason, the employee is entitled to severance pay and a length-of-service indemnity in cases of termination of employment with a valid reason\u201d.",

In the judgment in question, the court of first instance pointed out that even though, according to the relevant case-law, the employer was required to rely on objective facts and evidence if the termination was to be valid, a more flexible approach should be adopted in the particular circumstances of the case in issue. It was noted that Turkey was experiencing an exceptional and extraordinary situation following the failed military coup of 15 July 2016 perpetrated by FET\u00d6/PDY.

He explained that he had been dismissed on the basis of slander, that is to say an accusation devoid of any basis in fact. He also stated that he had not re-entered the civil service, and that that situation had had an impact on both his current status and his future.

On that point he submitted that his dismissal as ordered on account of his alleged links with a terrorist organisation had amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.

The Government added that as regards lustration procedures occurring after the dissolution of a political regime, the Court had found that the criminal limb of Article\u00a06 was applicable where there was a criminal connotation among the aspects of the measures implemented (the respondent Government referred here to the case of Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no.\u00a038184/03, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54, ECHR 2006-VII). The Government also stated that such proceedings were linked to the deprivation of public rights.",

They continued their reasoning as follows: the governing board of the Ankara Agency, which had terminated the applicant\u2019s employment contract, was an administrative body which lacked the powers of a public prosecutor; moreover, the court which had reviewed the case was the Labour Court, which was not a criminal court\u00a0; labour courts determined disputes between employers and employees in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code; they applied procedures set out in labour law and the rules of civil procedure; the applicant\u2019s legal status had been regulated by the Labour Code and the Code of Civil Procedure, and he had benefited from the guarantees set forth in the provisions in question; furthermore, there had been no reference to criminal legislation in the impugned provision of the Legislative Decree. Consequently, in the Government\u2019s view, the first Engel criterion had not been met (legal characterisation under domestic law), because the measure applied in respect of the applicant had not been characterised as criminal in domestic law.",

They reasoned as follows: in the present case the reasons justifying a valid termination of contract were set out in Law No. 4857; it had also been determined by domestic case-law that termination of employment based on suspicions fell within the scope of termination with a valid reason; in the instant case the impugned termination of the employment contract had been based on a suspicion harboured by the applicant\u2019s employer against him concerning links with the FET\u00d6/PDY organisation. The Government added that there was no ban on re-entering the civil service, that the applicant could apply for a post in the civil service and that he could lodge an application for severance pay and a length-of-service indemnity for valid termination.

The fact that an offence is not punishable by imprisonment is not by itself decisive for the purposes of the applicability of the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention since, as the Court has stressed on numerous occasions, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake cannot deprive an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e S\u00e1 v.\u00a0Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, \u00a7 122, 6 November 2018 and the references therein).",

Matyjek, decision cited above, \u00a7\u00a050 (in that case the organisation and conduct of the lustration proceedings had been based on the model of Polish criminal proceedings, and the rules of the Code of Criminal Proceedings had applied directly to the proceedings in question)).

The procedure in issue is sui generis and was adopted following the proclamation of the state of emergency in Turkey. There are of course similarities between the wording of section 4\u00a0(1)\u00a0(g) of Legislative Decree No. 667 \u2013 that is, membership of or affiliation with a terrorist organisation or another type of organisation posing a threat to national security \u2013 and the definition of certain criminal offences in the Penal Code. However, this fact alone is insufficient to conclude that the dismissal proceedings in question are comparable to proceedings concerning a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. First of all, there is no doubt that those proceedings do not belong to the category of repression-related proceedings (cf. Matyjek, decision cited above (in that case there had been a close link between the lustration proceedings and the criminal sphere)). In fact, the applicant was not accused of a criminal offence at any point during the domestic proceedings. Prima facie, under the terms of the aforementioned Legislative Decree, the point at issue had been an \u201cassessment\u201d put forward by the employer on the applicant\u2019s presumed links or affiliation with a criminal structure. That consideration had led the employer to terminate the employment contract. At all events, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, the fact that an action subject to a disciplinary sanction under administrative law also comprises substantive factors constituting a criminal offence is not sufficient grounds for considering that the person brought before the domestic courts as allegedly responsible for the action is \u201ccharged with an offence\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Moullet v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 27521/04, 13 September 2007, concerning disciplinary proceedings against a civil servant; see also Vagenas v.\u00a0Greece (dec.), no.\u00a053372/07, 23 August 2011).",

Clearly, the ban on re-entering the civil service, one of the consequences of implementing section 4 (2) of Legislative Decree No.\u00a0667, which is contested by the Government, might have a punitive\u00a0dimension; yet in the present case, the severity of the sanction in itself does not bring the offence into the criminal sphere.

This means, in particular, that the court must have the power to examine point by point each of the litigant\u2019s grounds on the merits, without refusing to examine any of them, and give clear reasons for their rejection. As to the facts, the court must be able to examine those that are central to the litigant\u2019s case (see, among other authorities, Bryan v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 22\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, Series A no. 335\u2011A, and Aleksandar Sabev v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no. 43503/08, \u00a7 51, 19 July 2018; see also, mutatis mutandis, Donadz\u00e9 v.\u00a0Georgia, no. 74644/01, \u00a7\u00a0131, 7 March 2006).",

The Court is not competent to hear appeals against national courts\u2019 decisions, nor is it its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Garc\u00eda Ruiz v.\u00a0Spain [GC], no.\u00a030544/96, \u00a7\u00a028, ECHR 1999\u2010I). Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to given items of evidence or to findings or assessments in issue before them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a court of fourth instance and will not therefore question under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 the judgment of the national courts, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (Bochan (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 61, and L\u00f3pez Ribalda and Others v.\u00a0Spain [GC], nos. 1874/13 and 8567/13, \u00a7 149, 17 October 2019).

As a result, in view of the seriousness of the consequences for the Convention rights of those persons, where an emergency legislative decree such as the one at issue in the present case does not contain any clear or explicit wording excluding the possibility of judicial supervision of the measures taken for its implementation, it must always be understood as authorising the courts of the respondent State to exercise sufficient scrutiny so that any arbitrariness can be avoided (see, mutatis mutandis, Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v.

This means that the applicant must raise legal arguments to the same or like effect on the basis of domestic law, in order to give the national courts the opportunity to redress the alleged breach. However, as the Court\u2019s case-law bears out, to genuinely afford a Contracting State the opportunity of preventing or redressing the alleged violation requires taking into account not only the facts but also the applicant\u2019s legal arguments, for the purposes of determining whether the complaint submitted to the Court had indeed been raised beforehand, in substance, before the domestic authorities (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0117).

It also notes that before the domestic courts he did not explicitly refer to Article 8 of the Convention or to the constitutional provision guaranteeing the right to respect for private life. It notes, however, that in the appeals lodged with the domestic courts he complained that he had been labelled as a person having links with an illegal structure (see paragraphs 20, 24, 26 and 28 above), and that he had explained that his dismissal was liable to damage his reputation (see paragraph 24 above). In his individual appeal lodged on 21\u00a0August 2017 with the Constitutional Court against the impugned dismissal, the applicant pointed out that the situation which he had faced had had consequences which exceeded the framework of the state of emergency and permanently affected his and his family\u2019s lives. He complained in that regard of a violation of the presumption of innocence, referring to Article\u00a06\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Convention. In particular, in his individual appeal, referring to Articles\u00a048 (right to work) and\u00a070 (right to enter the civil service and prohibition of discrimination in entering the civil service) of the Constitution, he argued that he had been totally and definitively prohibited from re-entering the civil service and that his right to work had therefore been violated. He added that he had sustained negative discrimination in his attempts to find fresh employment on account of his dismissal after the failed military coup. He submitted that not only his right to work but also his right to life, and that of his family, had been violated, and complained that his rights had been infringed. He explained in that connection that he had been branded a \u201cterrorist\u201d and a \u201ctraitor\u201d, which situation had made it impossible for him to continue with his life in society (see paragraph 28 above).",

Nonetheless, the Court has previously had occasion to address the question of the applicability of Article\u00a08 to the sphere of employment. In that regard, it reiterates that the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d is a broad\u00a0concept, not susceptible to exhaustive definition (see, among other authorities, Sch\u00fcth v. Germany, no. 1620/03, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2010). It would be too restrictive to limit the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d to an \u201cinner circle\u201d in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle (see Niemietz v.

Restrictions on an individual\u2019s professional life may fall within Article\u00a08 where they have repercussions on the manner in which he or she constructs his or her social identity by developing relationships with others. Moreover, professional life is often intricately linked to private life, especially if factors relating to private life, in the strict sense of the term, are regarded as qualifying criteria for a given profession (see \u00d6zp\u0131nar v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a0, \u00a7\u00a7 43-48, 19 October 2010). Professional life is therefore part of the zone of interaction between a person and others which, even in a public context, may fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d\u00a0(see Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, cited above, \u00a7 110, and the references therein).",

Nevertheless, this division does not preclude cases in which the Court may find it appropriate to employ both approaches in combination, examining whether there is a private-life issue in the underpinning reasons for the impugned measure and, in addition, analysing the consequences of the measure (see Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 110-112).

However, in the light of section 4\u00a0(2) of Legislative Decree No.\u00a0667, which was quoted in the judgment delivered by the Regional Court (see paragraph\u00a050 above), the Court must attach weight to the applicant\u2019s claim that he had found himself branded in society as a \u201cterrorist\u201d and had thus been stigmatised. In that regard, the applicant stated in particular that despite his postgraduate qualifications, he had been unemployed since the termination of his contract and that employers did not dare offer him a job because the termination had been based on Legislative Decree No.\u00a0667. Consequently, there have indeed been repercussions on the applicant\u2019s ability to forge and maintain relationships, including employment relations.",

There too, the applicant\u2019s dismissal should be considered as a termination of a relationship between private individuals and not as State interference. This approach should not be altered by the fact that the applicant\u2019s dismissal was mainly triggered by the provisions of section\u00a04\u00a0(1)\u00a0(g) of the Legislative Decree No. 667, an act adopted by the State. The applicant was not dismissed ex lege, as the provisions of that section had no self-executing effect. Instead, it was for the employer to assess whether a particular employee could be considered as belonging, affiliated or linked to terrorist organisations or structures, formations or groups, etc. prejudicial to the national security of the State. In this context, it is significant that the applicant himself does not contest the compatibility of the above-mentioned provisions of Legislative Decree No. 667 with the Convention. Rather, he complains that whereas his dismissal had been based on the alleged existence of links between himself and a terrorist organisation, he had never been notified of the facts and evidence underpinning the dismissal and had at no stage had an opportunity to challenge that omission (see paragraph\u00a065 and 109 of the judgment).",

In doing so, the Court could have taken into account the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 214 \u2013 224 of the judgment, and verified whether, and if so to what extent, those circumstances had been addressed by the domestic courts in their adjudication. As transpires from the examination of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the domestic courts apparently failed in their positive obligation to properly balance the interests of both parties involved.

I explained in my separate opinion in the case of Ali Riza and Others v.

Therefore, I consider that the majority\u2019s position is simply wrong and not in conformity with the well-established legal doctrine that is increasingly reflected in the Court\u2019s case-law. May I add that the majority\u2019s reference to the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Barbulescu v. Romania (GC), no.\u00a061496/08, paragraph\u00a0145, 5 September 2017, is not relevant in the present case. While the Barbulescu case solely concerned a violation of Article\u00a08 of the Convention, in the present case the Court has, rightly, also found a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It is precisely the latter violation that should trigger the application of the doctrine of the loss of real opportunities.

The applicant\u2019s grievances concerning the judicial review conducted in his case are closely connected with the fact that the dismissal itself was of a summary nature. The underlying reasons were neither specified nor substantiated, and the applicant was given no opportunity to respond to the allegation that he had links with a terrorist organisation. Under such circumstances, the very basis of the subsequent judicial review process was highly problematic. The applicant was not in a position to know exactly what he was being charged with, or on what grounds and on the basis of what evidence. Normally, there is a specific basis for a judicial review in the factual and legal elements invoked in the decision, the arguments and the evidence relied on to justify it, as well as the procedural materials underpinning the decision.

In matters relating to fundamental rights, it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society as enshrined in the Convention, for the legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise (see, for instance, Rotaru v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2000-V, Regner v. the Czech Republic GC, no. 35289/11, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2017, Navalnyy v.

Accordingly, the Court has considered that its examination of whether the requirements of the \u201cquality of the law\u201d are satisfied must include an analysis of whether the impugned powers are sufficiently circumscribed and whether their exercise is subject to adequate legal safeguards against abuse (Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a04158/05, \u00a7 87, ECHR 2010, Beghal , cited above, \u00a7 109).",

In other words, the present judgment should have taken care to avoid any misconceptions regarding the relevant standards and their applicability.
