The prosecutor held that a third party had called the emergency services at the applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s request, because the applicant, who had a history of psychological problems and who had been drunk, had been aggressive and had endangered his own life and safety and that of his family.

Moreover, in such a case, it would have been highly unlikely that an individual would call the emergency services for no reason. According to the prosecutor, those arguments were also supported by the fact that, in the medical report produced by the psychiatric unit of Slatina Emergency Hospital, where the applicant had been taken after the incident, it was stated that the applicant was suffering from a polymorphic personality disorder, which was aggravated by alcohol consumption. Also, his father had acknowledged that the applicant would generally act normally when he was sober, but transformed into a verbally and physically aggressive person once he drank alcohol.",

Moreover, the Court notes that the applicant has not submitted any medical documents attesting that he has been prescribed or advised to have a special carer and there is no evidence in the file that he initiated proceedings by relying on the relevant domestic legislation in order to obtain such aid. It therefore rejects this part of the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage. He did, however, submit an invoice totalling EUR 112 for a magnetic resonance imaging scan, and the Court therefore awards him that amount in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.",
