In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied\u00a0standards which were in conformity\u00a0with the principles embodied in Article\u00a010 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...\u201d",

As a matter of principle, the rights guaranteed under Articles 8 and 10 deserve equal respect, and the outcome of an application should not, in principle, vary according to whether it has been lodged with the Court under Article 10 of the Convention by the publisher of an offending article or under Article 8 of the Convention by the person who has been the subject of that article. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts (see Delfi AS v.\u00a0Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, \u00a7\u00a7 138-139, ECHR 2015, with further references).",

The courts did not discuss whether the article had contributed to a debate on a\u00a0matter of public interest or whether it had been a form of art criticism. They did not explain why they believed Mr Y.\u2019s reputation had to be afforded greater protection on account of his being \u201ca person, pedagogue and musician\u201d. The lack of reasoning in the judgments can be seen particularly in how they approached the contents of the article. Apart from a restatement of the applicable legal provisions, general remarks about the impermissibility of distorting Mr Y.\u2019s name and the \u201cnegative character\u201d of the information, the judgments were remarkably laconic and contain nothing that would help the Court to grasp the rationale behind the interference. In particular, the courts did not specify which elements of the impugned publication were problematic (see Kommersant Moldovy v.\u00a0Moldova, no.\u00a041827/02, \u00a7 36, 9 January 2007).",

The Court reiterates in this regard that it is not its task to substitute its own view for that of the domestic courts, which have the advantage of possessing direct knowledge of the situation and have all the evidence before them (see B\u00e9dat v.
