He did so promptly once the prosecutor had instituted proceedings on behalf of the City seeking the revocation of the applicant\u2019s title to the flat.

Nor did the Government argue that the period elapsed after the final decision in the first set of the civil proceedings before the applicant had reintroduced his claims for damages had been unreasonable.

In his view, the City of Moscow had not had standing, under Article\u00a0302 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, to reclaim the flat from him given that he had bought it in good faith. The City of Moscow had decided of its own will to cede ownership of the flat and to transfer it to K. It had verified and authorised all the transactions in respect of the flat. The applicant considered that his situation bore close resemblance to the one examined by the Court in the case of Gladysheva (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a077-83). In particular, he claimed that the loss of his flat had amounted to a disproportionate interference with his rights, as set out in Article\u00a01 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention. The authorities had placed an excessive burden on him. Even though he had acquired the property in good faith, they had failed to ensure a fair balance between their decision to reclaim the property from him, and his own interests. He further argued that the State bore responsibility for the fraudulent transactions in respect of the flat he had later purchased. It had been incumbent on them to verify the compliance of those transactions with the applicable laws. However, the authorities had failed to do so in a timely and diligent manner and had managed to recover the property from him only by flagrantly disregarding his interests. Lastly, the applicant submitted that he had been deprived of his property without compensation.",

The transfer of the flat to the State should not be viewed as having been carried out in the State\u2019s interests only. The City of Moscow was responsible for providing affordable housing to people on low incomes. Accordingly, the City had reclaimed the flat in the interests of those people. Lastly, the Government argued that the interference with the applicant\u2019s right could not be considered disproportionate given that he had been allowed to use the flat and to obtain title to it through the privatisation scheme.",

Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a047-51, 29 January 2015; Andrey Medvedev v. Russia, no. 75737/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a042-47, 13 September 2016; Kirillova v.

Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State had alienated its assets to private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures resulting in the loss by the State of its real property should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide purchasers. The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to its former owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

It observes that the applicant\u2019s title to the flat was revoked on the grounds that the procedures in which the City of Moscow had transferred the flat to K. had been fraudulent. The Court notes that those procedures were conducted by official bodies exercising the authority of the State. It further notes that the Government did not explain why the forgery of documents was not discovered when the relevant authorities dealt with K.\u2019s requests for exchange and subsequent privatisation of the flat. In the Court\u2019s view, it would have been a straightforward task for the authorities to verify the validity of the data submitted by K. and such an omission on their part could not justify the subsequent retribution against the applicant, who had bought the flat in good faith. Lastly, the Court takes into account that the applicant was deprived of his possession without compensation and that his claim for damages against the City of Moscow was dismissed. It therefore concludes that the restitution of the applicant\u2019s flat to the City of Moscow placed an excessive individual burden on him and that the public interest was not sufficient justification for doing so.",
