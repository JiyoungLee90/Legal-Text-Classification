The Court reiterates that although such supervising court has no competence to institute or to re-open criminal proceedings its supervising power on the decisions of the prosecuting authorities is a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of powers by the investigating authorities (see Abbas Ahmadov (dec.), cited above, \u00a7\u00a042).",

However, the parties disputed the dates on which those decisions had been sent to the applicants (see paragraphs 67-68 above). In this respect the Court observes that the Government failed to submit any evidence proving that the decisions of 23\u00a0May and 2 July 2011 had indeed been sent to the applicants on the same dates. The Court also observes that the applicants failed to submit any evidence that they had received those decisions only in January 2012. In particular, though the applicants argued that they had lodged before the investigating authorities enquiries about the outcome of the investigation, they failed to submit copies of those enquiries. However, even assuming that they indeed received the decisions at issue only in January 2012, the Court sees no circumstances which would prevent the applicants from complaining against those decisions to a supervising court afterwards. In addition, the applicants have not shown convincingly that such a review was bound to be ineffective. It follows therefore that the applicants failed to exhaust a domestic remedy which was relevant and available (compare Abbas\u00a0Ahmadov (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 41-43).",
