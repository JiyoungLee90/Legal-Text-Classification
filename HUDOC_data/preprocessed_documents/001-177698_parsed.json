It also found that no other such remedies existed, and held that Bulgaria had to make them available. As a result, in early 2017 Bulgaria put in place a preventive and a compensatory remedy designed to provide redress in respect of inhuman or degrading conditions in correctional and pre-trial detention facilities (see paragraph 22 above). In June 2017 the Court held that those remedies could be seen as effective, and that the compensatory remedy should also be used by pre-trial detainees and prisoners who had been released before its introduction and had in the meantime complained to the Court about the conditions of their detention (see Atanasov and Apostolov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-68).",

The periods of his detention in, on the one hand, the police station and, on the other hand, in the pre-trial detention facility and in Sofia Prison cannot therefore be seen as a single continuing situation (see, mutatis mutandis, Maltabar and Maltabar v.\u00a0Russia, no. 6954/02, \u00a7 83, 29 January 2009, and I.D. v.

This raises an issue under the authorities\u2019 positive obligations flowing from Article 8 of the Convention. The Court has had occasion to hold that in view of the deep anxiety that the disappearance of a family member can cause, even for a short period, and the consequent importance for someone who has been arrested to be able to get in touch with his or her family promptly, there is an obligation under that Article to enable an detainee to contact them rapidly after being taken into custody (see Sar\u0131 and\u00a0\u00c7olak v. Turkey, nos. 42596/98 and 42603/98, \u00a7\u00a7 33-37, ECHR 2006-V (extracts)). In some cases this can also amount to an important safeguard to prevent arbitrary detention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 122-24, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III). Indeed, in Bulgaria such an obligation is set out in section 243 of the 2009 Act (see paragraph 26 above). As evidenced by that provision, as well as the other relevant provisions of Bulgarian law, European Union law and international law (see paragraphs 23 to 27 above), that obligation takes on an added importance when the detainee is an alien whose family may be in a different country.",

His inability to express himself in Bulgarian must have also seriously restricted his capacity to communicate with the custodial staff or his co-detainees in the pre-trial detention facility. Moreover, he did not have any money on him when he was arrested; that prevented him from obtaining a phonecard enabling him to use the cardphone available in the detention facility (see paragraph 14 above). Thus, he was not able to inform anyone of his deprivation of liberty for twelve days, until, with the help of a co-detainee, he obtained access to a telephone and contacted the consulate of France in Sofia on 5 February 2014, which in turn informed his parents of his arrest and detention (ibid.).

Since it is not for the Court to inquire into the point of its own motion at this stage of the proceedings, it leaves the question whether that remedy would have been effective in this case open. Assuming, as the applicant implied, that he had no effective domestic remedy in respect of this grievance, the six-month time-limit under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention started to run when the situation of which he complained ended, that is, on 5 February 2014 (see, mutatis mutandis, Mifsud v.

Thus, when assessing compliance with the requirements of that provision with respect to their contacts with the outside world, regard must be had to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, \u00a7 74, Series A no. 131, and Dikme v. Turkey, no. 20869/92, \u00a7\u00a0117, ECHR 2000-VIII). Indeed, some restrictions of those contacts, such as limitations on the number and duration of visits, are not of themselves incompatible with Article 8 (see Khoroshenko, cited above, \u00a7 123, with further references). The same goes for correspondence (see, among other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7 45, Series A no. 18; Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 98, Series A no. 61; and Szuluk v. the United Kingdom, no. 36936/05, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2009). As for telephone calls, Article 8 does not in itself guarantee such a right, especially if there exist adequate possibilities for written correspondence. If telephone facilities are, however, made available, they may, again in view of the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment, also be subject to restrictions (see A.B. v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a037328/97, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93, 29 January 2002; Davison v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 52990/08, 2 March 2010; and Nusret Kaya and Others v.

Although that does not entail that the all detailed conditions and procedures governing the interference have to be laid down in the substantive law itself, the requirements of Article 8 \u00a7 2 are not met if points which cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of the substantive law are set out in internal orders of which the detainees have not been made sufficiently aware (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 88-89 and 93-94). As evident from that judgment, and from the Court\u2019s case-law relating to the accessibility of the law more generally (see The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a01), 26 April 1979, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, Series A no. 30; Groppera Radio AG and\u00a0Others v.
