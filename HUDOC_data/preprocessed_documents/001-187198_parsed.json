Russia, no. 50775/13, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03340, 13 September 2016; and Zimonin and Others v. Russia [Committee], nos.\u00a059291/13 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 58-61, 16\u00a0May 2017). Having examined the specific conditions and procedures under which the State ensured the compliance and legitimacy of the housing transactions between private individuals, the Court noted that they were within the State\u2019s exclusive competence and held that the defects in those procedures preventing the State from obtaining the title to bona vacantia housing should not have been remedied at the expense of bona fide owners. The Court further reasoned that such restitution of property to the State or municipality, in the absence of any compensation paid to the bona fide owner, imposed an individual and excessive burden on the latter and failed to strike a fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other.",

In this connection, the Court observes that it was the responsibility of the state registration authorities to make sure that the transfer of title to the real property from N. to Ya. and then from Ya. to the applicant was carried out in accordance with the law. However, despite the ongoing criminal investigation against M. and the seizure of the rooms by the District Court, the registration committee condoned the sale of those rooms to the applicant (see paragraphs 9-10 above). The Government did not proffer any explanation in this respect.",

In that connection, the Court reiterates that where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate manner and with utmost consistency (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7\u00a0120, ECHR 2000I).

The Court reiterates that the consequences of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7\u00a049, 29\u00a0January 2015). The Court therefore concludes that the forfeiture of the title to the rooms by the applicant and the transfer of the ownership of the rooms to the City of Moscow, in the absence of any compensation to be paid to the applicant, placed a disproportionate and excessive burden on the latter. There has therefore been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.",

Belgium (Article 50), 26\u00a0October 1984, \u00a7 12, Series A no. 85; Tchitchinadze v. Georgia, no.\u00a018156/05, \u00a7 69, 27 May 2010; Fener Rum Patrikli\u011fi (Ecumenical Patriarchy) v.

Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which he would have been had there not been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare, Gladysheva, cited above, \u00a7 106).
