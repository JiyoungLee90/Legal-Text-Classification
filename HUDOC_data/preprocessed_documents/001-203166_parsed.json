The third party noted that in some States legal proceedings for protection of human rights may be unavailable or ineffective and, in such circumstances, for lawyers to be effective in protecting the rights of their clients they may need to engage in activity, which may include statements or other forms of expression, that takes place outside of the strict confines of judicial proceedings. Such activity may be seen as necessary or useful for a variety of reasons, for example to draw the attention of the public to a case, or to assist in research and fact-finding in respect of that case. As such activities are part and parcel of a lawyer\u2019s professional functions, strict scrutiny of restrictions on freedom of expression of lawyers outside of court is also necessary.

Furthermore, where such matters are addressed, any restrictions on lawyers\u2019 freedom of expression on the grounds of confidentiality of proceedings should be subjected to particularly strict scrutiny for necessity and proportionality, taking into account the importance of the public interest in receiving information on these issues. Where information or allegations are already in the public domain, a lawyer should not be penalised on the grounds of confidentiality or secrecy of proceedings for expressing his views on these matters. Moreover, it is clear that where the client supports the disclosure of the information in the public domain, the lawyer should not be prohibited from disclosing it by principles of lawyer-client confidentiality.

In this regard the Court reiterates that a norm cannot be regarded as a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; he or she must be able \u2013 if need be with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.

In that connection, the Court notes that pursuant to Article 17 (I) of the Law information obtained by a lawyer, as well as advice and information given by a lawyer in furtherance of his or her professional activity, fall under the head of lawyer confidentiality. It does not appear from the wording of Article 17 (I) that the use of information available in the public domain falls under lawyer confidentiality.

In the present case, it is clear from the documents in the case file, and is not disputed by the parties, that the allegation of E.A.\u2019s death in police custody as a result of torture was made public by R.R. on 25 January 2011, and that the applicant only repeated that allegation on 28 February 2011.

France, no.\u00a041841/12, \u00a7 72, 19 April 2018). The specific status of lawyers gives them a central position in the administration of justice as intermediaries between the public and the courts. That special role of lawyers, as independent professionals, in the administration of justice entails a number of duties, particularly with regard to their conduct. Whilst they are subject to restrictions on their professional conduct, which must be discreet, honest and dignified, they also enjoy exclusive rights and privileges that may vary from one jurisdiction to another \u2013 among them, usually, a certain latitude regarding arguments used in court (see Morice, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013233). In addition, professional associations of lawyers play a fundamental role in ensuring the protection of human rights and must therefore be able to act independently, and respect towards professional colleagues and self-regulation of the legal profession are paramount (see Jankauskas v. Lithuania (no. 2), no. 50446/09, \u00a7 78, 27\u00a0June 2017, and Namazov v. Azerbaijan, no. 74354/13, \u00a7 46, 30 January 2020). While parties are certainly entitled to comment on the administration of justice in order to protect their rights, their criticism must not overstep certain bounds (see Saday v. Turkey, no.\u00a032458/96, \u00a7 34, 30 March 2006). In particular, a clear distinction must be made between criticism and insult. If the sole intent of any form of expression is to insult a court, or members of that court, an appropriate sanction would not, in principle, constitute a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (see Kincses, cited above, \u00a7 33).",

The Court accepts that the remarks, accusing a judge of lack of capacity to be a judge, represented a lack of respect for the judge and were capable of being offensive (compare, for example, \u017dugi\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 47, in which the applicant implied that the judge dealing with his case was ignorant and incompetent; Kincses, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, in which a lawyer called into question the professional competence of a judge dealing with his case; Rodriguez Ravelo, cited above, \u00a7\u00a046, in which a lawyer attributed blameworthy conduct to a judge, such as wilfully deciding to distort reality, unhesitatingly lying or, further, issuing an untruthful report containing false and malicious information; and, Mikhaylova v.

Nevertheless, it must be ascertained whether the sanction imposed on the applicant by the domestic courts struck a fair balance between the need to protect the authority of the judiciary and the need to protect the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression (see Igor Kabanov, cited above, \u00a7 54; Bono, cited above, \u00a7 51; and \u010ceferin v.

In that connection, it reiterates that the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It can embrace multiple aspects of the person\u2019s physical and social identity. Article 8 protects in addition a right to personal development and the right to form and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world, including relationships of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no.\u00a0\u00a076639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 95-96, \u00a7\u00a7 100-09, \u00a7\u00a7 115-17, 25 September 2018). In the present case it is undisputed that the applicant\u2019s suspension from the practice of law for one year and his subsequent disbarment for professional misconduct prevented him from exercising his profession, and therefore affected a wide range of his professional and other relationships and encroached upon his professional and social reputation. The applicant\u2019s suspension and disbarment also caused him a considerable loss of earnings (see paragraph 116 below) and must have had serious negative effects on his private life. The Court thus considers that the impugned measures had very serious consequences for the applicant and affected his private life to a very significant degree (compare and contrast Denisov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 123 and 125, and Namazov, cited above, \u00a7 34). Article 8 therefore applies.",

The Court considers it necessary to draw attention to Recommendation R (2000) 21 of the Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers to member States on the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer, which clearly states that the principle of proportionality should be respected in determining sanctions for disciplinary offences committed by lawyers (see paragraph 39 above). The Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the independence of judges and lawyers also stated in the annual report (A/71/348) to the UN General Assembly that disbarment \u201cconstitutes the ultimate sanction for the most serious violations of the code of ethics and professional standards\u201d and \u201cshould only be imposed in the most serious cases of misconduct, as provided in the professional code of conduct, and only after a due process in front of an independent and impartial body granting all guarantees to the accused lawyer\u201d (see paragraph\u00a041 above).

It further observes that the applicant, like lawyers who were not members of the ABA, was allowed under the domestic law as in force until 1 January 2018 to appear in the civil and administrative proceedings before the first-instance and appeal courts. In accordance with the new amendments to the domestic law which entered into force on 1 January 2018, the representation before the domestic courts falls with the exclusive competence of the members of the ABA. The applicant has also represented applicants in cases before the Court. In these circumstances, it would be speculative to calculate the exact amount of the pecuniary damage. Therefore, without assessing the exact amount of the benefits which the applicant would have received if the violations of the Convention had not occurred, the Court considers that the applicant has incurred pecuniary loss which should be evaluated on the basis of the document submitted by the applicant, taking into account that the rate of AZN changed on several occasions during the period in question. It further considers that the applicant has suffered nonpecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation, and that compensation should thus be awarded. Making an assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of all the information in its possession, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant an aggregate sum of EUR\u00a018,000, all heads of damage combined, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount (see, mutatis mutandis, Kayasu v. Turkey, nos. 64119/00 and 76292/01, \u00a7 128, 13\u00a0November 2008, and Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, \u00a7 191, 23\u00a0June 2016).",

The Court also points out that under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, failing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part (see Malik Babayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 30500/11, \u00a7 97, 1 June 2017). In the present case the applicant failed to produce any contract with his representatives or any other documents showing that he had paid or was under a legal obligation to pay the fees charged by his representatives (see Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], no. 72508/13, \u00a7 372, 28 November 2017). As regards the part of the claim for translation of various documents, the Court does not consider that the translation of those documents was necessary for its proceedings (see Allahverdiyev v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no. 49192/08, \u00a7 71, 6 March 2014, and Sakit Zahidov v.\u00a0Azerbaijan, no.\u00a051164/07, \u00a7 70, 12 November 2015).
