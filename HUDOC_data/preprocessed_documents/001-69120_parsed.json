Considering that he should not have had to request to be readmitted to the legal profession because he had been excluded from the Bar by a decision without any legal basis, the applicant had lodged the application with the issuing body, namely the Constan\u0163a Bar, as there was no provision for specific proceedings to redress the effects of such unlawful administrative decisions.

The applicant had asked the UAR and, subsequently, the courts to rule not only on the annulment of the UAR decision, but also on his reinstatement as a member of the Bar, since his exclusion in 1981 had been an abuse committed under the communist regime; on the UAR\u2019s failure to notify him of the decision of 27 June 1996; and on the applicability to his case of the Administrative Litigation Act (Law\u00a0no.\u00a029/1990). That law would allegedly have rendered the UAR\u2019s decision time-barred and would have made the Constan\u0163a Bar competent in 1991 to annul its own decision of 1981. He submitted that he had acted in good faith and had relied on Law\u00a0no.\u00a029/1990 when he had applied in 1991 to the Constan\u0163a Bar, and not to the UAR, in order to annul its 1981 decision removing him from the Bar roll, and that even the UAR had acknowledged, in its response to the applicant\u2019s questions of 30 March 1998, that he had the right to file such an application with the Bar.",

In particular, the Court had recognised that the State\u2019s responsibility could be engaged through the activities of professional associations to which it had entrusted powers of professional regulation. According to the applicant, the UAR was an independent regulatory body constituted by statute and had the task under that statute of regulating the Romanian Bar (section 58 (b) of Law no. 51/1995). It was a public-law body, subject to the jurisdiction of administrative courts by virtue of Law\u00a0no.\u00a029/1990.

Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003-VIII). It follows that, in accordance with its case-law, it cannot make an award under this head in respect of the hours the applicant himself spent working on the case, as this time does not represent monetary costs actually incurred by him (see Robins v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23\u00a0September\u00a01997, Reports 1997-V, p. 1812, \u00a7\u00a044, and Narinen v.

Seeing that the applicant has nevertheless incurred some costs and expenses in connection with his defence in the domestic proceedings, as is reflected by the aforementioned considerations, and that those proceedings were relevant to the complaints which led it to find a violation, the Court finds it reasonable to award the applicant, on an equitable basis, EUR\u00a0300 under this head.",

Nevertheless, the Court, taking into account the complexity of the instant case and the evidence in its possession, finds some weight in the Government\u2019s submission and considers that the legal costs and expenses for which the applicant claimed reimbursement cannot all be considered to have been necessarily incurred or to be reasonable as to quantum. In these circumstances, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR\u00a011,700 for the legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Convention proceedings.",
