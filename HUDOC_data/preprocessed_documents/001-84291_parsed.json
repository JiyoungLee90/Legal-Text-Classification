As it has reiterated on a number of occasions, it cannot take the place of the domestic courts in determining what method of calculation should have been taken into consideration for the estimation of the value of the expropriated land and for the assessment of the sums due in consequence (see, mutatis mutandis, Malama v. Greece, no. 43622/98, \u00a7 51, 1\u00a0March 2001). This being so, the Court observes that the Gebze Civil Court of First Instance examined four different expert reports in determining the nature of the land in question and relied on the findings of the experts who assessed the nature of the plot by examining many different elements, such as the land registry records, the location of the plots and the local zoning plans (see paragraph 10 above). Having regard to the facts and documents submitted by the parties, the Court concludes that the applicants were fully able to state their case and that there is nothing to indicate that the assessment of the evidence was arbitrary or the proceedings otherwise unfair under Article 6 of the Convention.",
