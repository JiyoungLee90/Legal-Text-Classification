In the absence of a guilty verdict on Mr Vitaliy Vulakh there were no grounds to impose joint liability on his heirs. A civil claim should have been brought against him, and the court should have examined the matter of procedural succession.

Having regard to the explicit and unqualified character of the impugned statements contained in both the District Court\u2019s and the Regional Court\u2019s judgments, the Court finds that they amounted to a pronouncement on Mr Vitaliy Vulakh\u2019s guilt before he was proved guilty according to law. The Court underlines that there can be no justification for a court of law to make a premature pronouncement of this kind (see the above-cited case-law, and also Ka\u017amierczak v. Poland, no. 4317/04, \u00a7 54, 10 March 2009; Wojciechowski v. , no. 5422/04, \u00a7\u00a054, 9 December 2008; Del Latte v.\u00a0the , no. 44760/98, \u00a7 31, 9 November 2004; and, as regards subsequent civil proceedings, Y. v.

Such a pronouncement was also at variance with the case-law of Russian courts which considered inappropriate a reference in the criminal conviction to the identities of any alleged accomplices, the charges against whom had not yet been examined, even where such accomplices were designated by their first initials only (see paragraph 22 above). In the instant case Mr Vitaliy Vulakh\u2019s name was spelled out in full and he was clearly identified in all the judgments. In the circumstances, the Court finds that the declarations by the Russian courts to the effect that Mr Vitaliy Vulakh had been the head of a criminal gang which had committed serious crimes under his leadership, before he was convicted, amounted to a breach of his right to be presumed innocent (compare Popovici v. Moldova, nos. 289/04 and 41194/04, \u00a7\u00a7 76-79, 27\u00a0November 2007).",

In such circumstances the injured party should be able to submit a claim for compensation for the damage under the general principles on the law of torts. By contrast with criminal proceedings, which cannot continue after the defendant\u2019s death, a civil claim for compensation may be brought against the estate of the deceased defendant, and decided upon in accordance with the general rules of civil proceedings to the standard of proof required in those proceedings.",

The question therefore arises whether such an opportunity was afforded to the applicants, who were named as the respondent party in the compensation proceedings. It appears from the judgment of 4 September 2003 that, in adjudicating the compensation claim, the District Court did not make any independent findings as to the fault of Mr Vitaliy Vulakh or the applicants, but merely referred back to the judgments pronounced by different courts in the criminal proceedings against Mr S., Mr\u00a0N. and Mr K. Neither the applicants, nor the late Mr\u00a0Vitaliy Vulakh had been a party to those criminal proceedings and, as the Court has found above, the declaration of Mr Vitaliy Vulakh\u2019s guilt in the criminal judgments \u2013 in the absence of a conviction \u2013 amounted to a breach of his presumption of innocence. The applicants pointed out this defect in their statement of appeal against the District Court\u2019s judgment, but the  maintained that the criminal judgment had already established Mr Vitaliy Vulakh\u2019s guilt. It follows that the domestic proceedings did not offer the applicants the necessary procedural guarantees for a vindication of their property rights.",

The Court cannot speculate what the outcome of the civil proceedings could have been, had the judges in the civil proceedings avoided relying on the criminal judgment which had allegedly established Mr Vitaliy Vulakh\u2019s guilt. It is noted that, pursuant to the Russian Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment no. 4-P of 26\u00a0February 2010, the Court\u2019s judgments are binding on Russia and a finding of a violation of the Convention or its Protocols by the Court is a ground for reopening civil proceedings under Article 392 of the Code of Civil Procedure and review of the domestic judgments in the light of the Convention principles established by the Court. The Court considers that a re-opening of the civil proceedings and review of the matter in the light of the principles it has identified in this judgment would be the most appropriate means of affording reparation to the injured party.
