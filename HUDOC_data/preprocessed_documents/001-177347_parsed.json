However, the Court of Appeal examined the same question, namely conducted a review of the first-instance court\u2019s detention order of 13 July 2010, on 6 August 2010 in the presence of both the applicant and his lawyer. It appears that the only substantive difference was that on 26 July the Court of Appeal examined the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s appeal while on 6 August 2010 it examined an appeal lodged by the applicant himself. The applicant did not allege that there was any breach of his rights at the 6 August hearing, did not explain what the difference between the two appeals was, or why he had lodged an appeal separately from his lawyer. Neither did he provide any other explanation as to why he believed that his rights had been prejudiced in such circumstances.
