Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4, Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions, and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 \u00a7 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, \u00a7 95, ECHR 1999V, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 93, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, and, more recently, Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2015). Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation as to the cause of the injury, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Aksoy v.

Since the injury appeared while the applicant was detained in prison, and since his allegation is supported by the statements of a number of witnesses, including prison staff and medical personnel, and by forensic reports in the file, the Court concludes that it was the result of treatment during the search. Immediately after the incident the applicant complained about sharp pain in his leg and he was urgently brought to a hospital for treatment, his leg having been fixed in plaster (see paragraph 10 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the presence of an actual bodily harm and of pain sufficiently intense so as to require urgent medical assistance at a hospital attains a minimum level of severity so as to fall within the scope of Article 3. It must be qualified as inhuman treatment within the meaning of that provision (see, amongst many other authorities, Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, \u00a7\u00a7 86 et seq., ECHR 2015).",

Given the particular vulnerability of such inmates, it could be expected that any actions in their respect such as searches of their cell would be carried out with special precautions against unnecessarily affecting their psychological state. Indeed, the applicant\u2019s unchallenged submission (see paragraph 37 above) that before the search of 28 October 2006 all previous such actions had taken place in the presence of a doctor would suggest that the prison authorities were well aware of this special situation in cell no. 20.",

The kind of investigation that will achieve those purposes may vary according to the circumstances. However, whatever the method of investigation, the authorities must act as soon as an official complaint has been lodged.

It is to be noted that content saved in an electronic form on a compact disk is easily editable to exclude parts of the recording, much less so than content on the original video cassette. Given that the video was of such crucial importance, providing objective evidence of what had happened (the prosecutor\u2019s final conclusion being in large part based on it, see paragraph 29 above), the failure to obtain the original cassette is a serious flaw in the investigation, leading to the conclusion that the authorities did not \u201ctake all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident\u201d (see paragraph 60 above).",
