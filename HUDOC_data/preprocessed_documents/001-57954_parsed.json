But this building did not incorporate internal drainage considered necessary for such stock.  The doorways appeared to have been more likely to have been useful as window openings, none reached ground level as built; one was almost waist high above outside ground level measured from the lower edge of the unbonded brickwork added later.  Other features in both buildings include the extensive use of Georgian-style windows and other windows made for domestic use.  I understand that Mr\u00a0Bryan\u2019s contacts allowed him to buy these windows cheaply.  But whatever their source, they contribute to an impression that the buildings look more like houses than barns.  There are other features which add to that view.  The use of domestic-style eaves and gable barge boarding.  The residential look of the \u2018porch\u2019 to No. 1 building.  And the [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\u2019s] view about the uneconomic layout of both buildings as originally built all add to the impression that these buildings were not designed for agricultural purposes, albeit they have since been modified and adapted for such a use.",

Whether another decision-maker would have reached the same conclusion as did this inspector is not to the point.  Nor is the view of this court, which does not sit on appeal from the judgment of inspectors, relevant.  I am unable to say that there was anything irrational in the inspector\u2019s decision.  In particular, the question whether the alterations proposed to a building were, as he evidently thought, a \u2018matter of cosmetics\u2019 and would not meet the main objections was entirely a matter of planning judgment for him. It is to be remembered that, in order to stay within his General Development Order rights, the applicant must erect replacement buildings which, by their appearance and layout, could be considered as designed for the purposes of agriculture.  If they are, their effect on the green belt, the countryside and the conservation area is irrelevant to the exercise of that right. That does not, however, in my judgment mean that the inspector acted irrationally in concluding that the buildings in fact erected without permission under the General Development Order were objectionable and should be demolished.
