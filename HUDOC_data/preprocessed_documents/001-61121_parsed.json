In this respect, the Government pointed out that on 21 July 1994, the day following the applicant\u2019s arrest, he was brought before a judge at the Bihor County Court for questioning, under Article 152 of the CCP. In the Government\u2019s opinion, this judge was an officer who clearly provided the safeguards required by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.

This provision enjoins the judicial officer before whom the arrested person appears to review the circumstances militating for or against detention, to decide by reference to legal criteria whether there are reasons to justify detention, and to order release if there are no such reasons (see, inter alia, Assenov and Others, cited above, p. 3298, \u00a7 146, and De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, pp. 21-24, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 47 and 51).

Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996VI, p. 2282, \u00a7 76). Before an \u201cofficer\u201d can be said to exercise \u201cjudicial power\u201d within the meaning of this provision, he or she must satisfy certain conditions providing a guarantee to the person detained against any arbitrary or unjustified deprivation of liberty (see Schiesser v. Switzerland, judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A no. 34, pp. 13-14, \u00a7 31). Thus, the \u201cofficer\u201d must be independent of the executive and of the parties (ibid.). In this respect, objective appearances at the time of the decision on detention are material: if it appears at that time that the \u201cofficer\u201d may later intervene in subsequent criminal proceedings on behalf of the prosecuting authority, his independence and impartiality may be open to doubt (see Huber v.

He subsequently acted as a prosecuting authority, formally charging the applicant and drawing up the indictment on which the latter was committed for trial in the . However, he did not act as prosecuting counsel before this court although this would have been possible, since no provision in the Law on the Administration of Justice would have specifically forbidden him from so doing.
