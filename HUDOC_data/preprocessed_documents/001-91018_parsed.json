It reiterates that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention, including the guarantees of Article 6. However, the actual manner in which it is used must not impair the very essence of a fair trial. In other words, the power to reopen criminal proceedings must be exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-61). In the specific context of supervisory review, the Convention requires that the authorities respect the binding nature of a final judicial decision and allow the resumption of criminal proceedings only if serious legitimate considerations outweigh the principle of legal certainty (see Bratyakin, cited above).",

This conclusion should exclude any further consideration of the proceedings under Article 6. A retrial may not be justified by the fact that the applicant was not required to serve his penalty \u2013 an issue which was determined by the competent courts pursuant to a law on amnesty. A reopening on that ground would question the very aim of that law, which was to absolve certain categories of convicted persons from serving their penalties. I also fail to see anything extraordinary in the dissatisfaction of the accusatory party with the leniency of the penalty pronounced \u2013 a complaint which was raised and considered by the courts within the regular appeal proceedings.

While both these provisions promote finality in criminal proceedings, Article 4 \u00a7 1 of the Protocol should be interpreted as a lex specialis to the principle of legal certainty envisaged by Article 6. More importantly, the effect of a finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not equate to that of a finding of a breach of the ne bis in idem principle. Turning to the straightforward fact of the retrial in the present case, I realise that a separate finding of a violation of Article 4 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No. 7 would perhaps be of questionable theoretical contribution to its interpretation. Yet, this provision also protects individuals from being punished twice. Following an amnesty, the effect of which is comparable to an acquittal, the applicant\u2019s retrial resulted in his effective imprisonment. In my view this detrimental outcome should be considered automatically contrary to the Convention. This conclusion involves different consequences and requires a different redress. The applicant\u2019s effective imprisonment cannot be seen as warranted by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) and this conclusion should automatically require his immediate release. The Court has declared this complaint inadmissible and has limited the scope of the case to the proceedings per se, thus leaving their result outside the focus of its scrutiny. The majority\u2019s finding that a prohibited retrial \u201cdid not satisfy the \u2018fair balance\u2019 required by Article 6\u201d (\u00a7 30) neither requires the applicant\u2019s immediate release, nor calls for any additional compensation for the resulting deprivation of liberty prohibited by the Convention. In these circumstances one may only hope that the individual measures taken to correct the absence of \u201cfair balance\u201d found by the Court do not involve yet another reopening of the proceedings.",

Contrary to this legitimate aim, the very purpose of the retrial in the present case was to require the lower courts to impose a harsher penalty than the initial \u201cfinal\u201d one. This was the legal ground for the requested supervisory review, and the single issue discussed in the resulting decision to order a rehearing of the case. It must not be overlooked that the reasoning given for this decision was binding and served as a mandatory instruction for the lower courts. In Daktaras v. Lithuania (\u00a7\u00a7 35 et seq.) the Court considered that \u201c[the binding] opinion cannot be regarded as neutral from the parties\u2019 point of view. By recommending that a particular decision be adopted or quashed, the President necessarily becomes the defendant\u2019s ally or opponent (see, mutatis mutandis, Borgers v. , 30 October 1991, \u00a7 26, Series A no.\u00a0214-B).\u201d In Daktaras the Court found that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s doubts as to the impartiality of the Supreme Court may be said to have been objectively justified. Consequently, there has been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\u201d",

                        "content": "In the present case the similarly binding opinion had the effect of instructing the lower courts to come to certain conclusions and to a predefined result. Moreover, once the Presidium of the upper court agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s view that the penalty was inappropriately lenient, the applicant\u2019s case was destined to as many quashings, remittals and reviews as necessary to achieve the harsher penalty sought. Any different outcome was vulnerable to further supervisory review proceedings and there was nothing in the law to stop the subsequent quashing of decisions which failed to comply with the instructions given. Since the initiation of the supervisory review mechanism was a privilege of the prosecution with the consent of the upper courts, it allowed the perpetuation of the criminal proceedings until that party was satisfied with the result.",
