The Court recalls that although it is primarily for the national courts to assess the admissibility, relevance and weight of evidence in a case, it was precisely in order to avoid the danger of misinterpretation of witness statements, and in order to avoid ordering detention without a proper basis, that C.N. should have given evidence before the court.",
