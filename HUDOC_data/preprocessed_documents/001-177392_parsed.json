Turkey, no. 61960/08, \u00a7\u00a072, 2\u00a0December 2014). The criteria that guide the Court\u2019s assessment of the conditions in which conflicting judgments are in breach of the fair trial requirement, enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, consist in establishing whether profound and longstanding differences exist in the case-law of the domestic courts, whether the domestic law provides for a mechanism for overcoming these inconsistencies, whether that mechanism has been applied and, if appropriate, to what effect (see Iordan Iordanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a023530/02, \u00a7\u00a7 49-50, 2 July 2009, and Nejdet \u015eahin and Perihan \u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 13279/05, \u00a7 53, 20\u00a0October 2011).",

                                        "content": "29.\u00a0\u00a0In the present case the Court notes that, during the domestic proceedings, the applicant cited only one decision rendered by the First Civil Division of the Court of Cassation in 2002 which had found in favour of the claimant, whose title deed to a plot of land had also been annulled as the land had been classified as part of the public forest area. While it is true that the Fourth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation reached different conclusions in a seemingly very similar case in 2006 and 2007, it cannot be said that there were \u201cprofound and long-standing differences\u201d in the relevant caselaw. The Court further notes that, although it is not directly accessible to claimants, under section 15(2-b) of the Court of Cassation Act (Law no.\u00a02797), in cases where there is inconsistency between decisions of the different civil divisions of the Court of Cassation, the plenary Court of Cassation (civil divisions) shall render a legally binding ruling settling the conflict of case-law. Taking these aspects into consideration, the Court finds no reason to further examine whether the aforementioned provision for overcoming the judicial inconsistencies could have been applied in the instant case and to what effect (see, mutatis mutandis, Ari\u015fanu v. Romania (dec.), no. 17436/09, 28 January 2014). In these circumstances, and bearing in mind that interpretation is inherent in the work of the judiciary (as case-law is evolutive in essence) and that it is not the Court\u2019s function to compare different judgments of national courts, even if delivered in respect of similar proceedings, the Court considers that the difference of interpretation between the decisions of the First and the Fourth Civil Division of the Court of Cassation does not, in itself, constitute a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.",

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7\u00a026, ECHR 1999I, and the cases cited therein). Although Article 6 \u00a7 1 obliges courts to give reasons for their rulings, it cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument. The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the ruling and must be determined in the light of the specific circumstances of the case (Ruiz Torija v.\u00a0Spain, 9 December 1994, \u00a7\u00a029, Series A no. 303A; Hiro\u00a0Balani v. Spain, 9\u00a0December 1994, \u00a7 27, Series A no. 303B, and Garc\u00eda Ruiz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a026). Thus, in dismissing an appeal, an appellate court may, in principle, simply endorse the reasons for the lower court\u2019s judgment (Helle v.\u00a0Finland, 19\u00a0December 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII; Hirvisaari v.

However, neither during the first-instance proceedings nor in the cassation proceedings did the domestic courts consider the applicant\u2019s submissions when concluding that the applicant did not have a right to compensation on the ground that there was no illegal act or action on the part of the land registry officials. In the Court\u2019s opinion, while an earlier judgment delivered by the First Civil Division was in conflict with the approaches of the first-instance court and the Fourth Civil Division in the present case, the applicant\u2019s submissions regarding the said judgment required an adequate and express response. In the absence of such a response, it is impossible to ascertain whether the domestic courts simply neglected to deal with the applicant\u2019s submission or whether they intended to dismiss its argument and, if that was their intention, what their reasons were for so deciding (see Hiro\u00a0Balani, cited above, \u00a7 28, and Emel Boyraz, cited above, \u00a7 75).",
