It held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without judicial authorisation or clear rules governing their situation was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and the protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Isayev v. , no.\u00a020756/04, \u00a7\u00a7 131-133, 22 October 2009; Yudayev v. , no.\u00a040258/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-61, 15 January 2009; Belov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 22053/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a090-91, 3 July 2008; Lebedev v.
