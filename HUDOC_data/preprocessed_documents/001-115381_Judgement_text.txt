On 12 March 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in .
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 12 January 1998 the applicant was issued an occupancy voucher (yaşayış orderi) to a flat in a recently constructed residential building in  on the basis of the Baku City Executive Authority’s order of 7 January 1998.
At the same time, the applicant became aware that the flat was occupied by O. and her family, who were internally displaced persons (“IDP”) from Gubadly, a region under occupation of Armenian military forces following the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
According to the applicant, despite her numerous demands, O. refused to vacate the flat noting that she was an IDP and she had no other place to reside in.
On 1 July 2004 the applicant was delivered an ownership certificate to the flat.
On an unspecified date in 2005, the applicant lodged a lawsuit with the Yasamal District Court asking the court to order the eviction of O. and her family from the flat.
On 5 July 2007 the Yasamal District Court granted the applicant’s request. The court held that the applicant was the lawful owner of the flat on the basis of the ownership certificate of 1 July 2004 and, therefore, the flat was unlawfully occupied by O. and her family. The court ordered the eviction be conducted once the IDP family was provided with other accommodation by the Sumgayit City Executive Authority. The applicant appealed before the Court of Appeal asking the immediate eviction of the IDP family. On 20 April 2007 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s request and ordered that the IDP family be evicted. On 13 September 2007 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 20 April 2007.
According to the applicant, O. and her family refused to comply with the judgment and the competent authorities did not take any measures to enforce it.
After the lodging of the present application before the Court, on 28 October 2008 the applicant sold the flat in question to O. On 26 November 2008 she lodged a request before the Yasamal District Enforcement Department asking that the enforcement proceedings be terminated owing to the resolution of the matter by the parties. On 10 December 2008 the Yasamal District Court terminated the enforcement proceedings in question.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Gulmammadova v.  (no. 38798/07, §§ 18-24, 22 April 2010).
