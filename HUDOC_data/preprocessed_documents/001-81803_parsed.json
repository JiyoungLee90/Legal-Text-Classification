In this respect, they considered that the latest reform regarding property, namely the Law no. 247/2005, had aimed at restitutio in integrum of immovable property wrongfully seized by the State during the communist regime and, when the property could have not be returned, at granting compensation. Law no. 247/2005 grants compensation at the market value in the form of participation in a common system of placing for movable securities, organised in the form of a joint stock company, Proprietatea. The persons having right to compensation will receive securities at face value which will be transformed into shares once Proprietatea is listed on the stock market. The Government considered that the compensation granted once Proprietatea will be put in place is in accordance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and that the delay in the effective payment does not impinge upon the fair balance that must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights.",
