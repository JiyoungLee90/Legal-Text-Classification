The CJEU concluded that such duplication of proceedings and penalties constituted a limitation of the ne bis in idem principle requiring justification. In particular, national legislation authorising a duplication of proceedings and penalties of a criminal nature had to pursue an objective of general interest, such as to justify a duplication of proceedings and penalties, it being necessary for those proceedings and penalties to pursue additional objectives; establish clear and precise rules allowing individuals to predict which acts or omissions were liable to be subject to such duplication of proceedings and penalties; ensure that the proceedings were coordinated in order to limit to what is strictly necessary the additional disadvantage which results, for the persons concerned, from a duplication of proceedings; and limit the severity of all of the penalties imposed to what is strictly necessary in relation to the seriousness of the offence concerned.",

Following the approach adopted in that judgment, it is clear that the determination as to whether the offences in question were the same (idem) depends on a facts-based assessment (ibid., \u00a7\u00a084), rather than, for example, a formal assessment consisting in comparing the \u201cessential elements\u201d of the offences. The prohibition in Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention concerns the prosecution or trial of a second \u201coffence\u201d in so far as the latter arises from identical facts or facts which are substantially the same (ibid., \u00a7 82). In the Court\u2019s view, statements of fact concerning both the offence for which the applicant has already\u00a0been\u00a0tried and\u00a0the offence\u00a0of which he or she stands accused are an appropriate starting-point for its determination of the issue whether the facts in both proceedings were identical or substantially the same (see, in this connection, Sergey Zolotukhin, cited above, \u00a7 83). The Court\u2019s inquiry should therefore focus on those facts which constitute a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and inextricably linked together in time and space, the existence of which must be demonstrated in order to secure a conviction or institute criminal proceedings (ibid., \u00a7 84).",

Thus, the Court considers that the minor-offence proceedings related to a number of facts \u2013 in particular driving a vehicle with worn out tyres and not providing assistance to a victim of a road accident, not informing the police and not waiting for the arrival of a person authorised to carry out an on-site inspection \u2013 which were not covered by the subsequent criminal charges (compare Hauser-Sporn v.

It cannot therefore be said that the facts for which the applicant was punished in the minor-offence proceedings under sections 239(1) and 176(1) and (3) of the Road Traffic Safety Act can be regarded as substantially the same as the facts for which he was subsequently punished in criminal proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramda v.

States should be able legitimately to choose complementary legal responses to socially offensive conduct (such as non-compliance with road-traffic regulations or non-payment/evasion of taxes) through different procedures forming a coherent whole so as to address different aspects of the social problem involved, provided that the accumulated legal responses do not represent an excessive burden for the individual concerned (see A\u00a0and B v.

As the Government explained, this minor offence is aimed at discouraging all drivers from disregarding speed limits, irrespective of whether or not their conduct causes a road-traffic accident. The subsequent criminal proceedings against the applicant, on the other hand, were conducted precisely with the aim of addressing the consequence of his failure to comply with the speed limit, that is, to penalise his conduct which caused the death of a pedestrian (compare and contrast Gradinger, cited above, \u00a7 54). The Court therefore accepts that the two sets of proceedings pursued complementary purposes in addressing different aspects of the failure to respect road-traffic safety regulations, criminal proceedings being limited to offences which are particularly serious, such as reckless driving resulting in serious bodily injury or death (see paragraph 13 above).",

While it is true that the Rijeka Minor Offences Court included the death of the pedestrian in the description of the facts of the case, it is clear from the text of its decision that the actual minor offences of which the applicant was found guilty related only to speeding (see paragraph 5 above). Under Croatian law, causing a death in a road-traffic accident cannot be prosecuted in minor-offence proceedings; instead, it is dealt with as a criminal offence that is subject to public prosecution by the State Attorney in criminal proceedings. Moreover, at the material time, dual-track punitive proceedings combining minor-offence proceedings and criminal proceedings formed part of the actions commonly taken to impose sanctions in accordance with clear and precise rules for failure to comply with road-traffic safety regulations and for reckless driving causing a fatal road-traffic accident (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 23 above). Therefore, the Court cannot accept the applicant\u2019s contention that the dual proceedings and penalty had been an unforeseeable consequence of his conduct.",

Although the criminal court did not expressly refer to the fine previously imposed by the Rijeka Minor Offences Court, the Court observes that it sentenced the applicant to one and a half years\u2019 imprisonment, whereas at the material time the Criminal Code prescribed a maximum sentence for such an offence of up to five years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 31 above). In the Court\u2019s view, when taken together the penalties imposed did not exceed what was strictly necessary in relation to the seriousness of the offences concerned. It cannot therefore be said that the applicant was made to bear an excessive burden (see the relevant criteria set out in A and B v. Norway, cited at paragraph 39 above). Rather, only once punishment for speeding had been complemented by the punishment for causing a fatal road-traffic accident did the applicant in the present case receive an effective, proportionate and dissuasive punishment for his conduct.

Although the Court does not have in its possession the exact date of the commencement of the criminal investigation in respect of the applicant, it is clear from the bill of indictment that the applicant and a number of other witnesses had already been questioned prior to the lodging of the indictment. In other words, the two sets of proceedings must have been initiated at practically the same time (contrast J\u00f3hannesson and Others v. Iceland, no. 22007/11, \u00a7 54, 18 May 2017, where the applicants had been indicted only 15 and 16 months after the decision of the tax authorities had been taken in their cases). The two sets of proceedings were then conducted in parallel for almost another fourteen months, when the Rijeka Minor Offences Court\u2019s penalty notice became final, without an appeal having been lodged against it. The criminal proceedings against the applicant thereafter lasted another six years and ten months at four levels of jurisdiction, a period which, in the Court\u2019s view, cannot of itself suffice to disconnect in time the minor-offence and the criminal proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, A and B v. Norway, cited above, \u00a7 151; and contrast Kapetanios, cited above, \u00a7 67, where the delay between the conclusion of the two sets of proceedings had amounted to between 9 and 14 years; and Nodet v.

In particular, the additional lapse of time before the criminal courts cannot be considered disproportionate, abusive or unreasonable, taking into consideration that the penalty notice had been issued as a result of summary minor-offence proceedings, whereas the criminal proceedings, which by their nature are more complex, had been conducted before four court instances.

There was an adequate level of interaction between the two courts in these proceedings, and the punishments imposed, taken together, did not make the applicant bear an excessive burden, but were limited to what was strictly necessary in relation to the seriousness of the offence. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds no abuse of the State\u2019s right to impose a punishment (jus puniendi), nor can it conclude that the applicant suffered any disproportionate prejudice resulting from the duplication of proceedings and penalties.
