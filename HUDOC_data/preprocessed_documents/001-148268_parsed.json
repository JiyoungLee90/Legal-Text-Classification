On 15 November 2001 the director of R.L., O.V., submitted a writ of execution of the said decision to the Riga City Vidzeme District Bailiffs\u2019 Office (Rigas pils\u0113tas Vidzemes priek\u0161pils\u0113tas Tiesu izpild\u012bt\u0101ju kantoris).

On 19\u00a0November 2001 G.P. seized M.\u2019s property, which chiefly consisted of fur coats, transported it to another location, and entrusted its storage to O.V. On the same day representatives of M. contacted the applicant, asking him to ensure that the coats were stored in proper conditions, to prevent any damage. The applicant alleged that he then decided to entrust the storage of the seized property to an independent third party, whose costs would have to be reimbursed by R.L. Accordingly, the applicant directed his secretary to prepare documentation for the request of an advance payment from R.L. for the expected costs of the storage. The next day the applicant signed a document requesting an advance payment of 500 Latvian lati (LVL), which he considered would be sufficient to cover the costs of transporting the fur coats to an independent storage facility and obtaining an estimate of the value of the coats from an expert.",

The applicant firstly noted that there were no practical or legal reasons for O.V. to demand such a decision, since the suspension of execution of decisions was an automatic corollary to the lodging of an ancillary complaint and did not require a separate decision. He also stated that it was noteworthy that O.V. could have obtained the decision from G.P. on two occasions, but instead had insisted on meeting the applicant in person. Taking those considerations into account, the applicant concluded that the only motivation for O.V.\u2019s actions was the instructions he had received from the police. The applicant also complained about the first-instance court\u2019s refusal to request the production of documents pertaining to the investigative measures taken in his case (operat\u012bv\u0101s darb\u012bbas lieta). He asked the appeal court to obtain the relevant documents from the police. In respect of the recordings of his conversations, he indicated that the unavailability of proper documentation made it impossible to determine by whom, when and where the conversations had been recorded.

In contrast with the previous response, this time a distinction was made between the conversations that had been recorded before and after the approval of the investigative test on 18\u00a0December 2001. According to the prosecutor, the Law on Operational Activities was not applicable to recordings of conversations made by private individuals, since the provisions of section 17(3) of that Law did not apply in such a situation. The recordings of the applicant\u2019s conversations made before 18\u00a0December were legally permissible for that reason.

When drawing a line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and instigation of a crime the Court will examine the question whether the applicant was subjected to pressure to commit the offence.

From the documents made available to the Court it does not appear that any reasons were given for having recourse to the Law on Operational Activities instead of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Neither does there appear to have been any analysis of whether the recording of the applicant\u2019s conversations would \u201csignificantly impinge\u201d on his constitutional rights, such as, for example, the right to respect for his private life.",

In other words, if an investigator and his supervisor were in agreement that a certain operational activity would not significantly impinge on the constitutional rights of persons subjected to it, a written decision to authorise such an activity was not required. The Court views that approach as incompatible with the rule of law, since it conferred unfettered and uncontrolled in the absence of a written record of the decision or the decision-making process discretion on investigative authorities (see also Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a04158/05, \u00a7\u00a077, ECHR\u00a02010 (extracts)).

However, in situations where it has been impossible to obtain a prior judicial warrant there is a particular need for an effective and diligently conducted ex post factum judicial assessment of the lawfulness of, and justification for, the search warrant (see, for example, Harju v. Finland, no.\u00a056716/09, \u00a7\u00a044, 15\u00a0February 2011). Such a system of ex post factum review by an investigating judge in Latvia is now provided for in section\u00a0180 of the Criminal Procedure Law (see Nagla, cited above, \u00a7\u00a036). At the relevant time, however, Article\u00a0168 only stipulated that a judge was to be \u201cinformed\u201d that a search had taken place, and no assessment of the legality of the search warrant was required from the judge.",

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the Constitutional Court in Latvia is empowered to repeal legal provisions which it finds unconstitutional, but not to adopt new legal procedures or to close a deemed legislative gap (see Mihailovs v. Latvia, no.\u00a035939/10, \u00a7\u00a0157, 22\u00a0January 2013, and Liep\u0101jnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no.\u00a037586/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a073 and 75, 2\u00a0November 2010). The absence of an ex post factum judicial assessment of the legality of the warrant for the search in the applicant\u2019s office derived precisely from the fact that no such assessment was required by law. Hence the root of the problem was a legislative gap or absence of an appropriate legal procedure. The Government have not submitted any examples from the case-law of the Constitutional Court that would allow the Court to find that the Constitutional Court might have been able through its case-law to be instrumental towards filling such a legislative gap (see Latvijas Jauno Zemnieku Apvien\u012bba, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051).

The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair.

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (ibid., \u00a7\u00a090).",

The Court further notes that the first-instance court secured an expert report to the effect that the recordings had not in fact been edited (see paragraph\u00a026 above). The applicant has failed to submit any arguments that would cast doubts on the expert\u2019s findings. The Court further accepts the Government\u2019s argument that with regard to the contents of the recorded conversations the applicant had ample opportunity in the course of his trial to question and to cross-examine his counterparts O.V. and S.\u017d. The Court also notes that the applicant made no complaints in relation to the procedure by which the courts reached their decision concerning the admissibility of the evidence. Lastly, while noting that it has already found that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were unfair because of the domestic courts\u2019 failure to properly address the applicant\u2019s entrapment plea, the Court finds that, in the light of the overall body of evidence, the use of the items of evidence obtained by using procedures that did not meet the Convention standards did not of itself render the proceedings as a whole unfair.",
