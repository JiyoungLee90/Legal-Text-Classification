France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII). In cases relating to civil status, what is at stake for the applicant is also a relevant consideration, and special diligence is required in view of the possible consequences which the excessive length of proceedings may have, notably on enjoyment of the right to respect for family life (Laino v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a03158/96, \u00a7 18, ECHR 1999-I).",

It notes in particular that the proceedings related to the applicant\u2019s civil status, and thus required special diligence. However, in 1997 only one hearing was held and no hearings were held in 1996 and 1998. It has not been disputed that the case was not complex and that no delays could be attributed to the applicant.",
