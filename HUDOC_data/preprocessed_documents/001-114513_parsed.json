The court noted that the victims had sought pecuniary damages for the destruction of the houses and their contents, as well as non-pecuniary damages. The court further noted that, during the events of 20 September 1993, eighteen houses belonging to the Roma population in H\u0103d\u0103reni had been totally or partially destroyed and three Roma had been killed, a criminal court having found twelve villagers guilty of these acts. Basing its decision on an expert report, the court awarded pecuniary damages for those houses which had not been rebuilt in the meantime, and maintenance allowances for the children of some of the Roma killed during the riots. On the basis of an expert report, the court awarded pecuniary damages in respect of the partial or total destruction of the houses of six Roma. The court rejected the other victims\u2019 claim for pecuniary damages in respect of the rebuilt houses, finding, on the basis of the same expert report, that their value was either the same or even higher than the original buildings. It further refused to award any of the victims damages in respect of belongings and furniture, on the grounds that they had not submitted documents confirming the value of their assets and were not registered as taxpayers with incomes that would have made them capable of acquiring such valuable assets.

She argued that the three widows who had lost their husbands during the events of September 1993, M.F.Z., P.D.R. and herself, should have been treated in the same way by the lower court on account of the fact that following the violent events they had all remained single parents of minor children and the first applicant\u2019s second child had been born an orphan.

Greece, 19 March 1997, \u00a7 40, Reports 1997II). However, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances (see Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7\u00a035, ECHR 2002III) and the right of \u201caccess to court\u201d does not impose an obligation on a State to execute every judgment of a civil character without having regard to the particular circumstances of the case (see Sanglier v.\u00a0France, no. 50342/99, \u00a7 39, 27\u00a0May 2003). The Court notes that State responsibility for enforcement of a judgment against a private party extends no further than the involvement of State bodies in the enforcement process. When the authorities are obliged to act in order to enforce a judgment and they fail to do so, their inaction can engage the State\u2019s responsibility under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Cebotari and Others v.

Moreover, since the domestic judgments became final the applicants have not raised any complaint before the domestic authorities or courts of a refusal by the enforcement officer to assist them in the enforcement of the said judgment or the alleged discriminatory attitude of the authorities in enforcing the judgment. In this context, the Court notes that while the domestic courts allowed the villagers\u2019 action contesting the enforcement of the domestic courts\u2019 judgments in respect of some of the victims of the events, it appears from the evidence in the file that they dismissed their action in respect of child allowance payments (see paragraph 36 above). Moreover, the applicants have not substantiated their allegation that they lacked the financial means to seek the enforcement of the judgment, particularly considering that the first applicant\u2019s husband, Mr Petru (D\u00eegal\u0103) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f, had himself been party to proceedings before the Court and was awarded just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage.
