The decision was based on the medical evidence, and on the statements of the court registry officers, the court security guards, the police officers, the ambulance driver, the ambulance doctor and his medical assistant, as well as the forensic medical expert. As regards Ms G., she could not be questioned as she had been unavailable. According to that decision, the applicant had behaved inappropriately on the premises of the court. He had breached public order and failed to obey the lawful orders of police officers. The court security guards had therefore handcuffed him and tried to escort him out of the court. When the applicant had lost consciousness (or pretended to have lost consciousness) and had fallen on the floor, the handcuffs had been removed and he had been provided with first aid. The decision further referred to the statements of the ambulance team and one of the police officers, specifying that outside the court premises the applicant had been in an agitated state, falling on the ground and hitting his head against the ambulance. The decision also referred to the forensic medical expert\u2019s report describing the applicant\u2019s injuries; it cited the expert\u2019s opinion that the applicant\u2019s head injuries could have been caused when he had allegedly been hitting his head against the ambulance.",
