At the same time, the District Court took into account a medical opinion issued on 17 July 2013 (cited in detail below), according to which the applicant\u2019s state of health did not preclude his detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility. It also noted that there was no evidence that the authorities had delayed the pre-trial investigation.

The District Court noted the gravity of the charges, including the new ones, and the fact that the applicant was facing a sentence of up to life imprisonment. It once again cited the risks of the applicant absconding, reoffending and obstructing the course of justice, and expressed concern for the safety of the witnesses and victims. The District Court noted that the investigation of certain criminal offences with which the applicant was charged was at an active stage and that the risk of his interfering with the investigation, if he were released, was well-founded. More than eleven defendants had been arrested and certain suspects were yet to be apprehended.

It concluded that neither his family ties nor his state of health outweighed the reasons for his continued detention. In particular, the District Court relied on the medical opinions of 17 July and 7\u00a0August 2013, which had found that the applicant\u2019s illness was not among those listed in Governmental Decree no. 3 of 14 January 2011 preventing the detention of a suspect. It further stressed that on a daily basis at least three medical specialists from municipal and State medical facilities (\u201cgeneralists, surgeons, neurologists, urologists, endocrinologists, proctologists, an infectious diseases specialist, and a rehabilitation specialist\u201d) had examined the applicant and that he had received the prescribed drug treatment in full. Moreover, he had undergone all the necessary laboratory testing and clinical examinations in certified civilian laboratories in Moscow and on 5 November 2013 he was to undergo yet another expert examination to determine whether he was suffering from any illness warranting his release. Having cited a long list of the applicant\u2019s illnesses, the District Court noted that there was no evidence that his condition had deteriorated or that he required treatment in a specialised medical facility. The District Court dismissed as unreliable various expert opinions and medical records prepared by specialists, including foreign ones, in various related fields of medicine and produced by the defence in support of their argument that the applicant\u2019s life was being put at risk by his prolonged detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility and in the absence of adequate medical assistance.",

In particular, the criminal proceedings against the applicant were at a crucial stage of collecting evidence and there was a risk that, using his connections in the criminal underworld, the applicant might try to influence witnesses and victims who feared him. The District Court also cited the medical reports of 17 July, 7 August and 8 November 2013, which supported its conclusion that the applicant\u2019s state of health did not preclude his further detention.",

His detention in a temporary detention facility could aggravate his condition and, in the absence of a swift reaction to such an aggravation, could result in his death.

Citing extracts from the medical records, the director reported that the applicant was examined by him almost every day and also by various specialist doctors, including a urologist, a neurologist, a surgeon, a cardiologist and an endocrinologist. Blood and urine tests were regularly performed. He was prescribed and administered various medications. The applicant used disposable catheters to urinate. He performed that procedure himself, as he had done before his arrest, up to ten times a day without the facility administration having the possibility of ensuring the requisite level of asepsis. An enema was carried out by a doctor two or three times a week to make the applicant defecate. The applicant\u2019s condition was stable and no deterioration in his health had been noted, although he had continued to raise various health complaints.",

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2005\u2011I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Naydyon v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a016474/03, \u00a7 63, 14\u00a0October 2010; Savitskyy v.

The Court cannot emphasise enough the special importance attached to interim measures in the Convention system. Their purpose is not only to enable an effective examination of the application to be carried out but also to ensure that the protection afforded to the applicant by the Convention is effective; such measures subsequently allow the Committee of Ministers to supervise the execution of the final judgment. Interim measures thus enable the State concerned to discharge its obligation to comply with the final judgment of the Court, which is legally binding by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention (see Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, \u00a7 125; Shamayev and Others v.

The Court is not convinced by the Government\u2019s argument. It reiterates that the aim of the interim measure in the present case, as formulated in the Court\u2019s decision of 16\u00a0August 2013, was to obtain an independent medical expert assessment of the state of the applicant\u2019s health, the quality of the treatment he was receiving and the adequacy of the conditions of his detention for his medical needs. That expert evidence was necessary to decide whether, as the applicant argued, his life and limb were at real risk as a result of the conditions of his detention, including the alleged lack of requisite medical care. In addition, the Court was concerned with the contradictory nature of the medical reports prepared by the applicant\u2019s experts and those commissioned by the investigators, which the applicant submitted with his application and his request for an interim measure. The interim measure in the present case was therefore also meant to ensure that the applicant could effectively pursue his case before the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Shtukaturov v.

The main purpose of the interim measure, as indicated by the Court in the present case \u2013 and the Government did not pretend to be unaware of it \u2013 was to prevent the applicant\u2019s exposure to inhuman and degrading suffering in view of his poor health and his remaining in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility that was unable to ensure that he received, as he argued, adequate medical assistance.

Although the Court is mindful of the particularly harsh criticism to which the two reports were subjected by the experts appointed by the applicant, to the point of being described as incomplete, subjective and failing to reflect the \u201ctrue picture of [the applicant\u2019s] pathology\u201d (see paragraphs 26 and 39 above), it finds it more important that the aim of the two medical examinations, the results of which were set out in the reports submitted by the Government, was to compare the applicant\u2019s medical condition with the exhaustive list of illnesses provided for by the Governmental Decree, which could have warranted his release (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above). At no point during the examinations did the doctors from hospital no. 20 assess the applicant\u2019s state of health independently from that list or evaluate whether his illnesses, separately or in combination, given their current manifestation, nature and duration, required his transfer to a hospital. Nor did they pay any attention to the quality of the medical care he had been receiving while in detention, or the conditions in which he was being detained. The reports therefore have little relevance to the implementation of the interim measure indicated by the Court to the Russian Government in the present case.",

They relied on evidence enclosed with their reply of 26 August 2013. The Government further challenged the reliability of the medical reports commissioned by the applicant from Russian and foreign doctors.

The medical specialists who had treated him prior to his arrest had always acknowledged the necessity of various medical procedures, including simple ones such as physiotherapy, as he was unable to move on his own. The administration of the detention facility was unable to provide that level of care. They merely continued to register the increasing number of the applicant\u2019s complaints, including those of serious pain in the back, atrophy of the limbs, headaches, pain in the legs, dizziness, insomnia, spasms, and so on. He was unable to urinate and defecate and had to undergo medical procedures to relieve himself, which he had to do in extremely degrading and unsanitary conditions that posed a constant risk to his life. While the authorities, in their replies to the applicant\u2019s complaints, had acknowledged that the conditions in the detention facility did not satisfy the simple requirements of hygiene and sterility, they had taken no steps to change that situation. The medical recommendations issued by specialists prior to his arrest were costly and complex, as could be seen from various medical reports submitted by him to the Court, and could not be complied with by the untrained and poorly qualified medical personnel of the detention facility. The applicant insisted that the Russian authorities had violated his rights guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention as they were unable to provide him with the requisite level of medical services and were subjecting him to severe suffering and a significant risk of a fatal outcome.",

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention  conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions. In accordance with its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Creang\u0103 v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, \u00a7 88, 23 February 2012, and the cases cited therein).",

Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a \u201cparticularly thorough scrutiny\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 336, and Georgiy Bykov v. Russia, no. 24271/03, \u00a7 51, 14 October 2010).",

In that role, paying particular attention to the vulnerability of applicants in view of their detention, the Court has called on the Government to provide credible and convincing evidence showing that the applicant concerned had received comprehensive and adequate medical care in detention.",

The medical personnel of the detention facilities were taking no steps to address his concerns or to apply the recommendation of the experts commissioned by the applicant. The poor quality of the medical services was accentuated by the fact that the applicant was being kept in unsterile and unsanitary detention conditions posing a serious danger to him, given that his immune system was already compromised. The Court is also concerned that the information provided by the prison doctor from the detention facility in Rostov-on-Don in respect of the quality of the medical care currently afforded to the applicant does not lead it to conclude that the medical care he is continuing to receive in detention is such as to be capable of securing his health and well-being and preventing further aggravation of his condition (see paragraph 49 above). The Court believes that, as a result of the lack of comprehensive and adequate medical treatment, the applicant is being exposed to prolonged mental and physical suffering that is diminishing his human dignity. The authorities\u2019 failure to provide the applicant with the medical care he needs amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article\u00a03 of the Convention.",

The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v.\u00a0Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007 II (extracts)). The applicant in the present case is undoubtedly a person with significant financial resources and powerful connections, including in political and law-enforcement circles. The medical evidence that he presented to the national courts showed that he had frequently travelled abroad to consult foreign medical specialists and to undergo treatment. There was no evidence in the file that he had surrendered his passport. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts\u2019 finding that it was necessary to continue the applicant\u2019s detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the persistence of a risk of his absconding (see, for similar reasoning, Sopin v. Russia, no. 57319/10, \u00a7\u00a042, 18\u00a0December 2012, and Mkhitaryan v. Russia, no. 46108/11, \u00a7\u00a093, 5\u00a0February 2013).",

The Court reiterates that, as regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses, the judicial authorities considered that the applicant\u2019s substantial influence, including through his holding office in Makhachkala and his links with the law-enforcement bodies, as well as with the criminal underworld, could give him an opportunity to influence witnesses and to destroy evidence if released. In these circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that the courts could have validly presumed that a risk existed that, if released, the applicant might abscond, reoffend or interfere with the proceedings, given the nature of his alleged criminal activities (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

The Court reiterates the applicant\u2019s arguments that the fact that he is seriously ill and confined to a wheelchair, with his state of health continuously deteriorating and the need to remain under constant medical supervision, considerably reduces the risk of his absconding. While not being convinced that the applicant\u2019s medical condition entirely mitigated the risk of his absconding so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, the Court is of the opinion that the risk of collusion is such that it cannot be negated by the changes in the applicant\u2019s state of health to the extent that his detention is no longer warranted.",

Those included the organisation of a terrorist attack on a civilian aircraft and the commissioning of murders of various public officials, including representatives of the law-enforcement bodies who had investigated criminal activities in Makhachkala. The national courts stressed the organised nature of the crimes, involving eleven apprehended defendants and a number of suspects still on the run. Moreover, they could not disregard the fact that the criminal group itself was comprised of public officials and law-enforcement officers. The authorities considered the risk of pressure being brought to bear on the parties to the proceedings to be real, and in such circumstances insisted on the necessity to keep the applicant detained in order to prevent him from disrupting the criminal proceedings. The Court reiterates that the fear of reprisal, justifiable in the present case, can often be enough for intimidated witnesses to withdraw from the criminal justice process altogether. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the safety of the witnesses and victims who had already given statements against the applicant, together with the prospect of other witnesses\u2019 willingness to testify, against the applicant\u2019s right to liberty (see Sopin, cited above, \u00a7 44).",

Russia, no.\u00a072967/01, \u00a7\u00a7 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Khudobin v. Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a7 103 et seq., ECHR 2006-... (extracts); and Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a7 72 et seq., 1 June 2006). In the present case, the domestic courts cited specific facts in support of their conclusion that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings, having assessed the evolving circumstances and the changes that affected the applicant\u2019s situation in the course of his detention. They also considered the possibility of applying alternative measures, but found them to be inadequate (see, for similar reasoning, Buldashev v. Russia, no. 46793/06, \u00a7 99, 18 October 2011 and Bordikov v. Russia, no. 921/03, \u00a7 92, 8 October 2009.",

In these circumstances, the Court also accepts that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, coupled with the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the applicant\u2019s alleged criminal activities, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for extending the applicant\u2019s detention for the time necessary to complete the investigation, draw up a bill of indictment and hear evidence from the accused and witnesses in court. The Court does not underestimate the need for the domestic authorities to take statements from witnesses in a manner that excludes any doubt as to their veracity. The Court thus concludes that, in the circumstances of this case, the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice actually did exist, and it justified holding him in custody (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, 4\u00a0May 2006, and \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 28481/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, 15\u00a0January 2008). The Court concludes that the circumstances of the case as described in the decisions of the domestic courts, including the applicant\u2019s personality and the nature of the crimes with which he was charged, reveal that his detention was based on \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds.",

The time that elapsed between the commission of the crimes and the institution of the criminal proceedings was another factor that complicated the investigators\u2019 task. The Court is mindful of the fact that the authorities needed to balance the necessity to proceed with the investigation against an obligation to ensure that the applicant was fully fit to take part in it. The national authorities displayed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. They completed the investigation, held the trial hearings and issued the judgment against the applicant within thirteen months. The applicant did not argue that the authorities had, in any way, delayed that procedural action. In these circumstances, the Court reiterates that while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the authorities\u2019 efforts to clarify fully the facts at issue, to provide the defence with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case, and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 64).",

The Court observes that the applicant did not submit any documents to confirm the legal fees paid to his representative in the proceedings before the Court. However, it cannot overlook the number of submissions made by the applicant\u2019s lawyer to the Court. In the absence of any documents showing the actual sums incurred by the applicant for his representation before the Court, it therefore considers it reasonable to award under this head the usual amount of legal aid granted to applicants in the proceedings, that is, the sum of EUR 850, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.
