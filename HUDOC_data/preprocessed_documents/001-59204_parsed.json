In the proceedings at issue the Vienna Labour and Social Court determined the applicant\u2019s claim for the reimbursement of costs solely on the basis of the statement submitted by her, whereas the Vienna Court of Appeal, applying the law in force on the calculation of lawyers\u2019 fees, merely corrected the costs award.
