While none of the court-appointed experts was able to confirm that the children had in fact been sexually abused, an expert appointed by A.W. maintained that they had suffered such abuse (see paragraph 12 above). In this respect the Court reiterates that it is not seeking to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities as regards parental authority, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see Olsson, cited above, \u00a7 68).",
