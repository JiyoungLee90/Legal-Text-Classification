We do not have any difficulty accepting that these accusations, particularly the second one, may cause deep offence to devout Muslims, whose convictions are eminently deserving of respect.

Freedom of the press relates to matters of principle, and any criminal conviction has what is known as a \u201cchilling effect\u201d liable to discourage publishers from producing books that are not strictly conformist or \u201cpolitically (or religiously) correct\u201d.
