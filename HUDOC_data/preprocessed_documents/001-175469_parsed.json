As regards the cost of a computer, the Court rejects the claim in this part as unrelated to the consideration of the present application by the Court. As regards the lawyer\u2019s fee, the Court considers that the amount claimed is not reasonable to quantum, given a number of the applicant\u2019s complaints which were declared inadmissible at an earlier stage, as well as a straightforward nature of the case at hand. Furthermore, the Court observes that neither the applicant\u2019s submissions nor the case file contain information on the specific services covered by the invoices, or on the lawyer\u2019s hourly or daily rate, or a detailed description of the work done in that case and the time spent on it. Thus, the Court considers that a significant reduction is necessary on those grounds (see Bykov v.\u00a0Russia [GC], no.\u00a04378/02, \u00a7\u00a0114, 10\u00a0March 2009). Having regard to all relevant factors, the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR\u00a0500 in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, and to reject the remainder of the claims under this head.",
