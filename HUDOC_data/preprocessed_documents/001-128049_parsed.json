In order that a State may be held responsible it must in the view of the Court be shown that the domestic legal system, and in particular the criminal law applicable in the circumstances of the case, fails to provide practical and effective protection of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 (see Beganovi\u0107 v.

A few days later the applicant lodged a formal complaint seeking the public prosecution of R. and L. It is to be noted that for more than half a year the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment were examined exclusively in \u201cpre-investigation\u201d enquiries. However, the Court has held in various contexts that this investigative procedure does not comply with the principles of an effective remedy because the enquiring officer can take only a limited number of procedural steps within that procedure at a point where victims have no formal status, thus excluding their effective participation in the procedure (see Davydov and Others v. Ukraine, nos.\u00a017674/02 and 39081/02, \u00a7\u00a7 310-312, 1 July 2010; Golovan v. , no. 41716/06, \u00a7\u00a075, 5 July 2012; and Savitskyy v. , no. 38773/05, \u00a7\u00a0105, 26 July 2012). There is no reason to depart from those findings in the present case. It is remarkable that during the period of \u201cpre-investigation\u201d enquiries the police took several decisions refusing the opening of a criminal investigation. However, the supervising authorities found that those decisions had been unsubstantiated and each time remitted the case for a new round of enquiries (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). The repetition of such remittal orders within one set of proceedings discloses a serious deficiency by itself (see, for example, Spinov v. Ukraine, no. 34331/03, \u00a7\u00a056, 27 November 2008).",
