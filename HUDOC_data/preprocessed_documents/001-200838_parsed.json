It was established that on 20 April 2008 when playing outside with two other children the second applicant had found a cylinder-shaped metal object in a ditch near garages situated 200 metres from school no. 30 and had taken it home. At about 5\u00a0p.m. the next day near his block of flats the second applicant had handed the object to the first applicant who had dropped it on the tarmac. That had caused an explosion in which five children had been injured including the first applicant. The explosion had also damaged the windows of a flat located on the ground floor of a nearby block of flats.\u00a0In her decision of 30\u00a0April 2008 the inspector concluded that there had been the elements of the crimes provided for by Article 118 \u00a7\u00a01 (infliction of grievous bodily harm by negligence) and Article\u00a0168 (destruction and damage to property by negligence) of the Criminal Code in the first applicant\u2019s actions.

On 5\u00a0May 2008 that decision was annulled as unlawful by the Chernovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office, which ordered an additional pre-investigation inquiry. The inspector\u2019s new decision of 16 May 2008 not to institute criminal proceedings against the first applicant in view of his minor age was again annulled by the district prosecutor\u2019s office on 19 May 2008, and an additional inquiry was ordered.

In the absence of such signs, it had been for the State to ensure that the firing range had been cleaned up in order to eliminate all unexploded ordnance.

In the course of the ensuing investigation explosives-expert reports were obtained and victims and witnesses were questioned. Five months after the incident the acts of an unidentified perpetrator were reclassified as crimes against public safety and military service under Article 225 \u00a7 1 (negligence on the part of personnel entrusted with guarding firearms, ammunition and explosives) and Article\u00a0348 (loss of military property) of the Criminal Code, respectively (see paragraphs 46-47 above). A month after the reclassification regular decisions to suspend the investigation for failure to identify the perpetrator followed, until the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings for the reasons that the prosecution had become timebarred.",

If the investigation considered, as it did, that there had been possible negligence on the part of military personnel in ensuring that ammunition had not been lost, then it had to establish, for example, whether the fired but unexploded VOG-17 grenade could have been abandoned after military training activities. The Court notes, however, that there is no indication as to what actions had been carried out and what the results of those actions had been in order for the military investigation division of the Chita garrison to conclude that the involvement of military personnel in the loss of the grenade had not been established as a result of its pre-investigation inquiry, which lasted nine days (see paragraph\u00a020 above). Nor is there any such indication in the decisions by the civilian investigating authorities in the case, including the most recent decision of 27 December 2013, while the material of the military pre-investigation inquiry had been joined to the criminal case initiated into the explosion (see paragraphs 20, 21, 23, 27, 31, 34, 36 and 37 above).

This line of investigation focusing on the criminal liability of the victims themselves was clearly wrong. The correct line of investigation focusing on crimes against public safety and military service under Article\u00a0225 \u00a7 1 (negligence on the part of personnel entrusted with guarding firearms, ammunition and explosives) and Article 348 (loss of military property) of the Criminal Code was belated, since it took five months after the incident for the acts of an unidentified perpetrator to be reclassified under these provisions. In our view, this is the main shortcoming of the internal criminal investigation, since it made it impossible to gather the relevant witness testimony and real evidence. This erroneous initial approach was compounded by the fact that the material from the pre-investigation inquiries and the criminal proceedings, as well as the material from the civil proceedings, was destroyed upon expiry of the time-limit for their storage.",

Accordingly, States are under an obligation to adopt a \u201cprotective legal framework\u201d that must include criminal sanctions against threats to life.

In this context, the Human Rights Committee has held that States must refrain from opting merely for administrative or disciplinary measures if there is enough evidence for criminal prosecution. The Human Rights Committee has also held that States must take preventive measures against repetition of right to life violations, which indicates the significance of criminal investigations in order to discover the truth and establish responsibility.",

Several limitations to the use of incendiary weapons are stipulated in Article 2 of Protocol III. In particular, subparagraph 3 of the Article provides that Parties may not use incendiary weapons in an area with a concentration of civilians.

Accordingly, since the applicants were not in any way associated with the army, nor were they harmed while performing their job, it is clear that the State must be subject to a much higher standard than merely reducing the risks to a reasonable minimum.

                                        "content": "As to the applicable standard, it must initially be noted that the Court employs a diverging causality test to establish substantive obligations, including determining responsibility when Article 2 has been infringed as a result of an omission of the State. The Court\u2019s approach is highly fact and context-dependent, and can hardly be deemed consistent. It has varied from finding State responsibility due to \u201cfailure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm\u201d, to a test as ambiguous as \u201cdisplay[ing] due diligence in protecting the right to life\u201d, or to one as stringent as a \u201ccausal link established between the gross negligence attributable to the State and the loss of human lives\u201d.",

                                        "content": "In the present judgment, the Court (only theoretically) offers the consideration \u201cwhether ... the grenade could have been abandoned after military training activities\u201d, which is a rather high threshold that demands a direct causal link between the State\u2019s action and the applicants\u2019 injuries. In contrast, previous case-law has established that harm may be attributed to the State\u2019s inaction and namely to a failure to monitor compliance with the law. For instance, in Iliya Petrov v. Bulgaria, the Court found that the lack of a system for monitoring the proper application of safety rules in the operation of high-voltage electrical installations was the determining factor in the occurrence of the accident. Significantly, in Cevrio\u011flu v. Turkey, although the proper implementation of the relevant inspection mechanism might not have absolutely prevented the death of the applicant\u2019s son, the Court found it sufficient that it would have \u201cincreased the possibility of identifying and remedying the failings\u201d of the system. It is also significant that where the State is engaged in a dangerous activity, it is under an obligation to govern the \u201coperation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks\u201d.",

                                        "content": "As pointed out by the Court in the present judgment, \u201cat an unidentified place an unidentified person responsible for guarding the firearms, ammunition and the explosive devices, had failed to carry out his duties properly\u201d and this person responsible for guarding this particular ammunition (a 30-mm VOG-17 grenade from an AGS-17 heavy grenade launcher which had been launched) could only have been a member of the military personnel. It also follows from the sequence of events that the supervision of the military personnel involved was insufficient as well, since there is no indication that the conduct of the personnel was subject to control. For instance, there is no indication of an inventory being taken after activities involving the use of grenades, or of a periodic inventory for that matter. Nor is there any indication that the designated supervisory authority, the Main Information Centre or regional organ of the Ministry of the Interior, played any role in supervising the recording of lost weapons and ammunition. Accordingly, it should be concluded that the State authorities have failed in their obligation to monitor compliance with the law.",

This amount would obviously be excessive in the case of a mere procedural violation of Article 2, according to the case-law of the Court. The truth is that the Court decided this \u201c[i]n view of the seriousness of the violation concerning the procedural obligation of the State in a situation involving an interference with the right to life of the applicants, who sustained serious injuries demanding complex treatment at the age of thirteen and seven\u201d. In other words, the Court went well beyond the reasonable amount for a procedural violation of Article 2, in view of the gravity of the consequences that this incident has had for the applicants. By so doing, the Court is ultimately imputing these injuries to the negligence of the Russian State.",
