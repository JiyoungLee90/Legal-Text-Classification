It recalls that it is not its task to act by calling into question the outcome of the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts are best placed for assessing the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case and for interpreting and applying rules of substantive and procedural law (see Pekinel v. Turkey, no. 9939/02, \u00a7\u00a053, 18\u00a0March 2008). The Court also reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not concern the regulation of civil law rights between parties under private law. Courts\u2019 decisions according to the rules of private law cannot be seen as an unjustified State interference with the property rights of one of the parties. Indeed, it is the very function of the courts to determine such disputes, the regulation of which falls within the province of domestic law and outside the scope of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kucha\u0159 and \u0160tis v. Czech Republic (dec.), no. 37527/97, 21 October 1998; see also S.\u00d6., A.K., Ar.K. and Y.S.P.E.H.V. v. Turkey (dec.) 31138/96, 14 September 1999). It follows that this complaint should be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.",
