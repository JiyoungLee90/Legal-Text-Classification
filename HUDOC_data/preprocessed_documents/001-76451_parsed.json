In any event, the ground for the applicant\u2019s dismissal was the tainting of his reputation as a police officer, showing his unsuitability for police work from the point of view of the public-law provisions (paragraphs 12 and 44 above), with the result that a procedure in determination of the lawfulness of his dismissal on that basis would in any event have been ruled incompatible ratione materiae with Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pellegrin v.

Norway, no. 34964/97, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2003-II; also see, C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11882/85, Commission decision of 7 October 1987, DR 54, p. 162). The only basis on which the present applicant can bring a complaint about a breach of the presumption of innocence in relation to his dismissal is by alleging that an official statement in the context of the dismissal procedure amounted to an unequivocal declaration of his guilt, which could have prejudged the subsequent assessment of the charges against him in the context of the ensuing criminal proceedings. However, this is not how the argument has been raised on behalf of the applicant. The fact of his dismissal, as such, is of no relevance in determining the compliance with the principle of the presumption of innocence, given the absence of any indication that the wording of the dismissal order - or indeed any other public statement made within or outside the context of the impugned criminal case - amounted to a premature declaration of his guilt (see, by contrast, Butkevi\u010dius v. Lithuania, no.\u00a048297/99, \u00a7\u00a7 49-54, ECHR 2002-II).
