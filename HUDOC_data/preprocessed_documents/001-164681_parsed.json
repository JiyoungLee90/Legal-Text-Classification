The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Gherghina v. Romania (dec.) [GC], no. 42219/07, \u00a7 84, 9 July 2015; Hentrich v. France, 22\u00a0September 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a0296-A; and Remli v. France, 23\u00a0April 1996, \u00a7 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II). Thus, a complaint submitted to the Court should first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos.\u00a017153/11 and 29 others, \u00a7 72, 25 March 2014). To hold otherwise would not be compatible with the subsidiary character of the Convention system (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, \u00a7 42, 6 November 2008). Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires only that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances (see Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 73; Balogh v.\u00a0Hungary, no. 47940/99, \u00a7 30, 20 July 2004; and John Sammut and Visa Investments Limited v.\u00a0Malta (dec.), no.\u00a027023/03, 28 June 2005).",

According to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 is to be read in the light of the principle enunciated in the first sentence. Consequently, any interference must achieve a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirement of protecting the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In each case involving an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must ascertain whether by reason of the State\u2019s interference, the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February 1986, \u00a7 50, Series A no. 98, and Amato Gauci v. Malta, no.\u00a047045/06, \u00a7 57, 15 September 2009).

France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 75, ECHR 1999-III; Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 49, ECHR 1999V; and Luordo v.

The Court notes that when new legislation is introduced, the new procedural rules may apply only to future cases or to all pending proceedings. In this instance, the Croatian legislator provided that all pending enforcement proceedings would be conducted under the old rules (see paragraph 45 above). In the Court\u2019s view, this is just one example among others of the variety of legal systems existing in Europe, and it is not the Court\u2019s task to standardise them. A State\u2019s choice of a particular system of procedural rules is in principle outside the scope of the supervision carried out by the Court at European level, provided that the system chosen does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

However, in proceedings originating in an individual application the Court has to confine itself, as far as possible, to an examination of the concrete case before it (see J.B. v.

The purpose of the hearing was to give the parties a possibility to advance their arguments concerning the price of the property to be sold and to submit evidence in support of their arguments (see section 87(1) of the Enforcement Act, paragraph 42 above). The first applicant, however, did not advance any arguments or submit any evidence. Even though he had promised to submit an expert valuation of the house within two days, he failed to do so. An expert commissioned by the Municipal Court submitted his valuation report on 20\u00a0August 2010. The applicants did not submit any objections to that report. Indeed, they challenged the valuation of their house for the first time in their appeal against the decision granting M.G. title to the house, at a stage of the proceedings when further arguments concerning the value of the house were no longer admissible.",
