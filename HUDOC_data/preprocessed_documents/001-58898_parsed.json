It is true that in some instances courts have relied on this provision as a basis for ordering the detainee\u2019s release. However, apart from the Anthony Price case which concerned the 48hour time-limit for bringing arrested persons before a magistrate having been exceeded, the Government did not refer to any instances in which section\u00a0137 was successfully invoked to challenge the lawfulness of arrest or detention on suspicion of a criminal offence.

The Court notes that, according to the Government\u2019s own description, lodging a constitutional application involves a referral to the Civil Court and the possibility of an appeal to the Constitutional Court. This is a cumbersome procedure especially since practice shows that appeals to the Constitutional Court are lodged as a matter of course.
