Turkey (no. 46747/99, \u00a7 45, 18\u00a0October 2005). While there is little doubt that more could have been done by the police in the present case, the decisive question is whether their reaction was adequate in the circumstances, having regard to the concrete facts and practical realities of daily police work. In this respect, the Court notes that the nursing home was located on a busy boulevard in  \u2013 a city of more than one million inhabitants. Since the staff of the nursing home, who \u2013 unlike the police \u2013 knew Mrs\u00a0Stoyanova's physical appearance well, had searched the area in vain, it is difficult for the Court to accept that the police officers' decision not to deploy forces for an immediate search was unreasonable.",

That is particularly surprising having regard to the fact that the problem was raised repeatedly by some of the parties, including the applicant, and that the Sofia City Court noted it in its judgement of 31 July 2002 (see paragraphs 33, 35, 44, 49 and 50 above). The ensuing delay is entirely imputable to the courts, which were under a duty to determine the legal characterisation of the claim (see paragraph 59 above).",

Having regard to the nature of those differences, the Court finds it difficult to accept that in 2004 and 2005 it was justified to begin the proceedings afresh and invalidate the procedural steps undertaken since 1996, including the collection of witnesses' testimonies and documentary evidence. The rule according to which the proceedings had to restart might have had sound basis in legal theory, however, it must have been obvious to the national courts that its implementation in the particular circumstances would engender significant difficulties, having regard to the limited possibilities to collect evidence, including witness testimony, a decade or more after the events. The duty of Contracting States to secure the enjoyment of such fundamental human rights as the right to life requires the implementation of legal remedies that are capable of producing effective practical results without excessive formalism. It was for the national authorities to conceive such procedural rules as to avoid unjustified delays.",

It never did so, despite repeated statements by the parties in that sense.
