Albania, no. 32907/07, \u00a7\u00a7 58-60, 29 September 2009). Furthermore, having regard to the bailiff\u2019s repeated inability to enforce the final decision in the applicant company\u2019s favour, an appeal against its decisions discontinuing the enforcement would not have been capable of remedying the situation. Finally, the Court is not convinced that a criminal complaint under Article 320 of the CC would have provided redress or compensation to the applicant company. In fact, not even the imposition of a fine on the director of the local Treasury office resulted in a favourable outcome to the applicant company.",
