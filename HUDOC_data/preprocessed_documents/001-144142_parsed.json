They first indicated that the applicants had been offered a new flat as far back as in July 2004, the only one which had been available within the Council\u2019s temporary stock. However, they had turned down this flat. The applicants had been provided with housing on 28 September 2005 (the first applicant) and on 28\u00a0December 2005 (the other applicants). The time taken by the Council to rehouse them had been consistent with its housing programme and with the regional programme on the rehousing of residents from derelict housing. In this regard, the Government indicated that, given the extent of the problem and the shortage of local authority housing, it had not been possible to rehouse the thousands of people concerned by the programmes at once without causing the Council\u2019s budget to be exceeded. The Government also submitted that the delay in the rehousing of the applicants had been caused by the applicants themselves, because they had initiated proceedings aimed at being provided with a specific apartment. Finally, the Government indicated that as regards the sum of RUB 500 awarded by the judgment of 13\u00a0May 2004 it had been transferred to the first applicant\u2019s bank account on 28\u00a0March 2006.

In this regard, the Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite a lack of funds or other resources, such as housing, as an excuse for not honoring a judgment debt (see Malinovskiy v.

In this respect, the Court refers to its practice regarding awards of just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage (see lastly Kalinkin and others, cited above, \u00a7 59). Given what was at stake for the applicants, the Court observes that the prompt execution of the domestic judgment ordering that the applicants be temporarily rehoused from a house unsuitable for habitation and which presented an imminent threat of collapse had particular importance for them: this factor is not without impact on the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the individuals concerned as a result of the violations found.",
