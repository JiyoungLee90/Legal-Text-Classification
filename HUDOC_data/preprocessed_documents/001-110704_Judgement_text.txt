The applicants lodged separate civil actions before the domestic courts seeking the eviction of the IDPs from their flats.

The respective judgments became final and enforceable. However, the IDP families refused to comply with those judgments and despite the applicants’ complaints to various authorities, the judgments were not enforced.
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Gulmammadova v.  (no. 38798/07, §§ 18-24, 22 April 2010).
