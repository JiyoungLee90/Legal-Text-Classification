Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court of 20 October 2005 file number 5Cdo\u00a0150/03, the court held that criminal proceedings which were conducted in compliance with the applicable laws could not constitute an unjustified interference with personal integrity even if they ended with an acquittal. The court also addressed briefly the length of the plaintiffs\u2019 detention and concluded that it had not been excessive. The above claim was thus not accepted, unlike other claims made in the same action (compensation for lost profit, legal costs and infringement of the presumption of innocence).",

The Court emphasises that a fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear judicial declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question (see Matija\u0161evi\u0107 v. Serbia, no. 23037/04, \u00a7 48, 19 September 2006). The Court finds that the statements impugned in the present case implied the applicant\u2019s guilt before it was proved according to law.",
