Thus, it observes that the first hearing in the case was scheduled in one year from the date of lodging of the claims and that the court was inactive for nine months after adjourning the hearing of 20 October 2000 to allow the State respondent to collect certain documents. Furthermore, despite the relative simplicity of the case, its examination at the first instance was plagued by various defects which compelled the appeal court to remit it to the trial court on three occasions. In this respect the Court reiterates that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory. The right to have one\u2019s claim examined within a reasonable time would be devoid of all sense if domestic courts examined a case endlessly, even if at the end the length of proceedings per instance did not appear particularly excessive (see, mutatis mutandis, Svetlana Orlova v. Russia, no. 4487/04, \u00a7 47, 30 July 2009).",

Romania, no.\u00a019567/02, \u00a7 24, 2 November 2006; and Falimonov v. Russia, no.\u00a011549/02, \u00a7\u00a058, 25\u00a0March 2008). The fact that the domestic courts heard the case several times did not absolve them from complying with the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Litoselitis v. Greece, no.\u00a062771/00, \u00a7\u00a032, 5\u00a0February 2004; and Svetlana Orlova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a050).
