However, in assessing the reasonableness of the time elapsed after the Court\u2019s judgment, account must be taken of the total length of the proceedings. In this respect, the Court recalls that the proceedings had started on 16 October 1995 when the applicant lodged her civil claim. Their whole duration thus was fourteen years and more than one month at three levels of jurisdiction.",
