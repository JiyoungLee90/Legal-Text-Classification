The case originated in an application (no. 38840/08) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Ms Valentina Atanasova Gyuleva (“the applicant”), on 6 August 2008.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Obretenov, of the Ministry of Justice
The applicant alleged, in particular, that her rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention had been breached because she had not been notified of a set of civil proceedings instituted against her and had not been able to defend herself in the context of those proceedings.
On 16 March 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Plovdiv.
Between 1992 and 2000 the applicant was involved in proceedings regarding the restitution of a flat which she and her family had been occupying. The flat, purchased from the State by the applicant’s parents in 1968, had become State property after having been nationalised in the period following 1947, and denationalisation legislation adopted in the beginning of the 1990s provided that under certain circumstances even properties which had in the meantime been sold to private parties could be subject to restitution. At the end of the proceedings at issue the courts found that the pre-nationalisation owners were the true owners of the flat by virtue of restitution. Those proceedings were the subject of the applicant’s first application before the Court, in which the Court found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and also a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention due to the length of the court proceedings (see Gyuleva and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 76963/01, 25 June 2009).
On 1 February 2002 the persons recognised as owners of the flat at issue (the pre-nationalisation owners) sold it to a Mr and Mrs P. Soon after that, Mr and Mrs P. brought rei vindicatio proceedings against the applicant, who was still living in the property. Their claim was allowed at first instance by the Plovdiv District Court on 24 October 2002. Even though the rei vindicatio proceedings after that remained the subject of appeals, the applicant vacated the property on 10 January 2003. She moved to a house she owned in the village of Hrabrino, where she registered her address on 4 February 2003.
On 4 May 2005 Mr and Mrs P. brought another action against the applicant, for unjust enrichment, alleging that she had had no valid legal grounds to live in their flat between 1 February 2002 and 10 January 2003, and seeking compensation.
On 16 May 2005 the Plovdiv District Court issued a summons, notifying the applicant of the action brought against her and the date of the first court hearing. The summons was sent to the mayor of Hrabrino for delivery to the applicant. However, in a letter to the District Court dated 16 June 2005, the mayor sent the summons back, stating that “no such person has been registered” as living in the village.
On 8 July 2005, upon a request by Mr and Mrs P., the Plovdiv Regional Directorate of the Interior issued a certificate confirming that the applicant’s last declared address was in the village of Hrabrino.
Without making any further attempts to find the applicant, on 26 August 2005 the Plovdiv District Court, after concluding that the applicant was of “unknown address”, published a notification concerning the unjust enrichment proceedings in the State Gazette (Article 50 § 1 of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure, see paragraph 18 below in fine).
The District Court appointed ex officio a lawyer to represent the applicant, to whom all subsequent papers and notifications were served. According to the applicant, the lawyer did not adequately defend her interests in the proceedings, because she failed to seek to contact the applicant, to appeal against the Plovdiv District Court’s judgment, which would have been standard practice, to make any evidentiary requests, or to contest in any meaningful manner the claimants’ arguments, including by raising what the applicant considered a valid objection that the claims against her were partially time-barred.
On 6 April 2006 the Plovdiv District Court gave judgment, allowing the claim against the applicant and ordering her to pay 3,573 Bulgarian levs (BGN), plus interest, to Mr and Mrs P.
Upon an appeal by Mr and Mrs P., in a judgment of 10 July 2006 which was final, the Plovdiv Regional Court ordered the applicant to pay the claimants an additional BGN 1,006.21.
The applicant became aware of the proceedings and the judgments against her on 22 February 2008, when she received a notice from a bailiff to pay the sums due.
The applicant points to several additional facts. In 2004, she was appointed as a juror at the Plovdiv District Court for the period between 2005 and 2009 and she received notifications of the court hearings she needed to attend at another address she had provided to the authorities (the address of her brother in Plovdiv). At that same address, in 2007 and 2008, she received two summonses related to other unspecified proceedings brought against her by Mr and Mrs P. At that same address, in February 2008, she received the bailiff’s notice mentioned in the previous paragraph. The applicant is a well-known piano teacher at the Academy of Music, Dance and Fine Arts in Plovdiv whose place of work could have been known to the authorities.
In the months after February 2008 the applicant paid the sums owed by her in full. The overall amount paid, comprising the damages awarded to Mr and Mrs P., accrued interest and the relevant fees and expenses, totalled BGN 8,767.07 (equivalent to approximately 4,473 euros (EUR)).
At the relevant time, service of a summons was regulated by Articles 41 to 52 of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure, in force until 1 March 2008. Summonses were as a rule to be delivered by court officials or, where appropriate, through the competent municipality or by a village mayor (Article 41 §§ 1 and 2). It was also possible to send them by registered mail (Article 41 § 3). Summonses could also be served on individuals at their place of work (Article 49). As a last resort, in cases where, inter alia, the party’s address was unknown, that party could be summoned through a notification published in the State Gazette, under Article 50 § 1 of the Code, which provided:
“Where, at the time the proceedings are initiated, the defendant’s address is unknown, or the summons cannot be served at his registered address during a month and his absence has been certified on the summons with the signature of at least one witness, with the person serving the summons indicating [the witness’] three names and address, the defendant shall be summoned through a publication in the unofficial section of the State Gazette, made at least a month before the court hearing. The court shall resort to such means of summoning after having satisfied itself, through a check at the respective address service or otherwise, that the defendant’s address is indeed unknown.”
Article 231 § 1 of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure provided that parties could seek the setting aside of a final judgment and the re-opening of their case in situations, inter alia, where they had been deprived of the possibility to participate in the proceedings, in breach of the respective rules, or where a court-appointed representative had been assigned to represent them, even though their address had not been unknown. Similar provisions are contained in Article 303 § 1 (5) and (6) of the new Code of Civil Procedure, adopted in 2007 and in force since 1 March 2008.
Pursuant to Article 232 § 1 of the 1952 Code, any interested party intending to seek a re-opening of their case on the grounds mentioned above, could do so within three months of becoming aware of the contested judgment, but no later than a year following its entry into force. An identical provision was initially contained in Article 305 of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure.
On 30 May 2008 an amendment to Article 305 of the 2007 Code was published in the State Gazette. The rule that the re-opening of a case could only be sought within a year of the impugned judgment’s entry into force was repealed, and the only requirement which remained was that the interested party should apply for a re-opening of their case within three months of becoming aware of that judgment.
Following that amendment, when dealing with requests for reopening in respect of judgments which had entered into force under the rules of the 1952 Code, in situations where the absolute time-limit of oneyear following the judgment’s entry into force had expired but the three-month time-limit from the moment the interested party had become aware of it had not, the Supreme Court of Cassation held in some cases that the parties were no longer entitled to seek re-opening (Определение № 8 от 21.01.2011 г. по гр. д. № 1418/10 г. на І г. о., Определение № 171 от 27.06.2013 г. по гр. д. № 3668/13 г. на ІV г. о.), and in others that they could still do so, despite the expiry of more than one year (Решение № 374 от 03.10.2011 г. по гр. д. № 1356/10 г. на ІV г. о., Решение № 114 от 10.04.2012 г. по гр. д. № 598/11 г. на ІV г. о.). Due to the divergent caselaw, the matter was brought up before the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Cassation, for interpretative decision.
Article 303 § 1 (7) of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure provides that an interested party may also request the re-opening of civil proceedings in a case where a “judgment of the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of the [Convention]” and “a new examination of the case is required in order to repair the consequences of the violation”.
Section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (“the SMRDA”) provides that the State and the municipalities are liable for damage suffered by private individuals as a result of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions by public officials committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of their duties. Section 2 of the same Act provides for liability of the courts in specific situations, which are mostly in the context of criminal proceedings and which do not include defective service of a summons.
