While noting that the members of the applicant union who were dismissed are not applicants in the case before it, the Court considers that their dismissal had two effects on the union\u2019s activities. Firstly, the fact that the judicial decisions did not lead to the reinstatement of the dismissed employees or, alternatively, to an order for the company to pay compensation for wrongful dismissal amounting to an effective deterrent caused the applicant union to lose its members at the Tuka\u015f company. Secondly, the non-reinstatement of the dismissed employees and the insufficient amounts of compensation they were awarded by the courts for wrongful dismissal had the effect of discouraging other employees from joining the applicant union. The union thus lost the chance of retaining its members or attracting new ones and attaining the necessary threshold to qualify as representative for the purpose of collective bargaining within the company in question. It cannot reasonably be concluded that the damage caused by the redundancy of the employees belonging to the union as a result of their wrongful dismissal was fully repaired and ceased to have a deterrent effect simply because the dismissed employees were paid compensation equivalent to one year\u2019s wages, following judicial proceedings that lasted between a year and a year and half instead of complying with the three-month time-limit prescribed by law. In the light of these factors, the Court considers that there has been an interference with the applicant union\u2019s exercise, as an entity distinct from its members, of its right to conduct trade-union activities and engage in collective bargaining.",

It infers from this that the relevant law, as applied by the courts, did not impose sufficiently deterrent penalties on the employer, which, by carrying out large-scale wrongful dismissals, negated the applicant union\u2019s freedom to seek to persuade employees to join it. Accordingly, neither the legislature nor the courts involved in the case satisfied their positive obligation to secure the effective enjoyment of the applicant union\u2019s right to seek to persuade the employer to hear what it had to say on behalf of its members and, in principle, its right to bargain collectively with the employer. It follows that a fair balance between the competing interests of the applicant union and of the community as a whole has not been struck in the present case.",
