The judge\u2019s decision was entered in the land register on 14 June 2013 and the applicant company was thus able to recover its property on 2\u00a0December 2013.",

According to a line of Court of Cassation case-law, this type of development was not unlawful where it had been authorised by the competent authorities (Court of Cassation, 1988, Brunotti, and Court of Cassation, no. 6094, 1991, Ligresti and Others). Land planning was regulated by a series of administrative acts which, on the basis of the broader land-use plan, led to the adoption of decisions on individual cases. The criminal courts had no power to waive the implementation of the administrative decision authorising individual projects, save where it was deemed non-existent or invalid (Court of Cassation, Ligresti and Others, cited above). In so far as the unlawful site development encroached on the powers of the public authorities in matters of land planning, the offence was made out where a new developed area was created without any preventive supervision on the part of the municipality (Court of Cassation, 1980, Peta, and Court of Cassation, Brunotti, cited above). In conclusion, under this approach the development was unlawful only where it was not authorised, and not where, despite planning permission, the activity was deemed inconsistent with other planning regulations.",

In this scenario, the development project exclusively stems from a legal procedure rather than a physical activity (building work) (Court of Cassation, 2009, Quarta). Where legal acts are combined with building activity, the status of \u201ccontractual\u201d development shifts to that of \u201chybrid\u201d unlawful site development (see Court of Cassation, no. 618, 2012).

The change may, for instance, involve splitting up a tourist/hotel complex and selling the units separately as private dwellings. Such a change of intended use must be such as to affect the land-use plan. This mode of development fits into either the material or the contractual category of site development depending on whether the emphasis is placed on the existence of constructions (material element) or on the manner in which the development project is implemented, that is to say by a legal act (see, to that effect, Court of Cassation, no. 20569, 2015). Even though this mode of development does not involve unauthorised building activity, case-law considers that it is one of the situations provided for in Article 30 of the Construction Code, given that the separate sale of buildings necessarily entails dividing up the land on which they are built (Farabegoli, cited above).",

If it wishes to order confiscation, a criminal court must ascertain that the material element of the offence of unlawful site development is made out, which means that it must establish the existence of all the constituent elements of the unlawful conduct. Under section 18 of Law no. 47 of 1985, the notion of unlawful conduct is not confined to activities carried on without authorisation, but also includes acts in breach of planning regulations and of regional and national norms (Court of Cassation, Salvini and Others, cited above). In this context, the Court of Cassation has clarified the relationship between the administrative decision authorising site development and the power of the criminal court to make a finding of unlawful site development and to order confiscation. The Court of Cassation has explained that where the planning permission does not comply with other planning regulations, the criminal court may find against the perpetrator of the development and order confiscation without the need for any administrative assessment of the permission granted. Given that the criminal court is not empowered to declare the permission null and void, it will remain valid (Court of Cassation, Salvini and Others, cited above; Court of Cassation, Varvara, cited above; and Court of Cassation, no.\u00a036366, 2015, Faiola).",

Without an autonomous concept of penalty, States would be free to impose penalties without classifying them as such, and the individuals concerned would then be deprived of the safeguards under Article 7 \u00a7 1. That provision would thus be devoid of any practical effect. It is of crucial importance that the Convention be interpreted and applied in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory, and this principle thus applies to Article 7 (see Del R\u00edo Prada, cited above, \u00a7 88).",

As is explained in the Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment (merits, cited above), the principle that offences and sanctions must be provided for by law entails that criminal law must clearly define the offences and the sanctions by which they are punished, such as to be accessible and foreseeable in its effects. This\u00a0requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. This also means that, in principle, a measure can only be regarded as a penalty within the meaning of Article 7 where an element of personal liability on the part of the offender has been established. There is certainly, as the Italian Court of Cassation noted in the case of Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others (see paragraph 112 of the Court\u2019s judgment in that case, ibid.), a clear correlation between the degree of foreseeability of a criminal-law provision and the personal liability of the offender. The Grand Chamber thus shares the Chamber\u2019s findings in that case to the effect that punishment under Article 7 requires the existence of a mental link through which an element of liability may be detected in the conduct of the person who physically committed the offence (ibid., \u00a7 116).",

In this connection, the Court would refer to its case-law under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention to the effect that in principle the Contracting States remain free to apply the criminal law to an act where it is not carried out in the normal exercise of one of the rights protected under the Convention (see Engel and Others v.\u00a0the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 81, Series A no. 22, p. 34) and, accordingly, to define the constituent elements of the resulting offence. In particular, the Contracting States may, under certain conditions, penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or from negligence. Examples of such offences may be found in the laws of the Contracting States. Presumptions of fact or of law operate in every legal system. The Convention does not prohibit such presumptions in principle; it does, however, require the Contracting States to remain within certain limits in this respect as regards criminal law. According to the case-law, these limits will be overstepped where a presumption has the effect of making it impossible for an individual to exonerate himself from the accusations against him, thus depriving him of the benefit of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 27-28, Series A no.\u00a0141-A; Janosevic v.\u00a0Sweden, no. 34619/97, \u00a7\u00a068; ECHR 2002 - VII and Klouvi v.\u00a0France, no. 30754/03, \u00a7 48, 30 June 2011).",

That Article allowed legitimate interference only on the basis of a law that was accessible, precise and foreseeable. The applicant company took the view that section 19 should have indicated in greater detail the limits within which it was possible to decide on confiscation in relation to the established facts, by indicating, according to a principle of reason and proportionality, the extent of the land that could be confiscated in relation to the buildings erected thereon and the unlawful conduct as established in material and mental terms. It explained that the lack of clarity and precision of the national law, and of the regional law, which had been regarded by the Court as \u201cobscure and poorly worded\u201d in its Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others judgment (merits, cited above), had made it possible to confiscate land of an area that was three times as large as that covered by the planning permission issued by the Bari municipal authority.

Moreover, the applicant companies took the view that a State\u2019s interference with the right to enjoyment of property had to strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the imperatives of guaranteeing the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. They explained that, in the present case, the extent of the confiscation affecting the property had to be taken into account: the eighty-eight plots that were built upon totalled 15,920 sq. m, while the confiscation had affected an additional area that was 14.5 times as large.",

The impugned measures had a legal basis, pursued a legitimate aim and were proportionate. As to the proportionality aspect, the Government explained that less restrictive measures could not have been envisaged. In their view, it would have been technically very difficult, if not impossible, to limit the confiscation merely to the areas that had been built upon and to have separated those areas from the undeveloped land. In the Government\u2019s view, a purely partial confiscation of the land would have frustrated the legitimate aims pursued by the State, namely to ensure the conformity of the plots in question with the planning regulations, environmental protection and the punishment of those responsible for the unlawful land transformation. In any event, the Government argued that the State had to be afforded a broad margin of appreciation as to the choice of instruments to be used in order to find the best solutions to guarantee environmental protection.",

For the same reason the present case can be distinguished from C.M. v. France ((dec.), no. 28078/95, ECHR 2001VII) or Air Canada v. the United Kingdom (5 May 1995, Series\u00a0A no. 316A), in which the confiscation, ordered after the conviction of the accused, concerned property which was the instrumentum sceleris and was in the possession of third parties. As regards the proceeds of crime (productum sceleris), the Court observes that it has examined a case where the confiscation had followed the applicant\u2019s conviction (see Phillips v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a041087/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09-18, ECHR 2001-VII) and cases where confiscation had been ordered independently of the existence of any criminal proceedings, because the applicant companies\u2019 property had been presumed to be of unlawful origin (see Riela and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 52439/99, 4\u00a0September 2001; Arcuri and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 52024/99, 5 July 2001; and Raimondo v.\u00a0Italy, 22\u00a0February 1994, \u00a7\u00a029, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0281-A) or to have been used for unlawful activities (Butler v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 41661/98, 27 June 2002). In the first case cited above, the Court held that the confiscation constituted a penalty for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Phillips, cited above, \u00a7\u00a051, and, mutatis mutandis, Welch v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, 9\u00a0February 1995, \u00a7\u00a035, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0307-A), whereas in the other cases it took the view that it was a matter of control of the use of property.",

Regarded as a procedural safeguard in the context of the criminal trial itself, the presumption of innocence also has another aspect. Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fairtrial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a02 in this connection may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see, for example, Zollman v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 62902/00, ECHR\u00a02003XII; Taliadorou and Stylianou v. Cyprus, nos. 39627/05 and 39631/05, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 56-59, 16 October 2008; and Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09394).",

Romania (no. 34814/02, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a040-42, 14 April 2009), the Court found that the fact that the court ruling at last instance had quashed the acquittal decisions by the lower courts, and had found the person concerned guilty whilst closing the proceedings because criminal liability was statute-barred, had breached Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, since the defence rights had not been respected in the proceedings before it, even though that last-instance court was the first court to have found the applicant guilty. Similarly, in Giosakis v. Greece (no. 3) (no. 5689/08, \u00a7 41, 3 May 2011), the Court found that Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention had been breached by the fact that the Court of Cassation had quashed the acquittal by the Court of Appeal whereas it had at the same time found the proceedings to be statute-barred.",

The court could thus order a measure similar to that which could be taken by the administrative authorities. According to the domestic law provisions existing at the time and the interpretation thereof by the national courts, confiscation ordered by criminal courts was an administrative sanction, because it was a measure intended to restore legality. It was not regarded as a punitive measure linked to the personal liability of the accused; it was warranted by the mere fact that the transformation was illegal. According to the Sud Fondi judgment, however, the confiscation measure was a \u201cpenalty\u201d within the meaning of Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. That analysis entailed that such a measure could be imposed only on the basis of a sufficiently precise law and on the condition that there was a mental link between the objectively illegal acts and the person who committed them: an element of liability had to be established in that person\u2019s conduct. The Italian courts attempted to implement the Sud Fondi judgment, thus leading to an interpretation of domestic law whereby a confiscation order could be issued only against a person \u201cwhose liability [had] been established through a mental link\u201d (awareness and intent) with the acts in question.",

On that last point, the Court uses rather equivocal language: it sometimes speaks more generally of \u201cliability\u201d and sometimes more specifically of a \u201cconviction\u201d, a term which is also used in the strictly criminal context of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), or \u201ca verdict as to guilt\u201d.

The Constitutional Court noted that such an interpretation would be in conflict, not only with the Italian Constitution (as it would limit the legislature\u2019s discretion to decide whether a given conduct should be \u201csanctioned\u201d by criminal law or by administrative law), but also with the case-law of the European Court (which accepted that \u201cpenalties\u201d, in the sense of the Convention, could be imposed by an administrative authority, without a formal declaration of guilt by a criminal court). Moreover, and more importantly, the Constitutional Court indicated that it was possible to interpret Varvara differently, namely by considering that it only required that \u201cliability\u201d be established, in whatever form (a \u201cconviction\u201d being one of several possible forms). As a consequence, it concluded that \u201cas things currently stand\u201d \u2013 that is, until the Grand Chamber ruled in G.I.E.M. and Others, one could not unequivocally interpret Varvara as implying that confiscation was possible only where there was a \u201cconviction\u201d for the offence of illegal transformation of land. Since it was possible to read Varvara differently, the Constitutional Court took the view that the domestic courts should adopt that interpretation, which was in line with the European Court\u2019s case-law and which was compatible with the Italian Constitution).",

I do not think that a true dialogue between courts is served by ignoring the criticism addressed by some supreme and constitutional courts to the Court and its case-law.

Yet simultaneously the Constitutional Court admitted that \u201cthe interpretation in conformity with the Constitution is supported by significant regulatory instructions, including those with supranational origins\u201d, referring to the Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Furthermore, in order to enrich the interpretation of the constitutional catalogue of fundamental rights, the Constitutional Court invoked not only Convention provisions, but also the Court\u2019s case-law. Nevertheless, the impact of the Convention in the constitutional landscape remained very limited.

In its seminal judgments no. 348 and no. 349 of 2007, also known as the \u201ctwin judgments\u201d (sentenze gemelle), the Constitutional Court reacted to this move of the ordinary judges, taking into account the new text of Article\u00a0117 of the Constitution, as amended by Constitutional Law no. 3 of 18 October 2001, which requires the legislature to comply with international obligations. On this constitutional basis, the Constitutional Court took the view that the Convention was a norm of intermediate rank between statute law and the Constitution and asserted its monopoly over any conflict between Convention and domestic law. In a discourse focused on the formal placement of international treaties in the Italian system of sources of law, the supralegislative rank of Convention law was unambiguously affirmed. In case of conflict between the Convention, as interpreted by the Court, and domestic legislation subsequent to Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, ordinary judges could not give priority to the former, and therefore could not set aside the conflicting domestic provision, but instead had to submit the conflict question to the \u201cfinal say\u201d of the Constitutional Court. The\u00a0Constitutional Court will then assess whether the Convention provision at stake, as interpreted by the Court, is compatible with the Constitution and, if so, whether the impugned statute is compatible with the Convention. In the event that the Convention provision at stake, as interpreted by the Court, were incompatible with the Constitution, Law no. 848 of 4\u00a0August 1955 would have to be partially struck down, in respect of the said provision, since the Convention itself cannot be found unconstitutional. Were the impugned statute incompatible with the Convention, the former would have to be struck down, because it would infringe Article 117 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. Therefore the Strasbourg Court\u2019s interpretation of the Convention has normative value, in so far as it functions as a normative standard in the constitutionality assessment of ordinary laws.",

Although admitting that the Convention was different from other international treaties, to the extent that its interpretation was not in the hands of the Contracting Parties, but in those of a Court, which had the \u201cfinal say\u201d (ultima parola) with regard to such interpretation, the Constitutional Court stressed that the Convention should be understood as a multilateral agreement which did not limit the Contracting parties\u2019 sovereignty.

In view of the precedent-oriented nature of the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, which warrants a long consolidation of its principles, not every judgment can be recognised as representing the Court\u2019s case-law. On the other hand, in the Consulta\u2019s eyes, the Strasbourg judgments are too simplistic and linear, because they take into account only the subjective interests at stake, not all the involved objective interests; thus the Court\u2019s case-law does not consider fully the peculiarity of the Italian legal order. If need be, the Constitutional Court may repeat the balancing of interests performed by Strasbourg in the light of the objective interests prevailing in the Italian constitutional order. It is precisely for that reason that a certain margin of appreciation should be accorded to the domestic authorities in the implementation of the Court\u2019s judgments.",

The Varvara requirement of the formal \u201cverdict as to ... guilt\u201d is a mere logical derivation from the requirement of limitation periods. There can be no punishment without a formal declaration of guilt, because there can be no such declaration after the prescrizione of the offence. In other words, the core of the famous paragraph 72 of Varvara lies in the acknowledgment that the application of the statute of limitations is not a substantive conviction (la prescrizione non \u00e8 una sostanziale condanna). While Sud Fondi established the principle of nulla poena sine culpa, Varvara recognised the statute of limitations as an integral part of the principle of legality. Article 7 thus precludes the application of confiscation (which is a \u201cpenalty\u201d according to Convention law, as interpreted by the Court, and Italian constitutional law, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court) to a timebarred offence, because prescrizione has the meaning of a substantive guarantee, and not a mere procedural meaning, in both Convention and national law.",

Although not grounded on the Convention, but on the Rules of Court, they are typical constitutional review instruments which play a critical role in resolving the dysfunctional operation of domestic law or the legislator\u2019s failure to regulate systemic dysfunctions, but have no special interpretative authority or distinct legal force. In fact, they mostly confirm previous case-law, delivered against the respondent Contracting Party or other Contracting Parties. For this Court, any decision or judgment constitutes an authoritative source of interpretation of the Convention and represents, as the Italian Constitutional Court itself admits, \u201cthe final say\u201d as to its meaning. The Court states this principle in the following straightforward terms: \u201cits judgments all have the same legal value.

The first criterion that the Italian Court uses to discard the consolidation of European case-law is \u201cthe creativity of the principle asserted compared to the traditional approach of European case-law\u201d. It is hard to understand what \u201ccreativity\u201d means in this context. Particularly, any solution given to a factual situation that appears before the Court for the first time would be, ipso facto, \u201ccreative\u201d in a relevant sense. No\u00a0\u201cconsolidated law\u201d would therefore emerge from a single case. If this were true, it would lead to the absurd result that, when the Court faces the same factual pattern for a second time, there would be no \u201cconsolidated law\u201d yet to be relied upon.

However, this comparative work is an intellectual operation which is neither obvious nor innocent. Since all cases are different in some regard, all cases could be said to be \u201ccreative\u201d in a non-trivial sense. The interpreter is left, therefore, with enormous discretion to recognise which cases are binding and which are not.

On the other hand, and more fundamentally, dissenting opinions do not demean in any way the legal force of the judgments to which they are appended.

The rhetoric of the Convention as a \u201cvillain\u2019s charter\u201d, which protects the terrorists, the paedophiles and all sorts of criminals against the innocent majority, or the abusive, lazy migrants against the hard-working Mr Smith, or the privileged minorities against the underprivileged, common man on the street, echoes the whipped-up fear of the outsider \u2013 of that which is foreign or different.",

These ideas have gained meretricious credibility with repetition. They are hard to untangle from other markers of a reactionary ideology, which hijacks the media space with the alarmist cries that government is losing control over borders and that Europe is losing control of its identity. This rhetoric is steeped in time-worn boutades about Europe being under attack from the near-heretics, sneering forces of modernity and governments being under constant siege from international organisations with an ever-growing political agenda. Such rhetoric has long erased the fine line between telling boastful untruths and criticising the advancements of case-law. It scorns the idea of universality of human rights with a view to revising the Court\u2019s civilisational acquis and putting the Court into reverse gear, in the belief that naming a desire will bring it about.",

In fact, the majority choose not to heed the call in my separate opinion in Varvara, where I mentioned the problematic state of the jurisprudence regarding confiscation.

The majority simply omit to provide any articulation for the two logically and axiologically contradictory statements. The only justification given is that, since the Court has accepted certain forms of presumption of liability under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, \u201cthe Court finds that the case-law described above applies mutatis mutandis under Article 7\u201d.

This latter possibility is highlighted by the Constitutional Court in its judgment no. 49 of 2015, which states that, under domestic law, it is not in itself impossible that an acquittal on the grounds of time-barring may be accompanied by a statement of more detailed reasons relating to \u201cresponsibility\u201d, for the sole purpose of the confiscation of land that has been unlawfully fragmented.",

The Constitutional Court noted that such an interpretation would be in conflict, not only with the Italian Constitution (as it would limit the legislature\u2019s discretion to decide whether a given conduct should be \u201csanctioned\u201d by criminal law or by administrative law), but also with the case-law of the European Court (which accepted that \u201cpenalties\u201d, in the autonomous sense of the Convention, could be imposed by an administrative authority, without a formal declaration of guilt by a criminal court) (\u00a7 6.1). Also, and more importantly, the Constitutional Court indicated that it was possible to interpret Varvara differently, namely by considering that it only required that \u201cresponsibility\u201d be established, in whatever form (a \u201cconviction\u201d for an offence being one of various possible forms). As a consequence, \u201cas things currently stand\u201d \u2013 that is, as long as the Grand Chamber would not hold otherwise in the present case \u2013 one could not unambiguously interpret Varvara as implying that confiscation was possible only in cases of a \u201cconviction\u201d for the offence of unlawful site development.

It is therefore relevant to look at the original provisions on criminal sanctions and confiscations, as they were contained in Act no. 47 of 28 February 1985. Sections 19 and 20 of that Act made a clear distinction between, respectively, confiscation measures and criminal penalties. Confiscation was not mentioned under the criminal penalties (see paragraphs 103 and 104 of the judgment). We therefore accept the Government\u2019s submission that the authors of the codification made a mistake (see paragraph 202 of the judgment), and consider that this mistake cannot have any consequence as to the characterisation of a confiscation measure. Finally, it is questionable whether the wording of the heading of an Article in a legislative or regulatory text can be relevant at all. According to the maxim \u201crubrica non fit ius\u201d (a heading does not create law), there is nothing normative that can flow from a heading.",

There the Court acknowledged that Article 7 did not expressly mention any mental link between the material element of the offence and the person deemed to have committed it. Nevertheless, the Court found that \u201cthe rationale of the sentence and punishment, and the \u2018guilty\u2019 concept (in the English version) and the corresponding notion of \u2018personne coupable\u2019 (in the French version), support[ed] an interpretation whereby Article 7 require[d], for the purposes of punishment, an intellectual link (awareness and intent) disclosing an element of liability in the conduct of the perpetrator of the offence, failing which the penalty [would] be unjustified\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 116).

It prohibits the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused\u2019s disadvantage. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege).

In fact, the majority immediately backtrack in paragraph 243 from its finding in paragraph 242, described above, that Article 7 of the Convention requires a \u201cmental link disclosing an element of liability\u201d, by stating that this requirement \u201cdoes not preclude the existence of certain forms of objective liability stemming from presumptions of liability, provided they comply with the Convention\u201d. The majority then refer to the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 6 \u00a7 2 to the effect that in principle the Contracting States \u201cmay, under certain conditions, penalise a simple or objective fact as such, irrespective of whether it results from criminal intent or from negligence\u201d. This is commonly termed strict or objective criminal liability. Although the Court has not had an opportunity to define in more detail what those \u201cconditions\u201d are, limiting the imposition of strict criminal liability under the Convention, it is clear in our view that those limitations would flow from the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 2, not from those of Article\u00a07. In other words, whether a \u201csimple or objective fact\u201d may justifiably be penalised under the Convention, without the prosecution having to prove a mental link, is intimately linked to the interpretation and application of the presumption of innocence guaranteed by the former, but is not a requirement flowing from the latter. In sum, although we of course do not call into question the majority\u2019s reliance on the settled methodological approach that the \u201cConvention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions\u201d (see paragraph 244 of the judgment), rather than applying that approach to clarifying the relationship between Article 6 \u00a7 2 and Article 7 of the Convention, the majority have sown seeds of confusion in the interpretation and application of these two important, but conceptually different, human rights guarantees.",

The rule laid down by this sentence is clear: it prohibits the retroactive application of criminal laws and has in the case-law furthermore been interpreted to require foreseeability in the application of such laws, as described above (see \u00a7 25 above). Within that context the word \u201cguilty\u201d must be understood as referring to the traditional concept used to describe the finding of a criminal conviction under domestic laws on criminal procedure. In other words, when a national court has found that the prosecution has proved, to the required standard of proof, the subjective and objective elements of the criminal provision referred to in the indictment, it finds the accused \u201cguilty\u201d of the offence. By\u00a0contrast, this concept, within the context of Article 7 of the Convention, does not entail any requirement as to the substance of domestic criminal laws. In other words, it does not imply that such laws should be formulated as requiring a particular type of subjective (mens rea) or objective (actus reus) elements for imposing criminal liability. That is the domain of the national authorities and not for the Court, at least not under Article 7 of the Convention.

Therefore, although other substantive provisions of the Convention may set limits on the Contracting States\u2019 ability to criminalise certain conduct (see for example Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, in the context of Article\u00a08 of the Convention and the criminalisation of certain homosexual acts between consenting adults), Article 7 is confined to prohibiting, in general terms, the retroactive application of criminal laws and to require that these laws be foreseeable and accessible.

According to the majority\u2019s own approach to Article 6, a finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 should necessarily entail a violation of Article\u00a07. It is not convincing, in the light of the majority\u2019s reasoning, that no such finding of a violation of Article 7 was reached in respect of Mr\u00a0Gironda.",

A \u201csubstantive\u201d declaration of guilt (and the subsequent application of a penalty of confiscation) when the criminal proceedings are time-barred will always entail a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2, as the majority point out in paragraph 317 (for further reference, see the case-law cited in paragraphs 314\u00ad15). This obviously means that in all fratelli minori di Gironda there will necessarily be, according to the majority\u2019s opinion, a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 and, in our view, also a violation of Article 7. Therefore the respondent State should not apply confiscation after an offence becomes time-barred and in the absence of a formal conviction, otherwise it will engage international liability at least under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

We cannot know today how this relaxation of the principle of legality will be interpreted.
