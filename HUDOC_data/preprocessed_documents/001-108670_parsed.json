Moreover, it is clear from the domestic courts\u2019 reasoning that it was not decisive for their decision on the extension of the applicant\u2019s preventive detention whether the applicant suffered from a mental illness and the particular nature of that illness. The question before them was whether the applicant was liable to reoffend if released (Article\u00a067d \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code, see paragraphs 14 and 36 above), be it because of his mental condition or not (compare in this respect also Kallweit, cited above, \u00a7 56).

Again, this finding could, however, be made without the applicant suffering from a pathological mental disorder diminishing his criminal responsibility (Article 63 of the Criminal Code).
