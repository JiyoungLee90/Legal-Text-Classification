It is to be noted in the first place that the payment order of 21\u00a0January 2003 was issued by a bailiff in respect of the Ministry and the fact that the latter had failed to comply with a final judgment was specifically mentioned in the bailiff's letters of April and July 2003 (see paragraph 16 above). Secondly, the Ministry's compliance with the judgment in favour of the applicant was the subject of domestic proceedings and it was found in those proceedings that in February 2004 the Ministry had not yet enforced it (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). Finally, in their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case the Government submitted that the judgment in favour of the applicant had been enforced on 15 March 2005 (see paragraph 23 above). The Court therefore considers that the period of non-enforcement should be calculated from 5\u00a0June 2002, when the judgment of 18\u00a0May 2001 became final, to 15\u00a0March 2005, when the applicant received MDL\u00a083,000.
