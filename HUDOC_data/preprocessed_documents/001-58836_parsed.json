Mr Harvey submitted that the purpose of Article 3 was to stop an accused at his trial putting forward an ambush defence. As the [applicant] had told the police who stopped him at the vehicle check-point that he had been at the Kellys' working with sheep all afternoon, the purpose of Article 3 had been achieved, and that it would therefore be wrong to draw an adverse inference against the [applicant] under the Article because he refused in interviews to repeat to the police his defence or to answer questions about it. I reject that submission. ... Notwithstanding that the [applicant] told Sergeant Ford in brief terms that he had been working at the Kellys' farm since 1 p.m., common sense clearly indicates that if the defence which he advanced in the witness box was true, he would have told the police of it after he was cautioned in Gough Barracks under Article 3 and was questioned at length about his movements on 24 April and was asked if he had an explanation for the fibres found on his hair and clothing. In addition I draw a very strong adverse inference against the [applicant] under Article 5 of the 1988 Order. The [applicant] failed to account for these fibres after each caution was read ... although he gave an explanation at the trial that he had been wearing gloves and a balaclava at his work on 23 April, which explanation was clearly designed and intended to show that the fibres found on his hair and on his clothing came from gloves and a balaclava which he was wearing ... on 23 April. This was an explanation which he could easily have given to the constable who served the Article 5 caution on him, and by reason of this failure to do so I draw a very strong adverse inference against him that the evidence which he gave at the trial about wearing a balaclava and gloves at work on 23 April was false. Mr Harvey submitted that I should not draw that inference because the cautions lacked clarity and detail ... and ... did not give the [applicant] sufficient information to enable him to understand that he was being requested to account for the presence of fibres from a pair of gloves and from a balaclava ... on his hair and clothing. ... I do not accept that submission. It follows from the very strong inferences which I have drawn against the [applicant] under Article 3 and Article 5 that I reject the evidence of the witnesses who sought to give the [applicant] an alibi by stating in the witness box that he was in the Kellys' farm at Halfgayne Road during the period when the gunmen were going to the Murphys' bungalow, imprisoning Mr Murphy and hijacking his car, murdering M.A.S. and J.A.W.Mc. ... For the same reason I reject the evidence of Sean McIldowney that the accused wore a balaclava and gloves at work on 23 April.\u201d",

Whether such a statement will prompt the court not to draw an inference against the accused will depend on an evaluation by the tribunal of fact of all the relevant circumstances including the accused's explanation for his failure to repeat the statement of his defence on interview. ... Where ... allegations are put to a suspect in interview which, if unchallenged, are clearly indicative of his guilt and where he fails, until trial, to put forward his answers to these or an explanation of them consistent with his innocence, this will justify the drawing of a strong inference against him. In this case the significance of the forensic evidence could scarcely be more obvious and important. It called for the production of the appellant's explanation at the earliest moment. The failure to produce that explanation on a point of such obvious and immediate importance justified the drawing of a strong adverse inference against the appellant. When that failure went unexplained (save by reference to a policy which was neither justified nor elaborated upon by the [applicant]) the drawing of a strong adverse inference against him was virtually inevitable. Mr Harvey [counsel for the applicant] submitted that the manner in which the forensic evidence was described by the [police] must have confused the appellant as to the nature of the forensic evidence which existed against him. Like the learned trial judge we do not accept this proposition. Mr Harvey submitted that it was not open to the learned trial judge to conclude that such a policy [by the applicant not to speak to the police] did not exist. We reject this argument. ... A person may have and apply such a policy but he must realise that the tribunal of fact may then draw an adverse inference from his silence. This [applicant] was seen daily by his solicitor after an initial 24-hour deferral and if he chose to remain silent it was his free choice. This does not avoid the possibility of Articles 3 or 5 being used to his disadvantage, however. To accept that a suspect may successfully rely on a 'policy' of silence to avoid the adverse effect of the Articles would 'drive a coach and four through the statute'.\u201d",

Thus, it observed that it would be incompatible with the right to silence to base a conviction solely or mainly on the accused's silence or on a refusal to answer questions or to give evidence himself.

The fact that he was warned in accordance with the terms of the cautions administered to him that his silence might lead to the drawing of adverse inferences at his trial discloses a level of indirect compulsion. That of itself is not decisive (see the John Murray judgment cited above, p. 50, \u00a7 50). At the same time, however, it is to be noted that the applicant's interrogation began and continued for a period of twenty-four hours without his solicitor being present (see paragraph 11 above). This must be considered a relevant factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the fairness of the trial judge's decision to draw an adverse inference under Article 3 of the 1988 Order. Equally so, is the fact that the applicant was able to consult with his solicitor on a daily basis after the end of the first 24-hour period and up to the moment of being charged.",

Notwithstanding these justifications, the Court considers that the extent to which adverse inferences can be drawn from an accused's failure to respond to police questioning must be necessarily limited. While it may no doubt be expected in most cases that innocent persons would be willing to cooperate with the police in explaining that they were not involved in any suspected crime, there may be reasons why in a specific case an innocent person would not be prepared to do so. In particular, an innocent person may not wish to make any statement before he has had the opportunity to consult a lawyer. For the Court, considerable caution is required when attaching weight to the fact that a person, arrested, as in this case, in connection with a serious criminal offence and having been denied access to a lawyer during the first twenty-four hours of his interrogation, does not provide detailed responses when confronted with incriminating evidence against him. Nor is the need for caution removed simply because an accused is eventually allowed to see his solicitor but continues to refuse to answer questions. It cannot be excluded that the accused's continued silence is based on, for example, bona fide advice received from his lawyer. Due regard must be given to such considerations by the fact-finding tribunal when confronted with the possible application of Articles 3 and 5 of the 1988 Order.",

He did so in the exercise of a discretion conferred on him by Articles 3 and 5 and provided detailed reasons for his decision. The Court of Appeal scrupulously reviewed the reasons which led the trial judge to draw adverse inferences and endorsed his decision. It clearly emerges from the judgment given by the trial judge that the applicant was not convicted solely or mainly on account of his silence. The trial judge had due regard to the weight of the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of its case, in particular the considerable body of forensic evidence which strongly supported a finding that there had been direct and intimate contact between the applicant and the balaclava masks and gloves found in the abandoned car used by the gunmen (see paragraph 23 above). It must also be observed that the applicant's oral testimony did not in any way advance his alibi defence having regard to the fact that the trial judge found him to be a dishonest and unreliable witness (see paragraph 27 above). It is true that the applicant called witnesses on his behalf to confirm his account that he had been at the Kellys' farm at the relevant time and that the fibres found on his clothes and person could be explained with reference to the clothes he had been wearing at work on the day before the murder took place (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). However, it would appear that the prosecution undermined the credibility of his witnesses' testimony since the trial judge, who observed their demeanour in the witness-box, dismissed their evidence as lies. The Court does not agree with the applicant's submission that his witnesses' testimony was discounted merely because the trial judge drew adverse inferences from his silence. The applicant's own testimony to the court lacked credibility and it could not be reprieved by the testimony of his defence witnesses.",

Furthermore, in drawing adverse inferences, it cannot be said that the trial judge exceeded the limits of fairness since he could properly conclude that, when taxed in custody by questions as to his whereabouts at the material time or the presence of fibres on his hair and clothing, the applicant could have been expected to provide the police with explanations. It is to be noted that the applicant had been stopped by the police not far from the scene of the crime and had volunteered an explanation of his movements. However, he held his silence after being taken into custody. For the Court, the presence of incriminating fibres in the applicant's hair and clothing called for an explanation from him. His failure to provide an explanation when questioned by the police at Gough Barracks could, as a matter of common sense, allow the drawing of an adverse inference that he had no explanation and was guilty, all the more so since he did have daily access to his lawyer following the first twenty-four hours of his interrogation when he was again questioned about these matters under caution. Moreover, the applicant did not contend at his trial that he remained silent on the strength of legal advice. His only explanation was that he did not cooperate with the Royal Ulster Constabulary for reasons of policy. This justification was considered and discounted by the trial judge and by the Court of Appeal. Quite apart from the consideration that the defence of policy sits ill with the fact that the applicant volunteered information to Sergeant Ford when stopped at the checkpoint soon after the Garvagh killings (see paragraph 11 above), it must also be noted that the applicant was fully apprised of the implications of remaining silent and was therefore aware of the risks which a policy-based defence could entail for him at his trial.

It observed that, under the Order, an accused is confronted at the beginning of police interrogation with a fundamental dilemma relating to his defence. If he chooses to remain silent, adverse inferences may be drawn against him in accordance with the provisions of the Order. On the other hand, if the accused opts to break his silence during the course of interrogation, he runs the risk of prejudicing his defence without necessarily removing the possibility of inferences being drawn against him. Under such conditions the concept of fairness enshrined in Article 6 requires that the accused have the benefit of the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation (see the judgment cited above, p. 55, \u00a7 66).

The situation in which the accused finds himself during that 24hour period is one where the rights of the defence may well be irretrievably prejudiced on account of the above-mentioned dilemma which the Order presents for the accused. The fact that the applicant maintained his silence after he had seen his solicitor cannot justify the denial. Nor does the Court's conclusion as to the drawing of adverse inferences from the applicant's silence (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above) serve to legitimate the authorities' refusal to provide him with access to a solicitor during the first twenty-four hours of his interrogation.

As I have already explained, this right is safeguarded by Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention as a corollary of the presumption of innocence. This is a safeguard against abuses of power by law enforcement agencies. It is for this reason that I believe that this protection should be applicable during pre-trial police detention. I continue to be of the same view and I strongly support the proposition that under no circumstances should a person in police custody be compelled in any way to incriminate himself. ",

However, this approach overlooks the basic philosophy or the raison d'\u00eatre of the right to silence which is the protection of individuals, especially the weak and vulnerable, from oppressive methods. I have stressed this in the John Murray case where I stated the following in this connection: \u201c... an accused person, when faced with the law-enforcing agencies before trial, alone and without the legal guidance of a counsel, lacks the necessary safeguards for an effective presentation of his version in an inherently coercive setting in which the prosecutorial forces have the upper hand. Although he may not be guilty he may not be in a position to establish effectively his innocence.\u201d",
