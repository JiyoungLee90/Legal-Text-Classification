Turkey, no. 55955/00, \u00a7 20, 2\u00a0February 2006). The Court further highlights that, in the light of its well-established case-law, the issue of whether a person may be considered an indirect victim is only relevant where the direct victim dies before bringing his or her complaint before the Court (Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v. Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, \u00a7\u00a7 97-100, ECHR\u00a02014).",

Romania [GC], cited above, \u00a7 97; Fartushin v. Russia, no. 38887/09, \u00a7 33, 8 October 2015; and Va\u0161\u010denkovs v. Latvia, no. 30795/12, \u00a7 27, 15 December 2016). The Court reiterates that it is not only material interests which the successor of a deceased applicant may pursue by his or her wish to maintain the application. Human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension, and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice is done, even after the applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no. 33071/96, ECHR\u00a02000-XII). Thus, in cases where the direct victim has died after the lodging of an application, the decisive factor is not whether the rights at issue are transferable to heirs willing to pursue an application, but whether the persons wishing to pursue the proceedings can claim a legitimate interest in seeking that the Court decide the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s desire to use his individual and personal right to lodge a case before the Court (see Ergezen v. Turkey, no. 73359/10, \u00a7 29, 8 April 2014). Nor has the Court found it decisive that the person wishing to pursue the application is not the legally recognised heir under domestic law (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic, cited above).",

In this respect, the Court points out that, according to the entries on the medical register, following his fall on 12\u00a0December, the applicant was visited and examined by the duty doctor (see paragraph 23 above). On 15 December the duty doctor examined the applicant twice following his fall and ordered the monitoring of his condition by nursing staff, and the applicant was transferred to the emergency room of a civilian hospital when he was found to be unresponsive (see paragraph 24 and 25 above). The Court further notes that the applicant has not contested the Government\u2019s assertions and submitted documentation to the effect that he received medical attention following these incidents. Moreover, aside from reporting the existence of a criminal complaint lodged with respect to the above-mentioned incidents, the applicant did not provide any information as regards the outcome of the complaint before the domestic authorities (see paragraph 26 above). In the light of the foregoing considerations, and on the basis of the information submitted, the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence for it to draw conclusions as to whether or not the prison medical personnel were medically negligent and whether this, in turn, led to the applicant\u2019s hospitalisation and surgery being delayed.",

Nor have they provided any evidence in that regard. The Court further observes that, even when detained in hospital settings, the applicant was confined to correctional wards, and reporting physicians in Milan referred to the applicant\u2019s detention in a \u201c[section] 41 bis area\u201d of the hospital (see paragraph 43 above). It may therefore be assumed that a certain number of restrictions were still practicable in such settings. In any event, it remains undisputed that the impugned restrictions were formally in place, following nine consecutive renewals, from the time of the applicant\u2019s initial incarceration in 2006 up to his death in 2016 (see paragraph 59 above). Moreover, in view of the manner in which the applicant\u2019s complaint was framed, the Court notes that he did not focus on specific restrictions whose application, individually or globally, subjected him to inhuman or degrading treatment. Rather, the essence of the complaint appears to be that in the light of his worsening state of health in general, and in particular the severe deterioration in his cognitive functioning, the reasons for imposing the restrictions no longer obtained, thus rendering their imposition unwarranted.",

Indeed, the applicant had been an extremely dangerous individual and a prominent leader of one of the largest existing criminal organisations. The picture which emerges from the national authorities\u2019 decisions to renew the imposition of the measures is clear and persuasive in this respect. The authorities provided detailed accounts, based on evidence provided by different State bodies and agencies, of, amongst other things, the applicant\u2019s criminal history, his past leadership role within the criminal organisation, the support network which he had relied on during his time in hiding, his multiple convictions for heinous crimes, and the continuing existence and current state of activity of the criminal organisation in Italy and abroad (see paragraphs 65-71 and\u00a07478 above). Even the court responsible for the execution of the sentence, which was called upon to review the 2014 renewal order, highlighted the applicant\u2019s leadership within the organisation and the great danger he had posed to society, as well as the unique network of supporters who had enabled him to run the organisation for decades, even while in hiding (see paragraph 73 above).",

In this respect, the Court points out that the applicant\u2019s health situation was characterised by a serious cognitive deterioration which undeniably worsened over time. This aspect thus distinguishes the present case from those where \u2013 albeit serious \u2013 health problems are limited to the physical sphere but do not affect an applicant\u2019s mental capacity. The picture which emerges from the medical documentation available to the Court, summarised at paragraphs 15\u201347 above, is one which may at least cast some legitimate doubts on the applicant\u2019s persistent dangerousness and his ability to maintain meaningful, constructive contact with his criminal association. Thus, the Court cannot state, as it has done in a number of previous cases concerning the section\u00a041\u00a0bis regime, that the applicant failed to submit any evidence to it which could lead it to conclude that the extension of those restrictions was unjustified (see, amongst many others, Enea, cited above, \u00a7 65; Argenti, cited above, \u00a7 21; and Riina v.

In this connection, the Court considers that subjecting an individual to a set of additional restrictions (see paragraph 57 above), which are imposed by the prison authorities at their discretion, without providing sufficient and relevant reasons based on an individualised assessment of necessity, would undermine his human dignity and entail an infringement of the right set out in Article 3.",

Evidence of cognitive deterioration, already noted in medical reports from 2012 (see paragraphs 9, 21 and 22 above, was described as serious in a medical report from December 2013 (see paragraph 35 above), and the applicant\u2019s verbal expression was reported to be incoherent and incomprehensible (see paragraphs 35 and 36 above). The Court notes with some concern that the 2014 renewal order did not devote much attention to the applicant\u2019s cognitive deterioration, despite its seriousness and potential impact on the continuing need for special restrictive measures. The only evidence of such a situation having been acknowledged in the order is in the parts reporting the summarised findings of certain anti-Mafia prosecution offices (see paragraphs 69 and 70 above). Having said this, the Rome Court reviewed the 2014 order, and there is evidence in the text of the decision that, in doing so, it examined ample medical documentation, including a recent neuropsychological expert report that it had requested shortly prior to the issuing of the decision (see paragraph 73 above). On the basis of such documentation, the court made an independent assessment and reached a reasoned conclusion to the effect that the possibility that the applicant could convey criminally relevant messages to the organisation could not be ruled out with absolute certainty (ibid.). Thus, the Court cannot conclude that the applicant\u2019s condition was not genuinely reassessed so as to take into account his changing circumstances when the order was renewed in 2014.",

By way of example, in August\u00a02014 his cognitive situation was described as having worsened since the month of April, and the medical experts highlighted his complete lack of autonomy in performing basic everyday functions, to the extent that he had to receive all his hydration and nutrition artificially due to his inability to feed himself. In September 2014 he was described as unable to maintain interactions with people or take care of himself (see paragraph 45 above). The medical reports from 2015 and 2016 submitted by the Government disclose a further progressive decline of his cognitive functions, which were described as \u201cextremely deteriorated\u201d in March 2016 (see paragraph 46 above).

Moreover, there appears to be no discernible trace in the text of the order of an explicit, autonomous assessment by the Minister of Justice of the applicant\u2019s cognitive situation at the time the decision was made. The limited space afforded to such circumstances and the lack of an explicit assessment make it difficult for the Court to ascertain in what manner and to what extent such circumstances were weighed up when assessing whether to renew the restrictions.
