The Higher Court considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of L.E. before or after the creditor\u2019s claim had arisen. Having joined the company, he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities, and moreover, he had had the rights of a minority member. The Higher Court placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had been actively involved in the management of the company. It explained that the reasons for lifting the corporate veil under the FOCA were not identical to those provided for in the Companies Act. The FOCA established a non-rebuttable presumption that members of inactive companies intended to have the companies dissolved and, to that end, made it clear that they assumed joint and several liability for their outstanding debts (see paragraph\u00a041 below).",

However, the court allowed exoneration for former members of companies which had been struck off from the court register after the entry into force of the Act.",

An economically inactive company did not conduct any business operations, nor did it generate income or make payments. At the same time, its financial situation was not known to its creditors, who relied on the presumption that it had at least a minimum amount of assets.

However, companies were required to ensure that they were operating with adequate share capital, and that it did not fall below the statutory minimum. Companies which operated with insufficient share capital were considerably weaker economically than those which operated in accordance with the law, which affected the security of legal transactions as a whole. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court recognised the variety of legal and factual positions of shareholders of struck-off companies and established a distinction between so-called \u201cactive shareholders\u201d, who were in a position to influence the operation of a company, and \u201cpassive shareholders\u201d, who exerted no such influence. It upheld the regulation insofar as it applied to the former category, but annulled it with respect to passive shareholders. In its reasoning the Constitutional Court established the criteria which the regular courts were required to consider in deciding on the position of former shareholders. Those criteria were based on the subjective conduct of shareholders and the extent of the consequences that such conduct could have on the operation of the company, that is on their knowledge of and involvement in the management of the company.",

According to the Constitutional Court, the courts deciding on the issue of personal liability could in addition rely on the general criteria that the Companies Act determined with regard to the rule of disregarding a company\u2019s legal personality, namely whether (i) an individual had abused the company in order to attain an objective which, as an individual, he or she should not have sought, or (ii) an individual had abused the company and thereby caused damage to its creditors, or (iii) an individual had used the assets of the company for his or her personal interests in violation of the law, or (iv) an individual had reduced the assets of the company to his or her benefit or for the benefit of another person, knowing that it would not be capable of meeting its liabilities to third parties.",

In this connection, the Court has reached an affirmative conclusion, inter alia, in cases where the impugned measures had a direct bearing on the rights inherent in owning stocks or shares, as is the case with the cancelling of shares or the obligation to exchange them at a disadvantageous rate (see Olczak v. Poland (dec.), no. 30417/96, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62, ECHR 2002-X, and Pokis v. Latvia (dec.), no. 528/02, ECHR 2006-XV). While it is true that the impugned strike-off measure was to the detriment of company L.E., it is undisputable that it also directly affected the applicant in two different ways. Not only was his share in the company cancelled, but the cancellation of his share at the same time resulted in his personal liability for the debts of the struck-off company. Therefore, the dissolution of company L.E. entailed consequences which affected the financial interests of the applicant as a former member of the company and were thus directly decisive for his individual rights.",

                                                "content": "71.\u00a0\u00a0There is no doubt that a company share with an economic value can be considered a possession (see Olczak, cited above, \u00a7 60, and Sovtransavto Holding, cited above, \u00a7 91). The Court has also held that the shares of a company which was placed in compulsory administration for being insolvent and unable to meet its liabilities undoubtedly had an economic value and constituted possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Vefa Holding Sh.p.k. and Alimu\u00e7aj v. Albania (dec.), no.\u00a024096/05, \u00a7\u00a093, 14 June 2011). Indeed, as the Court has held on many occasions, a share in a company is a complex object. The ownership of a share implies that the holder possesses a bundle of corresponding rights. These encompass the right to a share to the company\u2019s assets in the event of its being wound up, but also other unconditioned rights, especially voting rights and the right to influence the company\u2019s conduct (see Company S. and T. v. Sweden, no.\u00a011189/84, Commission decision of 11 December 1986, DR 50, p. 138). Hence, the Court agrees with the applicant that, although in the four years between the cessation of company L.E.\u2019s activities and the strike-off he could not extract any pecuniary benefits from the company, he was still entitled to exercise a number of rights which arose from his possession of a share in the company. Those rights allowed the applicant and other members of company L.E. to engage in a commercial activity, and were thus of a pecuniary nature. Therefore, accepting that the mere possession of a share created interests of a proprietary nature, the Court cannot conclude that the lack of commercial activity and assets took the applicant\u2019s share out of the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

As regards the cancellation of the applicant\u2019s share, the Court has held, in the case of Olczak (cited above, \u00a7 71) where the applicant\u2019s shareholding was reduced from 45% to 0.4%, that although the applicant was not technically divested of his shares, their economic value was sufficiently reduced to amount to a deprivation of property. By contrast, in the present case it was accepted by the parties that company L.E. had had no assets at the time of the strike-off. Moreover, the company had not been conducting any commercial activities for four years before the strike-off was enforced. In fact, it was precisely because of those circumstances that the strike-off was ordered. Thus, notwithstanding the finding that the possession of the share gave rise to proprietary interests and that the strike-off divested the applicant of those interests, account must be taken of the fact that the cancellation of his share did not reduce the economic value of his assets.",

In this connection, the applicant\u2019s consequent personal liability for the payment of the company\u2019s debts, which falls into that same context, entailed responsibility for the repayment of losses suffered by the creditor of company L.E. The Court is of the view that this obligation may be regarded as a sanction for the applicant\u2019s failure, in his capacity as a member with influence on the company\u2019s business operations, to comply with the corporate obligations of the company of which he was a member. Based on the principle permitting the lifting of the corporate veil, the impugned measure should be considered as a measure of State control over the operation of the market, over corporate practices and over the management of corporate property.",

They had not conducted any business operations, generated any income, or made payments; nor had they had any assets. However, their financial situation had not been transparent to potential creditors, who could nevertheless presume that the companies in question had at least minimum assets. Consequently, non-operating companies could be abused in order to damage their creditors. Therefore, the introduction of the FOCA had been aimed at protecting the position of creditors and reducing the risks of conducting legal transactions on the Slovenian commercial market. In this connection, the Government further emphasised that in the enforcement proceedings against the applicant, his liability had been assessed according to the criteria established by the Constitutional Court.

Both documents had been duly served on company L.E. by leaving delivery slips in its mailbox, informing the company that the relevant correspondence could be collected at the post office. Since the mail had not been collected within the prescribed time-limit, both documents had been posted on the competent court\u2019s notice board, and were thereby deemed to have been served.

Also, the applicant had undoubtedly been aware of the civil proceedings initiated against company L.E. by the Railway Company (see paragraph 14 above) and could have expected that the latter would attempt to enforce its claims. Lastly, the Government emphasised that, even if the applicant had objected to the strike-off in due time, the reasons which he had subsequently put forward in the enforcement proceedings to show that he was not an active member of the company would not have prevented the company from being struck off the court register. Namely, the fact that company L.E.\u2019s prior petition for bankruptcy had been rejected for failure to make an advance payment to cover the costs of the proceedings could not be regarded as one of the grounds on which a company could successfully object to the strike-off (see paragraph 39 above).",

Germany, no. 37290/97, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-X; Forrer-Niedenthal v. Germany, no. 47316/99, \u00a7 39, 20 February 2003, and The Former King of Greece and Others v.

Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0109-10, ECHR 2000-I). Likewise, domestic law must provide a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see Hasan and Chaush v.\u00a0Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2000-XI). It is true that Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision (see Fredin v. Sweden (no.\u00a01), 18 February 1991, \u00a7 50, Series\u00a0A no. 192, and S.C. Antares Transport S.A. and S.C. Transroby S.R.L. v.\u00a0Romania, no. 27227/08, \u00a7 46, 15 December 2015). Nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by that provision. In ascertaining whether that condition has been satisfied, a comprehensive view must be taken of the applicable judicial and administrative procedures (see Jokela v. Finland, no. 28856/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2002-IV with further references, and Stolyarova v. Russia, no. 15711/13, \u00a7 43, 29 January 2015).",

The legislature initially set out to establish an open market which was accessible to as many investors as possible (see paragraph 30 above) which, however, resulted in an ever-increasing number of companies which were not able to meet their liabilities and to stay in operation. The Companies Act of 1993 thus increased the minimum share capital and imposed on existing companies a time-limit by which they had to bring their operation in line with the new stricter legislation (see paragraph 34 above). That attempt at strengthening the legal security of the commercial market was, however, not successful. By 1998 there were more than 6,000 companies which had not been operative for a considerably long period and had no assets (see paragraph\u00a0108 below). Nevertheless, the persons in charge of the companies\u2019 operations either did not institute any type of proceedings aimed at dissolving the inactive undertakings, or, as was the case with company L.E., did not follow them through to the end.",

This, however, failed to successfully address the problem. Subsequently, on 23 July 1999 the legislature introduced the FOCA, which imposed on companies a number of measures aimed at managing their liquidity and solvency. Furthermore, if a company found itself in a situation of illiquidity or insolvency and was unable to re-establish the normal course of business operations within two months, the FOCA required it to file for bankruptcy or compulsory composition (see paragraph 37 above). Companies which failed to comply with those rules were to be struck off the court register proprio motu without a prior winding-up procedure. The measure of striking off a company from the register thus necessarily resulted in the cancellation of the company\u2019s shares, but it had a further impact on the members or shareholders of such a company, since they became personally liable for its debts.",

Moreover, as a former managing director, he must have been well aware not only of the insolvent state of the company, but also of the civil proceedings brought against it by its creditor (see paragraphs 8 and\u00a014 above). As a result of the above, the Court is of the view that the applicant was expected to devote his attention in no small measure to the outstanding issues facing the company. It considers that the applicant was expected to be acquainted with the legislation applicable to companies, and in particular to insolvent companies. It is worth noting in this connection that a law may satisfy the requirement of foreseeability even if the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. The Court has emphasised that professional advice may be of particular importance to persons carrying on a professional activity, since they are expected to take special care in assessing the risks that such activity entails (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni v. France, 15\u00a0November 1996, \u00a7 35, Reports 1996-V). The same may be said to apply to persons engaging in commercial ventures.",

U-I-135/00 no sooner than two years after the entry into force of the FOCA and one year after the provisions on strike-off became applicable. However, that fact did not affect the applicant in any way, as the issue of his own personal liability for the debts of company L.E. was established in the enforcement proceedings which began in April 2002 (see paragraph 21 above) and ended in July 2007 (see paragraph 28 above).

The company failed to do so, and the documents were subsequently served by being posted on the competent court\u2019s notice board. Having regard to the Court\u2019s view that the rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal are aimed at ensuring a proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty, the applicant was entitled to expect those rules to be applied (see Ca\u00f1ete de Go\u00f1i v. Spain, no. 55782/00, \u00a7\u00a036, ECHR 2002-VIII).",

Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, \u00a7 91, ECHR 2005-VI). Thus, in situations such as the deterioration of the commercial market due to a high number of inactive and insolvent companies, there may be a paramount need for the State to act in order to avoid irreparable harm to the economy and to enhance the legal security of participants in the market. Nevertheless, such margin should not exceed what is necessary to protect the essence of the individuals\u2019 rights embodied in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measures applied by the State. In each case involving the alleged violation of that Article the Court must, therefore, ascertain whether by reason of the State\u2019s action or inaction the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden (see Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth, \u00a7 73, and The Former King of Greece and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 89-90, both cited above, with further references).",

In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant\u2019s submissions were focused rather on this second aspect of the interference. However, the Court considers it appropriate to first examine the dissolution of company L.E. and the cancellation of the applicant\u2019s share in the company. The strike-off measure constituted a type of administrative dissolution of companies imposed on them for failing to comply with the statutory requirements for the operation of companies. In fact, the measure only affected those companies which for a considerably long period had not been operating in accordance with the law or, more accurately, were no longer operating at all. It is clear that company law did not provide that insolvent companies should continue to exist (see paragraphs 34-37 above). Yet a great number of them existed formally, and although most of them had no assets, many of them were burdened by debts (see paragraphs 107108 above). The Court agrees with the Government that such a situation could not be perpetuated indefinitely.",

Thus, it can only be concluded that, as a limited liability company, L.E. was not adequately capitalised from the start and acted in contravention of the applicable rules of company law. Moreover, despite the fact that the company had been unable to re-establish liquidity and solvency since 1995, it did not apply for bankruptcy until two years later, when it was evidently lacking any assets whatsoever. As a result, it failed to make an advance payment for the costs of the proceedings in the amount of EUR 626, and instead decided to wait until such proceedings were instituted proprio motu (see paragraph 35 above). However, the relevant legislation changed and removed that possibility; the FOCA introduced stricter provisions on the operation of companies. In the one-year transitional period before the provisions on strike-off came into effect, the company could have instituted another set of bankruptcy proceedings. Indeed, in such a case the members would have been required to cover the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings, but would have avoided the strike-off and personal liability for the debts of the company. In addition, the Court reiterates that from June 1997 until it was struck off in September 2001, the company existed without any management, despite the fact that civil proceedings had been pending against it since 1993 for the payment of a debt. In the Court\u2019s opinion the lack of management, even if not in contravention of the law, was certainly not in line with good business practices.",

In view of these considerations, the Court agrees with the position of the Constitutional Court relied on by the Government that inactive and/or insolvent companies posed a threat to the proper functioning of the market. Moreover, as argued by the Government, the strike-off proceedings were initiated as a measure of last resort, that is in the absence of any other proceedings being instituted to dissolve the company. Also, as already found, they were accompanied by sufficient procedural guarantees which, but for the applicant\u2019s lack of due diligence, would have enabled him to effectively defend his interests (see paragraphs 99-103 above).",

Moreover, the applicant and other members had in any event intended to dissolve the company by themselves, and according to the applicant, it was only the impossibility of making the advance payment for the costs of bankruptcy proceedings that prevented them from doing so. In this light, the Court finds that the measure of striking off company L.E. from the register did not represent an excessive individual burden for the applicant.",

The applicant was convinced that this instance of piercing of the corporate veil was not justified in the circumstances of his case. He relied, inter alia, on the Court\u2019s case-law developed in the judgment Agrotexim and Others (cited above), according to which only exceptional circumstances can justify the lifting of the corporate veil. However, this view was not developed in response to the question whether the interference with the right to a peaceful enjoyment of possession was justified or proportionate, but rather in response to the question whether an applicant may in any circumstances claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a result of actions aimed at the property of a company, a separate legal entity (see Agrotexim and Others, cited above, \u00a7 66, and Olczak, cited above, \u00a7 57). In the present case, this question has already been answered in the affirmative (see paragraph 69 above). As regards, however, the question of whether the circumstances of the present case justified the strike-off, in the Court\u2019s opinion the above-mentioned disregard on the part of company L.E. for company law and the principles of good corporate governance, which consisted of (a) inadequate capitalisation, (b) failure to observe the law and good business practices, (c) a prolonged state of insolvency, and (d) inactivity on the part of the company\u2019s management, warranted a strong response by the authorities, including the imposition of personal liability on any member who was found to be responsible for the irregularities in the operation of the company.",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, such a lengthy course of proceedings could have been avoided if company L.E. had applied for bankruptcy in due time after recognising that it was unable to re-establish sufficient basic funds to continue its operations.

Moreover, the applicant was employed by the company for more than four years and was involved in its management, first as its acting director and later as managing director (see paragraphs 7-8 and\u00a010 above). Therefore, in the Court\u2019s opinion, the above-mentioned irregularities in the operation of company L.E. were to a large extent attributable to the applicant himself. Against this background, and considering the Constitutional Court\u2019s view on the elements of distinction between active and passive members (see paragraphs 48-49 above), the Court finds it reasonable that the applicant was found by the domestic courts to have been an active member of company L.E., and thus liable for the payment of its debts. In this connection, it is noted that the Constitutional Court confirmed that the lower courts had correctly applied its criteria for differentiating between active and passive members to the applicant\u2019s individual situation (see paragraph 28 above). Therefore, reiterating that it is in the first place for the domestic authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law, the Court cannot accept the applicant\u2019s argument that the domestic courts should have given more weight to other elements adduced by him (see paragraph 114 above) and absolved him from his personal liability.",
