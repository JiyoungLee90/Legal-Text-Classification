However, the Court notes that the domestic authorities have shown neither diligence nor rigour in the handling of the proceedings: the courts refused to examine the merits of the case on three occasions in 1997, 1998 and 1999, finding that the charges against the applicant had been vague and speculative. Furthermore, a substantial part of the time was spent on the procedural disputes involving the courts of ordinary and constitutional jurisdiction, regarding the prosecutors\u2019 appeals against judicial findings of inadequate investigations and the inability to proceed to trial. Nonetheless, clear charges were never formulated and a trial did not take place. Against the above background, and in the absence of any indication of the applicant\u2019s responsibility for the delays, the Court finds that the length of the proceedings was excessive and did not satisfy the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.",
