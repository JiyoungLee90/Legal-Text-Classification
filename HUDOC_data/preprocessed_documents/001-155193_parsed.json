On 11 September 2008 the Chelyabinsk Regional Court found that the applicant had committed six murders. It, however, concluded that the applicant\u2019s mental illness precluded him from bearing criminal responsibility and serving a sentence. He was to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for compulsory treatment. Accordingly, the Court considers that the periods of detention of the applicant from 20 September 2003 to 11 September 2008 fall within Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention as it was effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on criminal charges based, as was not disputed by the parties, on a reasonable suspicion of having committed the offences he was charged with. In turn, although the parties have not taken a stance on this issue, the Court considers that, in view of the circumstances of the case and the wording of the court\u2019s decisions, that in the instant case the applicant\u2019s detention starting from 25 October 2005 until 17 November 2006 also falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e) of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Erkalo, cited above, \u00a7 51, and Morsink v. the Netherlands, no.\u00a048865/99, \u00a7\u00a062, 11 May 2004; Proshkin v.
