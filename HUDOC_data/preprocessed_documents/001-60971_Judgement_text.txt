The case originated in an application (no. 31549/96) against Romania lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Romanian nationals, Mrs Irina Margaret Popovici, Mrs Sanda Popovici and Mrs Maria Margareta Dumitrescu (“the applicants”), on 5 April 1996. Following the death of Mrs Maria Margareta Dumitrescu on 10 November 1997, her heir, Mrs Maria Cristina Mauc Dumitrescu, a French and Romanian national, expressed her wish, on 9 May 2000, to continue the proceedings.
The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs C. Tarcea, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicants alleged, in particular, that the Braşov Court of Appeal's finding, on 20 September 1995, that the courts had no jurisdiction to determine an action for recovery of possession and the change in the case-law following the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice were contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The applicants also complained that the judgment had had the effect of infringing their right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
The application was referred to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
By a decision of 10 October 2000, the Court (First Section) declared the application partly admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).
The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The first two applicants are Romanian nationals who were born in 1930 and 1932 respectively and live in . The third applicant, a Romanian and French national, lives in VillebonsurYvette, France.
In 1934 S.D, the father of the first two applicants, bought a parcel of land in Predeal, . In 1937 S.D. built a house on the land.
On 30 August 1946 the State requisitioned a room in the house, pursuant to a requisition order of Predeal Town Council, on the ground that it was needed by a third person, M.A.
On 22 May 1948, following an application by the Ministry of the Interior (MAI), the  prefect ordered the property to be returned to the owner, S.D.
On 13 September 1965, as can be seen from the judgments delivered in the present case, the State nationalised the house.
On 17 August 1971 Braşov City Council (Consiliul Popular Judeţean Braşov) decided to transfer the administration of the property from the managing company of state-owned property (Intreprinderea de gospodărie locativă ) to the Romanian Intelligence Service (Consiliul securităţii statului).
According to information provided by the applicants, in 1992 the property was transferred to the administration of the Romanian Intelligence Service (Serviciul Român de Informatii – “SRI”).
In 1992 the applicants, as heirs, lodged an application under Law no. 18/91 for the return of the land on which the house had been built. In a judgment of 25 November 1992 the Braşov Court of First Instance dismissed their application as ill-founded on the ground that they should have brought an action in the administrative courts in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 29/90.
On 8 January 1993 the first two applicants and Maria Margareta Dumitrescu brought an action for recovery of possession against Military Command Centre no. 05024 of the Ministry of Defence in the Braşov Court of First Instance. They argued that they were the heirs of S.D., that he had owned land of 2,686 m² in Predeal, on which he had built a house, and that in 1946 a room in that house had been requisitioned but that the State had subsequently illegally appropriated the property. They sought to establish their title to the house and land as heirs.
In a judgment of 25 May 1993 the court found that the house had belonged to S.D.; that a room had been requisitioned in 1946 for a specific period; that the house had subsequently been requisitioned in its entirety; and that since then the State had continued to occupy it despite the fact that the owner had protested at the requisition. Noting that the property claimed was now occupied by Command Centre no. 05007 of the SRI, and finding that the requisition order could not have had the effect of lawfully passing the property into the ownership of the State and that the house had been nationalised under Decree no. 92/1950, which had not been lawfully applied, the court held that the applicants were the legal owners of the house and adjoining land and ordered the State's property title to be struck out of the land register and the late S.D. to be registered as owner.
The SRI appealed against that judgment, submitting that, pursuant to section 5 of the Real Property Act (Law no. 18/1991), the property in question had definitively become state-owned property. It submitted, in the alternative, that the house had been nationalised in 1965 pursuant to Decree no. 92/1950.
On 9 December 1993 the  allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of 25 May 1993 and dismissed the applicants' claim for recovery of possession on the merits.
The applicants lodged an appeal against that decision. In a judgment of 7 June 1994 the Braşov Court of Appeal allowed the applicants' appeal, noted that there had been procedural flaws, quashed the earlier decision and decided to remit the case to the  for a rehearing of the appeal.
On 21 December 1994 the , rehearing the appeal by the SRI, dismissed it as ill-founded. It considered that requisition was not a means of transferring title to property, but an act by which a right of use could temporarily be conferred. In addition, Decree no. 92/1950 was not applicable to the property of S.D., who, on account of his profession, did not fall into the category of persons whose property could be nationalised.
The SRI appealed against the decision of 21 December 1994.
In a final judgment of 20 September 1995 the Braşov Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the action for recovery of possession on the merits. It held that the courts had exceeded their jurisdiction when they had examined the lawfulness of the nationalisation of the house and that the matter could only be settled by legislation.
On 22 September 1999 the applicants brought a fresh action for recovery of possession against the Ministry of Finance, the SRI and Predeal Town Council.
In a judgment of 5 May 2000 the  granted the applicants' claim, found that they were the lawful owners of the property and ordered the defendants to cease interfering with their enjoyment of their property right.
According to information provided by the Government, an appeal by the SRI was dismissed as ill-founded in a decision of 14 November 2000 of the Braşov Court of Appeal.
According to information provided by the applicants, in a judgment of 4 December 2001 the Supreme Court of Justice decided to allow the appeal by the SRI and to quash the earlier decisions and dismiss the applicants' action for recovery of possession.
On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application for restitution with the administrative board established to deal with applications lodged with Braşov City Council pursuant to Law no. 122/95 (“the Administrative Board”).
In an administrative decision of 29 June 1999 the Administrative Board granted the application and ordered the building to be returned to the applicants.
On 10 September 1999 the SRI lodged an objection to that decision.
In a judgment of 16 December 1999 the Braşov Court of First Instance dismissed the objection as ill-founded.
On 9 May 2000 the  dismissed an appeal by the SRI as being ill-founded.
According to information provided by the applicants, in a judgment of 2000 the Braşov Court of Appeal allowed the SRI's appeal and objection, thereby setting aside the decision ordering the return of the building.
