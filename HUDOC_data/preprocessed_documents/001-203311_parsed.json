Those facts, in the District Court\u2019s view, showed that the applicant had wilfully neglected his parental duties with respect to his son. It thus considered that in such circumstances, it was in V.\u2019s best interests to deprive the applicant of his parental authority over his son and leave the boy under the full custody of his mother, Ms\u00a0A.K. Such a measure, according to the court, was necessary for the protection of V.\u2019s interests, restoration of his right to protection of his health and personality, as well as his right to education and proper physical and mental development. It thus granted Ms A.K.\u2019s claim against the applicant in full, and rejected the applicant\u2019s counter-claim.

Poland, no. 32407/13, \u00a7 70, 10 January 2017). There is currently a broad consensus \u2013 including in international law \u2013 in support of the idea that in all decisions concerning children, their best interests must be paramount (see Neulinger and Shuruk [GC], no.\u00a041615/07, \u00a7\u00a0135, 6 July 2010, and X\u00a0v.\u00a0Latvia [GC], no.\u00a027853/09, \u00a7 96, ECHR 2013). Generally, a child\u2019s interests dictate that the child\u2019s ties with his or her family must be maintained, except in cases where the family has proved to be particularly unfit and this may harm the child\u2019s health and development (see, for instance, K.B. and Others v.\u00a0Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7 143, 14 March 2017). Severing such ties means cutting a child off from his roots, which may only be done in exceptional circumstances (see G\u00f6rg\u00fcl\u00fc v. Germany, no.\u00a074969/01, \u00a7 48, 26 February 2004); everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, if and when appropriate, to \u201crebuild\u201d the family (see Kacper Nowakowski, cited above, \u00a7 75).",

The child\u2019s best interests may, depending on their nature and seriousness, override those of the parents (see, for instance, V.D. and Others v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a072931/10, \u00a7\u00a0114, 9 April 2019). In particular, where contact with the parent might appear to threaten the best interests of the child or interfere with his or her relevant rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see Khusnutdinov and X v.

Latvia [GC], \u00a7 101, and Strand Lobben and Others, \u00a7 210, both cited above). The margin of appreciation to be granted to the competent national authorities will vary in accordance with the nature of the issues and the importance of the interests at stake. Whilst the Court recognises that the authorities enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when deciding on custody matters, stricter scrutiny is called in respect of any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights and access, and of any legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that family relations between parents and a child are effectively curtailed (see Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2002-I; Haase v. Germany, no.\u00a011057/02, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2004-III (extracts), and Strand Lobben and Others, cited above, \u00a7 211).",

This does not, however, mean that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons for the decision to deprive the applicant of his parental authority. Indeed, that decision did not change the fact that the applicant continued to be the child\u2019s parent and thus to bear parental responsibility for him; moreover, he had not paid for any child support during many years. It is also to be noted that the obligation to pay child maintenance came to an end once V. was adopted by Mr M.K. (see paragraph 26 above).",

In so far as the applicant complained that the assessment had been carried out in his absence and that the child had not been heard in court, the Court notes, firstly, that it was open to the applicant to raise those questions before the courts at two levels of jurisdiction; and secondly, that it was open to him to challenge the findings of the report and to seek another expert examination of V.

Thus the deprivation of parental authority could be based on neglect of parental duties, including the persistent evasion of maintenance payments. However, divesting a parent of his or her parental authority is a very restrictive measure that should not be resorted to easily.

The domestic courts carried out a detailed and carefully balanced assessment of the entire situation and the needs of the child. In conclusion, it was a fair decision-making process.",

Even if the origin of the lack of relationship between father and son could have been seen as a goodwill gesture on the part of the natural father to avoid being an obstacle in the child\u2019s new situation after the divorce, allowing him to create a new family with his mother\u2019s new husband, the reality is that the child de facto almost did not know his biological father, as the mother\u2019s husband had assumed the role of real father. Moreover the child wanted to be adopted by his de facto new father (see paragraph 54). From a legal point of view, I understand that it could have been different if they had reached some kind of previous agreement about family visits. But this was not the case.

Unfortunately, the applicant was punished for not having something which he subsequently asked the domestic courts to grant to him, namely access to his son. Instead, the domestic courts not only refused to grant him such access, they, on the contrary, stripped away all his parental authority, simply because of the delay in his initiative. In my view, parent-child relations and ensuing rights should not be treated like property rights which may lapse if not exercised for a period of time. Whenever there is hope that parent-child relations can be restored, the authorities ought to assist them and not terminate them totally and permanently, as they did in the present case.",

It is also correct for the judgment to state that such a measure should only be applied in exceptional circumstances which can only be justified if they are motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child\u2019s best interests (ibid).

Family relationships are complex and they are not linear; families can go through better and worse times. It is not easy for a domestic court to conclude that family relations cannot be salvaged, and, therefore, a court should only deprive parents of such a chance if they pose a real threat to the child\u2019s welfare. Such a risk did not exist in the present case. I am of the opinion that mere inaction of the parent is not sufficient to satisfy the exceptional circumstance under which authorities may resort to the impugned measure, depriving a parent of all connection with a child. In other words, even assuming that it was the applicant\u2019s own inaction that led to the severance of ties between him and his son \u2013 and not any alleged parental alienation or psychological manipulation caused to the child by the mother \u2013 I am not at all convinced that this factor was sufficient for the purpose of divesting the applicant of his parental authority in respect of his son. Especially so in a situation where the applicant insistently indicated that he wished to restore and develop a relationship with his son (see paragraphs 7 and 22 of the judgment and the present application before the Court).",

It is relevant in this connection that, apart from holding that the applicant had failed to maintain contact with V. and to participate in his upbringing for the past seven years, the domestic courts established no other aspects that could have justified the withdrawal of the applicant\u2019s parental authority. Indeed, in the domestic proceedings, it had never been established that the applicant was unfit for child-rearing, that he had ever inflicted any harm on his son, or that he posed a threat to the child\u2019s health and development or that contact with the applicant might interfere with the child\u2019s relevant rights (compare Haddad v. Spain, no. 16572/17, \u00a7 67, 18 June 2019). Stated otherwise, in the present case, neither the life, nor the physical integrity, nor the health nor the morality of the child were at stake and there was no other exceptional circumstance. It is true that during the seven years when there was no contact, the child established strong family ties with his mother, stepfather and half-brother. In the child\u2019s eyes, this was his family and he had no recollection of the applicant. However, there was nothing in these relations to warrant depriving him of the opportunity to rebuild his relationship with his biological father. In order to protect the child\u2019s best interests, it is conceivable that the child had to remain in the family unit with which he had already an existing connection. Yet, to reiterate, this is not sufficient to justify depriving the father of all contact with the child, and all possibility of future contact. Thus, stripping the father of all parental authority does not satisfy the proportionality test and the principle of effectiveness. It is a requirement of the principle of effectiveness that human rights must be practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory. Hence, the interpretative approach to human rights provisions must be pragmatic and realistic, ensuring that they are meaningfully exercised.",

According to the Court\u2019s case-law, effective respect for family life requires that future relations between parent and child be determined in the light of all the relevant considerations, and not by the mere passage of time (see, as a recent authority, V.D. and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a072931/10, \u00a7 116, 9 April 2019).

Pursuant to the Court\u2019s case-law, children are entitled to be consulted and heard on matters affecting them. In particular, as children mature and, with the passage of time, become able to formulate their own opinions, the courts should give due weight to their views and feelings, as well as to their right to respect for their private life (see Petrov and X v. Russia, no. 23608/16, \u00a7\u00a0108, 23\u00a0October 2018). At the same time, those views are not necessarily immutable, and their objections, which must be given due weight, are not necessarily sufficient to override the parents\u2019 interests, especially their interest in having regular contact with their child. The right of a child to express his or her own views should not be interpreted as effectively giving an unconditional power of veto to children without any other factors being considered or any examination being carried out to determine their best interests. What is more, if a court based a decision on the views of children who were palpably unable to form and articulate an opinion as to their wishes \u2013 for example, because of a conflict of loyalty and/or their exposure to the alienating behaviour of one parent \u2013 such a decision could run counter to Article 8 of the Convention (see K.B. and Others v. Croatia, no.\u00a036216/13, \u00a7\u00a0143, 14 March 2017 and the authorities cited therein). In the latter connection, the applicant argues that the interview in question had been carried out with V. in his absence, and that V. had been living with his mother and might have been influenced by her (see paragraph 35 of the judgment). Besides, it must be pointed out that the judge did not have an interview with the boy to determine his genuine views and ascertain whether he was influenced by his mother (see, about children\u2019s rights to express their views, Articles 3(c) and 6 (b)(c) of the European Convention on the Exercise of Children\u2019s Rights; Article 12.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989; and Council of Europe, Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on Child-Friendly Justice, Strasbourg, 2010 (available also online), at p. 28, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044-49).",

Consequently, the door for such a relationship was closed harshly and permanently \u2013 given the child\u2019s subsequent adoption by his mother\u2019s new husband \u2013 by the domestic courts. The domestic courts should not have ruled out the prospect that regaining contact and building new ties with his biological father would be beneficial for V\u2019s future. Indeed, the authority of the case of Mandet v. France, no. 30955/12, 4\u00a0January 2016, should not be overlooked. The facts of Mandet are complex, but a strong analogy can be made with the present case. After a divorce, the mother of the child Ms Mandet entered into a relationship with Mr Glouzmann. She gave birth to a child which was registered in her name. Subsequently, Ms Mandet became reconciled with her ex-husband and they remarried, which had the effect of legitimising the child. The boy grew up believing that Mr Mandet was his father, but when he was 11 years old, Mr\u00a0Glouzmann applied to the court, which found that the boy was his biological father. The Court also ruled that it was in the child\u2019s best interests to know his biological father. The fact that it took Mr Glouzmann 11 years in order to pursue recognition of paternity and that the child had already existing bonds with his other family members and Mr Mandet, whom he perceived as a father, did not extinguish the biological father\u2019s right to have contact with his child. The 11 years of inaction were not considered an exceptional circumstance such as to prevent recognition of parenthood. Instead, the Court recognised the potential benefit of a future relationship.",

Yet such measure, if used as a punishment, would be paradoxical in the light of the very strong case-law of the Court reaffirming that a prisoner, who committed a wrong against society at large should still enjoy his right to family life. As decided in Dickson v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 44362/04, 4 December 2007), not only should a prisoner maintain the right to existing family ties, but also the States are under a positive obligations to facilitate starting a family. In the light of this caselaw, the rights entrenched within the Convention are of such importance that they should not be taken away as a means of punishing the individual beyond what is necessary to keep the public or, as in this case, a child, safe. It has previously been stressed that enabling the applicant to have contact with his son would not put V\u2019s welfare at risk, but on the contrary, regaining contact with his biological father would be in his best interests.

It is also striking that the domestic court imposed on the applicant an obligation to pay a monthly amount in maintenance until the boy reached the age of majority, notwithstanding the fact that he would no longer have parental authority over the child (see paragraphs 21 and 56 of the judgment), a point which the majority noted with a hint of implicit criticism.",

The judgment then goes on to say that \u201c[i]n particular, they [i.e. the national authorities] were called upon to decide whether it was in V.\u2019s best interests to set in motion his bonding with the applicant \u2013 his natural father \u2013 contact with whom had been lost for the previous seven years, or rather to consolidate the existing ties between V. and the family in which he had been living during that period\u201d (ibid.). Subsequently, the judgment continues that \u201c[t]he Court finds that the domestic courts carried out a detailed and carefully balanced assessment of the entire situation and the needs of the child ...\u201d (ibid.). By stating the above, the Court found that the domestic courts \u201cprovided \u2018relevant and sufficient\u2019 reasons for their decision, within their margin of appreciation\u201d (ibid). In my humble view, however, the national courts either made no proportionality test at all or erred in what that test should be, and in what the child\u2019s best interests were. With due respect I am unable to understand what is the meaning of \u201cconsolidation\u201d of the existing relations of the child with his mother, his half-brother and his stepfather. The child\u2019s relationship with his mother, half-brother and stepfather was very good and there was no evidence that this relationship should be upset if the child\u2019s biological father were also to have contact with him every fortnight. This is a scenario which arises for almost all separated parents. The domestic courts did not take into account the child\u2019s best interests in terms of having contact with his father or the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his family life. What the domestic courts seem only to have taken into account was the wish of the mother and her new husband to legally alienate the child from his biological father. In that connection the intention of the mother and her new husband was for the latter to adopt the child and they ultimately succeeded.",

The applicant wished to participate in his child\u2019s upbringing (see paragraph 7 of the judgment), which implies a request going beyond the right of access. Russian family law, seen as a whole, does not allow the different aspects of parental authority to be allocated to each parent, no matter to what degree or extent. Indeed, parental authority can be depicted as a wide circle which encompasses various smaller circles within it, representing the different aspects of the child\u2019s well-being over which the parents may exercise some control: for example, decisions concerning custody, everyday childcare, education, medical treatment, travel abroad, representation before a court, administration of property, etc. It is conceivable that it may be in the child\u2019s best interests for a parent to be stripped of some of these rights and obligations, such as for example that of everyday childcare, while also being able to participate in other aspects of the child\u2019s upbringing. Regrettably, the domestic courts not only rejected the applicant\u2019s counterclaim regarding his access to the child, they completely ignored his more general request to participate in the upbringing of his child.",

Of course, the principle of subsidiarity cannot justify a lack of European scrutiny in ensuring that the requirements of Article 8 are met when a domestic legal system, as in the present case, by the indivisibility of parental authority as a legal concept, does not facilitate any proportionality test or any guarantee for the effective protection of the right to respect for family life.

Nothing in the records of the case shows that he had displayed the slightest interest in following his son\u2019s progress during the years preceding his former wife\u2019s request for termination of his authority. Similarly, it was also evident that he had, for the important formative years of his son\u2019s life, neglected the responsibilities which are at the heart of parental authority (a dynamic obligation to ensure his son\u2019s well-being, to follow his son\u2019s development or contribute towards his maintenance) to the extent that his son did not know him and would have nothing to do with him. Viewed from the perspective of the child, children are holders of rights as well as beneficiaries of protection. Parental authority is as much, if not more, an issue of parental responsibilities than a question of parental rights.
