In that judgment, the Court considered that the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention in Bac\u0103u Police Arrest and Bac\u0103u Prison, for the period between 13 May 2011 and 18\u00a0June 2015, the date when the judgment was delivered, were inadequate and disclosed a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Taking into account the above considerations and referring to its case-law (see Vojnovi\u0107 v.\u00a0Croatia (dec.), no. 4819/10, 26 June 2012), the Court finds that this part of the application no. 57991/15, regarding the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention before 18 June 2015, is essentially the same as a matter that has already been examined by the Court and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention.",
