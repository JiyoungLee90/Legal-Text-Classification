He reasoned that it amounted to an administrative decision, creating legal rights for Ilinden, and that it was unlawful. Firstly, the organisation was not registered; on the contrary, in February 2007 the Supreme Court of Cassation had upheld the Sofia City Court\u2019s judgment turning down a request by UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN to be registered as a political party (see UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 2), no. 41561/07, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0819, 18 October 2011). Since it was accordingly unlawful under Bulgarian law, it had no standing to give notice of its intention to hold a rally. Secondly, the proposed rally would put public order at risk. The Rozhen Monastery was a place visited by many tourists, especially at weekends. It was therefore inappropriate to allow the staging of a rally there. Moreover, rallies and meetings were being organised at those locations at the same time by the local authorities and non-governmental organisations. As clashes between supporters of Ilinden and others had taken place in the past, it was necessary to ban its rally. Finally, the activities of the organisation were contrary to Bulgarian law, as they consisted in propaganda against the country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and aroused national and ethnic hatred.",

In others it held that although the Mayor\u2019s ban on the rally planned for 12 September 2007 was legally binding, the actions of the members of Ilinden on that date had not amounted to the staging of a rally, as they had been too few and had not tried to wave banners and make speeches, but merely to lay flowers on Gotse Delchev\u2019s monument.

The interference with the applicants\u2019 rights was a result of the lack of recognition of the Macedonian minority in  and of the resulting infringement of that minority\u2019s rights. The nonexecution of a number of the Court\u2019s judgments in previous cases concerning Ilinden showed that even now individuals asserting a Macedonian ethnic consciousness were being denied the right to freedom of assembly and association. The Macedonian minority was the only one not recognised by  and, as a result, suffered diverse instances of discrimination.

The possibility to do so, envisaged expressly by section 12(6) of the 1990 Meetings and Marches Act (see paragraph 107 above), comes across as the most adequate avenue of redress under the circumstances. However, the national courts, while on some occasions taking note of this Court\u2019s rulings in previous cases concerning Ilinden, consistently found against the applicants, on varying grounds (see paragraphs 14, 19, 23, 30, 61, 76, 84, 88, 93 and 97 above). In that connection, the Court reiterates that, for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies, an applicant is not required to try more than one avenue of redress when there are several available (see, among other authorities, Hyde Park and Others v.  (nos. 5 and 6), nos. 6991/08 and 15084/08, \u00a7 33, 14 September 2010).",

First, the Government have not shown \u2013 by, for instance, citing relevant caselaw \u2013 that such a claim would have had a reasonable prospect of success (see Zeleni Balkani v. Bulgaria, no. 63778/00, \u00a7 46, 12 April 2007, and Hyde Park and Others (nos. 5 and 6), cited above, \u00a7 34 in fine). Secondly and more importantly, such a claim cannot be considered as providing sufficient redress in itself, because it can result solely in an award of compensation. In cases where, as here, the authorities, through deliberate actions, prevent a group of individuals or an organisation from holding a rally in the manner chosen by them, the alleged breach of Article 11 cannot be made good exclusively through such an award. If States were able to confine their response to such incidents to the mere payment of compensation, without putting in place effective procedures ensuring the possibility of staging such rallies, it would be possible in some cases for the authorities arbitrarily to deprive groups of individuals and organisations of their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Were that to be the case, that right, which, along with the rights to freedom of expression and association, and the right to take part in free and fair elections, is one of the essential features of a vigorous and healthy democracy, would be ineffective in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos.\u00a077568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, \u00a7 79, ECHR 2009..., with further references). Indeed, where assemblies are concerned, and provided their organisers give timely notice to the authorities, the notion of an effective remedy implies the possibility of obtaining a determination of a legal challenge to a ban before the time of the planned event (see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, \u00a7 32 in fine, 9 April 2002; Ivanov and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a074; Zeleni Balkani, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 45; B\u0105czkowski and Others v.\u00a0Poland, no. 1543/06, \u00a7 81, 3 May 2007; and Alekseyev v. , nos.\u00a04916/07, 25924/08 and 14599/09, \u00a7 98, 21 October 2010).",

It observes that on every occasion when Ilinden wished to hold a rally at Yane Sandanski\u2019s grave near the Rozhen Monastery, the Mayor of Sandanski imposed restrictions on the timing and manner of organisation of its events (see paragraphs 9, 28, 50, 7274 and 96 above). In April 2007 the Regional Governor of Blagoevgrad imposed an outright ban on the rally (see paragraph 78 above). With the notable exception of a rally in July 2006 (see paragraph 56 above), the Mayor of Petrich systematically banned or imposed restrictions on the events which Ilinden sought to organise in the Samuilova Krepost area (see paragraphs 18, 41 and 87 above). In Blagoevgrad, between 2004 and 2007 the Mayor systematically banned the events planned by Ilinden (see paragraphs 13, 22, 34, 44, 53, 58, 60, 62, 82 and 91 above). On a number of occasions, the Blagoevgrad police issued orders to members and supporters of Ilinden not to organise or take part in rallies (see paragraphs 15, 38, 45, 54, 85, 104 and 106 above). On several occasions, the Blagoevgrad police arrested participants in rallies and seized materials from them (see paragraphs 46, 94, 104 and 106 above). On one occasion, participants in a rally were fined (see paragraph 95 above).",

The term \u201crestrictions\u201d in Article 11 \u00a7 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly, and those, such as punitive measures, taken after that (see Ezelin v. , 26 April 1991, \u00a7 39, Series A no. 202). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see B\u0105czkowski and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 6668). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v. , no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 5962, ECHR 2003III). So do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as a dispersal of the rally or arrests of participants (see Oya Ataman v. , no. 74552/01, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 30, ECHR 2006XIII, and Hyde Park and Others (nos. 5 and 6), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 13, 16, 41, 44 and 48), and penalties imposed for having taken part in a rally (see Ezelin, cited above, \u00a7 41; Osmani and Others v.\u00a0\u201cthe \u201d (dec.), no. 50841/99, ECHR 2001X; Mkrtchyan v.

First, no legal basis has been cited for the arrests and seizures made by the police during certain rallies (see paragraphs 46, 94, 104 and 106 above, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Djavit An, cited above, \u00a7 66). Secondly, on a number of occasions the Mayor of Blagoevgrad relied on the fact that Ilinden was not registered to ban its rallies (see paragraphs 13, 22, 34, 53, 62, 82 and 91 above), even though this was not an express requirement of the law (see paragraph 107 above, as well as Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, \u00a7 81, and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, \u00a7 108, both cited above). While on some occasions the domestic courts ruled that that did not amount to a valid ground for such bans (see paragraphs 61, 84 and 93 above), on others they required proof of Ilinden\u2019s registration in order to accept for examination its legal challenges against the bans (see paragraph 23 above). Thirdly \u2013 with regard to the rally banned by the Regional Governor of Blagoevgrad (see paragraph 78 above) \u2013 the 1990 Meetings and Marches Act envisages no role for regional governors in the policing of rallies (see paragraph 107 above); moreover, in banning the rally the Regional Governor likewise relied on some clearly irrelevant grounds, such as UMO Ilinden \u2013 PIRIN\u2019s lack of registration. Fourthly, section 62(1) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act, which served as a basis for the orders issued by the police, was formulated very generally and gave no indication of the circumstances in which the police could use the power conferred on them (see paragraph 108 above and, mutatis mutandis, United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 109). The same goes for section 55(1) of the 2006 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act, which superseded that provision on 1 May 2006. Lastly, the fines imposed by the mayor of Blagoevgrad were later annulled by the courts (see paragraph 95 above).",

The mayors of Blagoevgrad and Petrich relied on essentially the same grounds as those given to ban such rallies previously: the organisation\u2019s unregistered status, conjectural threats to public order, the holding of events of other organisations and/or the authorities at the same time and place, and lastly, Ilinden\u2019s controversial statements on issues perceived as sensitive (see paragraphs 13, 18, 22, 34, 41, 44, 53, 58, 60, 62, 82, 87 and 91 above). On at least three occasions the courts, while acknowledging the right to freedom of assembly in principle, also relied on such grounds (see paragraphs 61, 84 and 93 above). So did the Regional Governor of Blagoevgrad (see paragraph 78 above). The fact that the national authorities should rely on grounds which the Court had, at the time when those authorities made their decisions, already found problematic is indicative of a troubling disregard for the Court\u2019s judgments and the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of peaceful assembly (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no.\u00a032772/02, \u00a7\u00a7 8388, ECHR 2009..., and United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden and Ivanov, cited above, \u00a7 116).",

(no. 2), no.\u00a045094/06, \u00a7 26, 31 March 2009, and Hyde Park and Others v.  (no. 4), no. 18491/07, \u00a7 53, 7 April 2009). Likewise, on a number of occasions the police, without giving any reasons, ordered members and supporters of Ilinden to refrain from organising or taking part in commemorative rallies (see paragraphs 46, 94, 104 and 106 above and, mutatis mutandis, Ivanov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 63). Even if there was a risk of clashes between participants in Ilinden\u2019s rallies and counterdemonstrators, it was the task of the police to stand between the two groups and to ensure public order, as was shown in fact to be possible. That reason for interfering with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of assembly could not therefore be considered as relevant and sufficient (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 94 and 107, and Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party v.

While the fines were later set aside by the courts (see paragraph 95 above), they doubtlessly had a chilling effect and discouraged those concerned from taking part in similar rallies in the future (see, mutatis mutandis, Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others v.
