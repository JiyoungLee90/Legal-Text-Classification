It established these stricter requirements in the following rule: such a statement must have been taken down by a judge who (a) is aware of the identity of the witness, (b) has expressed, in the official record of the hearing of such a witness, his reasoned opinion as to the reliability of the witness and as to the reasons for the wish of the witness to remain anonymous and (c) has provided the defence with some opportunity to put questions or have questions put to the witness. On the other hand, according to the same judgment, a written document containing the statement of an anonymous witness may be used in evidence if (a) the defence has not at any stage of the proceedings asked to be allowed to question the witness concerned, (b) the conviction is based to a significant extent on other evidence not derived from anonymous sources and (c) the trial court makes it clear that it has made use of the statement of the anonymous witness with caution and circumspection.

It entered into force on 1 February 1994. The additions include the following. Article 226a now provides that the identity of a witness may remain secret if there is reason to believe that the disclosure of his identity may threaten his life, health, safety, family life or socio-economic existence and if the witness has made it clear that he does not wish to make any statement because of this. The decision is made by the investigating judge, who must first hear the prosecution, the defence and the witness himself. An appeal against the decision of the investigating judge lies to the trial court (Article 226b). The investigating judge may order that a threatened witness be heard in the absence of the accused, or of counsel, or of both, so as not to disclose the identity of the threatened witness; in that event, the prosecuting authorities may not attend the questioning of the witness either. The investigating judge must then allow the defence to put questions of its own to the witness, either through the use of telecommunication or in writing (Article 226d). Article 264 now lays down that the prosecution may refuse to summon a threatened witness. If the trial court has ordered that a witness be heard and that witness turns out to be under threat, he must be heard in camera by the investigating judge (Article\u00a0280 \u00a7 5). The statement of an anonymous witness taken in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions may only be used in evidence against a person accused of crimes in respect of which he may be held in detention on remand (Article 342 \u00a7 2 (b)). A new paragraph has been added to Article 344 to the effect that a written document containing a statement of a person whose identity is not apparent may only be used in evidence if the conviction is based to a significant degree on other evidence and if the defence has not at any time during the trial sought to question that person or to have him questioned.

Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, ECHR 1999-III, p. 329, \u00a7 80). The Court is not persuaded of the necessity of the costs claimed in the instant case since it fails to see why the applicant could not have applied for legal aid in the proceedings to which these costs relate. It appears more than likely that he would have been eligible for such aid, given that he was awarded it when he did apply for it in both the domestic and the Strasbourg proceedings. Furthermore, such a step would not have interfered with the applicant\u2019s freedom to select a legal representative of his choice, and neither has it appeared or been argued that the lawyer in question would not have been prepared to represent the applicant at legal aid rates. In addition, as the Government rightly pointed out, the proceedings in which the costs were incurred also concerned an issue which was found not to constitute a violation of the Convention as the Commission rejected the complaint of the length of proceedings.
