It has been the Court\u2019s constant approach that an applicant cannot be blamed for taking full advantage of the resources afforded by the national law in the defence of his interests (see, mutatis mutandis, Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, 8\u00a0June 1995, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 319A). Furthermore, the Government claimed that the parties had failed to appear at some hearings. The Court considers that the domestic courts should have taken measures to discipline the defendants for their repeated failure to appear. In so far as the applicant is concerned, the Government did not indicate any dates on which the applicant had failed to appear. It is true that between 29 April and 8\u00a0October 2004 the case was adjourned because the applicant\u2019s representative did not appear.

In any event, the fact that the domestic courts heard the case several times did not absolve them from complying with the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Litoselitis v.

Furthermore, between 24 August 2000 and 15 March 2001 and between 21 June and 10 August 2001 no proceedings took place because the judge was on sick leave. The accumulated delay amounted to more than a year. The Court further notes that a considerable delay occurred when the case was reassigned to judge K., who took the case over on 16\u00a0August 2002 and scheduled the case only for 16 January 2003. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it is for Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee the right of everyone to obtain a final decision within a reasonable time (see, for instance, L\u00f6ffler v. Austria, no. 30546/96, \u00a7 21, 3 October 2000). The manner in which a State provides for mechanisms to comply with this requirement \u2013 whether by increasing the numbers of judges, or by automatic time-limits and directions, or by some other method \u2013 is for the State to decide. If a State lets proceedings continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay (see Price and Lowe v. the United Kingdom, nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98, \u00a7 23, 29 July 2003). The Court finds that in the present case the authorities did not take due measures to speed up the proceedings and, therefore, the delays resulting from the judge\u2019s absence from the hearings and reassignment of the case to different judges are imputable to the State.",

In this respect, the Court reiterates that the principle responsibility for the delay due to the expert opinions rests ultimately with the State. It was incumbent on the domestic court to ensure that the expert examination was performed without delay (see, for example, Rolgezer and Others v. Russia, no. 9941/03, \u00a7 30, 29 April 2008; Volovich v. Russia, no. 10374/02, \u00a7 30, 5 October 2006; and Capuano v. Italy, 25\u00a0June 1987, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 119).

He firstly complained that the construction work carried out on his plot of land had resulted in de facto expropriation of part of the land for which he had not received any compensation. The Court reiterates that, in accordance with the general rules of international law, the provisions of the Convention do not bind a Contracting Party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that Party (see Ble\u010di\u0107 v. Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2006...). Furthermore, the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction is to be determined in relation to the facts constitutive of the alleged interference. The subsequent failure of remedies aimed at redressing that interference cannot bring it within the Court\u2019s temporal jurisdiction (see Ble\u010di\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 77). In the present case the alleged interference (construction work) with the applicant\u2019s house and land took place between 1989 and 1996, i.e. before the ratification of the Convention by . The proceedings by which the applicant challenged the interference and which ended on 7 December 2006, i.e. after the ratification, did not constitute a new or independent interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights, but were aimed at providing him with redress for the interference that had occurred between 1989 and 1996. It follows that this complaint is incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03 and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a04.",
