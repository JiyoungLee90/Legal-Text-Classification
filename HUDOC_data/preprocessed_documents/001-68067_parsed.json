It has deemed treatment to be \u201cdegrading\u201d because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see, for example, Kud\u0142a v. , no. 30210/96, \u00a7 92, ECHR 2000-XI). In considering whether a particular form of treatment is \u201cdegrading\u201d within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see, among other authorities, Raninen v.\u00a0Finland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1997-VIII, pp. 2821\u201322, \u00a7 55).

The suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment.",

Besides, from similar cases (cf. the above mentioned Kalashnikov v. ) the Court is aware that overcrowding in pre-trial detention facilities is a general problem in  (ibid. \u00a7 93). In these circumstances the Court does not find it of crucial importance to determine the exact number of inmates in the cells during the periods concerned. The material available suggests that at any given time there would be less than 2 m\u00b2 of space per inmate. Thus, in the Court\u2019s view the cells were overcrowded, something which in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention.",
