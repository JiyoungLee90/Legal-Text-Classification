Secondly, the applicant did not obtain any compensation (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubjakov\u00e1 v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 67299/01, 19\u00a0October 2004 and Becov\u00e1 v.

In the present case, having regard to the fact that the costs of the applicant\u2019s legal representation before the Constitutional Court were reimbursed at the domestic level, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses incurred in the constitutional proceedings. It also rejects the remaining claims as regards the domestic costs because it finds no indication that those costs were incurred in order to prevent or obtain redress for the violation found (see Z\u00e1borsk\u00fd and \u0160m\u00e1rikov\u00e1 v.
