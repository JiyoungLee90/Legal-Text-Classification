Where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 (see Ribitsch v.

They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Mocanu and Others v.

It was also not disputed that more serious injuries such as a head trauma and bruises on the applicant\u2019s cheekbone, left shoulder, right knee and on a shoulder blade were discovered and recorded when the applicant was already under the control of the hospital staff to whom he had been entrusted after his release from the police station. The Court further notes that the applicant, whose state of intoxication was particularly grave even according to the description given by the police officers (sleeping in a stairway, slurred speech, impossibility to stand unaided, need to lift and assist him when walking to the car, inability to answer any question, etc.) (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 20 above), had not been examined by a doctor or other medical professional upon his placement in a cell in the station. The Court emphasizes in this connection, that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d) considers a right of access to a doctor for detained persons during their custody by law-enforcement agencies as one of the three fundamental safeguards against ill-treatment (the CPT Standards 2022 (revised in 2011) (CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1-Rev. 2011) Extract from the 2nd\u00a0General Report [CPT/Inf (92) 3]). The CPT further considers that while it is reasonable to keep persons with moderate levels of inebriation in custody without medical supervision, persons with severe alcohol intoxication should be routinely seen by a doctor and if necessary kept under medical supervision (Report to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on the visit to Kosovo carried out by the CPT from 8 to 15 June 2010, CPT/Inf (2011) 26).",

By denying the applicant a basic right of medical examination, the authorities had also striped themselves of a possibility to provide a plausible explanation to the applicant\u2019s injuries and to discharge their burden of proof in this regard.",

An emergency doctor or a medical professional from a town hospital could have been invited to perform the first-aid examination of the applicant.

The Court does not lose sight of the Government\u2019s argument that at least one injury, the applicant\u2019s head trauma, resulted from a fall in a staircase. Leaving aside the lack of any evidence supporting that conclusion, the Court does not need to assess the injury\u2019s origin. It observes that in addition to the head trauma the applicant was diagnosed with a number of other injuries, such as bruises on his cheekbone, left shoulder, right knee and on a shoulder blade (see paragraph 21 above). The nature and cause of those injuries was never explained.

The applicant\u2019s expenses in this part were confirmed by the relevant bills and receipts. Similar considerations apply to the applicant\u2019s claim in the part concerning the plastic surgery, the necessity of which also stems from the treatment to which the applicant had been subjected in contravention to Article 3 of the Convention. The Court observes, in this connection that the calculation of the cost of the surgery was provided by a local medical organisation and it does not seem manifestly unreasonable or excessive. The Court, therefore, grants the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damages in the part relating to the medical expenses which he had incurred and the plastic surgery which he intends to undergo.",

The Court considers that the method of calculation applied by the applicant is not in line with the Court\u2019s approach to the calculation of future losses. Therefore, the Court cannot accept the final figure claimed under this head by the applicant. Nonetheless, bearing in mind the uncertainties of the applicant\u2019s situation, and the fact that he will undeniably suffer material losses as a result of his disability and the need for constant medical treatment, the Court considers it appropriate, in the present case, to make an award in respect of pecuniary damage based on its own assessment of the situation (see Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a7 159-162, 26 January 2006).",
