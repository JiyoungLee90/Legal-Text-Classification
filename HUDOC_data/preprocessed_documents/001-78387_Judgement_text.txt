The case originated in an application (no. 5019/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Ms Taisiya Timofeyevna Spas and Ms Tamara Vladimirovna Voyna (“the applicants”), on 20 December 2002.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 20 January 2006 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicants' favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicants were born in 1949 and 1953 respectively and live in . They are former employees of the OJSC “Dnipro” (“the Dnipro,” ВАТ “Дніпро”). At the material time the State owned more than 25% of the Dnipro's shares. The company was therefore subject to the Law of 29 November 2001 “on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property.”
On 16 October 1996 the State Property Fund (Фонд державного майна України) ordered the creation of the Dnipro's subsidiary company “Energiya” (the “Subsidiary,” ДП “Енергія”). The applicants were reassigned to the Subsidiary.
On various dates the applicants instituted civil proceedings in the Komsomolsky District Court of Kherson (the “District Court,” Комсомольський районний суд м. Херсона) against the Subsidiary for salary arrears and other payments.
On 16 January and 18 August 2001 and 11 March 2002, the District Court awarded UAH 5,161.07, UAH 2,490.74 and UAH 1,167.60 respectively in favour of Ms Spas.
On 16 January and 16 July 2001 and 11 March 2002, the District Court awarded UAH 6,381, UAH 1,728.79 and UAH 602.24 respectively in favour of Ms Voyna.
The judgments given in favour of the applicants were not appealed against, became final and the writs of enforcement were transferred to the Komsomolsky District Bailiffs' Service (“the Bailiffs,” Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Комсомольського районного управління юстиції в м. Херсоні) for enforcement.
On 27 April 2001 the Bailiffs attached the Subsidiary's equipment for forced sale. However, the sale was cancelled, as Bailiffs learned that the equipment was formally owned by the Dnipro, held in a tax lien and subject to a moratorium on the forced sale (see paragraph 4 above).
On 2 November 2001 each applicant received UAH 300 of the awards due to them under the judgments given in their favour.
On 4 April 2002 the  (Господарський суд Херсонської області) declared the Subsidiary bankrupt and ordered its liquidation, which was completed by 25 May 2004.
The judgments given in favour of the applicants remain largely unenforced.
