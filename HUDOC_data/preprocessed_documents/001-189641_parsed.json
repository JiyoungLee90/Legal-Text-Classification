After her sixteenth birthday she had sent a letter to him, which remained unanswered. She claimed that in 1978, learning that the applicant was going to be in Malta, she went to meet him at the airport \u2013 on that day she had seen him arrive with his family, and noted the resemblance between herself and one of the applicant\u2019s daughters. On that occasion she had not approached him, but they met some time later before a lawyer. She stated that the applicant greeted her warmly and that, after that, they met various times. She also met the applicant\u2019s wife. According to X the applicant had told her that he would not inform his children about her in order not to disrupt their schooling and she agreed. X\u00a0stated that the applicant started visiting Malta regularly on his own, and when she had become pregnant he had offered her one of his properties to live in, and in this way they lived there together on his visits to the island. On the birth of X\u2019s daughter in 1979, the applicant had been the latter\u2019s godparent as shown by relevant certification. She claimed that at the applicant\u2019s suggestion she moved to the UK, only to return sixteen months later because she missed Malta. At that stage the applicant had given her the keys to another property for her to live in. She remained in close contact with him until 1985. In 1998 she was evicted from the property and thereafter their relationship deteriorated. X explained that during the eviction proceedings the applicant had promised her a sum of money to leave the premises peacefully and that she had accepted the deal, but he never paid up. Subsequently, she successfully issued proceedings against him to recover the sum in question (the relevant court judgments were also submitted).",

It also imposed an excessive burden in so far as it impeded his ability to contest a claim. Moreover, everyone was entitled to institute such proceedings without a shred of evidence, and an alleged father would be bound to submit to the test, with all its consequences, even though he was sure that he was not the father.

Citing Pascaud v.

According to the court, disproportionality would result if the person seeking paternity had acted negligently, by not requesting the test or not availing him or herself of an available remedy, or had renounced such right, but this was not the situation in the case in hand. Referring to the ECtHR caselaw the court noted that while it was true that the absence of an obligatory test did not necessarily entail a violation, it could not be said that making it obligatory was in violation of Article\u00a08 because it was not proportionate.",

On the other hand, the applicant had not put forward any sufficiently cogent reasons to consider that the application in his case of Article 100A would breach his rights under Article 8. Reiterating the findings in Pascaud (cited above), the Constitutional Court emphasised that the interest of a presumed father was not, alone, a sufficient argument to deprive the applicant (a person seeking to establish paternity) of her Article\u00a08 rights. Indeed, Article 8 paragraph 2 expressly allowed for a legitimate interference with a person\u2019s private life where such interference was \u201cfor the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d. This was precisely the situation in the case in hand. Thus, the application of the relevant law to the applicant\u2019s case would be justified given that the aim was precisely to establish X\u2019s identity and to safeguard her patrimonial interest, if it were to emerge that she was the applicant\u2019s daughter.",

He argued that once that evidence had been adduced in the casefile he could no longer offer his defence reiterating his original arguments without risking prosecution for the offence of perjury in civil proceedings. Thus, the very fact that the order issued to him to submit to the genetic test had been made out at the initial stage, before the applicant had been authorised to adduce his evidence, was contrary to the object of Article\u00a08, as well as to that of Article\u00a06 of the Convention. The applicant emphasised the early stage at which the test had been ordered \u2013 even before the applicant\u2019s version of events had been heard \u2013 when he had not yet produced any submissions or evidence and no crossexaminations had yet taken place, and argued that the factual circumstances referred to by the Constitutional Court had been \u201conedimensional\u201d and prejudicial to his right to defend himself in the civil proceedings. This had been made worse by the ambiguous wording of Article 100A of the Civil Code, which stated \u201cwithout prejudice to any evidence that may be produced by the parties\u201d, which would result in a situation where the applicant could not defend himself at all. He considered that had the test been ordered after he had been allowed to submit evidence, then his defence rights would have been respected. Similarly, the judge would have been able to take a decision as to the necessity of the test on the basis of the evidence submitted by both parties. In his view, he had been coerced into adducing evidence against himself, contrary to the principle against selfincrimination, and had thereafter been denied his right to defend himself, while X had been freed from her legal burden to adduce evidence in support of her civil claim, which was a cardinal rule of evidence. On the basis of the above, the applicant considered that the measure had not been in accordance with the law, since the implication arising from the application of the law itself were in themselves problematic in terms of natural justice.",

Indeed, the domestic courts had not specified any pressing social need. In the light of the fact that the law provided for a burden of proof in civil cases (consisting of a balance of probabilities), in the applicant\u2019s view, ordering the test could not have been considered \u201cnecessary\u201d as the same result could be achieved by less restrictive means. The State\u2019s positive obligation could have been fulfilled by allowing the court to invite a party to a filiation suit to submit to a genetic test, or allowing for inferences to be drawn from a refusal to undergo the test, which would have allowed the applicant to present his defence nonetheless.",

In the present case, those interests had concerned each party\u2019s individual human rights, and both deserved protection. It was even more necessary for the constitutional jurisdictions to carry out such an assessment given that the law did not allow for a judge in filiation proceedings to consider the interests at play before ordering such tests, unless the person in question was a minor.

Thus, according to the Government, the measure had been necessary to establish X\u2019s paternity, as X had a vital interest protected by the Convention in receiving the information enabling her to uncover the truth about an important aspect of her identity. Under Maltese law, the Civil Code had compelled the father to submit to the DNA test in order to secure X\u2019s right. Nevertheless, the domestic courts were vested with discretionary powers in deciding whether to order the DNA test, in the child\u2019s best interests. This allowed them to examine each case on its own merits and to strike a fair balance between the competing rights. They referred to Canonne (cited above).",

In that case, the fact that the domestic courts had annulled the results of a DNA test (on the basis of a procedural error \u2013 namely the lack of explicit consent of the donor of the sample), thus giving precedence to the right of the putative father as opposed to the right of the son to know his origins, gave rise to a breach of Article 8.",

The Court considers that this in itself does not undermine the rights of the parties to the proceedings; what is of importance is that they are given an opportunity personally to participate in the court proceedings (see, by implication, Tsvetelin\u00a0Petkov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a055).

Its task is confined to determining whether the methods adopted and the effects they entail are in conformity with the Convention (Leyla\u00a0\u015eahin v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2005XI and Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, \u00a7 184, 8\u00a0November 2016). The Court notes that under Article 100A the court \u201cmay\u201d order such tests. However, when read in connection with Article\u00a070A, it could appear that such courts have no discretion as to whether or not to order the test, save in the case of minors. Indeed, the Constitutional Court, in the present case, admitted that in certain cases an issue may arise as to the compatibility of such an imposed measure with the Convention. It is therefore true that on paper the measure appears to be mandatory; however, the Court is not convinced that in practice a court would order such a test without regard to any other consideration, such as, for example, that a prima facie case was made out. Similarly, the Court cannot ignore that once an order is made, the individual concerned may appeal against such an order. Admittedly, the scope of such an appeal has not been debated before this Court, and thus begs the question as to whether a court hearing such an appeal would be competent to perform a balancing exercise, which would provide a relevant procedural safeguard in circumstances such as those of the present case. Nevertheless, while noting that the law may require finetuning, the Court will confine itself to its application in the present case.",

Indeed, it was only after fully-fledged constitutional proceedings \u2013 undertaken at the applicant\u2019s request \u2013 that the test was ordered. This was an avenue open to the applicant (since under Maltese law an individual can also complain of breaches of the Convention which are about to occur), and of which he availed himself in full knowledge of his procedural rights and available safeguards at the domestic level. Thus, while the procedure might be cumbersome (for both the parties and the judicial system) and certainly prolonged the outcome of the civil case, it cannot be said that it did not serve the purpose of examining the interests at stake and determining whether ordering the test would have been in breach of the applicant\u2019s Article\u00a08 rights. It follows that the order to undergo the test in the present case was not made on the basis of its mandatory nature.",

The Court consequently finds that the decisionmaking process, taken as a whole, was fair and provided the applicant with the requisite protection of his interests safeguarded by Article 8. In line with its above-mentioned caselaw, the Court is also satisfied that the measure was necessary in a democratic society in order to protects X\u2019s rights.",
