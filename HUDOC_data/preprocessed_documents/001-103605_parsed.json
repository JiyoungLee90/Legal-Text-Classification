It notes in this respect that the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling of 21 March 2000 (see paragraph 9 above) constituted a res judicata, and it was only by virtue of the introduction of the new transitional remedy on 21 June 2001 (see paragraph 10 above) that the applicant was able to challenge this ruling. In such circumstances, the applicant\u2019s appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court to challenge the proceedings which had been brought to an end by a final decision must be seen as akin to a request to reopen those proceedings by means of the extraordinary transitional remedy provided for by the Law of 21 June 2001 (see Prystavska v.
