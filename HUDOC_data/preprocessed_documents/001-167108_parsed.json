Moreover, the Government did not provide any justification for the time it took the domestic courts to review the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. Accordingly, the entire length of the appeal proceedings in the present case was attributable to the authorities. The Court further reiterates that where an individual\u2019s personal liberty is at stake, it has very strict standards concerning the State\u2019s compliance with the requirement of speedy review of the lawfulness of detention (see, for example, Kadem v.\u00a0Malta, no.\u00a055263/00, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, 9 January 2003, where the Court considered a time-period of seventeen days in deciding on the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention to be excessive, and Mamedova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a07064/05, \u00a7 96, 1 June 2006, where the length of appeal proceedings lasting, inter alia, twenty-six days, was found to be in breach of the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention).",
