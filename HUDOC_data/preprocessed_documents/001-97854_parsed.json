He submitted that due to the criminal proceedings he had no longer been appointed by the Magdeburg District Court as liquidator on the same regular basis. While by 1999 he had been appointed (on average) in 41 insolvency proceedings per year, their number had amounted to only eight in 2000 and 2001 and to only three in 2003; thereafter, he had not been appointed at all. In support of his claims the applicant submitted a list of his appointments between 1999 and 2008 by five different courts. Without submitting further evidence, he also declared that, on average, he made a profit of EUR 10,000 to EUR 20,000 per case. In respect of EUR 100,000 of the sum claimed, the applicant submitted that, in 2006, his request with the Hannover District Court to be put on the list of liquidators eligible for singular proceedings was refused on account of the still pending criminal proceedings.",

They also submitted that he failed to further substantiate the alleged gains in the amount of EUR 10,000 to 20,000 per case, which, moreover, were gains of the civil law association he belonged to. Finally, they pointed out that, in view of the fact that the applicant never lodged a claim against his non-appointment, as foreseen in section 23 of the Introductory Act to the Judiciary Act, his claims for losses in any event lacked the required causal link and submitted that the applicant had filed a claim for public liability which was still pending before the national courts.",

The applicant failed to present to the court a comprehensive overview of all his assignments before, during and after his criminal proceedings and his respective profits \u2013 which might have allowed it to assess the possible impact of the criminal proceedings on his gains and the number of appointments by the Magdeburg District Court. In any event, there are also other possible explanations for the decrease. In this respect, the court also notes that, according to the statistics submitted by the applicant, he had been appointed by other courts during the relevant period. It also observes that, under German law, there is no right to be (re-)appointed as liquidator \u2013 the decision to entrust a liquidator with a case rests with the national courts \u2013 and that the applicant never challenged the decisions not to appoint him in a particular case. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that the losses claimed by the applicant indeed remain speculative. This also applies insofar as he claimed EUR 100,000 on account of the fact that, in 2006, the Hannover District Court refused to put him on the list of liquidators eligible for singular cases as a causal link with the length of the proceedings cannot be established. The Court therefore dismisses the applicant's claims for pecuniary damage.",
