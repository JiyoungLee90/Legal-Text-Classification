Justice required that they should not bear the burden to pay for improvements and maintenance expenses. Also, section 8 \u00a7 1 of the Restitution Law provided that persons who had obtained restitution of their nationalised property could not claim compensation for the fact that their property had been used by others after the nationalisation.

Disrespect for the law had been common in the communist bureaucracy where arbitrariness had reigned. Most importantly, trivial omissions had not, in accordance with the case-law of the Bulgarian courts at the relevant time, served as grounds for nullification of contracts for the sale of State housing and until 1970 the courts had not even had the power to review such contracts. Allowing their nullification decades later was absurd.

Compensation by bonds was a normal practice in a number of countries from Central and Eastern Europe. In , bonds could be traded in accordance with the relevant stock exchange rules and in July 2005, for example, they were traded at 70 % of their face value. The Government also referred to the fact that in accordance with the relevant law and practice the pre-nationalisation owners were entitled to restitution but could not claim compensation for damage or changes in the property since the nationalisation in the 1940s. It was therefore justified that the postnationalisation owners, who had to return the apartments they had possessed on the strength of a void title, could not claim compensation for improvements they had made.

It is also true that the terms used by section 7 to define the grounds on which a title to property could be declared null and void were broad. One of those grounds, \u201cbreaches of the law\u201d, was interpreted as referring to laws, decrees and various other enactments dating from the communist period and regulating matters as diverse as State housing policy, the functioning of the State administrative apparatus, real estate and civil transactions.

Furthermore, the Bulgarian legislature's approach to compensation for persons who had been deprived of property under section 7 changed several times in contradictory directions. Although in 1996 the law provided for full market value compensation, the Council of Ministers failed to adopt implementing regulations and no such compensation was paid.

The respondent State cannot be held responsible for the consequences of the applicants' choice. It can be said with certainty that as a result of their failure to take advantage of the bonds compensation scheme, the applicants forewent a possibility to obtain at least between 15 and 25% of the value of the apartment, as that was the rate at which bonds were traded until the end of 2004 (see paragraphs 135-137 above). The fact that bond prices rose in the end of 2004 cannot lead to the conclusion that the authorities would have secured adequate compensation to the applicants but for their refusal to receive their bonds. The applicants could not have foreseen bond prices and the Court cannot speculate whether they would have waited three or more years before cashing their bonds. Indeed, the legislation on compensation for persons in the applicants' position changed frequently and cannot be characterised as foreseeable. In so far as the law was amended again in June 2006, the Court notes that the Government have not shown that the amendment was applicable in the applicants' case (see paragraph 139 above).

It follows from this principle that a bona fide buyer may have to restore the property to its original owner seeking rei vindicatio if it is established that the person with whom the bona fide buyer entered into a transaction was not the owner. In theory, a rei vindicatio claim by the original owner can be brought even after a long chain of transactions, since none of those would generate ownership rights for the successive buyer.

In the case of Eneva and Dobrev, the fact that a relevant document had not been found in the archives concerning the sale of the apartment by the State to a Ms G. and that that sale was found to have been signed by a replacement for the relevant mayor sufficed to deprive the applicants from the property they had acquired from Ms G. in good faith and in due form forty years before the adoption of the Restitution Law.
