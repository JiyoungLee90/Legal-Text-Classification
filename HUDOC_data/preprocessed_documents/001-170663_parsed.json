Women\u2019s allegedly special role in society, which related, above all, to their reproductive function and childrearing, did not amount to a sufficient ground for treating female offenders more favourably than male ones. Irrespective of the biological differences between men and women, both sexes participated in caring for, protecting and supporting their children. National laws did not differentiate between the rights and obligations of a mother and a father in a child\u2019s upbringing. The Court had found that gender stereotypes, such as the perception of women as primary child-carers could not, in themselves, be considered to amount to sufficient justification for a difference in treatment (here the applicants referred to Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, \u00a7\u00a0143, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). In any event, the difference in sentencing would not achieve the purported objective of the protection of motherhood because a difference between a thirty-year prison sentence and a life sentence could not be decisive for a woman\u2019s reproductive ability if, in either case, she was bound to spend the childbearing years of her life in prison.",

Thus, Article 6 \u00a7 5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibited capital punishment of pregnant women because of considerations relating to their unborn child.

If all persons over 65 were to be considered irresponsible, the fact that such individuals were eligible under Russian law to hold important public offices, including that of judges of the Constitutional Court up to the age of 75, undermined the validity of the age-related generalisation. Furthermore, taking into account that the average life expectancy was 65 years for Russian men and that those statistics did not reflect the poor conditions of detention in Russian prison facilities which must further reduce life expectancy for inmates, the effect of a life sentence on a forty-year-old offender was hardly any different from that on a sixty-five-year-old: both had illusory chances of early release on parole. Thus, the age-limit established at 65 years was arbitrary, especially taking into account that the retirement age was set at 55 years for women and 60 years for men.",

In the Government\u2019s view, the case-law of the Constitutional Court reflected the requirements of international law concerning a differentiated approach to punishment according to the offender\u2019s sex and age. They referred, as regards juvenile offenders, to Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the position of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and that of the Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly\u2019s Resolution of 9 November 2012 and other international instruments, as well as to the fact that a vast majority of member States had abolished life imprisonment for children.

As to women, the sentencing exception was justified in view of their special role in society which related, above all, to their reproductive function.

The measures taken must be designed to address the disadvantage identified and the State must be able to show on what basis they had concluded that the measures chosen would attain that objective. However, a blanket exemption of women from a certain type of sentence was not temporary and did not pursue any objective linked to the equality of opportunity or treatment.

Generalisation as to a measure\u2019s ability to achieve a legitimate objective was insufficient (Age Concern England, ECJ, Case C-388/07, 5\u00a0March 2009, \u00a7\u00a051). Even if it was shown that a life sentence would more often be considered unduly harsh in the cases of persons aged over 65 than persons under 65, a blanket exemption was not necessarily a proportionate means of achieving the aim of avoiding harsh sentences. Age was not binary and any distinctions on the basis of age, where a cut-off point was identified, could call for a comparative analysis of State practice and scientific evidence when considering whether a measure was justified.",

In accordance with international legal principles and customary international law, the implementation of decisions of international tribunals should not abolish, restrict, or limit existing rights (reference was made to Article 53 of the Convention). Once the State had reduced the limitations on the right to liberty of a group of persons, it could not justify the reversal of this progress by reference to its obligation under the Convention. Instead, the third party submitted that, in order to comply with Article 14, the State should adopt an individualised approach to sentencing, which took into account, among other things, the offender\u2019s particular characteristics. An individualised approach would allow for a more nuanced calibrating of sentencing to the specific vulnerabilities of narrowly defined categories of individuals, as opposed to the overly broad and therefore arbitrary distinctions on the basis of gender or age.",

Indeed, the exemption of juvenile offenders from life imprisonment is consonant with the approach that is common to the legal systems of all the Contracting States, without exception, namely the abolition of life imprisonment for offenders considered juveniles under their respective domestic laws (see paragraph 20 above). The said exemption is also consistent with the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to abolish all forms of life imprisonment for offences committed by persons below the age of 18 and with the UN General Assembly\u2019s Resolution inviting the States to consider repealing all forms of life imprisonment for such persons (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Its purpose is evidently to facilitate the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents. The Court considers that when young offenders are held accountable for their deeds, however serious, this must be done with due regard for their presumed immaturity, both mental and emotional, as well as the greater malleability of their personality and their capacity for rehabilitation and reformation.",

Against the background of this Convention requirement, the Court sees no grounds for considering that the relevant domestic provision excluding offenders aged 65 or over from life imprisonment had no objective and reasonable justification. As can be seen from the material before the Court, the purpose of that provision in principle coincides with the interests underlying the eligibility for early release after the first twenty-five years for adult male offenders aged under 65, such as the applicants, noted in Vinter as being a common approach in national jurisdictions where life imprisonment can be imposed (see paragraph 74 above). Reducibility of a life sentence carries even greater weight for elderly offenders in order not to become a mere illusory possibility. By limiting the imposition of life sentences through providing for a maximum age limit, the Russian legislature used one among several methods at its disposal for securing a prospect of release for a reasonable number of prisoners and thus acted within its margin of appreciation in line with Convention standards.",

The Government provided statistical data showing a considerable difference between the total number of male and female prison inmates (see paragraph 48\u00a0above).

Whilst life imprisonment does not exist in nine Contracting States, either because no such sentences are available or because they have been abolished at some point in time (see paragraph 19 above), a majority of the Contracting States have opted for retaining the possibility of sentencing offenders for life in cases of particularly serious crimes. Within the latter group, there is no uniformity as to the age up to which the exemption from life imprisonment applies; many States have fixed the age at 18 years, in others it varies between 18 and 21 years (see paragraph 20 above).",

Such an exemption represents, all things considered, social progress in penological matters (compare Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7 41). The situation obtaining in the instant case is different from that in those cases where the Court was able to note a widespread and consistently developing consensus and associated legal changes to the domestic laws of Contracting States concerning a specific issue (compare Konstantin Markin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0140; Smith and Grady v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a0104, ECHR 1999VI; and Vallianatos and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a091). The Court is unable to discern an international trend in favour of abolishing life imprisonment or, on the contrary, confirming positive support for it. It notes however that life imprisonment in Europe has become limited in the sense of the requirement of reducibility of the sentence (see\u00a0Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 119) which may in future require further positive obligations on the part of the member States (see, for example, Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0124125). In the absence of common ground regarding the imposition of life imprisonment, the Russian authorities have not overstepped their margin of appreciation. Notwithstanding a more favourable position in which the perpetrators of offences comparable to those committed by the applicants have found themselves, the legislation on whose basis the punishments were served on the applicants and which is being challenged by them is not in breach of the applicable international law or markedly at variance with the solutions adopted by other member States of the Council of Europe in this sphere (compare Schwizgebel, cited above, \u00a7 92).",

Where the treatment of men and women differ, there is a presumption that this signals gender discrimination. This assumption is justified by a long history of unacceptable treatment of women.

What they are requesting is not to be subjected to a commutable life sentence. But according to Vinter, there is no such right under the Convention. Contrary to the finding in the present judgment, which accepts that the applicants \u201cdid not complain about the severity of punishment as such or the length of their sentence\u201d (see paragraph 54), this is exactly what they did complain about.

There is nothing in the imposition of a commutable life sentence on an offender that would violate the Convention. He receives what the judge finds appropriate. He is not discriminated against. Women (a class of people) do not receive the same punishment. One could argue that the most serious crimes women commit differ from those committed by male offenders (for example, the high number of cases of \u2013 usually provoked \u2013 domestic violence, neonaticide). Female crime is far less common than male crime; therefore there can be less need for deterrence. It is not unreasonable for the legislator to create a separate category for purposes of punishment, on the assumption that for this category of persons a lesser punishment is sufficient. Moreover, female offenders typically do not pose the same security problem that men do, and the danger of recidivism is less. It is true that women may commit some very heinous crimes, for example they may be partners in terrorist acts, but the question is not whether there are rare instances where they commit the same crime as male offenders but whether the State is entitled to create categories for purposes of punishment with a view to general prevention and deterrence.

But in a society where women are expected to have children and are raised in a social environment in which they are conditioned to believe that their happiness comes from having children they will suffer from the lack of fulfilment of this socially imposed expectation.

It is not appropriate to claim discrimination when (notwithstanding all legal extensions) the disadvantage has nothing to do with the difference. The disadvantage is a well-deserved punishment and not exclusion from a benefit (as in the case of Konstantin Markin v. Russia ([GC], no. 30078/06, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). Contrary to a service or benefit, where the exclusion can be discriminatory on impermissible grounds, here the applicants were not excluded from a benefit.

However, as the research report shows, there are currently only nine member States of the Council of Europe where life imprisonment does not exist (see paragraph 19). So there is neither a consensus to consider life imprisonment as a necessary option in the sentencing policy, nor to abolish it. For the latter approach there is even less support than for the former one. In such a situation Article 53 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as reducing to zero the existing broad margin of appreciation in defining the sentencing policy, and that only for States offering a more protective solution for some and not for all (on this point see also the concurring opinion of Judge Turkovic). Such an approach would be a disincentive for any reform.",

First, it was not disputed that there was a difference in treatment on grounds of sex. Second, it was clear that there was no common standard in the policy of the member States of the Council of Europe. Third, the disputed measure (abolition of life sentences in the present case; provision of parental leave allowances in the Petrovic case) could be regarded as a recent and welcome development. It is true that when the Court decided the Petrovic case, the legislation had already been changed and Austria had provided both men and women with parental allowance and thus moved towards the desired aim. Nevertheless, it seems to me that in the present case the same conclusion can be drawn as in Petrovic: It appears difficult to criticise the respondent State for having introduced, in a gradual manner and thus not for all at once, a measure advancing human rights protection, or even a measure based on the principles of \u201cjustice and humanity\u201d as argued by the Russian Government (see paragraph 70).",

In Russia this is considered necessary only for men. I have voted for a non-violation as I cannot accept that such an ultima ratio threat will also be introduced for women. It would be appalling if such a backward step were justified by the necessity to execute a judgment of the Court and were even done under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers.

The Grand Chamber was almost unanimous in respect of juvenile offenders and offenders aged 65 or over, finding sufficient justification in compliance with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention.

For this reason, in the present case it should be acknowledged that the respondent State\u2019s reasoning regarding the legislation exempting women from life imprisonment portrays women as a naturally vulnerable social group (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik v.

For the \u201cmental wellbeing\u201d dimension, for example, the women\u2019s severity score was almost twice as high as the men\u2019s; the women were significantly more likely to struggle with \u2018trust\u2019 and the absence of \u2018control\u2019 over their life in prison, and \u2018losing contact with family and friends\u2019 ranked comparatively higher for them.

While some penal reformers have argued in favour of the differential sentencing of men and women on the basis of dangerousness, legitimacy of punishment, and the value of their role in society, others have argued for the need for parity between provisions for female offenders coupled with gender-sensitive regimes. It follows from all this literature that formal equality in sentencing is not in itself a solution to the problem contemporary societies are facing in their penal systems when it comes to the female prison population. Much more than equality in sentencing is required to achieve substantive and transitive equality between female and male offenders/prisoners \u2013 we cannot simply replicate what we provide for men and hope it will work for women.

Thus I fully agree with Judge Nu\u03b2berger and Judge Mits that it was important for the Court to look at this case from the broader perspective, taking into consideration the spirit of the Convention as a whole as an instrument advancing human rights (see paragraphs\u00a073\u00a0and\u00a075 of the judgment).

Gradual abolition, targeting groups that are more vulnerable to the harmful impact of life sentences, should be tolerated as a step towards its complete abolition in so far as that difference in treatment does not additionally harm those to whom life imprisonment continues to apply.

The protection of maternity appears in Article 5 b) of the CEDAW, which stipulates that States Parties \u201cshall take all appropriate measures ... to ensure that family education includes a proper understanding of maternity as a social function\u201d. However, the provision par excellence in this area is the one contained in Article 11, paragraph 2, pursuant to which the States Parties undertake to take appropriate measures to prohibit, \u201csubject to the imposition of sanctions, dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy or of maternity leave\u201d and to introduce \u201cmaternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or social allowances\u201d. It would thus appear that the measures provided for by the CEDAW to protect maternity relate to family relationships and the field of employment law. However, even if Article\u00a04, paragraph 2, of the CEDAW were to be construed more broadly, the provisions designed to protect women in terms of \u201cpregnancy and maternity\u201d require \u2013 as an exception to the principle of non-discrimination \u2013 a very strict interpretation. This was indicated by the CJEU in the judgment Johnston, C-222/84, \u00a7\u00a044, in the context of Council Directive 76/207/EEC (see also Brown, C-394/96, \u00a7\u00a017; Commission/Austria, C-203/03, \u00a7\u00a7 43-45; and Stoeckel, C-345/89, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014-19). It is clear from this case-law that measures for the protection of maternity must always be adapted to the real and specific risks of different situations and do not justify an extension to the female sex as such.

It is significant, moreover, that neither the majority nor the Constitutional Court explicitly qualified the difference in treatment in question as a \u201cspecial measure\u201d aimed at protecting maternity. To quote the Russian Constitutional Court, the prohibition of the imposition of life imprisonment on women is more generally justified by their \u201csocial and physiological characteristics ... on the basis of the principles of justice and humanity in the criminal law\u201d (see paragraph 18 of the judgment).",

We observe, firstly, that the statistical data concern purely quantitative aspects. They say nothing about the possibility of women committing particularly serious crimes. Above all, they ignore the overriding importance of the personal situation of offenders when determining sentence.

Indeed the Council of Europe\u2019s most recent penal statistics show that these two trends can be observed in all the member States. More specifically, according to the statistics in question, female prisoners in Russia represent 8.2% of all prisoners in the country \u2013 a figure which approximately corresponds to the data provided by the Government \u2013 whilst the European average is 5% (Council of Europe, Annual Penal Statistics. SPACE I \u2013 Prison Populations, doc. PC-CP (2015)7, 23 December 2015, p. 64). In other words, the disproportionate ratio referred to by the Government is actually greater at pan-European level than in Russia. Furthermore, with regard to convicted offenders sentenced to life imprisonment as compared with the prison population as a whole, the Council of Europe\u2019s statistics show that the European average is around 1.6% (ibid., p. 97). Like Russia, this percentage reflects the low number of convicted offenders belonging to this category. Accordingly, we do not think it is possible to detect in this statistical data any particular feature with regard to Russia that would constitute a weighty argument for justifying the difference in question. In that connection we would point out that once a difference in treatment has been demonstrated under Article 14, it is for the Government to prove that it was justified (see the recent judgment delivered in the case of Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2016).",

In the area under consideration there is no doubt that the national legislatures have a wide margin of appreciation regarding the question whether provision should be made for life imprisonment. The States also have a substantial margin of appreciation to determine which crimes carry that sentence, it being understood, however, that, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, only particularly serious crimes deserve such punishment. However, where differences are made between offenders placed in analogous or relevantly similar situations, as in the present case women and men may be (see paragraphs 66-68 of the judgment), the margin of appreciation narrows according to the criterion for the differential treatment. We can never over-emphasise the point that, according to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, differences based exclusively on sex require \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d, \u201cparticularly weighty and convincing reasons\u201d or even \u201cparticularly serious reasons\u201d by way of justification (see paragraph\u00a02 above).",

In other words, in order to reply to that question, a comparison has to be made between what is truly comparable (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 91). Mixing different elements would be liable to impair the methodological clarity and lead to hasty conclusions. In the present case, what is important is to know whether there is justification for exempting female offenders from life imprisonment by way of a general rule. Consequently, the reference group is the one composed of the States which make provision in their legislation for the penalty in question. We observe that of the thirty-seven member States of the Council of Europe in which convicted offenders can be sentenced to life imprisonment, only Albania, Azerbaijan and the Republic of Moldova (in addition to Russia) generally exempt female offenders from this sentence in their criminal law (see paragraphs 20 and 22 of the judgment).

One of the main pitfalls facing the protection of this category is precisely the perpetuation of age-old prejudices regarding the nature or role of women in society. Perpetuating such thought patterns may turn out to be just as dangerous as the social disadvantages affecting women as compared with men since they contribute to maintaining the belief that there is an innate difference in aptitude between the sexes. For that purpose Article 5 of the CEDAW imposes a duty on the States Parties to take all appropriate measures \u201cto modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women\u201d.",

The second,\u00a0\u201creal\u201d, component of the principle of equality seeks to overcome that deficiency by aiming at achieving factual equality between individuals. The aim is therefore to offset initial inequalities in order to achieve, in fine, equal situations notwithstanding the original differences in each one\u2019s situation. Equality corresponds here to Aristotle\u2019s conception of justice. The concept of real equality thus refers to the idea of \u201cdistributive\u201d justice since the application of equal treatment to persons in unequal situations would be fundamentally unjust: persons in unequal situations must be treated unequally in order to re-establish equality. It is therefore sometimes necessary, for the purposes of achieving the objective of equality, to introduce a form of inequality.

Thus in the name of non-discrimination a difference in treatment is required or, as summed up by Kelsen, \u201cwhere individuals are equal, or, to be more precise, where individuals and external circumstances are equal, they must receive equal treatment, and where individuals and external circumstances are unequal, they must receive different treatment\u201d. Such action is compatible with the Convention, as expressly provided for in the Preamble to Protocol No.\u00a012. The Court has recently reaffirmed this in the case of Andrle v. the Czech Republic, in which it stated that \u201cArticle 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct \u2018factual inequalities\u2019 between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article\u201d.",

It pointed out in that case that despite the possibility, or even the necessity, of putting such policies in place in certain cases, \u201c[a] difference of treatment is, however, discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized\u201d.

The Court has already acknowledged that age is a concept that is also covered by Article\u00a014 and which must be taken into consideration in determining sentence.

That is the fundamental consequence of a finding of a violation of the principle of equality by the Court, as can be seen in its earliest decisions, for example in the case of Marckx v. Belgium. In that judgment it indicated, having noted that inheritance law discriminated against children born out of wedlock, that \u201c[it did] not exclude that a judgment finding a breach of the Convention on one of those aspects might render desirable or necessary a reform of the law\u201d.

On the contrary, some States which have kept life imprisonment in their criminal arsenal, like the United States or Russia, have high crime rates. Certain States which have abolished it, on the other hand, such as Portugal \u2013 since the prison reform of 1884 \u2013 do not have particularly high rates of general or violent crime.\u00a0Thus, the final argument in favour of life imprisonment, which consists in identifying advantages in terms of general prevention, does not justify maintaining this type of inhuman treatment in our day and age. Accordingly, there is no justification for life imprisonment in terms of penological objectives of criminal imprisonment or in terms of effectiveness of prevention.

In that case the Attorney-General for the Isle of Man argued that \u201chaving due regard to the local circumstances in the Island\u201d ... the continued use of judicial corporal punishment on a limited scale was justified as a deterrent.

If nothing else this cas[t] doubt on whether the availability of this penalty [was] a requirement for the maintenance of law and order in a European country\u201d. It concluded that the Isle of Man must be regarded as sharing fully that \u201ccommon heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law\" to which the Preamble to the Convention referred, and that consequently there were no local requirements affecting the application of Article 3. Accordingly, the evolutive interpretation of the Convention is closely linked to the need for a consensual reading of the text based on consideration of the practice of the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of the Contracting States, which is regarded as an indicator par excellence\u00a0of \u201cpresent-day\u00a0conditions\u201d, the evolution of which since the Convention was drafted justifies such an interpretation.",

In the Russian indemnity case the Permanent Court of Arbitration observed that \u201cthe fulfilment of obligations [was], between States as between individuals, the surest commentary on the meaning of these obligations\u201d. The subsequent practice of the parties in executing a treaty is therefore a fundamental tool of interpretation, capable of enlightening the interpreter as to the manner in which the agreement must be understood. It is therefore logical that it should appear among the rules of interpretation listed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. This is a classic interpretation technique of international law, practised by nearly all international jurisdictions. The International Court of Justice has for a long time examined such subsequent practice when interpreting the provisions of a treaty and clearly indicated in a case brought by Costa Rica against Nicaragua concerning a dispute regarding navigational and related rights that \u201cthe subsequent practice of the parties, within the meaning of Article\u00a031\u00a0(3)\u00a0(b) of the Vienna Convention, can result in a departure from the original intent on the basis of a tacit agreement between the parties\u201d. In its classic sense subsequent practice is thus understood from a State-centred perspective, as had already been observed by Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice who said that such a practice was not, in his view, made out unless \u201cit [was] possible and reasonable in the circumstances to infer from the behavior of the parties that they ha[d] regarded the interpretation of the instrument in question as the legally correct one, and ha[d] tacitly recognized that, in consequence, certain behaviour was legally incumbent upon them\u201d. The fact remains that the argument based on the existence of a European consensus is in line with this traditional rule, whose central position in the European system is confirmed by the wording of the Preamble referred to above. In the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment the Court reiterated its attachment to respect for the rules of interpretation formulated in the Vienna Convention of 1969, and more particularly the \u201csubsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\u201d. It thus formally expressed the link between subsequent practice and the consensus observable between the Contracting States in considering that \u201cwith regard to subsequent treaty practice, while there have been statements opposing the Turkish interpretation of Articles 25 and 46, it has not been established that there is a practice reflecting an agreement among all Contracting Parties concerning the attachment of conditions to these instruments of acceptance\u201d. This approach contains, in essence, an important evolutive dimension in that the practice of States and non-State actors evolves throughout execution of the treaty, adapting to changing customs and new social realities.

In other words, the binding provisions of Article\u00a04 of the CEDAW do not apply to the present case. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s argument is not in any way supported by the various soft law instruments referred to. Those instruments are aimed at conditions of detention and the protection of women\u2019s reproductive and child-caring role and must be distinguished from measures of wider scope, such as that provided for in Russian criminal law seeking to protect women in general on account of their sex. It should also be borne in mind that the alternative to life imprisonment under the Russian Criminal Code is a twenty-five-year prison sentence. If a convicted offender is sentenced to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment, he or she can only apply for release on parole sixteen years later. The gender-based exemption from life imprisonment provided for in Article\u00a057 of the Russian Criminal Code does not in itself achieve the declared aim of protecting pregnant women and mothers of young children, because by the time they can apply for release on parole their children will already have become adults. While not claiming that motherhood should not benefit from specific protection in contemporary societies, the stereotyped message being conveyed here is that women do not have the same power of endurance as men.

The Government confine their submissions to arguing that the imposition of a life sentence on persons aged over 65 would render eligibility for release on parole an illusory possibility. This is the argument upheld by the majority in the present judgment, without it being possible to decipher the reasons for determining the age beyond which life imprisonment becomes intolerable for reasons of humanity and justice. On the contrary, as a man\u2019s average life expectancy at birth in Russia is 64.7 years and having regard to the appalling conditions in Russian prisons, which must reduce the inmates\u2019 life expectancy still further, the legislature can be criticised for arbitrarily fixing the age-limit for this type of penalty at 65 as compared with other prisoners because whether one receives a life sentence at the age of 50 or 65 this has the almost identical effect of rendering eligibility for release on parole an illusory possibility. Moreover, it is difficult to draw a distinction between a person sentenced to imprisonment at the age of 50 who would be unable to apply for release on parole until the age of 75 and another person sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment at the age of 64, with the possibility of applying for release on parole after ten years.

That line of argument amounts to implicit acknowledgment of the fact that life imprisonment of male offenders aged between 18 and 65 does not really pursue the aim of rehabilitation of the offenders, but rather blind punishment and permanent social exclusion, exactly as dictated by a strictly punitive criminal policy. The Government\u2019s argument is particularly unfortunate in that it fails to take account of the fact that it is the domestic authorities which have ultimate responsibility for establishing a decent and humane environment in prisons and that this obligation extends to all prisoners, without distinction on grounds of age, sex or other personal characteristics. Even if a far higher number of offences are committed by men than by women, the Government cannot rely on that factor to justify an inhumane criminal policy towards male offenders aged between 18 and 65. Otherwise, male life prisoners aged between 18 and 65 would be the scapegoats of male offenders, serving a particularly inhuman sentence in order to atone for allegedly collective guilt on the part of male offenders. It would be inappropriate for the Court to find that female offenders should be protected from inhuman and degrading treatment, but not their male counterparts. Unfortunately, the majority fail to distance themselves from this criminal policy and thus condone it.",

I have specifically pointed out above that there is an international trend towards abolishing this type of treatment and that, furthermore, the Court is not bound to wait for that trend to mature to take note of it. On the contrary, it can, and must, accompany and encourage it in the light of an evolutive and pro persona interpretation of the Convention. A wait-and-see position does not correspond to the role and vocation of the Court.",

The applicants\u2019 arguments in the present case should have been heard, in so far as the Russian legislation is the source of discrimination which highlights the need to simply abolish this punishment, and, over and beyond this case, accompany a more general trend of European human rights law, in conformity with the development of democratic societies and with the aim of developing human rights. Like the death penalty, European States can and must do without this archaic and inhuman punishment, and choose solutions geared towards the social reinsertion of offenders. The role of the Court is to accompany and encourage this change, in the light of an evolutive and pro persona interpretation of the Convention. Whilst the subsidiary position of the Court requires it to respect the specific criminal policies of each national system, such fundamental questions do not allow it to remain passive. Its credibility and authority, and above all the effectiveness of the rights guaranteed by the Convention, are at stake.",
