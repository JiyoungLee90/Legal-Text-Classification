It did not disclose the origin of the information concerning the distance of twenty-eight metres, nor did it contain any suggestion as to how the expert had come up with that figure. The report also indicated that the braking distance of a BMW of the kind involved in the accident moving at a speed of 50\u00a0k.p.h. was between thirty-one and thirty-nine metres.

Ukraine, no. 36660/08, \u00a7 35, 17 October 2013). In case of a life-threatening injury or death, the above obligation calls for an effective independent judicial system to ensure enforcement of the aforementioned legislative framework by providing appropriate redress (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, \u00a7 72, 24 May 2011). This obligation also applies in the context of designing a framework for protection of life from road traffic accidents (see, for example, Al Fayed v.\u00a0France (dec.), no. 38501/02, \u00a7\u00a7 73-78, 27 September 2007; Rajkowska v.\u00a0Poland (dec.), no. 37393/02, 27 November 2007; Railean v. Moldova, no.\u00a023401/04, \u00a7 30, 5 January 2010). An effective judicial system, as required by Article 2, may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law (see Cioban v. Romania (dec.), no. 18295/08, \u00a7\u00a025, 11 March 2014) but if the infringement of the right to life is not intentional, Article 2 does not necessarily require such remedies; the State may meet its obligation by affording victims a civil\u2011law remedy, either alone or in conjunction with a criminal\u2011law one, enabling any responsibility of the individuals concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages, to be obtained (see Anna Todorova, cited above, \u00a7 73).",

Any deficiency in the investigation, undermining its ability to establish the cause of the death or those responsible for it, may lead to the finding that the Convention requirements have not been met (see Antonov v. Ukraine, no.\u00a028096/04, \u00a7\u00a046, 3\u00a0November 2011).",

According to their account of the events, the grey car was going in the same direction as the victim\u2019s car at a very high speed in the lane for traffic coming from the opposite direction when it collided with the victim\u2019s car. It also appeared that the grey car driver had not applied his brakes at all before the collision.

The answer given was that in such circumstances the impact could not have been avoided because the braking distance of the grey car would have been longer by at least three metres than the imaginary distance between it and the manoeuvring car ahead of it. That was indeed a purely hypothetical exercise because, as it appears clearly from the materials of the case, neither the grey car\u2019s speed nor the distance between it and the victim\u2019s car were established during the investigation.",

It was not until 29 August 2008, namely almost five months after the accident that the prosecutor considered it necessary to ask for the real speed of the grey car to be determined by a forensic expert (see paragraph 20 above).
