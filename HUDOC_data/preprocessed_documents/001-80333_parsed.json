The editor-in-chief of the newspaper Keste Debena also left  in September 2001 (it therefore seems impossible that he could have covered the student strikes in 2002). The circumstances of his departure, accompanied by another reporter from the same newspaper, do not tally either with Mr Gaberamadhien\u2019s statements. It seems surprising to say the least that, apart from the editor-in-chief of Keste Debena, he is unable to name any other journalist or photographer arrested by the Eritrean government of the day, or to name any other newspaper that was banned. Likewise, it is extremely surprising that Mr Gaberamadhien is only able to cite \u2013 in a very sketchy and imprecise way \u2013 one event which he covered as a photographer. His lack of knowledge is such that it raises serious doubts as to whether he was actually engaged in this activity. Given the widespread media coverage of the events at the time, it seems strange that Mr Gaberamadhien\u2019s name does not appear anywhere, either as a member of staff of Keste Debena or as one of the persons arrested.

In ANAF\u00c9\u2019s view, this reduction in the numbers seeking asylum at the border was a result of the measures implemented by the Government to prevent foreigners from coming to France (in violation of the Geneva Convention when the persons concerned were refugees). As examples of these measures, the organisation cited the increased use of airport transit visas (which were now required from nationals of some thirty countries), the severe penalties imposed on carriers and the checks on leaving the aircraft (it was not uncommon for persons to be refused entry following such checks before they had even had a chance to register an asylum request).",

The investigation consisted of an interview and the drafting of a recommendation by an official from OFPRA, followed by a decision by the Ministry of the Interior (which was generally in line with the recommendation). ANAF\u00c9 stressed that asylum-seekers often did not have any documents to substantiate their claim and that the speed with which claims were processed made it difficult for them to obtain the necessary papers. The organisation complained in particular of the fact that the administrative authorities, in determining whether or not an application was \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d, examined its merits in detail, whereas they were supposed just to check briefly whether the reasons given by the asylum-seeker meant that he or she required protection, in order to screen out persons wishing to enter France for other reasons (work, family reunion and so forth) without following the visa procedure. By doing this, the authorities were denying asylum-seekers the guarantees offered by the procedure for requesting asylum after leave to enter the country had been granted. (This entailed a decision by OFPRA \u2013 which had the resources needed to conduct the research and investigation required \u2013 taken following a comprehensive examination of the application and amenable to an appeal with suspensive effect.) It was not uncommon for asylum-seekers whose application at the border had been declared \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d to gain entry to the country by another means and subsequently obtain refugee status. In support of this assertion, ANAF\u00c9 described the cases of six persons who had found themselves in this situation in 2004 or 2005 (some of whom had been the subject of criminal sanctions in the meantime for failing to comply with the order for their removal).

The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see, among many other authorities, \u010conka, cited above, \u00a7 75).",

In the instant case, however, following the application of Rule 39, the applicant was eventually granted leave to enter . As a result, he was able to lodge an asylum application with OFPRA, which granted him refugee status on 7 November 2005.

France (dec.) [GC], no. 76642/01, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2006XIV). The applicant was granted refugee status on 7 November 2005, that is, quite some time after the last decision by the domestic courts on the appeal whose ineffectiveness he complained of before the Court (the Conseil d\u2019Etat having decided on 11 August 2005 that it was unnecessary to rule on the appeal against the order of 8 July 2005 given by the urgentapplications judge (see paragraph 19 above)).",

It is quite clear in the instant case that those conditions have not been met in relation to the complaint under Articles 13 and 3 taken together. The fact that the applicant was not removed to Eritrea and was eventually able to enter France to lodge an asylum application appears to have been due to his not being issued with a laissez-passer by the Eritrean embassy and then to the application by the Court of Rule 39. Furthermore, the Court observes in this regard that the administrative authorisation to enter the country and the safe conduct issued on 20 July 2005, and also the decision of the Conseil d\u2019Etat of 11 August 2005, referred expressly to Rule 39 and to the interim measure taken in accordance with that provision (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above).",

The procedure in question is similar to the urgent-application procedure before the French administrative courts which is under consideration here. In its judgment, having observed that applications under the \u201cextremely urgent procedure\u201d did not have automatic suspensive effect, the Court rejected the Belgian Government\u2019s argument that the remedy in question nonetheless satisfied the requirements of the Articles cited above since it had suspensive effect in practice. In that regard the Court stressed in particular that \u201cthe requirements of Article 13, and of the other provisions of the Convention, take the form of a guarantee and not of a mere statement of intent or a practical arrangement. That is one of the consequences of the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention\u201d (\u00a7 83). It went on to find a violation on the ground that \u201c... the [applicant] ha[d] no guarantee that the Conseil d\u2019Etat and the authorities [would] comply in every case with that practice, that the Conseil d\u2019Etat [would] deliver its decision, or even hear the case, before his expulsion, or that the authorities [would] allow a minimum reasonable period of grace\u201d (ibid.).",

Firstly, in accordance with domestic law (Articles L. 221-3, L. 222-1 and L. 222-2 of the Immigration and Asylum Code (see paragraph 29 above)), the initial decision to place the applicant in the waiting zone on 1 July 2005 was extended after forty-eight hours by the competent administrative authorities for the same period, and subsequently by the liberties and detention judge of the Bobigny tribunal de grande instance, first on 5 July 2005 for eight days and a second time on 13 July 2005 for a further eight days (see paragraph 18 above). Secondly, on the twentieth day after he had been placed in the waiting zone, the applicant was granted leave to enter France and was issued with a safe conduct (see paragraph 17 above), putting an end to his deprivation of liberty. Hence, not only did the overall period of detention not exceed the legal maximum of twenty days, but the holding of the applicant in the waiting zone between 15 and 20 July 2005 was also based on a court decision in the form of the order by the liberties and detention judge of 13 July 2005. Moreover, since the applicant by his own admission had no travel papers, the Court sees no reason to doubt the Government\u2019s good faith in stating that the authorities had to conduct checks as to his identity before granting him leave to enter the country. Lastly, the Court considers that the length of time for which the applicant was held in the waiting zone for that purpose did not exceed what was reasonable in the circumstances of the case.",
