The occupancy relationship could be terminated and another, more appropriate dwelling allocated in the event of a reduction of the number of users of the dwelling (Section 59 of the ZSR). In the Government\u2019s view, this proved that the occupancy right was associated with personal and family needs, and not with a particular dwelling. The concept of family needs was variable and depended on the number of family members. No more than one dwelling could be used at the same time and no one could move into the dwelling without the prior approval of the holder of the occupancy right. The latter was given management entitlements, such as the right and duty to participate in the management of the socially-owned housing. Holders of occupancy rights could exchange dwellings and make alterations to the dwelling, its furnishings and appliances only with the prior written approval of the housing administration (Section\u00a029 of the ZSR).",

The legal relationship was not limited in time and was linked not only to the holder of the right, but also to persons living with him. It concluded that, because of the very limited volume of transactions involving socially-owned dwellings, the specially protected tenancy had been more akin to a property right than to a tenancy right.",

Special provisions applied in the event of divorce (Section 17 of the ZSR), and if it considered that none of the users of the dwelling met the conditions for obtaining the occupancy right after the death of the previous holder, the housing administration could request the said users to vacate the premises (Section 18 of the ZSR).",

In this case, the users of the dwelling who had been living together with the holder of the occupancy right for a minimum of two years had the same rights as they would have had if the holder had died. Other grounds were inappropriate and detrimental behaviour, failure to pay the fee, full sublease, use of the dwelling by a person other than the holder of the occupancy right and possession of an unoccupied flat suitable for residence. Although inspections were to be carried out to ensure compliance with these requirements, the specially protected tenancy was rarely, if ever, cancelled on these grounds (see \u0110oki\u0107 v.\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina, no.\u00a06518/04, \u00a7\u00a06, 27 May 2010). In this connection, the applicants pointed out that it was true that in theory holders of a specially protected tenancy could be moved to a substitute dwelling if the dwelling they were occupying was too large for them and the other users with regard to social standards (see the Government\u2019s submissions in paragraph\u00a09 above).

Upon a judicial action introduced by the tenant, the competent court would appoint a construction expert to assess the value of the property at the time of nationalisation and its value at the time of its restitution; a tenant who could provide evidence of the investments made (they were not required to provide evidence that the community of residents had consented to the investments) could then obtain the difference between the two values of the property (Section 25 of the ZDen).

As a rule, the tenants\u2019 requests for reimbursement were examined in sets of proceedings initiated after the denationalisation proceedings, often after the year 2005.

Moreover, only those investments which had increased the value of the dwelling \u2013 and not those which had kept the value of the property at the same level since its expropriation \u2013 were taken into account.

The great majority of holders of occupancy rights who had been given the opportunity to purchase the dwellings on favourable terms had availed themselves of this possibility; only a few of them had stayed in the flats on a contractual basis. However, as explained in paragraph 20 above, the possibility to purchase without the \u201cprevious owners\u2019\u201d consent was not given to those who were living in previously expropriated dwellings subject to denationalisation (approximately 4,700 properties, covering 2% of all specially protected tenants).

It challenged the Housing Act 1991 and the Denationalisation Act 1991, on the ground that they deprived the Association\u2019s members of their specially protected tenancy rights in a manner incompatible with the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, which was still in force at the time when the two acts were passed in 1991. Instead of the privileged specially protected tenancy, which in the Association\u2019s view was in many respects equal to a property right, tenants were granted leases with a temporary non-profit rent. Moreover, once the dwelling had been taken over by a \u201cprevious owner\u201d, that contract became an ordinary lease contract. This effectively deprived the tenants of their property and home. In 1991 approximately 45,000 individuals (previous holders of specially protected tenancies and their families), living in 13,000 flats, were concerned by these measures.

The Association concluded that privatisation and restitution of previously expropriated dwellings should be achieved by paying compensation to the \u201cprevious owners\u201d of the dwellings rather than returning their property, as recommended by Resolution 1096 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 87-89 below).

Even though the Ombudsman\u2019s report was formally examined and accepted by the National Assembly, the suggestions it contained were not implemented in the SZ-1, which completely abolished the concept of the right of former specially protected tenancy holders to purchase an existing or substitute dwelling in accordance with the \u201cfirst and third models\u201d of substitute privatisation. Instead, the 2003 legislation focused on the \u201csecond model\u201d (paragraph 34 above), which had rarely been used and which allowed the tenant to receive financial compensation if he or she decided to move out of the dwelling and purchase another flat on the free market or to build a house.",

The replacement of the specially protected tenancy with normal leases restricted the applicants\u2019 rights in several respects. They were no longer able to enjoy the protection which the previous legislation afforded to holders of occupancy rights, namely the possibility of using the premises for an indefinite period in exchange for the payment of a fee, protection against eviction, the right to transmit the lease to family members other than spouses or long-term partners and the possibility of subletting, renovating or decorating the flat without the owner\u2019s permission. Moreover, the fee was replaced by a higher non-profit rent, and the obligation to tolerate visits of the \u201cprevious owners\u201d, and new grounds for eviction were introduced. It is also to be noted that the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision repealing the \u201cthird model\u201d of substitute privatisation (see paragraph 37 above) deprived the applicants of the possibility, provided for by the 1994 amendments to the Housing Act 1991, of purchasing a substitute flat on favourable terms from the municipalities.

The Court held that the scheme was not compatible with Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1 when, for purely mathematical reasons, it made it impossible for landlords to receive an income from rent or at least recover their maintenance costs. Moreover, the Polish reform provided for various restrictions on landlords\u2019 rights in respect of the termination of leases, the statutory financial burdens imposed on them and the absence of any legal ways and means making it possible for them either to offset or to mitigate the losses incurred in connection with the maintenance of property or to have the necessary repairs subsidised by the State in justified cases (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 223-224).",

Notably, the level of rent was particularly low and could be adjusted only on the basis of changes in the consumer price index (thus excluding the possibility of taking into account the value of the land as a relevant factor) and the lease contracts were extended for an indefinite duration.

In adjudicating the merits of their complaint, the Court will have regard, among other factors, to one of the main principles expressed in Hutten-Czapska, namely that in balancing the exceptionally difficult and socially sensitive issues involved in reconciling the conflicting interests of landlords and tenants the State should ensure a \u201cfair distribution of the social and financial burden involved in the transformation and reform of the country\u2019s housing supply\u201d (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, \u00a7 225).

The Court will examine whether in the present case a similar burden was placed on the tenants. In considering whether this is the case, the Court must keep in mind the particular context in which the issue arises, namely that of a reform of the housing system, which cannot but be, at least in part, the expression of society\u2019s concern for the social protection of tenants (see Velosa Barreto v.\u00a0Portugal, 21\u00a0November 1995, \u00a7\u00a016, Series A no.\u00a0334, and Almeida Ferreira and Melo Ferreira, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 32; see also, mutatis mutandis and in the context of a social security scheme, Goudswaard-Van der Lans v.\u00a0the Netherlands (dec.), no.\u00a075255/01, ECHR 2005XI, and Wieczorek, cited above, \u00a7 64).",

This is true, in particular, of the obligation not to cause major damage to the dwelling, not to disturb other residents, not to perform prohibited activities in the flat, not to change the dwelling and fixtures, not to sublet and not to allow new people to use the dwelling without the prior consent of the owner (see paragraph 21 above).

In particular, the lease contracts were concluded for an indefinite period (see paragraph 19 above) and were transmissible, also for an indefinite period, to the spouse or long term partner of the tenant (see paragraph 69 above). The latter did not have to pay a full market rent, but only an administratively-determined non-profit rent, meant to cover only the depreciation, management and routine maintenance of the dwelling and the cost of the capital invested (see paragraphs 79-86 above). It is shown by the data submitted by the Government (see paragraph 239 below), and not contested by the applicants, that they were paying sums comprised between EUR\u00a049.16 and EUR 280.78 per month and that in spite of a market rental price of between EUR 6 and EUR 11 per square metre, the applicants were charged between EUR\u00a01.13 and EUR 3.33 per square metre. The Court concludes that the non-profit rent imposed on the applicants was significantly lower than the rents charged on the free market, and that the fact that they still enjoyed such favourable terms more than 22 years after the enactment of the housing reform shows that the transition to a market economy was conducted in a reasonable and progressive manner. Moreover, none of the applicants has shown that the level of the non-profit rent was excessive in relation to his or her income.",

She had inherited a specially protected tenancy from her late mother in 1991. The denationalisation decision of the Municipality of Maribor of 16\u00a0April 1993 stated, inter alia, that the \u201cprevious owners\u201d had to conclude a lease contract with her. They never did so, but continued to charge rent. When applicant no. 2 was evicted in 2000, her lawyer had filed a lawsuit to have a lease contract drawn up; this legal action was dismissed as it had been filed against a \u201cprevious owner\u201d who had died some months earlier. A new lawsuit was rejected in 2011 as time-barred and because applicant no. 2 had meanwhile received public financial assistance. Contrary to what the Government and the \u201cprevious owners\u201d asserted, Mrs\u00a0Berglez had never refused to sign a lease and the allegations of wrongful behaviour on her part (keeping flammable material, endangering other residents of the building, lack of maintenance of the flat) had never been proven. The Slovenian courts themselves had found that the forceful eviction of the applicant was an arbitrary and unlawful action. It was not true that the applicant had given false information to the Court. Mrs Berglez had inherited agricultural land of negligible value (approximately EUR\u00a015,000) from her parents.

Until 2005 the right to purchase a returned dwelling and the right to a lease had been transferable mortis causa to close family members. After the death of his father, applicant no. 6 had wanted to remain in the premises and had accordingly insisted on signing a lease contract. At the end of 1999 he learned that the \u201cthird model\u201d had been repealed and that he could no longer purchase a substitute dwelling on favourable conditions. However, after two favourable judgments, in 2005 the Supreme Court had reversed the existing case-law and decided that users of denationalised flats could not demand the continuation of a non-profit lease following the demise of the tenant (paragraph 68 above). This meant that Mr Niko Kuret\u2019s family had unjustifiably used the dwelling for more than ten years and that the \u201cprevious owners\u201d could require them to pay a market rent for that period (a claim which would amount to at least DEM 150,000 plus interest). If such a request had been filed, the applicant and his wife \u2013 who had two dependent children \u2013 would have gone bankrupt.

Otherwise, the non-profit rent would have had no connection with maintenance costs, which would then have had to be borne by the \u201cprevious owners\u201d. As in the last twenty years economic standards, prices and salary levels had changed, it would be unrealistic to expect the non-profit rent to remain unchanged. Non-profit rents had increased from 1.88% of the value of the dwelling in 1990 to a maximum of 4.68% of the value of the dwelling by 2012. This increase represented a 148% increase in rents. As salaries had also increased, in 1990 the rent for an average two-room dwelling amounted to 7.30% of the average salary, while in 2012 it was 14.70% of it. This meant that rents had only increased by about 100% in real terms (and not by 700%). Furthermore, non-profit rents were substantially lower than market rents.",

Applicant no. 2 was using the dwelling in a way that was putting other residents in the building at risk, notably by keeping flammable materials in the attic. Mrs\u00a0Berglez, who according to the Government had on several occasions been offered the keys of the place where her furniture was being held, had lodged an action for trespassing; in 2007 the Maribor Higher Court upheld her claim and on 25\u00a0August 2008 the Maribor Local Court issued an enforcement order which at the time of introduction of the application had not yet been complied with, as the \u201cprevious owners\u201d had objected that in 2000 applicant no. 2 did not have any right to be living in the dwelling. Applicant no. 2 alleged that because of the behaviour of the \u201cprevious owners\u201d, since September 2000 she had been forced to rent alternative accommodation, a fact which had placed her in financial difficulties. The Government could confirm that applicant no. 2 had never concluded a lease contract with the provisional public owner and had thus never become a protected tenant; her use of the dwelling had been unlawful or not based on a legal title. The two actions filed by Mrs Berglez to force the \u201cprevious owners\u201d to sign a lease contract had failed on procedural grounds and because applicant no. 2 had purchased a two-room dwelling in Maribor in the meantime (on 26\u00a0November 2010) and had thus resolved her housing issue. The Government further noted that applicant no.\u00a02 had been receiving welfare benefits, that she had inherited a large estate from her father, that on 16\u00a0May 2011 she had obtained the non-refundable sum of EUR 38,752.08 and that she had been granted a soft loan of EUR\u00a028,774.92 by the National Housing Fund, which she did not use to buy the two-room dwelling in Maribor.",

Three of the plots were building sites; therefore, the applicant\u2019s allegation that the inherited property consisted only of agricultural land of the poorest quality was false. The new dwelling was acquired on 26\u00a0November 2006, while the State financial support was not transferred to the applicant\u2019s account until 16 May 2011. As Mrs\u00a0Berglez did not indicate that she had obtained a loan, it could be inferred that she had sufficient financial means to purchase the dwelling. Finally, it was worth noting that in 1993 the manager of the building had started proceedings against applicant no. 2 for non-payment of rent between April and September 1992, which was a ground for terminating the tenancy relationship.",

The \u201cprevious owner\u201d had allegedly exerted pressure on applicant no. 3 \u2013 through her lawyer and by hiring detectives \u2013 to get her to move out of the dwelling, and had refused to authorise repairs. The \u201cprevious owner\u201d had eventually filed a lawsuit against applicant no. 3, which was rejected on formal grounds (the \u201cprevious owners\u201d had already sold the dwelling and therefore had lost legal interest in the case). The new owners subsequently requested the termination of the lease, claiming that they needed the dwelling for their son and his family. These proceedings ended with a court settlement in 2005. Applicant no. 3 vacated the premises and waived all her claims for the recovery of investments; in exchange, she received compensation in the amount of EUR\u00a0100,000. Mrs Bertoncelj allegedly later discovered that she had been deceived by the buyers: the dwelling was not for use by their son, but had been connected to their own flat. The Government observed that Mrs\u00a0Bertoncelj had never started proceedings with a view to having maintenance work done and normal living conditions restored in the dwelling, nor had she introduced an action for trespassing or obstructive conduct.

The pressure exerted by the owner was such that Mrs Jeran\u010di\u010d had eventually vacated the premises. The Government observed that tenants in denationalised dwellings were protected by the legislation from payment of an excessive rent and that alleged inadequate use of the dwelling did not constitute a ground for termination of the lease. In any event, no such lawsuits had been filed by the owner against applicant no. 4. The applicant was the co-owner of an 83 m\u00b2 dwelling in Kamnik built in 2006 and suitable for living in.

It does not institute for individuals a kind of actio popularis for the interpretation of the Convention; it does not permit individuals to complain against a law in abstracto simply because they feel it contravenes the Convention. In principle, it does not suffice for an individual applicant to claim that the mere existence of a law violates his rights under the Convention; it is necessary that the law should have been applied to his detriment\u201d (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 28). This principle also applies to decisions that are allegedly contrary to the Convention (see Fairfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a024790/04, ECHR 2005-VI). Moreover, the exercise of the right of individual petition cannot be used to prevent a potential violation of the Convention: in theory, the Court cannot examine a violation other than a posteriori, once that violation has occurred. It is only in highly exceptional circumstances that an applicant may nevertheless claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention owing to the risk of a future violation (see, for instance, Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v.

The Court is accordingly of the opinion that the applicant had a legitimate expectation of signing a lease agreement with the \u201cprevious owners\u201d. Not until April 2005, when that expectation was frustrated by a reversal of case-law (see paragraph 68 above), did Mr Kuret \u2013 also in order to avoid the risk of being asked to pay arrears of rent at the free-market rate \u2013 envisage reaching a friendly settlement with the \u201cprevious owner\u201d and resolve his housing needs by moving out of Ljubljana (see paragraph 228 in fine, above).

On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that \u2018[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation\u2019 ... The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature\u2019s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ... It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual\u2019s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community ... Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ...",

It is true that the Housing Act 2003 introduced a new ground for eviction \u2013 namely ownership of another suitable dwelling \u2013 and the possibility for the \u201cprevious owner\u201d to move the tenant to another adequate flat at any time and without any reason. The Court considers, however, that these legislative measures were justified in view of the special, reinforced protection which was afforded to persons in the applicants\u2019 situation and the corresponding limitations placed on the rights of the \u201cprevious owners\u201d. Upon obtaining restitution of the property, the latter were obliged to enter into a permanent, lifelong agreement with a tenant they did not choose and in exchange for a particularly low rent. It was therefore not disproportionate to offer them the possibility of moving the tenant to another adequate flat. In this regard, the Court notes that the removal costs were borne by the \u201cprevious owner\u201d and that the same tenant could be made to move only once (see paragraph 40 above). Moreover, as the rules governing the lease agreement were aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants, it was not arbitrary to provide for the possibility of eviction when, as in the case of Mrs\u00a0Margu\u010d, ownership of another suitable dwelling showed that a given tenant was not in a situation of social or financial distress and that his or her housing needs could be satisfied elsewhere without limiting the \u201cprevious owner\u2019s\u201d property rights. In any event, as noted above, the Court has already considered compatible with Article 8 an eviction order justified by the fact that members of the tenant\u2019s household owned other real estate (see Galovi\u0107, decision cited above).",

The Court considers that the new rule resulting from the decisions of the Slovenian judicial authorities was aimed at ensuring a fair balance between the protection of the rights of the tenants on the one hand and those of the \u201cprevious owners\u201d on the other. In particular, the latter\u2019s ability to obtain any profit from their real estate would have been frustrated for a significant and potentially excessive length of time had they been prevented from imposing market rents not only on the former holder of the specially protected tenancy, but also, after his or her demise, on his or her close family members (see also the similar arguments developed by the Court under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in paragraph 206 above).",

The latter category included formerly privately-owned housing units, in respect of which the right of a denationalisation claimant excluded the right of the occupancy right holder to acquire the same property in kind. Only for the first category of dwellings was it possible to confer on the occupancy right holders a right of pre-emption, which was the right to purchase the property at a discount amounting to 30 per cent of its value, less the amount of own participation still not refunded and the value of own investments, which were reflected in the increased value of the dwelling. 90 per cent of that price could be paid in monthly instalments over a period of twenty years. In the event of a one-off payment within sixty days of the signing of the purchase contract, the buyer was entitled to a discount amounting to 60 per cent of the value of the property (see paragraph 19 above).",

On the other hand, the Court has an extensive body of case-law in respect of former Soviet Union countries in which it has held that socially protected tenancies amounted to property rights precisely because the legislation enacted after the fall of the communist regime provided for the unconditional privatisation of apartments or houses occupied under such tenancies (see Malinovskiy v.

Thus, the Court held that from the date of the domestic court\u2019s judgment the applicant had an established \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of acquiring a pecuniary asset.

As regards the theoretical possibility of privatising the apartment in question, the Court stated: \u201cin the absence of any comments in this respect from the applicants, the Court cannot conclude to what extent such possibility is tangible. Moreover, the Court reiterates that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee the right to acquire property.\u201d Accordingly, the applicants had failed to show that they had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

In Croatia holders of specially protected tenancies were entitled to purchase their flats under favourable conditions. The applicant complained that she was not able to do so because her socially protected tenancy had been terminated. The Court dismissed this complaint as incompatible ratione materiae with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It reiterated that when examining alleged violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on account of the termination of a specially protected tenancy in proceedings that had ended after Croatia\u2019s ratification of the Convention, it did not have to determine whether a specially protected tenancy itself could be considered a \u201cpossession\u201d protected by that Article. Rather, it had to examine whether the termination of that tenancy affected any of the rights derived from it \u2013 such as, for example, the right to purchase the flat under the Specially Protected Tenancies Act \u2013 and, more importantly, whether those derived rights could amount to a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of that provision. Having noted that \u201cpossessions\u201d could be \u201cexisting possessions\u201d or claims in respect of which an applicant could argue that he had at least a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d that they would be realised, it concluded that since neither the applicant nor her husband had ever made a request to purchase the flat within the applicable time-limit, the applicant had no claim under domestic law to purchase the flat. Thus, she did not have a sufficient proprietary interest to constitute a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see also Ga\u0107e\u0161a v. Croatia (dec.), no. 43389/02, 1 April 2008).",

Bosnia and Herzegovina (nos.\u00a012959/05, 19724/05, 47860/06, 8367/08, 9872/09 and 11706/09, \u00a7\u00a7 75-78, 3\u00a0May 2012), noting that in Bosnia and Herzegovina all occupancy right holders were as a rule entitled to get back their pre-war flats and then purchase them under very favourable terms, and that unlike the Croatian authorities, those in Bosnia and Herzegovina had consistently held that occupancy rights constituted \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article\u00a01 of Protocol No. 1. This provision was also deemed to be applicable in Brezovec v.\u00a0Croatia (no.\u00a013488/07, \u00a7\u00a7 40-46, 29 March 2011), in which, in contrast to the Ga\u0107e\u0161a case, the applicant had met the legal conditions for acquiring the right to purchase a flat (notably, he had submitted his request within the statutory time-limit and was the holder of the specially protected tenancy on the flat he wanted to buy \u2013 see also Panchenko, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049-51, concerning enforcement of a judgment granting the applicant a \u201chousing warrant\u201d for a municipal flat).

Moreover, the 2003 Housing Act introduced a \u201cnew model\u201d of substitute privatisation, according to which former occupancy right holders who agreed to vacate their rented accommodation and decided to buy another dwelling or to build a house were entitled to special compensation (up to 74% of the price of the dwelling) and to a subsidised loan (see paragraph 42 of the judgment).",

However, I am of the opinion that this might be explained by the following factors. In the first place, the 1994 amendments to the Housing Act did not provide for any time-limit within which the right to purchase under the \u201cthird model\u201d was to be exercised, thus giving the impression that the said right could be used at any time. Furthermore, one of the pre-conditions for benefitting from this model was that the \u201cprevious owner\u201d was not prepared to sell the dwelling (see paragraph 35 of the judgment). It follows that a request for purchase from the municipality could be filed only when a \u201cprevious owner\u201d had been identified and he or she had stated his or her wish not to sell the property. Now, the restitution to a \u201cprevious owner\u201d was a process which could take several years, as it necessitated denationalisation proceedings which might be followed by inheritance proceedings in the event the original owner had meanwhile passed away. It is therefore not surprising that the applicants did not use their right to purchase within a time-span of little more than five years. I refer, on this point, to the details concerning the situation of individual applicants provided for by the parties (see paragraphs 222-232 and 239-251 of the judgment).",
