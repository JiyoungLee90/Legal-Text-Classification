He said that he strongly disliked Armenians because he had lost relatives in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. As for the Armenian participants in the language course, R.S. said they had provoked and mocked him and the Azerbaijani flag on several occasions, which was why he had decided to buy an axe and kill them on the anniversary of the beginning of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region (for general background information, see Chiragov and Others v.

That is why the steps for R.S.\u2019 transfer to Azerbaijan should have been taken in full secrecy. Throughout a year, secret negotiations and correspondence were conducted under the strict control of President llham Aliyev, including with lawenforcement bodies of Hungary.

Of course, the act committed by R.S. has never been approved by the authorities of Azerbaijan, for that act he was arrested by the Hungarian court, and we believe that this corresponds to committed act. But there is one question that Azerbaijani society has discussed for several years.... At that time, the Hungarian court treated R.S. too cruelly, and imposed an inadequate punishment on him, under heavy pressure from Armenians, including the pressure of the representatives of some pro-Armenian diaspora, and foreign organizations... For a crime committed by R.S., European countries, Azerbaijan, and Armenia itself and others impose a punishment of fifteen years, and after serving half the sentence, a prisoner, falling under an amnesty for good behaviour, is released. Therefore punishment passed by Hungarian court for eight and a half years has continuously been assessed by Azerbaijani people as inadequate decision... The result is obvious, and today, after eight and a half years of serving the sentence, the Azerbaijani society regards R.S.\u2019 release as a just act. In fact, the President of Azerbaijan pardoned R.S. using both the opinion formed during that time, and possibility, created by the Azerbaijani law as well... Azerbaijani authorities and socio-political circles do not assess the act committed by R.S. as heroic... We believe that R.S. had to answer for what he did, and he did answer.

She referred to Eichmann\u2019s captors as a \u2018volunteer group\u2019. Security Council resolution 138 (1960) of 23 June 1960 implied a finding that the Israeli Government was at least aware of, and consented to, the successful plan to capture Eichmann in Argentina.

These were sufficient in the context of that case, but as a general matter, conduct will not be attributable to a State under article 11 where a State merely acknowledges the factual existence of conduct or expresses its verbal approval of it. In international controversies, States often take positions which amount to \u2018approval\u2019 or \u2018endorsement\u2019 of conduct in some general sense but do not involve any assumption of responsibility. The language of \u2018adoption\u2019, on the other hand, carries with it the idea that the conduct is acknowledged by the State as, in effect, its own conduct. Indeed, provided the State\u2019s intention to accept responsibility for otherwise non-attributable conduct is clearly indicated, article 11 may cover cases where a State has accepted responsibility for conduct of which it did not approve, which it had sought to prevent and which it deeply regretted. However such acceptance may be phrased in the particular case, the term \u2018acknowledges and adopts\u2019 in article 11 makes it clear that what is required is something more than a general acknowledgement of a factual situation, but rather that the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.",

Nor has it in any way been argued or suggested that SFOR instructed, directed or controlled such acts.

The High Contracting Parties clearly wished the Court to devote more time to cases warranting consideration on the merits, whether seen from the perspective of the legal interest of the individual applicant or considered from the broader perspective of the law of the Convention and the European public order to which it contributes (ibid., \u00a7 77).",

Romania (dec.), no. 36659/04, 1 June 2010; see also Korolev v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a025551/05, ECHR 2010-V). Inspired by the general principle of de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court (see Ladygin v. Russia (dec.), no. 35365/05, 30\u00a0August\u00a02011). The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case (see Gagliano Giorgi, cited above, \u00a7 55). The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant\u2019s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case (see Korolev, cited above, and Eon v.\u00a0France, no. 26118/10, \u00a7 34, 14 March 2013). However, the applicant\u2019s subjective perception alone cannot suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, inter alia, Mura, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a021 and\u00a024).",

That threshold is not limited to the mere \u201capproval\u201d and \u201cendorsement\u201d of the act in question, which, in the words of the ILC Commentary, \u201cdo not involve any assumption of responsibility\u201d (ibid.) \u2013 Article 11 of the Draft Articles explicitly and categorically requires the \u201cacknowledgment\u201d and \u201cadoption\u201d of that act (see paragraph 34 above). The differentiation between the mere \u201capproval\u201d and \u201cendorsement\u201d of the act in question \u2013 which, on the one hand, in and of themselves do not bring about the responsibility of a respective State for that act, and, on the other hand, its \u201cacknowledgment\u201d and \u201cadoption\u201d as a threshold that must be reached for that responsibility to be invoked, has also been endorsed in the case-law of the ICTY (see paragraph 37 above). Moreover, the two conditions \u2013 \u201cacknowledgment\u201d and \u201cadoption\u201d \u2013 are cumulative, as stems directly from the wording of Article 11 of the Draft Articles, and, in addition, require that the State \u201cacknowledges\u201d and \u201cadopts\u201d the act \u201cas its own\u201d, which again demonstrates the very stringent requirements set by that provision. The Court furthermore observes that, according to the ILC Commentary, such an act of \u201cacknowledgment\u201d and \u201cadoption\u201d must, importantly, be \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d, whether it takes the form of words or conduct (see paragraph 35 above).",

That being so, the legal question before the Court in its examination of the applicants\u2019 complaints under the substantive limb of Article 2 remains whether the very fact that the impugned measures were taken by the State of Azerbaijan allows for their categorisation \u2013 within the context of the factual circumstances, as submitted and argued by the parties, and in accordance with the standards of international law as it stood at the material time and stands today (see paragraphs 114-116 above) \u2013 in such a manner as to justify the Court in concluding that the respective State not only manifestly demonstrated its \u201capproval\u201d and \u201cendorsement\u201d of R.S.\u2019s acts, but in fact \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d \u201cacknowledged\u201d and \u201cadopted\u201d them as acts not just, strictly speaking, perpetrated by R.S., but in fact as having been perpetrated by the State itself. Having most thoroughly examined the nature and scope of the impugned measures within the overall context in which they were taken and in the light of international law, the Court is unable to conclusively find that such \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d \u201cacknowledgement\u201d and \u201cadoption\u201d indeed took place. In substance those measures can be interpreted not so much as the State\u2019s \u201cacknowledgment\u201d and \u201cadoption\u201d of R.S.\u2019s criminal acts, as such, but rather as having the purpose of publicly addressing, recognising and remedying R.S.\u2019s adverse personal, professional and financial situation, which the authorities of Azerbaijan perceived, unjustifiably in the Court\u2019s view, as being the consequence of the allegedly flawed criminal proceedings in Hungary (see paragraph 106 above). It follows that, although the Court considers it beyond any doubt that by their actions various institutions and highest officials of the State of Azerbaijan \u201capproved\u201d and \u201cendorsed\u201d the criminal acts of R.S., applying the very high threshold set by Article 11 of the Draft Articles \u2013 as interpreted and applied by international tribunals, in particular the ICJ and the ICTY (see paragraphs 36-37 above) \u2013 the Court cannot but conclude that, on the facts of the case, as presented by the applicants, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that the State of Azerbaijan \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d \u201cacknowledged\u201d and \u201cadopted\u201d \u201cas its own\u201d R.S.\u2019s deplorable acts, thus assuming, as such, responsibility for his actual killing of G.M. and the preparations for the murder of the first applicant. The Court places emphasis on the fact that this assessment is undertaken on the basis of the very stringent standards set out by the existing rules of international law, as they stood at the material time and stand today, from which the Court sees no reason or possibility to depart in the present case. Therefore, contrary to what was argued by the applicants, the present case cannot be considered fully comparable to the ICJ\u2019s United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case.",

Admittedly, in cases where crimes have been committed by police officers acting outside of their official duties, the Court has already held that the member States of the Council of Europe are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that the persons serving in these systems meet the requisite criteria (see Enukidze and Girgvliani, cited above, \u00a7 290; and Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, nos. 36146/05 and 42418/05, \u00a7 38, 12\u00a0January 2012). The Court accepts that similar standards may apply to members of the armed forces. However, having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court is not convinced that the private acts of R.S. could have been foreseen by his commanding officers or should be held imputable to the Azerbaijani State as a whole, just because that individual happened to be its agent. Indeed, the impugned acts were so flagrantly abusive and so far removed from R.S.\u2019s official status as a military officer that, on the facts of the case, his most serious criminal behaviour cannot engage the State\u2019s substantive international responsibility. What is more, nothing in the case file suggests that the procedure in Azerbaijan for the recruitment of members of the armed forces and the monitoring of their compliance with professional standards at the time that R.S. was sent on his mission \u2013 including their continued mental fitness to serve \u2013 had been inadequate.",

Indeed, pursuant to the preamble to the Transfer Convention, its main aims are to promote justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons. Moreover, in its 2014 resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly concluded that, by granting R.S. a pardon, Azerbaijan had violated the principle of good faith and the rule of law (see paragraph 41 above). Other international bodies have also deplored the treatment and glorification of R.S. upon his return to Azerbaijan (see paragraph 42 above).",

Azerbaijan could not, therefore, avoid the legal effects of its own reservation. Its decision regarding the pardon of R.S. should have been agreed with the competent authorities of Hungary. If the Court accepted that the declaration of Azerbaijan constituted an interpretative declaration and not a reservation, it would show the understanding of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be that the correct interpretation of Article 12 implied that the consent of the sentencing State must be sought.

Discrimination on account of, inter alia, a person\u2019s ethnic origin is a form of racial discrimination. Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy\u2019s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others, cited above, \u00a7 145, and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and\u00a055974/00, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2005). The Court has also held that no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person\u2019s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures (see Timishev, cited above, \u00a7 58).",

Secondly, R.S. was not only reinstated to his post in the military, he was also promoted in military rank in a public ceremony shortly after his return to Azerbaijan. Moreover, he received a flat in Baku, together with salary arrears in respect of the entire period that he had spent in prison (even though the latter measure was provided under the domestic law only in respect of acquitted persons \u2013 see paragraph 28 above).

While it is true that the President himself had never posted anything in that section, its mere existence and the reason therefor pointed to the idea that R.S. had been pardoned because his attack had been of an ethnic nature and that the granting of the pardon could be perceived as an important step in the process of legitimising and glorifying R.S.\u2019s actions.",

Such action undertaken on the part of Azerbaijan clearly goes beyond statements of approval or endorsement. The repayment of salary arrears represents a positive action undertaken by the State of Azerbaijan in an effort to compensate R.S. for the time he was serving his appropriate and lawful sentence in Hungary.",

R.S. therefore has the ability to carry out acts of the State, which, in the light of R.S.\u2019s previous commission of a heinous crime, can only be rationalised by assuming that Azerbaijan views that crime as a laudable, rewardable, legal act, and one which was not flagrantly abusive or far removed from R.S.\u2019s official status as a military officer.

Here again, it is of the utmost importance that the Court should not turn a blind eye to reality, because President Orban\u2019s statements are truly remarkable. Not only did he indicate his involvement in the process of the transfer of R.S., which normally involves the Ministry of Justice as the competent authority to transfer sentenced persons, he also blatantly expressed his view that Hungary was indeed not surprised at the outcome of R.S.\u2019s transfer. This, in consequence, demonstrates that Hungary was willing to face the risks that would arise once R.S. was transferred back to Azerbaijan.",

The mere legal possibility of a pardon for a transfer candidate such as R.S. should have triggered a duty on the part of Hungary to be extremely cautious about accepting the request from Azerbaijan regarding the transfer. This view was also expressed by the Hungarian Commissioner for Fundamental Rights who, in response to R.S.\u2019s transfer, issued a report in which he stated:",

The informal assurances issued by the Deputy Minister of Justice of the Republic of Azerbaijan merely stated that R.S. would be handled under Article 9(1)(a) of the Transfer Convention, which would imply non-conversion of sentence. The formulation is the following: \u201cin the event of the transfer of a prisoner convicted abroad, the enforcement of the sentence would be continued in Azerbaijan without any \u2018conversion\u2019 of the sentence\u201d. He then proceeded to state that the punishment of a convict serving a life sentence could only be replaced with a term of imprisonment for a specified period, and that the convict could be released on conditional parole only after serving at least 25 years of his or her prison sentence. It is crucial to observe the detail of this statement. The Azerbaijani Deputy Minister of Justice did not specify that R.S. would be subject to the punishment of a convict serving a life sentence, which would only allow parole after 25 years; he merely pointed out the existence of the legislative framework and did not apply it to R.S.\u2019s case.",

I believe the tangible facts were there, and one cannot turn a blind eye to them. Right after the commission of the crime in 2004, there had been statements from official persons, such as the Azerbaijani Ombudsman, the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan to the Council of Europe and members of parliament who had spoken favourably of R.S. and praised his patriotism. Hungary was also aware of the tense relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and could therefore deduce the special meaning of R.S. for the Azerbaijani government, as the majority themselves admit. Lastly, the statement of assurance by Azerbaijan should have been analysed closely. Such an abstract statement ought to have made the Hungarian government sceptical and they should have \u2013 taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding R.S.\u2019s case \u2013 as a minimum, required diplomatic assurances from Azerbaijan. Instead, Hungary chose to wilfully ignore the signs that R.S., a murderer convicted for an \u201cexceptionally cruel\u201d ethnically and religious-based crime, would be set free.",
