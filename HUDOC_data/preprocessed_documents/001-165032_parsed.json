There can only be one answer to that and it is clearly in the affirmative. Whether domestic law did or did not provide machinery whereby an applicant could request the authorities to act in this regard is utterly without significance. Consequently, it is also without significance whether, as a matter of domestic law, the applicant\u2019s requests for reopening were rightly or wrongly determined. Once the authorities had become aware of the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment they were duty-bound to act without any prompting; they should have proceeded, without further ado, to carry out an Article 3-compliant investigation, the meaning of which is made abundantly clear by firmly established and undisputed case-law.

The fact that the parties have chosen to argue the case from that angle is no reason at all to take that path when, moreover, to do so may be at variance with the Convention and create uncertainty in a particularly sensitive area. The point I am trying to make is illustrated by paragraph 120 of the judgment, where the Court relies on a general rule against reopening and then finds reason to depart from it:",

In the leading case cited in the Court\u2019s strike-out decision, namely Tahsin Acar v.

The present case is not, as I see it, a case where a subsequent application raises or supposedly raises a new issue in relation to a previous application, as for example in Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v.\u00a0Switzerland (no.\u00a02) ([GC], no. 32772/02, ECHR 2009); nor is it a case of a continuing violation divisible into temporal parts for which compensation is adjudged separately, as in Ivan\u0163oc and Others v.

All those cases involved just one complaint, complete in its own right, and awarding compensation for it was not incompatible with awarding compensation in another case with which it had an affinity or connection, irrespective of which came to the Court first.

I cannot but see this judgment as a departure from case-law on the status of complaints that have been dealt with by the Court in a final judgment or decision. This standing case-law concerns not only Article\u00a06 complaints (as in Fischer v. Austria (dec.), no. 27569/02, ECHR 2003VI; Komanicky v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 13677/03, 1 March 2005; and \u00d6calan v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 5980/07, 6 July 2010). In Egmez v.\u00a0Cyprus ((dec.), no.\u00a012214/07, 18 September 2012), the Court did not find any new events that could revive a procedural obligation under Article 3 and thus trigger a possible breach of that provision. That path should have been followed in this case. The reasoning of the Court now accepted by the majority could apply also to applications that have been determined by the Court in a judgment (and not a strike-out decision), and where the State, in the view of the applicant, has failed to comply with the earlier judgment finding a violation. In other words, if the Court finds in a judgment that the State has failed to conduct an effective investigation in violation of Article\u00a02 or 3 of the Convention, and if the State subsequently does not ensure that a new investigation is carried out meeting the requirements of the Convention, the applicant may lodge a fresh application and the Court may find a fresh violation.",

The applicant lodged complaints of ill-treatment on 8 October 2001. More than five years later, on 22\u00a0February 2007, the Government were given notice of the application and on 30 April 2008 they issued a unilateral declaration admitting an Article\u00a03 violation and awarding the applicant compensation for it. On\u00a010\u00a0February 2009 the Court accepted this unilateral declaration by the Government and struck out the case in respect of the ill-treatment covered by the declaration. In accordance with that declaration the applicant received 4,500 euros (EUR). Subsequently, on 1 December 2012, the Court found violations concerning the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention following the above-mentioned arrest, as well as a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 because the applicant, while in detention, had not been given the opportunity to appear in person before the Supreme Court during the proceedings in his case. He was awarded EUR\u00a05,000. All these complaints were already part of the original application in 2001. However, in 2010 the applicant reiterated his complaints in a new application and included a fresh complaint to the effect that the investigation into his ill-treatment had not resumed after the acceptance of the unilateral declaration, despite his efforts to that end at domestic level. On 9 October 2012 the Court declared the old complaints partly inadmissible, but relinquished jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber with regard to the complaint concerning the decision not to resume the investigation into the applicant\u2019s ill-treatment after the acceptance of the unilateral declaration. Three out of the five Sections of the Court have, in one way or another, dealt with the applicant\u2019s complaints following the events of 25 April 1998, and now the Grand Chamber has as well. The majority of the Grand Chamber has still not succeeded in bringing this case to an end. Instead it looks as if a perpetuum mobile of never-ending court proceedings has been set in motion. What purpose is being served? Is it the theoretical notion of a continuing obligation?

It is for the Court to ensure that the unilateral declaration observes the requisite minimum in terms of clarity and precision. In particular, in the present case, if the Court considered that the respondent State had a duty to reopen the criminal investigation, it would have been preferable for it not to accept a unilateral declaration that did not contain an express clause to that effect.
