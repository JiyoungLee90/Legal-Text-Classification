The Constitutional Court holds that in the reasoning given for the decisions challenged by the respective appeals, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal gave detailed, clear and precise explanations in that regard. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be reached that the application of the relevant legal provisions was in any way arbitrary ... Moreover, the allegations made by the appellant as regards its financial situation, which are repeated in its appeal, were examined in detail in the challenged judgments and clear reasoning has been provided as to why those allegations cannot lead to a finding of a different solution in the instant legal case and the Constitutional Court, given the circumstances of the present case, does not consider that reasoning to be arbitrary.\u201d",
