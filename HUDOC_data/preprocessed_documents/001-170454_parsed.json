It calculated the amount on the basis of documents submitted by the applicant. In the note, the market value of the vehicle was set at EUR\u00a034,000.

The representative of the State argued, inter alia, that the customs duties on the car in question had not been paid and that therefore it could not have been used any way. Once the applicant had paid the duties his debt had been cleared and the car had been able to enter the domestic market. They also argued that the customs proceedings had not taken an unduly long time as they had lasted only from 27 May 2003 to 7 July 2003. The applicant argued, inter alia, that the order which had led to the seizure of the car had been unlawful and that it therefore gave rise to a liability on the part of the State for any damage resulting from it. He also submitted that the Customs Office\u2019s seizure order had been issued only on 27 May 2003 and was thus irrelevant to the question of liability for damage. The applicant also noted that he had not been found guilty in any of the proceedings and had not done anything wrong. He stated that the car that had been seized had been remodelled in his own repair shop and that he had not yet finished the remodelling or necessary paperwork by the time of the seizure. Such a process included obtaining new approval papers and the registration of the vehicle as a special vehicle. He pointed out that he had finished that process and obtained all the necessary documents once the car had been returned to him.",

The Court found that there was no dispute about the fact that the car had been seized in criminal proceedings. The court noted that it was not bound by the findings of the criminal court that the seizure had been unlawful, but, basing its conclusion on its own assessment, it concluded that the seizure had been ordered on the basis of gossip and newspaper article and that all the other information relating to the alleged offences had been obtained on the basis of the unwarranted seizure. The search warrant had been general and lacking in precision and therefore could not be subjected to any scrutiny. On the basis of such considerations it found that the seizure had not complied with the requirements set out in the Criminal Procedure Act (see paragraph 38 below) and had therefore been unlawful. However, the court found that the causal link between the unlawful seizure and the damage incurred by the applicant had been broken because the applicant would in any event have been unable to use the car for several reasons. Firstly, the applicant, as a professional driver and owner of the repair shop, should have known that any remodelling of the car required a new technical inspection and registration, which the applicant had not done before the seizure. Secondly, no customs duties had been paid on parts that had been imported and then used in the car. The seized car, which had thus not been properly registered or imported in compliance with customs regulations, could not have been used in traffic and the applicant could not have raced with it. The applicant was ordered to pay the opposing party\u2019s costs of EUR 3,462.19.",

Until 27\u00a0May 2003 (see paragraph 13 above), when the seizure order was issued by the customs authorities, the only basis for the seizure of the car was the unlawful order issued in the criminal proceedings.

In particular, the Ljubljana District Court failed to state with any clarity how long the customs procedure and registration would have taken (see paragraph 31 above) and why that task could not have been completed in time for the applicant to use his car in the competition. Even assuming that the applicant had failed to pay the customs duties and that his car had not been properly registered at the time of the police seizure, the first competition after the seizure was not due to be held for three months (see paragraph 32 above). In that connection, the Court notes that the subsequent customs proceedings lasted merely about a month and that the applicant was cooperative in these proceedings and paid the duties within three days of the delivery of the decision (see paragraph 18 above). He also subsequently obtained all the necessary documents to use the car as a special vehicle (see paragraph 19 above). Although that only happened six months after the release of the car, it cannot be ignored that the racing season was at that point coming to an end and the applicant, who had rented a replacement car, was thus no longer under pressure to have the car ready as soon as possible (see paragraph 10 above). The Court therefore finds no reason to conclude, and none have been adduced by the Government or domestic courts, that the applicant would have been unable to see to his legal obligations, namely the customs and registration duties, and consequently would have been able to use his car during the racing season, had it not been for the unlawful seizure.",

It observes that in the instant case the applicant used all the available remedies against the judgment dismissing his claim for compensation, including a constitutional appeal.

In those circumstances the Court considers that the right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions was in issue, even if only implicitly, in the proceedings before the Slovenian Constitutional Court and that the legal arguments put forward by the applicant in that court included a complaint connected with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The complaint in question was therefore raised, at least in substance, before the Constitutional Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Chroust v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no.\u00a04295/03, ECHR 2006XV).

While it might be that the value given for his car in the customs proceedings was below its real value or that it concerned only the parts of the car which had been imported, it was for the applicant to clarify that to the Court.
