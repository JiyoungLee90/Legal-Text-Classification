In this context, \u201cpressure\u201d includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation, but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from using a Convention remedy. The issue of whether or not contacts between the authorities and an applicant amount to unacceptable practices from the standpoint of Article\u00a034 must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. In the context of the questioning of applicants about their applications under the Convention by authorities exercising a domestic investigative function, this will depend on whether the procedures adopted have involved a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure which may be regarded as hindering the exercise of the right of individual application (see, e.g. the Aydin v. Turkey judgment of 25\u00a0September 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI, pp.\u00a01899-1990, \u00a7\u00a7 115-117; Salman v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no.\u00a021986/93, \u00a7\u00a0130 with further references, ECHR 2000VII).
