In order to staunch the endless flow of fugitives, the GDR built the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 and reinforced all the security measures along the border between the two German States, in particular by installing anti-personnel mines and automatic-fire systems (Selbstschussanlagen). Many people who tried to cross the border to reach the West subsequently lost their lives, either after triggering anti-personnel mines or automatic-fire systems or after being shot by East-German border guards. The official death toll, according to the FRG\u2019s prosecuting authorities, was 264. Higher figures have been advanced by other sources, such as the \u201c13 August Working Party\u201d (Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August), which speaks of 938 dead. In any event, the exact number of persons killed is very difficult to determine, since incidents at the border were kept secret by the GDR authorities.",

In addition, the principle of the rule of law includes, as one of the guiding ideas behind the Basic Law, the requirement of objective justice... In the sphere of the criminal law, these concerns relating to the rule of law are reflected in the principle that no penalty may be imposed where there is no guilt.

In the interests of legal certainty and justice, it provides that in the sphere of the criminal law, which permits extremely serious interference with personal rights by the State, only the legislature may determine what offences shall be punishable. Article 103 \u00a7 2 of the Basic Law thus reinforces the rule of law by strictly reserving law-making to Parliament... The citizen\u2019s trust is earned by the fact that Article 103 \u00a7 2 gives him the assurance that the State will punish only acts which, at the time when they were committed, had been defined by Parliament as criminal offences, and for which it had prescribed specific penalties. That allows the citizen to regulate his conduct, on his own responsibility, in such a way as to avoid committing a punishable offence.

In the sphere of the criminal law grounds of justification may also be derived from customary law or case-law.

That rule is a consequence of the Federal Republic\u2019s assumption of responsibility for the administration of criminal justice in the territory of the GDR; it is accordingly compatible with Article 103 \u00a7 2 of the Basic Law, since citizens of the former GDR are tried according to the criminal law that was applicable to them at the material time, the law of the Federal Republic in force at the time of conviction being applied only if it is more lenient. However, this legal situation, in which the Federal Republic has to exercise its authority in criminal matters on the basis of the law of a State that neither practised democracy and the separation of powers nor respected fundamental rights, may lead to a conflict between the mandatory rule-of-law precepts of the Basic Law and the absolute prohibition of retroactiveness in Article 103 \u00a7 2 thereof, which, as has been noted, derives its justification in terms of the rule of law [rechtsstaatliche Rechtfertigung] in the special trust reposed in criminal statutes when these have been enacted by a democratic legislature required to respect fundamental rights. This special basis of trust no longer obtains where the other State statutorily defines certain acts as serious criminal offences while excluding the possibility of punishment by allowing grounds of justification covering some of those acts and even by requiring and encouraging them notwithstanding the provisions of written law, thus gravely breaching the human rights generally recognised by the international community.

It states that a court must disregard a justification if it purports to exonerate the intentional killing of persons who sought nothing more than to cross the intra-German border unarmed and without endangering interests generally recognised as enjoying legal protection, because such a justification, which puts the prohibition on crossing the border above the right to life, must remain ineffective on account of a manifest and intolerable infringement of elementary precepts of justice and of human rights protected under international law.

Admittedly, the wording of the GDR\u2019s legal provisions, in so far as they regulated the use of firearms at the intra-German border, corresponded to that of the Federal Republic\u2019s provisions on the use of force [unmittelbarer Zwang]. But the findings in the impugned judgments show that, superimposed on those legal provisions, there were orders which left no room for limitation of the use of firearms according to the principle of proportionality, and which conveyed to the border guards on the spot the view of their superiors \u2013 and ultimately of the National Defence Council \u2013 that border violators were to be \u2018annihilated\u2019 if they could not be prevented from crossing the border by other means. Through that subordination of the individual\u2019s right to life to the State\u2019s interest in preventing border crossings the written law was eclipsed by the requirements of political expediency.

W.] both knew, when firing the fatal shots, that the fugitive was likely to be mortally wounded and willingly accepted that risk.

Criminal responsibility was thus established in a constitutionally unobjectionable manner. That applies also inasmuch as the requirements for acting in obedience to orders (Handeln auf Befehl) were held not to have been satisfied. The fact that the Federal Court of Justice, like the Regional Court, based its examination on Article\u00a05\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 of the Military Criminal Code, as interpreted by the highest courts, and treated it as being identical in content with Article 258 of the Criminal Code of the GDR is a matter for the criminal courts since it concerns the interpretation and application of the criminal law. On the basis of their findings of fact, those courts \u2013 likewise unobjectionably from a constitutional point of view \u2013 assumed that the ground for exempting the appellant from punishment could be excluded only under the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Military Criminal Code, because the unlawfulness of the order to use firearms at the border was obvious in the circumstances known to the appellant. According to the settled case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, that condition is satisfied where the breach of criminal law is clear beyond doubt; soldiers are not under any duty to check or make inquiries. What is decisive is rather whether the breach of the criminal law was so obvious that it was plain without further thought or inquiry to an average soldier possessed of the information which the recipient of the order had (cf. BGHSt 39 at 168 and 188 et seq.).",

Admittedly, misgivings as to whether the breach of criminal law was clear beyond all doubt might arise from the fact that the GDR leadership, exercising the authority of the State, broadened the justification intended to cover the conduct of the border guards and thereby made that justification available to them. That being so, it is not self-evident that the dividing-line between criminal and non-criminal conduct would be crystal clear to the average soldier, and it would be inconsistent with the principle of guilt to hold that the breach of criminal law was obvious to the soldiers on the sole basis that there had \u2013 objectively \u2013 been a serious breach of human rights; it must therefore be shown in greater detail why the individual soldier, in view of his education, indoctrination and other circumstances, was in a position to recognise that his action undoubtedly contravened the criminal law. The criminal courts did not discuss the facts in detail from this point of view in the initial proceedings. They did, however, show that the killing of an unarmed fugitive by sustained fire (Dauerfeuer) was, in the circumstances they had found, such a dreadful and wholly unjustifiable act that it must have been immediately apparent and obvious even to an indoctrinated person that it breached the principle of proportionality and the elementary prohibition on the taking of human life. The other explanations given by those courts likewise show sufficiently clearly, in the light of all the reasons stated in the judgments and the reference to statements made in the earlier decisions of 3\u00a0November 1992 (BGHSt 39 at 1) and 25 March 1993 (BGHSt\u00a039\u00a0at\u00a0168) concerning cases of the same type, that the principle of guilt has been respected.",

From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law. In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts\u2019 interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court thus indicated that when speaking of \u2018law\u2019 Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see ... the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72,\u00a7 37).",

Therefore, any person who knowingly kills a member of the civilian population as part of a general plan should be considered responsible for the crime in question. An interpretation contrary to the above would lead to the absurd result that only the organisers of mass murders may be responsible for crimes against humanity, but not the individuals who by a single murder knowingly execute the relevant plan.",

Nor am I fully convinced that persons in the applicant\u2019s position were envisaged by the democratically elected parliament of the GDR, which in the summer of 1990 requested the legislature of the united Germany \u201cto ensure that criminal prosecutions would be brought in respect of the injustices committed by the SED\u201d (see paragraph 87). The fact that the applicant volunteered to serve in the army for three years does not show any particular allegiance to the inhuman border-control system. As can be seen from the judgments of the trial court and the Federal Court of Justice, he appears to have done this reluctantly and at the insistence of his father, a professional soldier. Thus his voluntary service is an indication rather of a lack of independence and maturity than of any particular commitment to the system. However that may be, his decision to do three years\u2019 military service did not in my view increase the foreseeability required by Article 7 in any legally relevant manner.",

Thus it would arguably have been possible to justify the conviction of those responsible for that policy also with reference to paragraph 2 of Article 7. Whether an individual act, such as the one in issue here, was able to trigger responsibility for a crime against humanity is, however, a different question. Regardless of what the answer to that question might be today, I can find no authority for the proposition that the act committed by the applicant in 1972 was at that time a crime against humanity within the meaning of the Nuremberg principles. That being so, I also conclude that Resolution 95(I) of the UN General Assembly (see paragraph 79 of the judgment), which applies to acts covered by those principles, has no direct bearing in the present case.",

Thus in a 1988 decision (BGHSt 35, 379) the German Federal Court of Justice acquitted a customs officer who had fired in a life-threatening manner at a person on a motorcycle trying to escape controls at the German-Dutch border, on the ground that he was objectively entitled to suspect that the persons fleeing were serious drug offenders or had a comparable reason for fleeing. Although one should not draw a parallel between that case and the applicant\u2019s case, the Federal Court\u2019s decision of 1988 is nevertheless one indication that the right to life had not become of such overriding importance as to justify the conclusion that the present applicant\u2019s act was, in 1972, criminal \u201caccording to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations\u201d.
