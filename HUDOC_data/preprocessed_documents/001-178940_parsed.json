However, although the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in assessing the risk of an accused absconding or reoffending, the need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view, taking into consideration only the gravity of the offence. Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see\u00a0Topekhin v. Russia, no. 78774/13, \u00a7\u00a0104, 10 May 2016, with further references).

The Court recalls in this regard that the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the alleged criminal activities of an applicant may be accepted as the basis for his or her detention at the initial stages of the proceedings and in some circumstances also for subsequent prolongations of the detention. It is also accepted that in cases (as the present one), involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, including nine victims, residing in the Moscow Region, nine thousand kilometers away from the place of the investigation, as well as the necessity to determine the facts and degree of the alleged responsibility of each of the co-accused, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for the applicant\u2019s detention during the period of the investigation (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, \u00a7 147, 13\u00a0April 2017, with further references).",

Poland, no.\u00a017584/04, \u00a7\u00a095, 4 May 2006). The Court is mindful, in this context, of the fact, that Mr\u00a0K., the applicant\u2019s co-accused, who had given incriminating statements against the applicant, was found dead in his prison cell and that some of the gang members absconded and were at liberty (see paragraphs 7 and 11 above). The Court, therefore, concludes that the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice and exerting pressure on the victims and witnesses was very high and it justified his pre-trial detention.",

It took the applicant and his lawyers another six months to study the case-file comprising nineteen volumes, 200-300 pages long each. In the absence of any arguments to the contrary, the Court considers that this protraction could not be attributed to the authorities, especially given that his co-defendants generally completed studying the entire case-file in no more than three weeks (see, for similar reasoning, Mkhitaryan v. Russia, no. 46108/11, \u00a7 99, 5\u00a0February 2013). Lastly, the Court observes that the trial in the applicant\u2019s case have been completed in approximately fifteen months, a duration, which also seems reasonable, taking into account the objective difficulties of trial by jury, significant volume of evidence presented by the parties, the number of co-defendants, and the complexity of the case itself. The applicant did not argue that there had been any protractions in the conduct of the trial. The Court therefore concludes that the authorities displayed special diligence in handling the applicant\u2019s case.",

However, it observes, that they were the only eye-witnesses confirming the applicant\u2019s involvement in the offences against Mr\u00a0L. Their statements were, thus, both sole and decisive evidence on which the relevant part of the applicant\u2019s conviction was based and there were no counterbalancing factors in place to compensate for their absence at the trial and for the difficulties caused to the defence by the admission of their untested statements as evidence (such as pre-trial confrontation interviews or an opportunity to put questions to Mr L. at the trial stage indirectly).",

The Court reiterates in this connection that a higher degree of scrutiny should be applied to assessment of such statements, because the position in which the accomplices find themselves while testifying is different from that of ordinary witnesses. They do not testify under oath, that is, without any affirmation of the truth of their statements which could have rendered them punishable for perjury for willfully making untrue statements. In such situations, for the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention to be respected on account of the admissibility of a guilty plea from a co-accused, such a plea should only be admitted to establish the fact of a commission of a crime by a pleading person, and not the applicant, and a judge should make it clear to the jury that the guilty plea by itself did not prove that the applicant was involved in that crime (see Vladimir Romanov v. Russia, no. 41461/02, \u00a7 102, 24 July 2008).",
