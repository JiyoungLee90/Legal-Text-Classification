Moreover, the applicant couple had three daughters who still lived in Baghdad and who were not harassed. The Board acknowledged that the applicants had been the victims of severe violence and harassment but observed that they had not sought any protection from the domestic authorities in Baghdad. Although it was true that al-Qaeda had infiltrated the domestic authorities, this had to a great extent diminished. Therefore, the Board concluded that the applicants had not made probable that they would be unable to seek the domestic authorities\u2019 protection.

Since the publication of UNHCR\u2019s 2012 Iraq Eligibility Guidelines and the 2012 Aide M\u00e9moire relating to Palestinian refugees in Iraq, Iraq has experienced a new surge in violence between Iraqi security forces (ISF) and Kurdish forces (Peshmerga) on the one hand and the group \u201cIslamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham\u201d (hereafter ISIS), which operates both in Iraq and Syria, and affiliated armed groups on the other hand. Civilians are killed and wounded every day as a result of this surge of violence, including suicide attacks and car bombs, shelling, airstrikes, and executions. As a result of advances by ISIS, the Government of Iraq is reported to have lost full or partial control over considerable parts of the country\u2019s territory, particularly in Al-Anbar, Ninewa, Salah Al-Din, Kirkuk and Diyala governorates. Although the ISF and Kurdish forces, supported by US airstrikes, have recently regained control over some localities, mostly along the internal boundaries with the Kurdistan Region, overall frontlines remain fluid. The conflict, which re-escalated in Al-Anbar governorate in January 2014 and since then spread to other governorates, has been labelled as a non international armed conflict. Casualties so far in 2014 represent the highest total since the height of sectarian conflict in 2006-2007.",

As the situation in Iraq remains highly fluid and volatile, and since all parts of the country are reported to have been affected, directly or indirectly, by the ongoing crisis, UNHCR urges States not to forcibly return persons originating from Iraq until tangible improvements in the security and human rights situation have occurred. In the current circumstances, many persons fleeing Iraq are likely to meet the 1951 Convention criteria for refugee status. When, in the context of the adjudication of an individual case of a person originating from Iraq, 1951 Convention criteria are found not to apply, broader refugee criteria as contained in relevant regional instruments or complementary forms of protection are likely to apply. In the current circumstances, with massive new internal displacement coupled with a large-scale humanitarian crisis, mounting sectarian tensions and reported access restrictions, particularly into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, UNHCR does in principle not consider it appropriate for States to deny persons from Iraq international protection on the basis of the applicability of an internal flight or relocation alternative.

However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0124-125, ECHR\u00a02008-...).",

Turkey [GC], nos.\u00a046827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the illtreatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, \u00a7 40).",

It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker\u2019s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and\u00a0Akaziebie v.

The Court notes that the applicants did not mention the recording at all before the Migration Board, despite being interviewed several times. The applicant husband submitted the recording for the first time with his written submission to the Migration Court on 1\u00a0February\u00a02012.

It was only in his appeal to the Migration Court of Appeal and his request to the Migration Board for a reexamination that he changed his explanation and stated that the debate had taken place in February 2010, and it was only in his observations of 13\u00a0January 2013 to the Court that he submitted that, due to the debate, he now also risks being persecuted by the Iraqi authorities. In so far as this issue has been presented before the Swedish authorities, the latter were not convinced that the recording was from February 2010 or that the applicants would be unable to obtain protection from the Iraqi authorities because the applicant husband publicly criticised them during the debate. In addition, before the Court the Government have pointed out that when opening the DVD on a computer, it can be seen that the file was last amended on 4\u00a0March 2008. The DVD has been submitted to the Court as well, and in so far as the applicants have exhausted domestic remedies as to this submission, the Court cannot but agree with the Swedish authorities, that the applicants have failed to substantiate that the recording was made after 4 March 2008 and notably that the applicant husband now also risks being persecuted by the Iraqi authorities on account of this.",

In 2005, the applicant\u2019s brother was kidnapped by al-Qaeda because of the applicant\u2019s alleged collaboration with the Americans. The applicants then fled to Jordan and stayed there until December 2006. Some time thereafter a bomb was placed next to their house (the bomb did not explode as it was detected in time) and the perpetrator had later confessed that he had been paid by al-Qaeda to kill the applicant husband. In January 2008 the applicants had nevertheless returned to Baghdad. In October 2008 the applicant husband and his daughter had been shot at while driving. In this incident the daughter was killed. Subsequently, the family started to move around in Baghdad in order to avoid being killed. Allegedly, a masked terrorist group came looking for the applicant husband on 10\u00a0September 2011 at 10 p.m. (see \u00a7 16 of the judgment).
