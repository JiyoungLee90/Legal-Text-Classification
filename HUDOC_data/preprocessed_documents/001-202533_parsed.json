It further observed that the new tax audit of the applicant had been carried out in May 2004, after the Varna Regional Court had found in January 2004 that the taxes imposed by the 2001 tax assessment had been charged in breach of the statutory rules. The SAC went on to say that even though the applicant had not sought judicial review, the subsequent tax audit resulting in the 2004 tax assessment had in fact revoked the 2001 decision. The 2004 tax assessment which charged the applicant with the same type of taxes, on the same legal grounds and for the same period as the 2001 decision had been set aside because the courts had found that the taxes had not been due by the taxpayer (see paragraph\u00a011 above). Accordingly, the sums paid by the applicant under both the 2001 and the 2004 tax assessments had to be returned to him. The SAC thus quashed the decision of 13 December 2007 refusing to return to the applicant the sums collected under the 2001 tax assessment.

They argued, in particular, that the courts\u2019 conclusions that the 2001 tax assessment had been replaced by the 2004 tax assessment had been wrong and in breach of the statutory provisions. The tax authorities further maintained that the 2001 tax assessment remained valid since the applicant had failed to lodge a timely appeal against it (see paragraph 9 above).

The proceedings ultimately ended on 14 March 2012 when the Varna District Court dismissed the tax authorities\u2019 claim. The court checked for the presence of any of the possible grounds for nullity of judicial decisions and noted in that regard that the SAC\u2019s judgment of 28 November 2008 had been given by a three-judge panel within the SAC\u2019s jurisdictional competence; it had been delivered in writing and had been signed by the judicial panel; its reasons as well as the judgment\u2019s operative part indicated clearly the court\u2019s will. The Varna District Court\u2019s concluded that the arguments relied upon by the tax authorities were ill-founded since they could not entail the nullity of the SAC\u2019s final judgment of 28 November 2008. The ruling of 14 March 2002 was not appealed against and entered into force on 10 April 2012.",

Later, with its final judgments of November 2008 and December 2008 the SAC reiterated that the taxes charged to the applicant had been unduly collected. They had therefore to be returned to him by the tax authorities, together with interest, through the procedure for offset or refund (see paragraphs\u00a03235 above).",

In the case of Buffalo (cited above) the Court found that the prolonged unavailability of the tax that had been unduly paid by the applicant company had had a considerable impact on its financial situation. This, coupled with the lack of an effective remedy to expedite reimbursement and the uncertainty as to when the rebates would be paid, had upset the fair balance that had to be maintained between the general interest of the community and the applicant company\u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions (see Buffalo S.r.l. in liquidation, cited above, \u00a7 32 and \u00a7 37).",

While the Court does not doubt that the authorities should be afforded sufficient leeway to perform their duties in the area of fiscal policy so as to secure the payment of taxes by using the available legal means, it has not been demonstrated that their repeated actions, all of which had to be dismissed, were warranted in the circumstances of this case.",

They merely repeated their submissions which the SAC had already carefully considered and ultimately rejected in the judicial review proceedings (see paragraphs 15-16 and 18 above) and did not raise any of the legal grounds for nullity under domestic law, namely unlawfully constituted judicial panel, lack of jurisdiction of the court, lack of signatures or absolute incomprehensibility of the judgment (see paragraphs 21 and 38 above). The Government has not explained, in these circumstances, how the tax authorities\u2019 initiative to bring proceedings for nullity had any prospect of success. Nevertheless, the tax authorities pursued their actions with persistence, thereby forcing the applicant to participate in several pointless sets of proceedings (see paragraphs 18-22 above). As a result, his requests for a refund were stayed pending the outcome of the proceedings for nullity (see paragraph\u00a017 above). The time that elapsed from the delivery of the SAC\u2019s final judgments in 2008 recognising the applicant\u2019s right to be refunded the unduly paid taxes, until their payout in 2012, was more than three and a half years.",
