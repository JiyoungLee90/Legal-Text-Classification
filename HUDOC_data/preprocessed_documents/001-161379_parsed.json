The challenge was brought by two nationals of Ukraine and one of Moldova and their Russian spouses. The non-Russian complainants had either been refused a residence permit or declared undesirable in Russia on account of their HIV-positive status. The Constitution Court held that the migration laws can lawfully restrict access to Russia by non-Russian nationals whose medical condition may jeopardise public health and pose a threat to national security. It acknowledged the contemporary medical consensus that HIV does not pose a threat to public health because it is not transmitted merely by the presence of the infected individual in the country or through casual contact, airborne particles, food or water. The Constitutional Court noted, on the strength of evidence submitted by the complainants, that law-enforcement authorities did not systematically take into account its position in the matter, as expressed in its previous decisions of 12 May 2006 and 4 June 2013 (see paragraph 24 above).

Neither party contests this.

The notion of the \u201cfamily\u201d in Article\u00a08 is not confined solely to marriage-based relationships, and may encompass other de facto \u201cfamily\u201d ties where the parties are living together outside of marriage. This includes relationships formed by cohabiting same-sex couples living in a stable de facto partnership (see Schalk and Kopf v.\u00a0Austria, no. 30141/04, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2010; K. and T. v.

Furthermore, as Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world, and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8. Regardless of the existence or otherwise of a \u201cfamily life\u201d, the expulsion of a settled migrant therefore constitutes an interference with his or her right to respect for private life (see \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2006XII, and Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2008).

The national authorities had had regard to the facts that the applicants had arrived in Russia as adults, and could not be seen as longterm or settled migrants, and that they had not sought medical assistance in Russia. The Government considered that the national authorities had not exceeded their margin of appreciation in the matter of issuing residence permits. The number of States requiring an HIV-negative certificate as a condition for taking up residence has admittedly decreased, but a few States have retained this requirement. Moreover, since 17\u00a0January 2014 the United Kingdom has required Russian nationals to produce a negative tuberculosis test as part of their long-term visa application.

Besides, tuberculosis is a treatable condition and the travel restriction is not permanent or irreversible for the affected individual.

The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice, with lasting consequences resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs (see Kiyutin, cited above, \u00a7 63, and Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no.\u00a038832/06, \u00a7\u00a042, 20 May 2010). The Court has found that people living with HIV have to face a whole host of problems, not only medical but also professional, social, personal and psychological, and to confront deeply rooted prejudice even from among highly educated people (see I.B. v. Greece, cited above, \u00a7 80). The prejudice was born out of ignorance about the routes of transmission of HIV/Aids, and has stigmatised and marginalised those who live with the virus. Consequently, the Court has held that people living with HIV are a vulnerable group and that the State should be afforded only a narrow margin of appreciation in choosing measures that single out this group for differential treatment on account of their health status (see I.B. v. Greece, \u00a7\u00a081, and Kiyutin, \u00a7\u00a064, both cited above).",

Shortly after it gave the Kiyutin judgment on 10\u00a0March 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, at its 95th plenary meeting on 10 June 2011, the \u201cPolitical Declaration on HIV and AIDS\u201d, by which the heads and representatives of UN member States declared their solemn commitment to end the HIV/Aids epidemic by bold and decisive action, including in particular identification and review of any remaining HIV-related restrictions on aliens\u2019 entry, stay and residence in order to eliminate them (paragraph 79 of the Political Declaration). In the ensuing period up to the present day, the number of countries, territories and areas worldwide that do not impose any HIV-specific restrictions on entry, stay or residence has grown from 124 to 142. Conversely, the number of countries that maintain such restrictions has fallen from 52 to 35 (see paragraph 64 above, and compare with Kiyutin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a037). It is at the European level that the progress has been most significant: in the wake of the Kiyutin judgment, Armenia and Moldova brought their legislation into compliance with the Court\u2019s findings and abolished HIV-specific travel restrictions, while Andorra and Slovakia clarified that they did not apply any such restrictions (see paragraph 65 above). As things currently stand, Russia is the only member State of the Council of Europe and one of sixteen States world-wide that enforces deportation of HIV-positive non-nationals (see\u00a0paragraph 64 above). Since the expulsion of HIV-positive individuals does not reflect an established European consensus, and has no support in other member States, the respondent State is under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for the differential treatment of which the applicants complained that they had been victims (see Kiyutin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a065).",

The example of tuberculosis-related restrictions which the Government gave in their submissions is particularly apposite here. Tuberculosis has no symptoms in its latent form but may progress over time to the active phase and be spread through the air when people who have active tuberculosis cough or sneeze. Russia has an extremely high incidence of tuberculosis, with an estimated rate of 114 cases per 100,000 population, as compared with seventeen\u00a0cases in the United Kingdom (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2014).

The Court is bound to observe that the Russian court of cassation based its decision justifying the exclusion order against the applicant V.V. on a manifestly inaccurate premise, namely that he may transmit the infection to others by using shared facilities in a student dormitory (see paragraph 45 above and compare with I.B. v.

In that case, the expulsion order against Mr\u00a0Ndangoya followed on his conviction of criminal assault on people with whom he had had unprotected sexual intercourse without disclosing his HIV-positive status. In the instant case, the applicants have been living with their families or partners and they have not been suspected of, or charged with, any comparable acts, even though Russian law treats any form of behaviour by an HIVpositive person who is aware of his or her HIV status and who exposes others to the risk of HIV infection as a criminal offence punishable by deprivation of liberty (see Kiyutin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a027 and\u00a068). The case of V.V. is different from the others, in that the domestic authorities deduced an increased risk of unsafe behaviour on his part from his refusal to name his former partners. The Court is not persuaded that the risk was convincingly established. It observes at the outset that this particular ground appeared rather late in the proceedings: it was not part of the decision declaring the applicant\u2019s presence undesirable that referred solely to the medical certificates showing the applicant\u2019s diagnosis (see\u00a0paragraph 41 above), and was put forward for the first time by the court of appeal which overturned the initial decision in the applicant\u2019s favour (see\u00a0paragraph 44 above). The applicant could not reasonably expect that a new ground for his exclusion would be brought up, as concealing names of contacts by an HIV-positive person constitutes an administrative offence in Russian law (see paragraph 56 above), of which he had never been accused or found guilty. He mounted a defence to that charge in his cassation appeal, indicating that he had disclosed his HIV status to his former partners and that he was living in a stable relationship, yet the Regional Court shifted the burden of proof on to him, holding that he had to adduce evidence, above and beyond his own declaration, to clear himself of that allegation (see\u00a0paragraph 45 above). Besides, the Regional Court based its decision on another novel ground, namely that the applicant could transmit HIV by using shared dormitory facilities, which, as the Court observed above, was scientifically false. In sum, the Court finds that the alleged risk of unsafe behaviour on the part of V.V. amounted to nothing more than conjecture not supported with facts or evidence. Nor has any public health risk been shown to exist in Mr\u00a0Khalupa\u2019s case, in which the Migration Service described that risk as \u201creal\u201d, without elaborating on why it was so (see paragraph\u00a020 above).",

In Kiyutin, the Court found that the impugned provisions of Russian law, including section\u00a07(1)(13) of the Foreign Nationals Act and section 11(2) of the HIV Prevention Act, are of an imperative nature, leaving no room for an individualised assessment based on the facts of a particular case (see\u00a0Kiyutin, cited above, \u00a7 72). In the cases of Mr Novruk and Ms\u00a0Ostrovskaya, as in Kiyutin, the courts refused their applications for residence permits solely by reference to the Foreign Nationals Act, without taking into account their ties with family members in Russia. Mr\u00a0Khalupa was unable to obtain a new Convention-compliant assessment of the exclusion decisions for purely formal administrative reasons. At first, the courts refused to order a new review of the undesirability decision, contending that there was no legal provision explicitly providing for the possibility of such a review (see paragraph\u00a023 above). Later on, the Consumer Protection Authority refused to consider his request to be allowed to visit his children in Russia, claiming that it was not competent to review the decisions issued by another agency (see paragraph 25 above).",

As they were issued in connection with their infection with HIV, which is by today\u2019s medical standards a lifetime condition, they have the effect of a permanent ban on their re-entry to Russia in accordance with the current legislation.

In this context, \u201cpressure\u201d includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy. Whether or not contacts between the authorities and an applicant are tantamount to unacceptable practice from the standpoint of Article 34 must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. The Court has repeatedly emphasised that it was in principle not appropriate for the authorities of a respondent State to enter into direct contact with an applicant in connection with his case before the Court. In this respect, regard must be had to the vulnerability of the complainant and his or her susceptibility to influence exerted by the authorities. Even an informal interview with the applicant or his representative, let alone his or her formal questioning in respect of the Court proceedings, may be regarded as a form of intimidation (see, among other authorities, Fedotova v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a073225/01, \u00a7\u00a7 49-52, 13\u00a0April 2006; Kurt v.

Article 34 does not prevent the State from taking measures for improving the applicant\u2019s situation or investigating the problem which was at the heart of the complaints to the Court. In cases concerning a domestic inquiry into the facts underlying the application, the Court was unable to find, in the absence of evidence of pressure or compulsion to give evidence, that the applicant was hindered in the exercise of the right of individual petition (see Vladimir Sokolov v. Russia, no. 31242/05, \u00a7\u00a080, 29\u00a0March 2011; Tarariyeva v.

By contrast, the Court established a breach of Article\u00a034 where the questioning of the applicants was unconnected to any domestic investigation or conducted by an authority having no competence in the matter (see Kosheleva and Others v. Russia, no. 9046/07, \u00a7\u00a7 20-29, 17\u00a0January 2012, and Ryabov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3896/04, \u00a7\u00a7 60-65, 31\u00a0January 2008). Similarly, lacking any submissions from the Government about the nature or findings of a domestic investigation into complaints raised by the applicant before the Court and having no transcripts of the meetings between the applicant and the State officials, the Court was not satisfied that the applicant was contacted in connection with a domestic investigation and concluded to a breach of Article 34 of the Convention (see Lopata v. Russia, no.\u00a072250/01, \u00a7 156, 13 July 2010; Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, \u00a7\u00a0249, 13 July 2006; and Dula\u015f v. Turkey, no.\u00a025801/94, \u00a7 81, 30 January 2001).",

The Government submitted a copy of the compliance prosecutor\u2019s description of the interview and a statement which the representative Mr X had given to the interviewer (see\u00a0paragraph 48 above). The interview touched upon the applicant\u2019s family situation, his education, past and present employment, and migration status. Some of the questions were personal in nature but it does not appear that Mr X felt compelled to give evidence, as he chose, for instance, not to divulge the details of his personal life. As a former employee of the same prosecutor\u2019s office and a legal professional, Mr\u00a0X was able to tell the difference between a formal questioning and the fact-finding discussion that was taking place (see, by contrast, Kosheleva and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a027, in which the applicants without legal backgrounds could well have perceived the recital of the right not to incriminate themselves as an intimidating reference to the criminal proceedings against them). The Court is therefore satisfied that the interview related to the public prosecutor\u2019s duty to collect information about the applicant\u2019s complaints for the purpose of the Government\u2019s submissions to the Court, and that no pressure was brought to bear on the applicant\u2019s representative. The inquiries conducted by the police and the migration authorities pursued the same purpose, with no discernible indication of intimidation.",

The Government relied on a selection of approximately sixty cases in which the Russian courts granted challenges by HIV-positive non-nationals against the Federal Migration Service\u2019s and Consumer Protection Authority\u2019s decisions refusing them residence permits or declaring their presence undesirable. The courts had taken into account the individual circumstances of each case, including the duration of the nonnational\u2019s residence, the lawfully contracted marriage, the ages of any children, the absence of housing or family links in the country of origin, and so on.",

The Government did not show that the executive authorities had taken into account the case-law of the Russian Constitutional Court or the findings of this Court in Kiyutin.

In the context of systemic or structural violations the potential inflow of future cases is also an important consideration in terms of preventing the accumulation of repetitive cases on the Court\u2019s list, which hinders the effective processing of other cases giving rise to violations, sometimes serious, of the rights it is responsible for safeguarding. A systemic or structural problem stems or results not just from an isolated incident or a particular turn of events in individual cases but from defective legislation, when actions and omissions based thereon have given rise, or may give rise, to repetitive applications (see G\u00fclmez v. Turkey, no.\u00a016330/02, \u00a7 60, 20\u00a0May 2008; Urb\u00e1rska Obec Tren\u010dianske Biskupice v. Slovakia, no. 74258/01, \u00a7\u00a0148, 27 November 2007; and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a035014/97, \u00a7\u00a7 235-237, ECHR 2006VIII).

Over the past years the varying rates of economic, social and political development in the former USSR countries have generated large economic migration flows towards Russia. The net migration to Russia in 2010-14 is estimated by the World Bank to be in excess of one million people. The Russian authorities have deployed large-scale efforts for testing migrants for communicable diseases, which has allowed them to identify thousands of HIV-positive non-nationals and to pronounce their presence in Russia undesirable for health reasons (see paragraphs 58 and 59 above). Those who have unsuccessfully challenged the decisions that discriminate against them before Russian courts may eventually turn to the Court for relief. Starting from 2014, a new category of migrants, defined as \u201chabitual Russian speakers\u201d, are eligible for residence permits, but the same health-related restrictions apply to them (see paragraph 52 above). The Court accordingly finds that the actions based on defective legislation amount to a structural problem which may give rise to further repetitive applications.",

The judgment by the Russian Constitutional Court dated 12\u00a0March 2015 represented a major step forward for the protection of the rights of people living with HIV (see paragraph 61 above). It acknowledged the medical consensus regarding the means of transmission of HIV, and observed that the existing administrative practice of assessing the situation of HIV-positive people did not follow its own case-law. On that ground, it pronounced the legal provisions of the Entry and Exit Procedures Act, the Foreign Nationals Act, and the HIV Prevention Act \u2013 which were at the heart of the instant case \u2013 incompatible with the Russian Constitution in so far as they allowed the authorities to refuse entry or residence or to deport an HIV-positive non-national with family ties in Russia solely on account of his or her diagnosis. The Constitutional Court directed the legislator to make the necessary amendments in the light of its judgment which remained directly applicable pending the legislative reform. The Court notes that a draft law implementing the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment has already been prepared and submitted to the Russian Parliament (see\u00a0paragraph\u00a062 above).",

The proposed amendment will therefore not affect individuals in the situation of the applicant Mr\u00a0V.V. It is moreover not clear whether the law would apply with retroactive effect so as to allow individuals who were banned from Russia, as was the applicant Mr Khalupa, to obtain a new assessment of the grounds for their exclusion. However, the legislative reform is currently under way and it is not for the Court to speculate what final shape the proposed draft law may take (see Statileo, cited above, \u00a7 165). The Court will therefore abstain at this stage from formulating general measures, considering that the indications provided above will help to ensure the proper execution of the present judgment under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers (see\u00a0Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, \u00a7 264, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).
