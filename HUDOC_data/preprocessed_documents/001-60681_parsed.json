Tribunal with representation on the part of the Commission for Racial Equality and on appeal to the [EAT] with representation by leading counsel. Her endeavours since the first complaint have been prompted by a refusal to accept failure. She, if I may presume to advise her, should not lose sight of the fact that although race discrimination is a serious evil which the law is rightly astute to prevent, the opportunity to complain of discrimination puts a powerful weapon in the hands of the complainant. Charges of race discrimination are extremely hurtful and are not always easy to resist, at all events, without time, trouble and expense. Those who abuse the right of complaint by over-persistent or unscrupulous use of it must expect to suffer the consequence of having such misuse penalised by adverse costs orders. Such an order was made in this case by the [EAT]. It was, in my view, amply justified.\u201d",

The applicant\u2019s counsel was not available until March 1991, and the preliminary hearing was thus postponed until 17 July 1991, as a result of the applicant\u2019s failure to accept the first proposed date but also because of \u201cthe limited number of Judges available to sit at the [EAT]\u201d (see paragraph 17 above).

This long delay was compounded by the EAT\u2019s decision to defer judgment until after it had considered the anticipated appeal in the second claim, which was not heard until 6-7\u00a0June 1996, and the subsequent interval of over five months before the judgment was sent to the parties (see paragraphs 21-22 below); ",

The respondent first informed the Tribunal of this failure in May 1992 and requested the Tribunal to consider making an order requiring its production. No less than nine further letters were sent by the respondent to the Tribunal between July 1992 and January 1993 before the preliminary hearing was arranged (see paragraphs 40-41 above). Although the catalyst for the delay was the omission on the part of the applicant and her solicitor to produce the schedule as promised, the failure by the Tribunal to react promptly to prevent further delay was regrettable, as the Tribunal itself acknowledged in its judgment of 8 June 1993 (see paragraph 42 above). Furthermore, the delay was compounded by the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s decision following the February 1993 hearing was not delivered until June 1993 (ibid).
