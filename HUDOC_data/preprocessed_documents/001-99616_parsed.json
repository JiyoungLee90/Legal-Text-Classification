It reiterates that in particular in cases concerning a person\u2019s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter (see S\u00fc\u00df v. , no.\u00a040324/98, \u00a7 100, 10 November 2005). The Court takes note of the Government\u2019s submissions in this respect that ever since the Stralsund District Court\u2019s decision of 14 February 2001, the applicant could have exercised his right to supervised contact with his daughter thereby limiting the negative impact the duration of the subsequent proceedings before the Rostock Court of Appeal had on the relation with his child. However, the Court finds that it must have been obvious to the Court of Appeal that supervised access was not practicable given the obstructive conduct of the mother and the inactivity of the competent Youth Welfare Office. In\u00a0addition, any contact would have been overshadowed by the serious allegations of sexual abuse which also were of relevance for the regulation of the applicant\u2019s contact rights. The Court therefore finds that an expeditious clarification of the circumstances of the case was of particular importance for the applicant with a view to preventing a further alienation of the child and to finding a regulation of the applicant\u2019s contact rights in the child\u2019s best interest. The particular circumstances of the case placed in particular the Court of Appeal under a specific obligation to take special precautions in order to prevent any unnecessary delays, such as adhering to a very close time-schedule and closely supervising the taking of evidence.",

The Court further acknowledges that the hearing of extensive expert evidence and the taking of expert opinions with respect to the regulation of the applicant\u2019s contact rights required a certain period of time. While accepting that these circumstances may to some extent justify the duration of the proceedings at first instance, the Court nevertheless finds that there have been substantial periods of delay during the proceedings before the Court of Appeal in this respect.",

Notwithstanding the Court of Appeal\u2019s order, an examination of the child by the expert did not take place during the first set of proceedings before the Court of Appeal which ended by the court\u2019s decision of 28 January 2004. Following the remittal of the case by the prompt decision of the  dated 9\u00a0June\u00a02004, it took until 15\u00a0December\u00a02008 before an expert opinion based on the child\u2019s examination was obtained by the Court of Appeal.

They submitted that the costs claimed for the proceedings before the national courts were only partly caused by the length of the proceedings. Furthermore, the costs for the proceedings before the  could not be claimed, as the Court, in its judgment of S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany, had found that a constitutional complaint was not an effective remedy against proceedings that lasted too long. As regards the costs incurred before the Court, the Government maintained that the applicant had failed to indicate the number of actual hours spent by his lawyer on the case or the hourly rate charged, which made it impossible to judge whether the amount claimed was reasonable.",

In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers that the applicant has not established that the costs and expenses claimed for the proceedings before the domestic courts were incurred by him in order to seek prevention or rectification of the specific violation caused by the excessive length of the proceedings. However, seeing that in length of proceedings cases the protracted examination of a case beyond a \u201creasonable time\u201d involves an increase in the applicants\u2019 costs (see, among other authorities, S\u00fcrmeli v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a075529/01, \u00a7\u00a0148, ECHR 2006...), it does not find it unreasonable to make to the applicant an award of EUR\u00a0500 under this head. The Court further considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR\u00a02,933.83 covering costs for the proceedings before the Court in full.",
