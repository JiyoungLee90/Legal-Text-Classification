The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must, for a violation to be found, go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element. In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention, the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see\u00a0Kud\u0142a v.

Hygiene facilities were manifestly inadequate in relation to the number of detainees. Outdoor exercise was sporadic and of an extremely limited duration. The Court reiterates in this connection its well-established case-law that the mere fact of holding an applicant for a long period of time in an unadapted cell designed only for short-term detention discloses a violation of Article 3 (see Aslanis v.\u00a0Greece, no. 36401/10, \u00a7 38, 17 October 2013, with further references; Kuptsov and Kuptsova v.

However, the latter periods must be seen against the background of virtually non-existent outdoor exercise and deficient hygiene facilities. In previous cases where the applicants disposed of less than three square metres of personal space, the Court found that the overcrowding was severe enough to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article\u00a03 of the Convention (see Ananyev and Others v.

Given that the applicant spent more than two years in custody, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen in the meantime. In particular, the applicant sought to argue before the courts that his detention had ceased to be lawful after it had transpired that it was impossible to expel him to Uzbekistan. By virtue of Article 5 \u00a7 4 the applicant was entitled to apply to a \u201ccourt\u201d having jurisdiction to decide \u201cspeedily\u201d whether or not his deprivation of liberty had become \u201cunlawful\u201d in the light of new factors which emerged subsequently to the decision on his initial placement in custody (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 151-152, with further references).",

While administrative convenience may call for a group treatment of similar requests under different circumstances, the fact that the applicant was in detention required special diligence from the authorities and the four-month delay was clearly in breach of that requirement (see Tabesh, cited above, \u00a7 56, in which the authorities remained passive for three months).",

There is no indication that they asked him to specify such a country or that they took any steps to explore that option on their own initiative (compare Amie and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077).

In such circumstances the necessity of procedural safeguards becomes decisive. However, the Court has already established that the applicant did not have any effective remedy by which to contest the lawfulness and length of his detention, and the Government have not pointed to any other normative or practical safeguard. It follows that the Russian legal system did not provide for a procedure capable of preventing the risk of arbitrary detention pending expulsion (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 153-54; Louled Massoud, cited above, \u00a7 71, and, mutatis mutandis, Soldatenko v.

A situation similar to the one obtaining in the instant case arose in a case of three stateless persons of Roma origin who had spent almost one year in the same detention centre for aliens in St Petersburg pending their administrative removal from Russia, without judicial review of their detention. That case was terminated by way of a friendly settlement, with the Government undertaking to pay a sum of money to the applicants (see\u00a0Lakatosh and Others v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a032002/10, 7 June 2011). In Azimov and follow-up cases the Court found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention on account of the fact that during the term of the applicants\u2019 detention pending expulsion they did not have at their disposal any procedure for judicial review of its lawfulness in the light of new factors which emerged subsequent to the decision on their initial placement in custody (see Azimov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 153-54).",

With a view, however, to helping the respondent State fulfil its obligations under Article 46, the Court may seek to indicate the type of individual and/or general measures that might be taken in order to put an end to the situation it has found to exist (see Stanev v.

In that connection, the Court considers that general measures at the national level are undoubtedly called for in the execution of the present judgment (see Driza v.
