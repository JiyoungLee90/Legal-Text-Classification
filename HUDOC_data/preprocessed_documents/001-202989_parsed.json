While the availability of alternative accommodation might be relevant for the assessment of the proportionality of an eviction, the Court observes that those matters were not examined by the domestic courts in the present case. The Court further observes that the domestic courts did not weigh the interests of the Astrakhan region against the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home. Once they had found that the applicant\u2019s right to reside in the contested flat had come to an end following the termination of the agreement concluded between his former employer and the regional authorities, they gave that aspect paramount importance, without seeking to weigh it against the applicant\u2019s arguments.
