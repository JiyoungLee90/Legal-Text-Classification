On 19 November 1982 Mrs Guillemin applied to the administrative court to have that decision set aside. In civil cases the \"reasonable time\" for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) usually begins to run when the application is made to the court. In the present case the period to be taken into consideration began on 19\u00a0November 1982 at the latest.",

In the instant case, resolving the dispute, which could have been amicably settled, entailed bringing two sets of proceedings: the first in the administrative courts, which alone have jurisdiction to assess whether the public interest of an expropriation is lawful, and the second, conducted in both the administrative and the ordinary courts simultaneously, to secure compensation for the applicant for the illegal expropriation of her property by the public authorities. The latter proceedings are still pending. The length of time to be considered accordingly exceeds fourteen years already (19\u00a0November 1982 - 22 January 1997).",

Furthermore, as in the present case, an administrative court may have to rule on the lawfulness of the initial stage of the proceedings at the same time as an ordinary court has to deal with the consequences of an expropriation order whose lawfulness has been challenged in the other court. Such a situation may give rise to conflicting decisions, and this is a risk which prompt consideration of claims might help to diminish. The Court notes that the division of jurisdiction between the courts was not obvious to the Evry tribunal de grande instance; on 1 February 1993 it deferred judgment until the Versailles Administrative Court, to which a compensation claim had likewise been made but which theoretically had no jurisdiction in the matter, ruled on 24 May 1994 (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above).

Once the expropriation measures had been set aside, the town council did not respond to the applicant\u2019s claims, and this further delayed the end of the proceedings (see paragraph 13 above). Lastly, the compensation proceedings which were instituted in the Evry tribunal de grande instance on 13 January 1992 and entered in the court\u2019s list again on 25 November 1994, two years and eleven months later, are still pending (see paragraphs 16 and 19-22 above); moreover, an appeal will lie against the judgment to be delivered.",

The Court considers, however, that the domestic courts\u2019 acknowledgment of the applicant\u2019s right to compensation does not mean that she ceases to be a victim.
