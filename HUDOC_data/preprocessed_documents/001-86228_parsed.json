The Government would have had to establish satisfactorily that the applicant\u2019s injuries were caused otherwise than \u2013 entirely, mainly, or partly \u2013 by the treatment he underwent while in custody (Ribitsch v. Austria, judgment of \n4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, \u00a7 34). The applicant, however, complained about the fact that he had been beaten by his interrogators and by inmates. That makes the case a little more complicated, since \u2013 as far as violence by inmates is concerned \u2013 in my opinion the Government cannot be blamed for all such acts. As regards their responsibility for violence by inmates, it should in my opinion be established that either the authorities were aware of such violence but did nothing to prevent or immediately stop it (or worse, encouraged it) or that the prison conditions and/or the medical condition of the applicant were such that violence by inmates was in the specific circumstances of the case foreseeable, or that the authorities, having been properly warned, did not take the necessary steps to prevent further violence from occurring. In this specific case it is clear that the applicant\u2019s wife lodged a complaint on 16 February 1996 (paragraph 29). The injuries indicated in the above-mentioned report must have been sustained after that date. The judgment thus makes it clear that the national authorities cannot hide behind the fact that they investigated the allegations and that the interrogators cannot be blamed. Since they were properly warned as of \n16 February 1996, the reversal of the burden of proof remained in place, in respect of the violence inflicted by inmates as well.",

After such confiscation, does it really matter that there was a domestic remedy at his disposal which should have been used first? I wonder what the use is of being able to challenge the decision of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office under domestic law if in the meantime the authorities have become aware of the contents of correspondence with the Court. Once they have discovered that they confiscated \u201cuntouchable\u201d documents, ought the authorities not to be under an obligation to repair proprio motu the violation not only by returning the documents but also by at least expressly acknowledging that they had been wrong to confiscate them.",
