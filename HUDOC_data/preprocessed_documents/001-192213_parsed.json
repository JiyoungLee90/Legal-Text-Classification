Therefore, refusal of leave to appeal (on points of law) includes the consideration that a referral to the CJEU is not required in that case (see, for example, Federal Court of Justice, I\u00a0ZR\u00a0130/02, 16\u00a0January 2003; Federal Constitutional Court, 2 BvR 557/88, 22 December 1992; 1 BvR 2534/10, 3 March 2014; 1 BvR 1320/14, 8\u00a0October 2015). To provide the Federal Constitutional Court with the possibility to review such decisions for arbitrariness, it is necessary that the court establish the reasons for the decision either from the reasoning of the court of last resort or otherwise (see Federal Constitutional Court, 2 BvR 557/88, 22 December 1992; 1 BvR 2534/10, 3\u00a0March 2014; 1 BvR 1320/14, 8 October 2015). In case 2 BvR 557/88, the first-instance court had provided detailed reasoning concerning the relevant EU law and why there were no doubts regarding the correct interpretation of those provisions. It had relied on established case-law of the Federal Financial Court. Under these circumstances, the Constitutional Court found it acceptable that the Federal Financial Court had rejected the subsequent complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal without providing reasons. In case 1 BvR 1320/14, however, the Constitutional Court found a violation of the right to a decision by the legally competent court (Recht auf den gesetzlichen Richter) because the Federal Court of Justice had rejected a complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law and had not provided any reasoning. In that case, the court found that an obligation for a referral to the CJEU during the appeal on points of law proceedings was very likely (lag nahe) and that the Federal Court of Justice had not explained why it had rejected leave to appeal on points of law nevertheless. Even though the lower court had provided brief reasoning, there were no indications that the Federal Court of Justice had embraced it, particularly since the applicant in the proceedings had made extensive submissions in its complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law, disputing the reasoning of the lower court.",

The Court of Appeal, while not a court of last resort and therefore not obliged to refer questions to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling, had discussed EU law and the CJEU\u2019s case law in detail and had concluded that the applicant\u2019s legal opinion was not reflected in the CJEU\u2019s case-law or academic writing. It therefore followed from the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that a referral had not been required. In addition, the Court of Appeal had also had to examine the question of whether a referral was necessary when deciding whether leave to appeal on points of law had to be granted, since if a question had arisen concerning EU law that had been of relevance for the case, the matter would have had \u201cfundamental significance\u201d within the meaning of Article 543 of the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore required leave to appeal on points of law to be granted. Consequently, the decision of the Court of Appeal to refuse leave to appeal on points of law had also stated that a referral to the CJEU was not necessary. For the same reason, the reasoning of the Federal Court of Justice had been sufficient, because holding that the case had no \u201cfundamental significance\u201d implicitly meant that no referral to the CJEU was necessary. In addition, the Federal Court of Justice had endorsed the reasoning of the Court of Appeal by refusing the applicant\u2019s complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law and dispensing with further reasoning pursuant to Article\u00a0544 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure.",

It reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, the right to have a case referred by a domestic court to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously observed that this matter is, however, not unconnected to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention since a domestic court\u2019s refusal to grant a referral may, in certain circumstances, infringe the fairness of proceedings where the refusal proves to have been arbitrary. Such a refusal may be deemed arbitrary in cases where the applicable rules allow no exception to the granting of a referral or where the refusal is based on reasons other than those provided for by the rules, or where the refusal was not duly reasoned (see Ullens de Schooten and\u00a0Rezabek v. Belgium, nos. 3989/07 and 38353/07, 20 September 2011, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05459). The obligation for domestic courts to provide reasons for their judgments and decisions serves to enable the parties to understand the judicial decision that has been given; which is a vital safeguard against arbitrariness. In addition, it serves the purpose of demonstrating to the parties that they have been heard, thereby contributing to a more willing acceptance of the decision on their part (see Taxquet v.\u00a0Belgium [GC], no.\u00a0926/05, \u00a7\u00a7 90 and 91, ECHR 2010, with further references).",
