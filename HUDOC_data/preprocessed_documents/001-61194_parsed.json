It is not therefore the purpose of granting access, but the legal conditions for doing so, which differ: while a parent who does not have custody of a child born in wedlock is entitled to access under Article 1634 [of the Civil Code], Article 1711 [of the Code] does not grant a right of access to the father of a child born out of wedlock. Rather, the law leaves it up to the person having custody, as a rule the mother, to determine whether, and to what extent, the father should be able to spend time with his child. However, the guardianship court may decide that the father is entitled to access if this is in the child's best interests. The main reason for the weaker legal position of the father of a child born out of wedlock is his different social position. After the Federal Constitutional Court's decisions of 1971 and 1981, the constitutionality of Article 1711 can no longer be seriously doubted. For considerations of legal policy, a reform of the law on children born out of wedlock is even more urgently necessary. In the meantime, the courts are bound by Article 1711.",

It follows from these considerations that the Court's task is not to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding custody and access issues, but rather to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see Hokkanen v.

However, a stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations, such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of access, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed (see Elsholz v.

There, the Court noted that it could not be said on the facts of that case that a divorced father would have been treated more favourably. In that connection it observed that the German courts' decisions were clearly based on the danger to the child's development if he had to resume contact with his father, the applicant, contrary to the will of the mother, and on the finding that contact would negatively affect the child. Moreover, the  had confirmed that the ordinary courts had applied the same test as would have been applied to a divorced father.",

Having regard to the fact that these courts were convinced of the applicant's responsible motives, his attachment to his child and his genuine affection for her, they placed a burden on him which was heavier than the one on divorced fathers under Article 1634 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code. The Court also notes that the Regional Court, while regarding a reform of the legislation on children born out of wedlock as being urgently necessary, expressly stated that it considered itself bound by Article 1711 \u00a7 2, which placed fathers of children born out of wedlock in a weaker legal position.",

It was a measure which created the requisite conditions for the permanent alienation of the daughter from her natural father, which could easily lead, at a later stage, to the child's negation of any recognition of emotional ties and of the need for any further contact.

As the Court has correctly stressed in paragraph 65 of the judgment, following its already established case-law, \u201ca stricter scrutiny is called for as regards any further limitations [than that of custody], such as restrictions placed by those authorities on parental rights of access, and as regards any legal safeguards designed to secure an effective protection of the right of parents and children to respect for their family life. Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed\u201d. In conclusion, in the balancing of the various factors to be taken into account in determining the necessity of the interference in a democratic society, weight must be given to the radical nature of the measure of prohibition applying in a situation where the parent enjoys a minimum of family life, the aim being in most cases simply to safeguard the continuation of emotional ties between the parent and the child.",

It is one of the basic requirements in relation to parents' rights of access to their children that there exist legal safeguards designed to secure the effective protection of the rights of parents and children to respect for their family life (see Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2000-VIII; Kutzner v. Germany, no. 46544/99, \u00a7\u00a7 65-66, ECHR 2002-I; and Covezzi and Morselli v. Italy, no. 52763/99, 9 May 2003). A decisive element of these \u201cparental rights of access\u201d resides in the question whether the level of involvement of the applicant in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, provided him with the requisite protection of his interests. The procedural rule should be that first established in Elsholz (cited above), namely that the domestic courts should assess the difficult question of the child's best interests on the basis of a reasoned and up-to-date psychological report, and that the child, if possible, should be \u201cheard\u201d by the psychological expert and the court.",

The decisive factors for the District Court in rejecting the applicant's request for access to his daughter were \u201cthe strong differences between the parents\u201d and the mother's opposition to any contact between the child and the father, although the court realised that the father had genuine affection for his daughter. The expert heard by the  reached the conclusion that granting a right of access without a prior conversation to overcome the conflicts between the parents was not in the child's interests. That would mean, in other words, that without the mother's consent, the father would never gain a right of access. Under these circumstances the possibility cannot be excluded that the mother tried to alienate the child completely from her biological father. Such conduct was made possible, at least more or less, by the legal situation at the material time under Article 1711 of the Civil Code. ",

We can only underline the Chamber's conclusions that \u201ccorrect and complete information on the child's relationship to the applicant as the parent seeking access to the child is an indispensable prerequisite for establishing a child's true wishes and thereby striking a fair balance between the interests at stake\u201d (paragraph 48 of the Chamber's judgment).",

The applicant was from the very beginning in the rather difficult position, under the law, of having to prove that personal contact with the child would be in the child's interest, whereas normally for children born within a marital relationship this interest is presumed and access can be denied only where it is contrary to the best interests of the child. On the other hand, fathers of children born out of wedlock have to prove that it is positively in the child's interest to have personal contact with him or her. This rule placed the applicant, Mr Sahin, in a very unfavourable situation. In order to prove that further contact was in his daughter's interest, he had to overcome the explicit opposition of the child's mother. In order to establish that such contact would not disturb the relations between the mother and the child it would have been necessary to speak to the child about her father. The fact that the father was not mentioned in any way to the child, either by the psychological expert or by the court itself, which could have made special arrangements in view of the child's very young age, left the father with the burden of proof. There is no satisfactory answer to the question as to what else he could have done to prove that relations with her father would be in the child's interest, a conclusion which for children not born out of wedlock would have been presumed under the law in force at the time of the decision.",
