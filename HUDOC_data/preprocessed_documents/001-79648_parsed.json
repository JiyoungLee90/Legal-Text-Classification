The Court has already found that in the Russian legal system, the power of a court to reverse a decision not to institute criminal proceedings is a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of powers by the investigating authorities (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no.\u00a049790/99, 14\u00a0October 2003). Although in these proceedings the court of general jurisdiction is not competent to pursue an independent investigation or make any findings of fact, a judicial review of a complaint has the benefit of providing a forum guaranteeing due process of law.

In view of the essential link between Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained \u201cfor the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence\u201d, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d (see Panchenko v. , no. 45100/98, \u00a7\u00a7 91 and 93, 8 February 2005, with further references).

Nor can continuation of the detention be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see Panchenko, cited above \u00a7 102; Ilijkov v. , no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a081, 26\u00a0July 2001; and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 51). This is particularly true in the Russian legal system where the characterisation in law of the facts \u2013 and thus the sentence faced by the applicant \u2013 is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of the issue whether the evidence that has been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov v.

The Court reiterates that any system of mandatory detention pending trial is incompatible per se with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Rokhlina v.

Furthermore, the Court observes that the contract between the applicant and Mrs Moskalenko is a template, in which only the parties' names and the amount were filled in, whereas all the remaining fields describing the nature of legal work, the due date and other conditions, have remained blank. It appears that that template did not create a legally enforceable obligation on the applicant to pay any fee to Mrs Moskalenko.
