The fact that the Supreme Court on 1\u00a0April 2004 rejected the appeal on the ground that the value of the claim fell below the statutory threshold does not, in our opinion, justify the finding of the majority in paragraph 27 of the judgment, namely that the time that elapsed in the proceedings before the Supreme Court ought not to be taken into consideration as that appeal was rejected on procedural grounds and thus lacked any prospect of success. The underlying aim of the reasonable-time requirement is that parties to proceedings should not be left in a state of uncertainty about the outcome of their case for too long. If a party is dissatisfied with the judgments of the domestic court at first instance or at an intermediate level and burdens the higher national court with an appeal, that party should not in addition have the benefit of reasoning by our Court baldly stating that it will not take into account the last period and the extra level of jurisdiction involved. In the personal perception of the applicant he apparently had to wait for the final outcome of his case at national level from the day he started the civil proceedings until the day the decision of the Supreme Court was served on him. So it should come as no surprise to him that our Court should take that whole period into account when deciding whether or not the applicant was left in a state of uncertainty for too long.",

But that is a different matter. In the case at hand the applicant brought an appeal at national level and at (almost) the same time he lodged an application with the Court. That made his case admissible as far as the six-month rule is concerned. On a substantive level, however, we cannot help feeling that the applicant wants to have it both ways: that is, proceedings before the Court running in parallel with the domestic proceedings. We consider that, in assessing the length of the proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, the total length of the proceedings at all domestic levels of jurisdiction should be taken into account in such a case.",

Moreover, it does not appear that it is only the respondent State which can be blamed for the time that elapsed. One may query whether the applicant, who, before the actual hearing could take place, filed preliminary submissions in which he modified his claim as regards interest, and on one occasion reduced his claim, had sufficiently prepared his case when he went to court in the first place.",
