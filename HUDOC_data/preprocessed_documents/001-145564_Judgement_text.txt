The case originated in an application (no. 2641/06) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Bulgarian national, Mr Tsvetelin Veselinov Petkov (“the applicant”), on 23 December 2005. The applicant subsequently informed the Court that he changed his family name to Murlasits, following a marriage.
The applicant was represented initially by Ms S. Ivanova and Mr A. Lukanov, lawyers practising in Sofia. After the death of Mr A. Lukanov, he was represented by Ms S. Ivanova. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms M. Dimova and Ms M. Kotseva, of the Ministry of Justice.
The applicant complained, in particular, that he had been declared the father of a child in proceedings conducted in his absence and that his subsequent request for reopening had been refused.
On 6 December 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Sofia.
On 15 October 1993 the applicant got married. At the time of the marriage, the applicant’s wife had an almost three-year old son, who had been born on 20 September 1990 and whose father had been registered as “unknown”. On 21 September 1993 the applicant was registered as having recognised paternity in respect of that child.
The spouses apparently stopped living together about two years after their marriage and divorced in 1997.
In 1999 the applicant brought a claim in court to declare his recognition of paternity null and void. In particular, he asserted that the declaration, with which the child had been recognised and which had been enclosed in the case file, bore a signature that was not his. The Sofia City Court examined his case and found that the legal requirements for recognition of the child had not been met. More specifically, the applicant had not personally expressed his will to recognise the child before the State agent authorised to receive such declarations; in addition, it had been established on the basis of an expert report during the proceedings that the signature on the documents with which the child had been recognised in 1993 was not that of the applicant. The court declared the recognition of the child by the applicant null and void in a final decision of June 2001, which entered into force the following month.
In March 2002 the applicant’s former wife brought a claim on behalf of her child to establish the applicant’s paternity. She asked the court to order gynecological and blood tests in the context of the proceedings. She indicated in the claim the applicant’s “permanent address” as the address where he could be reached.
The applicant was not found at his “permanent address” when the authorities visited it once in April 2002. According to a note by the summons officer, a neighbour had indicated that the applicant no longer lived there. The authorities proceeded by summoning the applicant with a publication in the State Gazette in July 2002. As he did not appear in court, a lawyer was appointed ex officio to represent him. The lawyer attended the court hearing before the Sofia City Court which took place on 2 December 2002; it appears that she had no contact with the applicant at any point in time, either before or after the hearing.
In a judgment of 16 December 2002 the Sofia City Court allowed the claim, declaring the applicant the biological father of the child. The court also held that the child was to carry the applicant’s names (as a patronymic and family name) and determined a monthly amount of child maintenance which the applicant had to pay. The court remained silent on the request for blood tests made by the applicant’s former wife. Instead, it based its findings on the date of the child’s birth and on testimony submitted by the applicant’s former wife’s cousin and aunt. The latter stated that, at the time of the child’s conception, the mother had been in an intimate relationship only with him. The court held that this was sufficient to conclude that the applicant was the child’s father. The applicant was also ordered to pay about 50 euros (EUR) in legal fees to each of the ex officio lawyers appointed by the court to represent him and the child respectively.
On 19 December 2002 the Sofia City Court prepared two notifications of the judgment, one for the attention of the applicant and another for the attention of the child. The notification to the child was handed in person to the child’s lawyer on 8 January 2003. As for the notification to the applicant, on 13 January 2003 a court officer indicated on the court papers for notification that according to information from the applicant’s neighbours he no longer lived at his “permanent address” and no new address was known for him. On 16 January 2003 the court ordered that the notification be sent to the applicant’s ex officio lawyer; the latter was personally served a notice of the judgment on 18 January 2003. The notice indicated that an appeal against the judgment could be filed within 14 days from the moment of notification. The applicant’s ex officio lawyer did not appeal against the judgment and it became final.
The applicant found out about the judgment on 26 April 2004 when he was informed, at his “permanent address”, of his obligation to pay child maintenance in accordance with a writ of execution following the 2002 Sofia City Court judgment. A later certificate, issued on 25 May 2011 by the bailiff service and enclosed in the case file, indicated that no payments had been received in connection with the writ.
On 26 July 2004, the applicant filed a request for reopening, relying on Article 231 (e) and Article 231 (ж) of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952 in force at the time (see paragraph 28 below). He claimed in particular that he had been deprived of the opportunity personally to participate in the court proceedings in which he had been declared the father of the child.
The Supreme Court of Cassation (SCC) examined his request for reopening. It observed that the applicant had only learned about the Sofia City Court 2002 decision on 26 April 2004. It found his request for reopening procedurally admissible as lodged within the statutory time-limit. Nevertheless, the SCC rejected the request on the ground that the procedure for summoning him to the hearing had been observed, namely, attempted service at the applicant’s last known address and publication in the State Gazette. The Court also noted that a legal representative had been appointed ex officio and had represented the applicant during the proceedings. The court concluded, in a final judgment of 11 November 2005, that the applicant’s right to take part in those proceedings and to exercise his defence had not been infringed.
Article 41 of the Family Code, as in force at the time, stipulated that a claim for establishing paternity could be brought by the child’s mother within three years of the birth and by the child itself not later than three years after reaching majority.
According to section 90 of the Civil Registration Act 1999, every individual who is subject to civil registration has to inform the relevant local authorities in writing of his or her “permanent address” and, where applicable, “temporary address”. People also have to signal any change in their “temporary address” within 30 days of the change (section 99 of the same Act).
Article 50 (1) of the CCP, in its wording at the material time, stated that in cases in which, at the time of bringing the claim, the defendant’s domicile or address were unknown, he or she was to be summoned by a publication in the State Gazette made not less than a month before the court hearing. The fact that the defendant’s domicile was unknown was to be established by an inquiry with the address registry office or by other means. That provision was amended in November 2002 by introducing a requirement according to which the person informing the summons officer of the absence of the summons addressee from his or her address had to provide their full names and sign under that statement.
The party who, either temporarily or permanently, changed the address which it had given in a court case, or at which it had been summoned once, had to inform the court of that change.
A party’s legal representative could carry out all procedural acts in the name of the person represented apart from those for which the law required explicit authorisation (Article 22 of the CCP). According to the Supreme Court of Cassation, the procedural acts which the legal representative could carry out included the bringing of appeals against court decisions at first instance (pеш. № 16 от 14 февруари 2011 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 236/2010 г., I г. о., ГК).
According to Article 22 (2) of the CCP, an explicit power of attorney was required for the conclusion of an agreement; for the reduction, withdrawal or abandoning of a claim; for the acceptance of the claims of the other party; for receiving money or other valuables; as well as for all other actions constituting disposal of the object of a case.
Article 21 (2) of the CCP provided that an explicit power of attorney was required for the bringing of proceedings related to an individual’s civil status. Such proceedings covered claims for establishing or revoking filiation, as well as claims for quashing adoption (Article 271 (1) of the CCP).
Article 16 (5) of the CCP provided that, in cases in which the domicile of a party was unknown, the court had to appoint ex officio a legal representative for that party. Article 50 (2) of the CCP stated that, in cases in which the party failed to appear before the court, despite having been summoned with a publication in the State Gazette, the court had to appoint a legal representative ex officio. According to section 21 of the Bar Act 1991, in force at the relevant time, once the Bar was apprised of the court’s decision for appointing ex officio a legal representative, the Bar had to select a lawyer for that purpose. The selected ex officio representative was obliged to provide legal defence to the person to whom she or he had been assigned.
According to legal commentators (see Живко Сталев, Българско Гражданско Процесуално Право, осмо издание, София, 2006 г., p. 172) the appointment ex officio of a legal representative to a party in cases covered by Articles 16 (5) and 50 (2) of the CCP is a condition for the validity of the procedural actions undertaken against the party or on his or her behalf. If the party was not represented ex officio in the situations falling under Articles 16 (5) and 50 (2) of the CCP, the decision of the court would be subject to reopening (see paragraph 29 below). The Supreme Court of Cassation held in a judgment of 2011 that, if a party in the situations under Articles 16 (5) and 50 (2) of the CCP was appointed with a lawyer ex officio, that party was considered to have been legally represented and there were no grounds for reopening (реш. № 804 от 5.01.2011 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 1953/2009 г., IV г. о., ГК).
According to Article 17 of the CCP, ex officio legal representatives appointed to a party with unknown address could carry out the acts, which under Article 22 (2) of the CCP required explicit authorisation, only with the approval of the court hearing the case.
According to Article 107 (1) of the CCP, if a party did not appear at a hearing after it had been duly notified thereof, the court could proceed with the examination of the case. If a party or its representative failed to appear because of a sudden illness or other impediment, the court had to adjourn the case (Article 107 (2)).
Article 231 of the CCP provided that an interested party could request the reopening of civil proceedings, which had ended with a decision which has acquired res judicata, on specific grounds exhaustively listed in the CCP. Article 231 (1) (e) of the CCP stipulated in particular that the parties could seek reopening when, in breach of the relevant provisions, the party had not taken part in the proceedings, had not been adequately represented or could not appear before the court for reasons out of that party’s control. Article 231 (1) (ж) of the CCP provided that a party could seek reopening when, despite having had a known address, he or she had been summoned in accordance with Article 16 (5) of the CCP. Reopening could be requested within three months from learning about the grounds giving rise to it. The request for reopening was examined by the Supreme Court of Cassation (SCC) (Article 234).
Article 231 (1)(з) of the CCP 1952 provided that civil proceedings may be reopened when a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights established that the Convention had been violated. The content of this provision was reproduced in Article 303 (1) (7) of the CCP 2007, where the text “and when a fresh examination of the case is necessary in order to eliminate the consequences of the violation” was added at the end of it. The interested party may make the request no later than six months after the judgment has become final (Article 305 (2) of the CCP 2007). The request is examined by the SCC (Article 307 of the CCP 2007).
Article 37 (1) of the CCP as in force at the time of the events provided that a party which had missed a limitation period, either defined by statute or by a court, could seek its renewal if it proved that it had missed the time-limit due to special unforeseen circumstances. The party could apply to have the period start running anew within seven days from the notification of the missed deadline (Article 37 (2)). In a decision of 1979 (see реш. № 3565 от 21.12.1979 г. по гр. д. № 2925б79 г., II г. о.) the Supreme Court at the time held that “special unforeseen circumstances” could be a natural disaster, such as a flooding which made travel impossible, or a sudden illness, loss of the case-file etc., which objectively deprived the party of the possibility to act within the statutory time-limit.
In a number of subsequent decisions (определения) the highest civil and administrative Bulgarian courts refused requests for renewal of timelimits (in most of those cases the time-limits concerned appeal), considering that no “special unforeseen circumstances” were present as the party’s omission to act within the statutory time-period was not due to objective reasons beyond the party’s control (see, among others, опр. № 294 от 12.03.2004 г. на ВКС по д. № 59/2004 г., IV г. о.; опр. № 80 от 8.01.2002 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 8703/2001 г., II о.; oпр. № 10467 от 29.12.2001 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 7377/2001 г., I о.; oпр. № 3957 от 20.06.2000 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 1416/2000 г., III о.; oпр. № 369 от 15.06.2000 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 2178/2000 г., III о.; oпр. № 3630 от 7.06.2000 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 3575/2000 г., III о.; oпр. № 2175 от 10.04.2000 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 839/99 г., III о.; oпр. № 4880 от 24.09.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 5260/99 г., III о.; oпр. № 5022 от 04.10.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 3571/99 г.; oпр. № 4431 от 30.07.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 2939/99 г., II о.; oпр. № 4063 от 19.07.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 3296/99 г., III о.; oпр. № 106 от 17.12.1984 г. на ВС по ч. гр. д. № 1141/84 г., II г. о.).
In six other decisions, the national courts allowed requests for renewal of time-limits as they found that the facts, preventing the individuals from appealing, constituted “special unforeseen circumstances”. Two of those decisions were taken in 1976 by the then Supreme Court (oпр. № 947 от 23.03.1976 г. на ВС по гр. д. № 1997/75 г., II г. о.; oпр. № 98 от 04.05.1976 г. на ВС по гр. д. № 1183/76 г., II г. о.); another two were taken in 1999 by the Supreme Administrative Court (oпр. № 5162 от 08.12.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 4955/99 г., 5-членен с-в; oпр. № 5443 от 19.10.1999 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 4885/99 г., IV o.); one was taken by a civil appellate court in 2000 (oпр. от 20.04.2000 г. на CАС по ч. гр. д. № 733/2000 г., гражданска колегия, 2-ри с-в), and one by the Supreme Administrative Court in 2003 (опр. № 12155 от 22.12.2003 г. на ВАС по адм. д. № 3699/2003 г., V о.). In the two 1976 decisions the omission by a party to act in proceedings was due to the failure of a neighbour to transmit a notification to that party. In the two 1999 decisions the omission was due to: first, the delivery of a notification, intended for a refugee applicant, not to the latter but to the national authorities responsible for deciding on refugee claims, when those national authorities were a respondent in the same case (and the court concluded that it was in the respondent’s interest to delay handing the notification to the refugee with a view to his missing the time-limit for appeal); and secondly, the inability of a party to appeal because of his being sent temporarily to serve his military duties outside the usual military station. In the 2000 case, the reason for allowing renewal of a time-limit was that a neighbor who had received the notification only handed it to the claimant after expiry of the statutory timelimit for appeal. In the 2003 decision the omission to appeal was due to a sudden serious illness of the party who had been taken to hospital during the time-limit.
