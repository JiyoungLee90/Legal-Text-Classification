The case originated in an application (no. 36630/11) against Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Zsolt Balogh (“the applicant”), on 8 June 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr Cs. Timár, a lawyer practising in Pécs. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 4 March 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Pécs. He had been practising as a lawyer.
On 22 January 2006 Mr K. I. lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant on charges of abuse of a minor.
As it appears from the case file, the criminal investigation was launched against the applicant around 7 August 2006.
The Public Prosecutor preferred a bill of indictment on 5 March 2007.
As a consequence of the criminal proceedings, on 3 July 2007 the Komárom-Esztergom County Bar Association suspended the applicant’s licence to practise as lawyer.
On 25 September 2008 the Pécs District Court convicted the applicant of abuse of a minor and sentenced him to one year imprisonment with enforcement suspended for two years. The applicant appealed against the judgment.
On 10 February 2010 the Baranya County Regional Court quashed the judgment and ordered the first-instance court to try the case again.
In the ensuing proceedings on 2 July 2010 the Pécs District Court acquitted the applicant due to absence of proof. The applicant appealed against the judgment for acquittal due to lack of an offence.
Finally, in early December 2010 the applicant withdrew his appeal. Arguing that he could have received several mandates from clients if he had had his licence to practise as lawyer, the applicant decided to terminate the criminal proceedings as early as possible in order to resume his practice.
