Finally, the fourth report, which referred to the findings of the medical report of 8 March, concluded that periorbital lesions would not occur as a result of hitting one\u2019s head on a door and that it was possible the marks on the applicant had been caused by the use of force.",

However, the Court observes that neither of the police officers who were heard by the public prosecutor on 2 June 1999 referred to any existing marks on the applicant\u2019s face which had occurred previously during his arrest. On the contrary, referring to a report drawn up on the morning of 8 March, they both stated that the applicant had hurt himself while in custody.

Having regard to the findings of the fourth medical report, which indicated that periorbital lesions would not have occurred as a result of hitting the head on a door (see paragraph 13 above), the Court does not find it credible, in the circumstances, that the marks on the applicant\u2019s face were caused by hitting his head against the door of his cell.",
