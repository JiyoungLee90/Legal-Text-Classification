The patient [the applicant] has a multifocal coronary lesion and an extremely high coronary risk, taking into account the stress echocardiography testing presented to me. The patient has absolute indicators calling for a surgical revascularisation of the coronary arteries - coronary artery grafting. As a cardiologist who has been seeing the patient since October 2010, who has assessed the clinical picture and the results of clinical laboratory and instrumental tests in their dynamics (repeated daily monitoring of ECG tests, the coronary angiography of 25 August 2011, echocardiography, [and] stress echocardiography), I can state unequivocally that the diagnosis presented has been fully confirmed. According to national and European recommendations, the lesion affecting more than 50% of the trunk of the left coronary artery, combined with the three arterial coronary atherosclerotic lesions, serve as the indication for urgent cardiac surgery \u2013 coronary artery grafting. It is also necessary to stress that the question of cardiac surgery, given the seriousness of the coronary lesions, should have been determined as soon as the results of the diagnostic coronary angiography were received and the consultation with the heart surgeon had taken place in August 2011! In addition, given the results of the cardiac angiography, it may be stated that further conservative treatment of [the applicant] will not be effective, will certainly lead to the patient becoming fully disabled, and to the development of an acute cardiac infarction and complications in the course of the heart ischemic disease, including sudden coronary death. Cardiac surgery will unequivocally lead to the improvement of the patient\u2019s condition, the improvement of his life expectancy [and] will sufficiently decrease his need for drug therapy\u201d.",

They had not taken any steps to organise surgery and had even cut his contact with the cardiologist, thus limiting his life expectancy even further.

Less than two months after his admission to the prison hospital the applicant suffered a stroke and was taken to the resuscitation unit of the hospital (see paragraph 10 above). Having examined the voluminous medical records presented by the parties, the Court takes note of the Russian authorities\u2019 efforts to maintain the applicant\u2019s health in the first few months of his stay in the prison hospital. Having promptly put forward complex and stable drug therapy as the cornerstone of the long-term management of the applicant\u2019s case, the authorities ensured his full compliance with the medication regimen and provided comprehensive evaluation and follow-up. The Court does not lose sight of the number of tests and procedures the applicant was subjected to, or of the fact that an independent medical specialist, a cardiologist from a respected Russian medical facility, was called to assist the prison medical personnel in monitoring the applicant\u2019s case. The Court also notes the open and supportive communication between the civilian medical specialists and the administration of the prison hospital during this time, with the former having unlimited access to the patient and the latter complying with the recommendations issued by the civilian doctors. While the applicant\u2019s condition did not improve in those months, the suitability of the treatment strategy chosen for the applicant, including the drug regimen, was confirmed by the head of the Therapeutic Department of the  (see paragraph  above).",

For unknown reasons the prison authorities either disregarded the recommendations (see paragraph  above) or substantially delayed their implementation (see paragraphs  and  above). The Court finds this change in the authorities\u2019 approach to be a cause for concern, particularly in that the applicant\u2019s health continued to deteriorate and the medical specialists were no longer able to assess the appropriateness of the existing drug therapy for his condition in view of the fact that the prison authorities had failed to comply with the doctors\u2019 recommendation to perform a coronary angiography (see paragraphs - above). The Court is mindful that a further serious deterioration in the applicant\u2019s health, which resulted in him being admitted to the resuscitation unit of the hospital, led to the prison medical staff joining the civilian cardiologist in his fears for the applicant\u2019s life (see paragraph  above). However, the resulting decision had no more than a declaratory character, having no effect on the quality of the medical care the applicant was afforded, despite the fact that the prison medical authorities acknowledged that the drug therapy was no longer working. From July 2011 the decision calling for surgery was steadily maintained both by the attending civilian cardiologist and the prison hospital doctors (see paragraph 47 above). The urgency of the coronary artery grafting for the applicant was raised on a number of occasions by the head of the therapeutic department of the prison hospital, following the recommendations of the leading medical specialists in the fields of the cardiology and neurology (see paragraphs  and  above). The necessity for surgical treatment became even more apparent when the doctors imposed a lengthy ban on the applicant\u2019s participation in the investigative actions on the ground that even minor emotional disturbance resulted in a further deterioration in his condition. The Court also notes that the applicant signed a number of forms consenting to any form of medical treatment, including surgery, the earliest written consent having been given after his arrest and the most recent in 2012 (see paragraphs 31 and 55 above).",

The Court is not convinced, and the Government did not argue otherwise, that the personnel of the detention facility were equipped to deal with a serious heart patient. The following events \u2013 the applicant suffering another heart attack on 14 September 2011 and his readmission to the prison hospital \u2013 strengthen the Court in this belief. The subsequent behaviour of the authorities when sending the applicant to the detention facility after a short-term assessment in the prison hospital only to return him to the hospital less than two weeks later is another example of the inadequate management of the applicant\u2019s health (see paragraphs 54 and 55 above).",

Another condition which contributed to the length of the proceedings was the applicant\u2019s state of health. While, in the Government\u2019s view, his health did not preclude his detention, the investigators had to take into account the applicant\u2019s inability, on health grounds, to participate in the investigation.

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or reoffending. It acknowledges that in view of the seriousness of the accusations against the applicant, the authorities could justifiably have considered that such an initial risk was established (see Ilijkov v.\u00a0Bulgaria, no.\u00a033977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80-81, 26\u00a0July 2001).

In particular, regard must be had to the character of the person involved, his morals and his assets (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 254A). Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v. Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the fact that the applicant had fled the country in 2007, had taken steps to conceal his trips to Russia, had substantial financial resources, had sold or given away property in the Russian Federation, and had secretly, and in violation of the established procedure, renewed his travel passport. The Court is satisfied that the totality of those factors, combined with other relevant grounds, provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour such as to lead to the belief that the risk of his absconding persisted.",

The Court reiterates that, as regards the risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses, at the initial stages of the proceedings the judicial authorities cited statements by victims and witnesses who had complained to the investigating authorities about threats mounted against them or incentives offered to them by the applicant\u2019s close circle. The authorities also considered that the applicant\u2019s substantial financial resources and his ties to the criminal environment would give him an opportunity to influence witnesses and to destroy evidence if released. In these circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that at the initial stage of the proceedings the courts could have validly presumed the existence of a risk that, if released, the applicant might abscond, reoffend or interfere with the proceedings, given the nature of his alleged criminal activities (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k v.

While not being convinced that the applicant\u2019s medical condition entirely mitigated the risk of his absconding so that it was no longer sufficient to outweigh his right to a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, the Court is of the opinion that the risk of collusion is such that it cannot be negated by the changes in the applicant\u2019s state of health to the extent that his detention is no longer warranted.",

The authorities considered the risk of pressure being brought to bear on the parties to the proceedings to be so real that they placed the prosecutor under security surveillance. The Court is also mindful of the fact that certain witnesses preferred to leave the country, fearing for their life and the lives of their family members. It understands that in such circumstances the authorities considered it necessary to keep the applicant detained in order to prevent him from disrupting the criminal proceedings. It reiterates that the fear of reprisal, justifiable in the present case, can often be enough for intimidated witnesses to withdraw from the criminal justice process altogether. The Court observes that the domestic courts carefully balanced the safety of the witnesses who had already given statements against the applicant, together with the prospect of other witnesses\u2019 willingness to testify, against the applicant\u2019s right to liberty.",

Russia, no. 72967/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a099 et seq., 1\u00a0March 2007; Khudobin\u00a0v. Russia, no.\u00a059696/00, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0103 et seq., ECHR 2006-... (extracts); and Mamedova v.

In the present case, the domestic courts cited specific facts in support of their conclusion that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings, having assessed the evolving circumstances and changes that affected the applicant\u2019s situation in the course of his detention. They also considered the possibility of applying alternative measures, but found them to be inadequate (see, for instance, paragraph 14 above) (see, for similar reasoning, Buldashev v. , no. 46793/06, \u00a7 99, 18 October 2011 and Bordikov v. , no. 921/03, \u00a7 92, 8 October 2009.",

In these circumstances, the Court also accepts that the need to obtain voluminous evidence from many sources, coupled with the existence of a general risk flowing from the organised nature of the applicant\u2019s alleged criminal activities, constituted relevant and sufficient grounds for extending the applicant\u2019s detention for the time necessary to complete the investigation, draw up the bill of indictment and hear evidence from the accused and witnesses in court. The Court does not underestimate the need for the domestic authorities to take statements from witnesses in a manner which will exclude any doubt as to their veracity. The Court thus concludes that, in the circumstances of this case, the risk of the applicant interfering with the course of justice actually did exist, and it justified holding him in custody (see, for similar reasoning, Celejewski v.\u00a0Poland, no. 17584/04, 4\u00a0May 2006, and \u0141aszkiewicz v. Poland, no. 28481/03, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60, 15 January 2008). The Court concludes that the circumstances of the case as described in the decisions of the domestic courts, including the applicant\u2019s personality and the nature of the crimes with which he is charged, reveal that his detention is based on \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds.",

The remoteness of the criminal acts in time from the institution of the criminal proceedings was another factor in complicating the investigators\u2019 task. Nor does the Court lose sight of the fact that the authorities need to balance the necessity to proceed with the investigation against an obligation to ensure that the applicant was fully fit to take part in it. The national authorities displayed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. In November 2011 the investigation was completed and the applicant\u2019s lawyers started studying the case file. It does not escape the Court\u2019s attention that that task had not yet been concluded in June 2012. The applicant did not argue that the authorities had, in any way, delayed that procedural action. In these circumstances, the Court reiterates that while an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and conducted with particular expedition, this must not stand in the way of the efforts of the authorities to clarify fully the facts in issue, to provide the defence with all the necessary facilities for putting forward their evidence and stating their case, and to give judgment only after careful reflection on whether the offences were in fact committed and on the sentence to be imposed (see, for similar reasoning, B\u0105k, cited above, \u00a7 64). At the same time, keeping in mind that the trial proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case are still pending and taking note of his remaining in detention since October 2010, the Court would like to remind the Russian authorities of their responsibility to display particular diligence while continuing dealing with the case.",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee and Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In this context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

There is nothing to suggest that the applicant caused delays in the examination of his appeals against the detention orders. The fact that the appeal court stayed the proceedings for two days to allow the applicant to consult his defence team does not alter this conclusion, given the total length of the appeal proceedings. The Court does not find any reasonable explanation for the court\u2019s decisions to grant up to two weeks to the prosecution to prepare responses to the applicant\u2019s appeal statements. Nor does it consider that in such an urgent matter as one concerning the right to liberty, the domestic courts acted diligently in taking up to twenty days to schedule the hearing. The Court thus finds that the two periods in question cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4, especially taking into account that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see, for example, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, \u00a7\u00a096, 1\u00a0June 2006; Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 198 and 203; and Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, ECHR 2000-XII, where review proceedings which lasted twenty-three days were not \u201cspeedy\u201d).",
