The group was accompanied by lieutenant V.G. and captain D.H. (hereafter, officers V.G. and D.H.). After the contest, the servicemen had been taken to a post office, outside which an argument had erupted between officers V.G. and D.H. on one side and Suren Muradyan on the other. Officer V.G. claimed that a watch that Suren Muradyan was wearing belonged to him and had been lost some days before, during a table tennis match. Officers V.G. and D.H. had both started swearing at Suren\u00a0Muradyan. Officer V.G. had then grabbed Suren Muradyan\u2019s hand and removed the watch. Suren\u00a0Muradyan had explained that he had borrowed the watch from a fellow serviceman, whose name he did not know, to wear at the comedy contest. Officers V.G. and D.H. did not believe him and gave him a deadline to reveal the identity of that person. They further claimed that a second watch had been lost and ordered Suren\u00a0Muradyan to find and bring it within the same deadline. Officer D.H. had threatened that, if he failed to do so, he would get into trouble. After the incident the group had walked to the bus to return to the military unit.

On 2 August a group of servicemen of the military unit had travelled to the town of Stepanakert (Nagorno Karabakh) to participate in another round of the contest. Suren\u00a0Muradyan had gone along but could not participate as he felt very unwell. The group had returned to the military unit from Stepanakert late at night and on the following day Suren\u00a0Muradyan had been taken to hospital.",

Asked about the discrepancies between the findings in those opinions, expert K.H. stated that it must have been an automatic mistake and admitted that she had not read one of the opinions before signing it. She further stated that the reason why no trace of malaria had been discovered at the Mekhakavan hospital could have been due to lack of proper equipment. She lastly stated that an enlarged spleen in a person suffering from malaria would become hard and filled with blood, the capsule would be strained and become more sensitive. Even a light blow might cause a sub-capsular rupture.",

When the latter had told the same story as the two other servicemen, officer K.Z. had become furious, started swearing and ordered serviceman G.M. to turn towards the wall, whereupon he had taken a 120\u00a0cm long pole and twice hit serviceman G.M. on his buttocks. Serviceman G.M. had started crying and after leaving the office he had asked Suren Muradyan and serviceman K.E. whether they had also been beaten, to which both of them replied \u201cno\u201d. The decision concluded that it was not necessary to prosecute officer K.Z. because he had no criminal record, was known to be of good character and regretted his actions. The motion of the Ministry of Defence of Nagorno Karabakh asking not to prosecute him was also taken into account.",

The applicant referred, in particular, to a witness statement by his son\u2019s fellow serviceman, according to which his son had woken up in the night of 24 July and complained that he was feeling ill. The same followed from the findings of the post-mortem examination, according to which the initial bruising had been inflicted 8-10 days before death. Furthermore, 24 July was the last day of the deadline fixed by the officers. The investigating authority was deliberately ignoring this evidence and had failed to clarify what had happened on that day, while the proceedings had been perfunctory and not objective and aimed to lead the case into an impasse and not to punish the murderers. The applicant further referred to the fact that serviceman G.M. had admitted that he had been ill-treated by officer K.Z. in his office. It followed from the decision of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of 24 November 2004 that the same had happened to his son. The accused, officer V.G., had also admitted in court that he had been outside officer K.Z.\u2019s office when the latter ill-treated Suren\u00a0Muradyan and that he had heard him scream. Furthermore, no explanation had been given for the second bruising and abrasion on the forehead sustained by his son 1-2 days before his death. The applicant further complained that the Regional Court had failed to clarify what was meant by the \u201cwell-known beating of Suren Muradyan\u201d referred to in the letter of the Head of the National Security Service of Nagorno Karabakh, as well as the circumstances and perpetrators of this beating.

No such request had been filed by the Prosecutor, while the investigating authority had carried out a thorough, full and objective investigation by examining a number of hypotheses, none of which confirmed that Suren\u00a0Muradyan had been ill-treated.

Even if the respondent Government did not explicitly contest the question of its jurisdiction, the Court nevertheless considers it necessary to examine whether the complaints concerning the events, which took place outside the territory of Armenia and concerned acts or omissions of the local Karabakhi authorities, can be considered to fall under the jurisdiction of the respondent Government and hence engage its responsibility under the Convention.",

Accordingly, the responsibility of Contracting States can be engaged by acts and omissions of their authorities which produce effects outside their own territory. In conformity with the relevant principles of international law governing State responsibility, the responsibility of a Contracting Party could also arise when as a consequence of military action - whether lawful or unlawful - it exercises effective control of an area outside its national territory. The obligation to secure, in such an area, the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention, derives from the fact of such control whether it be exercised directly, through its armed forces, or through a subordinate local administration (see Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996VI, and Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], nos.\u00a043370/04, 8252/05 and 18454/06, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106, ECHR 2012 (extracts)).",

Thus, having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, Turkey\u2019s responsibility could not be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but should also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survived by virtue of Turkish military and other support. It followed that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d should be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which she had ratified, and that violations of those rights were imputable to Turkey (see Cyprus v.

Armenia \u2013 it made a similar statement of principle as regards Armenia\u2019s general responsibility under the Convention. The Court found it to be established that from the early days of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Armenia had had a significant and decisive influence over Nagorno Karabakh, that the two entities were highly integrated in virtually all important matters and that this situation persisted to this day. In other words, Nagorno Karabakh and its administration survived by virtue of the military, political, financial and other support given to it by Armenia which, consequently, exercised effective control over Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding territories. The Court concluded that the matters complained of came within the jurisdiction of Armenia for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention (see Chiragov and Others v. Armenia [GC], no. 13216/05, \u00a7\u00a7 169-186, 16 June 2015). Thus, the Court considers that, by exercising effective control over Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding territories, Armenia is under an obligation to secure in that area the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention and its responsibility under the Convention cannot be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials operating in Nagorno Karabakh but is also engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Armenian military and other support (see Zalyan and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 214-215, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Djavit An v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 20652/92, \u00a7\u00a7 18-23, ECHR 2003III; and Amer v.

It notes in this respect that it is undisputed between the parties that Suren Muradyan died as a result of an injury to his spleen which initially resulted in its sub-capsular rupture and later in a full rupture and acute bleeding. It appears that medical negligence may also have contributed to his death. As regards the fatal injury, the authorities carried out an official investigation into this fact and concluded that it had been sustained on 21 July 2002 when officer V.G., during a public argument with Suren Muradyan, briskly shook his hand, as a result of which their hands \u2013 apparently accidentally \u2013 hit or touched the left side of Suren Muradyan\u2019s abdomen and caused the sub-capsular rupture of the spleen. The Court, however, has doubts about this explanation of Suren Muradyan\u2019s fatal injury in view of a number of serious flaws in the conduct of the investigation that led to those conclusions.",

The conflict had started with an argument on 21 July 2002 because of an allegedly stolen watch and Suren Muradyan had been given a deadline to comply with certain demands and had allegedly been threatened that he \u201cwould get into trouble\u201d and \u201cwould be punished\u201d if he failed to do so. Furthermore, a few days later (around 23-25 July 2002), apparently when the deadline expired, he was taken by those officers on several occasions to the headquarters, including officer K.Z.\u2019s office, where the threats allegedly continued. This also appears to be the period when Suren Muradyan started to feel unwell (see paragraphs 7, 22 and 23 above). Despite all this evidence which pointed to possible wrongdoing on the part of officers D.H., V.G. and K.Z., they were not immediately isolated and were not questioned until two, three and ten days later respectively (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above). The Court notes that, while there is no evidence to suggest that these officers colluded with each other, the mere fact that appropriate steps were not taken to reduce the risk of such collusion amounts to a significant shortcoming in the adequacy of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramsahai and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0330).",

No detailed questions were posed to the officers in an attempt to inquire about any possible ill-treatment to which Suren\u00a0Muradyan might have been subjected during those visits. The denial of any ill-treatment on their part was readily accepted without further inquiries, while in some case the interviews were largely confined to the taking of written statements where the officers were simply asked to recount the events of 21 July 2002 (see paragraphs 24, 25, 27, 28, 33 and 68 above).",

It is true that both of them, when questioned as witnesses, denied having any knowledge of Suren Muradyan having been subjected to ill-treatment during the visits to the headquarters (see paragraphs 23, 26, 37 and 47 above). However, it cannot be ruled out that their testimony was constrained and they did not speak out for fear of reprisals, given that those implicated were their superiors at the military unit where they continued to perform their military service, including such highranking officers as the acting commander of the unit, who was also its deputy commander. The investigating authority did not, however, consider taking any appropriate measures to address this possible problem, such as, for example, applying a protective measure under Articles 98 and 98.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by changing the place of service of the said witnesses and thereby guaranteeing their safety from any possible reprisals (see paragraph 115 above).",

Thus, on the one hand, the expert indicated a specific timeframe, namely 8-10 days, but, on the other hand, appears to have suggested that the bruising could have been sustained at any given point before that timeframe, thereby providing a very ambiguous answer to a crucial question and significantly diminishing the probative value of this evidence. The investigating authority failed to clarify this issue, including what the medical expert meant by \u201cmore than about 810 days\u201d (emphasis added), as well as the reasons why it had not been possible to indicate a more specific timeframe for the bruising while it was possible to do so in respect of the second bruising sustained in the same area (1-2 days before death).",

What is particularly striking is that officer K.Z. was actually implicated in inflicting violence in the context of the same story on one of the other two servicemen, G.M., who had been summoned to K.Z.\u2019s office together with Suren Muradyan for the same purpose. No importance was given to this fact and the authorities readily accepted the narrative in which only serviceman G.M., but not Suren Muradyan, had fallen victim to acts of violence (see paragraphs 90 and 92 above). There was no change in the course of the investigation even after two witnesses, K.B. and H.G., who had had contact with Suren Muradyan not long before his death, explicitly stated that they had been told by him that he had been ill-treated by officers V.G., D.H. and K.Z.

The Court notes that it was not until almost two years later that one of the implicated officers alleged that he had not previously told the whole truth and that there had actually been some accidental contact with Suren Muradyan\u2019s abdomen during the argument of 21 July 2002 (see paragraph 64 above). The investigating authority readily accepted this allegation, even if there was no objective evidence to support it, and the entire subsequent investigation, including all the medical expertise, appears to have been geared towards justifying the narrative that the first bruising and the sub-capsular rupture of the spleen had been sustained as a result of that accidental contact.
