It is to be noted that the applicant's article contributed to a regular rubric which informed readers of the material welfare of different political figures.

It notes in this regard that, as acknowledged by the Government, no such information was contained in Mr\u00a0Lominadze's property declaration. The Court further observes that the applicant's article described the kind and value of the assets exactly as disclosed by the parliamentarian's declaration (paragraph\u00a028 above). Consequently, whilst the applicant could not be said to have either knowingly distorted or recklessly disregarded the publicly available information about the origin of the parliamentarian's assets, the Court finds that she, as a journalist, was entitled, when contributing to the public debate on a matter of legitimate concern, to rely on the contents of the property declaration - an official document - without having to undertake independent research. To hold otherwise would undermine the vital role of public-watchdog which the press fulfils in a democratic society (see Colombani and Others v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a051279/99, \u00a7\u00a065, ECHR\u00a02002V).",
