It is not the Court\u2019s role to determine what measures the national authorities should have taken in these circumstances to ensure that the detention pending extradition, which had already exceeded a reasonable time by 24 January 1991, did not last even longer, especially in view of the fact that such detention could not be deducted from the sentence imposed in France.",
