Patients who do not respond to treatment and chronic cases should always be assessed for possible drug resistance. For patients in whom drug resistance is considered to be likely, culture and drug susceptibility testing should be performed promptly (Standard 14). Persons who are in close contact with confirmed multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis patients also are at high risk of being infected with multidrug-resistant strains. In some closed settings, prisoners, persons staying in shelters for the homeless and certain categories of immigrants and migrants are at increased risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis caused by drug-resistant organisms should be treated with special dietary regimes containing second-line antituberculosis drugs. At least four drugs to which the organisms are known or presumed to be susceptible should be used (Standard 15).",
