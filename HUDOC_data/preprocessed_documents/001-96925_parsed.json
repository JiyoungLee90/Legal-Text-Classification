He then said that Mr\u00a0Powell\u2019s statement was three-quarters lies and proceeded to give his own version of events. He said that if he spoke the truth he would go to jail, but he wanted to leave a free man as he did not kill Mr Seymour. He said that the \u201cmental Lahee patient\u201d (a reference to Mr Powell) had killed Mr Seymour. He\u00a0claimed that on the night in question, he had been looking for women but that Mr Powell had dragged him away with him. They were picked up by Mr Seymour, whom Mr Powell instructed to drive to an address which caused the applicant surprise. When the taxi stopped, Mr Powell grabbed Mr Seymour from behind and demanded money. The applicant found 200\u00a0dollars in the ashtray. The applicant was armed with a knife and Mr\u00a0Powell asked for the knife because Mr Seymour had seen their faces. The applicant gave Mr Powell the knife and Mr Powell stabbed Mr\u00a0Seymour, using both hands. Mr Powell then tried to pull the deceased out of the van but was unable to do so. He told the applicant to get rid of the knife by throwing it in the bushes. The applicant then undid Mr Seymour\u2019s seatbelt and Mr Powell pulled the deceased from the van and, after searching the body, dragged it to the dumpster. The applicant described how he had driven the van to the swamp area and tried to dispose of the vehicle by putting a rock on the accelerator, but this was unsuccessful. He threw the car keys into the bushes because he thought his fingerprints would be on them. As the applicant and Mr Powell left the scene, the applicant saw that Mr Powell had Mr Seymour\u2019s mobile telephone. Mr Powell wanted to use the phone to ask someone to come and collect them, but the applicant told Mr Powell that he was crazy as the police would be able to trace the call. Mr\u00a0Powell threw the mobile telephone away. The applicant removed his shirt and jacket and gave them to Mr Powell, who threw them away. They\u00a0were subsequently met by a friend of Mr Powell, who gave the latter a shirt which he in turn gave to the applicant.",

Nor is there anything to suggest that, even shortly after the trial, he complained to any fellow prisoner, or court official or prison officer. The first time that such a complaint emerges is some nine months later in his amended grounds of appeal dated 24 October 2001 and in his affidavit dated two days earlier. Of course, the delay in making the complaint does not show that it is unsound, but it is a factor to be taken into account. An appeal court must always bear in mind the distinct possibility that such a complaint may be fabricated \u2013 indeed that is precisely why there should be a contemporaneous written record of the decision that the defendant is not to give evidence.",

In para 6 of this judgment their Lordships have already drawn attention to one such occasion when, at the conclusion of the second voir dire, Mr St John Stevens took time to explain to Mr Ebanks that the cross-examination in the voir dire would, in effect, be held repeated in the main trial. Earlier, during the evidence of Julie Harris, Mr St John Stevens had asked for a break of five minutes to seek clarification of a point \u2013 although this is not said explicitly, it appears likely that the clarification was to come from his client.",

It would make absolutely no sense to suppose that when he had taken care in these relatively minor matters, he had simultaneously been riding roughshod over Mr Ebanks\u2019 views as to whether he should give evidence.

It may be that he thought it better tactically not to challenge the evidence of the police officers head-on. It may be, as Mr Perry suggested, that his overall strategy was to keep as low a profile as possible and to rely on Powell\u2019s evidence that Ebanks was not present when he killed Curtis Seymour. This would be consistent with the way in which counsel for Powell went first in cross-examination, even though Mr Ebanks was named first on the indictment.

That these were the applicant\u2019s instructions was supported by the evidence of Mr McGrath. Evidence of other lawyers involved in the case did not contradict this position. Both the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council found that the applicant\u2019s lawyers had complied with his instructions.

There was nothing in the record of proceedings to support his allegation. On the contrary, the record of the voir dire hearings showed that the trial judge had positively encouraged the applicant to give evidence.

However, in the absence of such a record, the question whether the applicant chose to remain silent of his own free will was a question of fact to be resolved on the basis of the evidence available. In the present case, the Court notes that the Court of Appeal had the benefit of affidavits from the applicant and his trial counsel. The clear picture which emerged from the affidavits of counsel was a denial of the allegation contained in the applicant\u2019s affidavit that he had failed to understand the implications of not giving evidence.\u00a0The Court of Appeal also considered it significant that the applicant\u2019s counsel were experienced lawyers and had met with him regularly before the trial to discuss his case (see paragraph 35 above). Further, the Court observes that Lord Rodger, on behalf of the majority in the Privy Council, examined the applicant\u2019s complaint afresh. With the benefit of a full transcript of the trial proceedings, he noted that the applicant had not raised this complaint at any time during trial and that it was first made some nine months after the conclusion of the trial (see paragraph 39 above). He further emphasised that the record of the trial showed the time and care taken by Mr St John Stevens to ensure that the applicant understood the proceedings and agreed to the steps taken on his behalf, citing specific examples (see paragraph 40 above). Finally, he pointed out that, given the difficulties that the applicant\u2019s refusal to give evidence was likely to create for counsel\u2019s presentation of his defence, it was hard to see why counsel would have \u201cdeliberately flouted\u201d the applicant\u2019s wish to give evidence (see paragraph 41 above).",

The court having found that the applicant\u2019s decision not to give evidence was freely made, it necessarily followed that he could not claim any unfairness from the failure of his counsel to present a positive case (see paragraph 36 above). The Court considers that if the applicant\u2019s counsel wrongly advised him that, in light of his decision not to give evidence, they were unable to dispute the making of the statement, then this error was so fundamental that it deprived the applicant of a fair trial.

However, Lord Rodger concluded that the point did not arise on the facts of the applicant\u2019s case as the Court of Appeal had proceeded on a basis for which there was no foundation in the lawyers\u2019 affidavits (see paragraph 43 above). Like Lord Rodger, the Court considers that there was nothing in the affidavit evidence to suggest that Mr St John Stevens had proceeded as he did because he thought it would be professionally improper to put to the police officers that the applicant had not made the statement when he was not going to give evidence in support of the submission (see paragraphs 28 and 31 to 32). The Court of Appeal did not find that counsel had advised the applicant thus (see paragraph 36 above). Further, the applicant himself did not allege, either in his affidavit or in his written submissions to this Court, that he had been advised that it was improper for counsel to challenge the statement in light of his refusal to give evidence.

Both Mr McGrath and Mr St John Stevens were clear in their affidavits as to the content of the applicant\u2019s instructions and the fact that they had acted in accordance with those instructions (see\u00a0paragraphs 31 to 32 above). In the circumstances, the Court does not consider the conclusions of the Privy Council to be manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary.",

However, the relevant question for the applicant\u2019s appeal was not whether he denied making the confession but whether he instructed his solicitors to present a positive case to that effect at trial. As noted above, the lawyers\u2019 affidavits were clear on this point. Mr\u00a0McGrath noted that, \u201cWhilst it is correct to say that no positive case was ever put in relation to [the applicant\u2019s denial that he made a statement] this was upon the appellant\u2019s instructions ... Because he would not give evidence the appellant chose not to put his case about not making the confession to the police officers in the course of the trial proper\u201d (see\u00a0paragraph 31 above). Mr St John Stevens said, \u201cThe appellant\u2019s instructions were that the Crown should be put to proof as to establishing that the confession in issue was made voluntarily and that no positive case would be put over and above this issue ... I am satisfied that the appellant\u2019s case was presented in accordance with and upon clear and unequivocal instructions\u201d (see paragraph 32 above). The position of counsel was, in this respect, unambiguous and there was therefore no requirement for the court to hear viva voce evidence on the matter.",
