The case originated in fifteen applications (nos. 8803/02, 8804/02, 8805/02, 8806/02, 8807/02, 8808/02, 8809/02, 8810/02, 8811/02, 8813/02, 8815/02, 8816/02, 8817/02, 8818/02 and 8819/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by fifteen Turkish nationals, Mr Abdullah Doğan, Mr Cemal Doğan, Mr Ali Rıza Doğan, Mr Ahmet Doğan, Mr Ali Murat Doğan, Mr Hasan Yıldız, Mr Hıdır Balık, Mr İhsan Balık, Mr Kazım Balık, Mr Mehmet Doğan, Mr Müslüm Yılmaz, Mr Hüseyin Doğan, Mrs Geyik Doğan (the wife of Yusuf Doğan, who died on 8 December 2004), Mr Hüseyin Doğan and Mr Ali Rıza Doğan (“the applicants”), on 3 December 2001.
In a judgment delivered on 29 June 2004 (“the principal judgment”), the Court held that there had been a violation of Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. More specifically, as regards Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court held that, as a result of their inability to have access to their possessions, the applicants had had to bear an individual and excessive burden which had upset the fair balance which should be struck between the requirements of the general interest and the protection of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions (Doğan and Others v. , nos. 8803-8811/02, 8813/02 and 88158819/02, §§ 155-156, ECHR 2004VI).
Under Article 41 of the Convention the applicants sought just satisfaction amounting to several million euros (EUR) in respect of damage sustained and also for costs and expenses.
Since the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicants to submit, within six months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., § 168, and point 8 of the operative provisions).
The applicants submitted their observations on 23 January 2003, 5 August 2003 and 23 June 2005. The Government replied on 18 June 2003 and 10 May 2005.
Meanwhile, subsequent to the adoption of the principal judgment in the instant case, the authorities of the respondent State have taken several measures, including enacting the Compensation Law of 27 July 2004, with a view to redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages. The Court examined the implementation of the compensation law in a “test case” (see İçyer v. Turkey (dec.), no. 18888/02, 12 January 2006), and ruled that the Government could be deemed to have fulfilled their duty to review the systemic situation at issue and to introduce an effective remedy (ibid., § 86). Accordingly, it found that the applicants should be required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention to apply to the relevant compensation commissions under the Law of 27 July 2004 and to claim compensation for the damage they had sustained as a result of their inability to gain access to their possessions. The Court therefore rejected almost 1,500 similar applications under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.
