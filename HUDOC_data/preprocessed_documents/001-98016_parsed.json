France, no.\u00a061517/00, \u00a7\u00a027, 31 March 2005). In this context, the Court reiterates that while the independence and impartiality of the prosecutor or similar officer may not be open to criticism, the public's increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice justifies the growing importance attached to appearances (see Borgers v. Belgium, 30\u00a0October 1991, \u00a7\u00a024, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0214-B).",

The Court noted in that context that in making such an assessment the focus should be on the legitimacy of the reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality and on whether this fear could be held to be objectively justified (ibid). In the context of the principle of equality of arms, in the case of Stoimenov v. \u201cthe \u201d (no.\u00a017995/02, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42, 5 April 2007) the Court also referred to \u201cappearances\u201d when concluding that an opinion submitted by the Forensic Science Bureau, a State agency, was akin to incriminating evidence used by the prosecution and that the refusal of an alternative expert examination and the applicant's inability to challenge the Bureau's report in the circumstances of that case had resulted in a violation of the equality of arms (see also Shulepova v. Russia, no. 34449/03, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, 11 December 2008).",

While it is uncontested that the prosecutor confined his participation in the proceedings to a mere statement of approval of the first-instance decision concerning the application of the statutory time-limit, the Court sees no reason to speculate on what effect such intervention may have had on the course of the proceedings. However it finds that the mere repeating by the prosecutor of the respondents' arguments on points of law, unless it aimed at influencing the court, appeared meaningless (see Menchinskaya, cited above, \u00a7 38). The foregoing considerations have led the Court to conclude that the principle of the equality of arms, requiring a fair balance between the parties, was not respected in the present case.",
