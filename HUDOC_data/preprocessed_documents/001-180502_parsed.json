The interference pursued a legitimate socialpolicy aim, specifically the social protection of tenants. However, the applicants, fully aware of the factual and legal situation, opted of their own free will to purchase the property and to enter into the existing agreement with J.G., whose emphyteusis had just been converted into a lease on 15 June 1987, and from whom they continued to receive rent.

In that case, when the applicants had acquired their respective properties their rents had been set in accordance with the rent regulations applicable at the time and the applicants could not have increased the rents above the threshold set by the State. Nor were they free to terminate the rent agreements and conclude new ones with different \u2013 higher \u2013 levels of rent.

The Court held that it could not be said that the applicants as landlords had implicitly waived their right to set the level of rents, as, for the Court, waiving a right necessarily presupposed that it would have been possible to exercise it. There was no waiver of a right in a situation where the person concerned had never had the option of exercising that right and thus could not waive it.

However, again the Court finds this not to be decisive given the passage of time between the purchase of the property and now. In this connection the Court reiterates that what might be justified at a specific time might not be justified decades later (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060). In the present case, while it is true that the applicants knowingly entered into the rent agreement in 1988 with the relevant restrictions (specifically the inability to increase the rent or to terminate the lease), the Court considers that the applicants could not reasonably have foreseen the extent of inflation in property prices in the decades that followed (see Zammit and Attard Cassar, cited above, \u00a7 50). Once the discrepancy in the rent applied and that on the market became evident, they were unable to do anything more than attempt to use the available remedies, which they did in 2010, but which were to no avail in their circumstances. The decisions of the domestic courts regarding their application thus constituted interference in their respect. Furthermore, the applicants, who bought a property that was already subject to a restricted lease, did not have the possibility to set the rent themselves or to freely terminate the agreement. Clearly, they could not be said to have waived any rights in that connection (see Zammit and Attard\u00a0Cassar, cited above,\u00a0\u00a7\u00a050).",

Thus, the needs and the general interest which may have existed in 1979 must have decreased over the three decades that ensued (see Anthony Aquilina, cited above, \u00a7 65). It is noted that as stated by the Government in paragraph 40 above, the minimum wage in 2015 was EUR\u00a0720.46 per month, while in 1974 (the date when Malta adopted a national minimum wage) it amounted to the equivalent of less than EUR\u00a0100 per month (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 60).",

Furthermore, the Government of the respondent State have often argued that Malta suffered a boom in property prices in 2003 (see, for example, Apap Bologna v.\u00a0Malta, no. 46931/12, \u00a7\u00a097, 30\u00a0August 2016). Lastly, although not determinative, it was only in 2008 that the applicants refused to accept the rent, once P.G. had inherited the property. In the light of the above it suffices for the Court to consider that a rent based on the value of the property as it stood in 1962 with the relevant adjustment which amounted to EUR 466 annually in 1988 and thereafter \u2013 was certainly not reasonable for the years following 2000.",

Thus, the amount of rent received by the applicants, around EUR 39 a month, that is to say EUR 466 per year, for a fourteen-room house in Sliema, a highly sought-after location, is indeed \u201cderisory\u201d as was also found by the first-instance domestic court (see paragraph 18 above). Indeed, that amount of rent contrasts sharply with the market value of the premises in recent years, as accepted by the domestic court or as submitted by the applicant, as it amounted to a little more than\u00a01% of the market value. The Court considers that State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable. Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

The Government noted that the sub-emphyteusis relative to the property in this case had been converted to a lease in 1987 and such a lease had been a controlled lease which had been based on free market lease values of the 1960s.

The fact that the effects of the impugned law were abolished in respect of contracts concluded after 1995, a decision which fell within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, could be deemed reasonably and objectively justified to protect owners from restrictions impinging on their rights (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 69-73).

Moreover, comparing the threshold of EUR 185 per annum with the minimum wage applicable in Malta, it was evident that even persons on the minimum wage would be able to rent property for an amount higher than EUR 185 per annum.",

Nevertheless, it cannot but note that the concept \u201cvery low\u201d is not a numerical consideration, but needs to be assessed relatively to, inter alia, the size, state or location of the property at issue (hereinafter referred to as its \u201cworth\u201d). Indeed the fact that an owner received less than EUR 185 for a property of a certain worth, does not mean that he or she suffered less of an excessive burden than others who received EUR 185 or more, for a property of more worth. Similarly, it cannot be said that those receiving less than EUR 185 were less prosperous, since an owner may have had various properties affected by the rent laws in place in Malta which benefited from this reform, as well as other movable or immovable property or capital. It is evident that a person owning various properties of less worth may be just as wealthy as a person owning only one property of more worth \u2013 it follows that neither can it be said that the 2009 amendments aimed at helping the neediest of protection. Furthermore, as noted by the Government (see paragraph 76 above), the 2009 amendments applied both to property owners who had originally rented out their property on an open market and had later had a restricted regime by operation of law imposed (as in the present case), as well as others whose properties had always been subject to controlled rents. It is clear therefore that the amendments were not aimed at property owners who had been affected prior to the 1979 laws, and who were arguably in a worse position given that in some cases such rents were tied to 1914 values. Thus, as admitted by the Government the sole aim of the law was to increase rents which were lower than EUR 185. This decision appears to have been solely based on a random choice of a numerical figure, with no real legitimate aim save that of creating an artificial distinction.",

It therefore considers that interest should be added to the award in order to compensate for the loss of value of the award over time (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos.\u00a042949/98 and 53134/99, \u00a7\u00a052, 10\u00a0May 2007). As such, the interest rate should reflect national economic conditions such as levels of inflation and rates of interest (see, for example, Akku\u015f v. Turkey, 9 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, \u00a7 35; Romanchenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a05596/03, 22 November 2005, \u00a7 30, unpublished; and Prodan v.\u00a0Moldova, no. 49806/99, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004-III (extracts)). It notes that the applicants claimed the statutory rate of eight per cent, and the Government\u2019s objection in that respect. The Court considers that a rate of five per cent interest is more realistic (see Amato Gauci, cited above, \u00a7 78, and Ghigo v.\u00a0Malta (just satisfaction), no.\u00a031122/05, \u00a7 20, 17\u00a0July 2008) thus a one-off payment at 5% interest should be added (see Anthony\u00a0Aquilina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a072, in fine).",
