In accordance with national and international practice, the Court is competent to examine facts which occurred during the proceedings before it and constitute a mere extension or the facts complained of at the outset, in particular in matters of detention while on remand (see, as a classic authority, St\u00f6gm\u00fcller v. Austria, 10\u00a0November 1969, \u00a7 7, Series A no. 9; and the case-law cited in Novokreshchin v. Russia, no.\u00a040573/08, \u00a7\u00a016, 27 November 2014). The moment of lodging the application or communication of the complaint to the respondent Government is therefore immaterial and the statement of facts, prepared by the Court\u2019s Registry, does not bind the Court or delimit the scope of the complaint. It is a working document containing a summary of the applicant\u2019s submissions which, upon the preliminary examination of the application and documents submitted, give the Court reason to believe that the case reveals prima facie evidence of a violation of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ananyev and Others v. Russia, nos. 42525/07 and\u00a060800/08, \u00a7\u00a0122, 10\u00a0January 2012). It is incumbent on the parties to verify the accuracy of the statement of facts and to submit such documents, which are in their possession or which are readily available to the State authorities concerned, as are necessary to complement the description of the circumstances of the case (see paragraph 7 above and Rule 44A of the Rules of Court).",
