In addition, such acts of torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the connivance of a public official or any other person acting in such an official capacity. In this respect, we speak of delictum proprium, that is to say torture can only be committed, to put it simply, by an agent of the State.",

The issue in Rehbock v. Slovenia, for example, was whether the physical resistance of a body-builder did or did not necessitate the use of physical force, i.e., whether or not it was incidental to the lawful sanction constituted by his arrest.",

Given the reception of the definition of the UN Convention\u2019s Article 1 in Selmouni v.
