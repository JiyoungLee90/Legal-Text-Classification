The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no. 25).",

In the Court\u2019s opinion, these considerations hold true in the present case. It accordingly finds that the applicant\u2019s detention in remand prison no.\u00a0IZ-66/1 from 15 March to 4\u00a0August 2005 in overcrowded cells where he was not provided with an individual bed amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.
