Turkey, no. 29871/96, ECHR 2005-XII). In the Court\u2019s view, the authorities are not entitled to maintain over lengthy periods restrictions on an individual\u2019s freedom of movement without a periodic reassessment of their justification (see Riener, cited above, \u00a7 124). However, such a reassessment never took place in the applicant\u2019s case, which means that the travel ban was in reality an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration, which ended only by virtue of an intervening change in the legislation.",
