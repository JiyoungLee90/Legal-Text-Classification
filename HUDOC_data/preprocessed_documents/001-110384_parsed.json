In their reasoning in those other cases, the courts explained, inter alia, that the claim for damages was justified on grounds of their disability and that the employer had to compensate them according to the extent to which the work-related illness had caused the disability. At the same time, the courts found that the claimants\u2019 redundancy and the accompanying payment, which the claimants had received, had nothing to do with the legal grounds for seeking damages for their disability.

Therefore, the said judgment cannot be considered relevant in the present case (see paragraph 55 above).

Therefore, only three decisions were rendered in favour of claimants who were in an identical situation to the applicants. These decisions, one rendered by the Court of First Instance and two by the High Court, were never examined by the Supreme Court as the respondent in question had failed to lodge an appeal or an appeal on points of law (see paragraphs 35-36 above).",
