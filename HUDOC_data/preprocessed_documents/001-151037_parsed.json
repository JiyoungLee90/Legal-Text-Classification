The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. It considered it established that the search of the applicants\u2019 legal offices and the seizure of their computers constituted an interference with their right to respect for \u201cprivate life\u201d, \u201chome\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d (see, among other authorities, Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a029-32, Series A no. 251B; and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v. Austria, no. 74336/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a043-45, ECHR 2007IV).",

Accordingly, it is prepared to accept the Government\u2019s argument that the search was lawful in domestic terms and pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime. It remains to be ascertained, accordingly, whether the impugned measures were \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, in other words, whether the relationship between the aim sought to be achieved and the means employed can be considered proportionate (see Robathin v.

Therefore the searching of lawyers\u2019 premises should be subject to especially strict scrutiny (see Elci and Others v. , nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, \u00a7 669, 13 November 2003). To determine whether these measures were \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the Court has to explore the availability of effective safeguards against abuse or arbitrariness under domestic law and to check how those safeguards operated in the specific case under examination. Elements taken into consideration in this regard are the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure have been effected, whether they were carried out pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge or a judicial officer (or subjected to after-the-fact judicial scrutiny), whether the warrant was based on reasonable suspicion and whether its scope was reasonably limited. The Court must also review the manner in which the search was executed, and \u2013 where a lawyer\u2019s office is concerned \u2013 whether it was carried out in the presence of an independent observer to ensure that material subject to legal professional privilege was not removed. The Court must finally take into account the extent of the possible repercussions on the work and the reputation of the persons affected by the search (see, among other authorities, Kolesnichenko v.\u00a0Russia, no. 19856/04, \u00a7\u00a031, 9 April 2009).",

However, the Court is mindful of the fact that \u2012 as argued by the applicants, and not contested by the Government \u2012 only lawyer I.T. had been suspected of being an accessory to the crime. The applicants were not the subjects of any criminal investigation. Nevertheless, the District Court stated that the law firm had been one of the signatories to the fictitious contract and authorised the search of the firm\u2019s entire premises. Having regard to the above, the Court cannot accept that the search warrant was based on reasonable suspicion.",

It did not explain why it would not be sufficient to search only the office and the computer used by I.T. Moreover, in issuing the warrant the judge did not touch upon the issue of whether privileged material was to be safeguarded, although he was aware that the applicants were bar members and possessed documents covered by attorney-client privilege. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, search warrants have to be drafted, as far as practicable, in a manner calculated to keep their impact within reasonable bounds (see Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, \u00a7\u00a041, 22 May 2008; and Van Rossem v. Belgium, no. 41872/98, \u00a7 45, 9\u00a0December 2004). This requirement was manifestly disregarded in the present case.",

The investigator seized all the applicants\u2019 computers. The Court notes that during the search no safeguard was in place to prevent interference with professional secrecy, such as, for example, a prohibition on removing documents covered by attorney-client privilege or supervision of the search by an independent observer capable of identifying, independently of the investigation team, which documents were covered by such privilege (see Sallinen and Others v. , no.\u00a050882/99, \u00a7\u00a089, 27\u00a0September 2005; and Tamosius v.\u00a0the\u00a0United\u00a0Kingdom (dec.), no.\u00a062002/00, ECHR 2002-VIII). The presence of two attesting witnesses obviously could not be considered a sufficient safeguard, given that they were laymen without any legal qualifications and therefore unable to identify privileged material (see Iliya\u00a0Stefanov, cited above, \u00a7 43). Moreover, as regards the electronic data held on the applicants\u2019 computers which were seized by the investigator, it does not seem that any sort of sifting procedure was followed during the search (see Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH, cited above, \u00a7 63).",
