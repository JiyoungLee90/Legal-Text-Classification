It stated that after the first applicant\u2019s conviction in 2006, the Aliens Police had refrained from issuing an exclusion order against her, because she had already been living in Austria for over 17 years and held a permanent residence permit. The authorities stated that at that point they did not consider that she posed a serious threat to public order and security within the meaning of section 86 \u00a7 1 of the Aliens Police Act. However, her most recent conviction did justify the assumption that her further stay in Austria endangered public order and safety. The exclusion order was necessary to protect the economic wellbeing of Austria and to prevent criminal activities, hence it was in accordance with Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It further held that even though the exclusion order constituted an interference with her private and family life, because her children and her parents lived in Austria, the public interest in her expulsion outweighed her interest in remaining in the country.",

It took into consideration the nature and seriousness of the offences the first applicant had committed and the resulting personality profile, reiterating that she had started her criminal activities shortly after her arrival in Austria. Her latest criminal conviction was based on numerous offences against private property, serving her as a source of income. She had therefore demonstrated that she did not respect the property of others, and that she constituted a danger to the public because of her fraudulent activities, which she had committed over a long period of time. Previous convictions for bodily harm and assault on a police officer showed that she did not shy away from attacks on life and limb either. Because she was serving her sentence at the time of the decision, it could not be assumed that the danger emanating from her person had diminished, which was why the unlimited exclusion order was justified.",

The exclusion order therefore constituted an interference with her rights under Article 8 of the Convention. However, due to her criminal record and the serious nature of her offences, the public interest in her expulsion outweighed her personal interest in respect of her private and family life. Furthermore, because of the short distance between Bratislava and Vienna of around one hour by train, it would be possible for her family members to visit her frequently. The first applicant came to Austria when she was 24 years old, speaks the Slovak language and could easily reintegrate in her country of origin. Because of the seriousness of her crimes, and because the presence of her family members in Austria could not deter her from repeatedly committing offences, the exclusion order was proportionate to the aim pursued. Because it was not possible to assess when the first applicant would cease to represent a danger, there was no reason to limit the exclusion order. The Independent Administrative Panel added that the first applicant could apply for the lifting of the exclusion order after an appropriate interval, and in any event three years after its enforcement, if the circumstances for its issue had changed significantly.",

On this particular point, the Court reiterates that there is a broad consensus, including in international law, in support of the idea that in all decisions concerning children, their best interests are of paramount importance (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.\u00a0Switzerland, cited above, \u00a7 135, and X v. Latvia, cited above, \u00a7 96). Whilst alone they cannot be decisive, such interests certainly must be afforded significant weight. Accordingly, national decision-making bodies should, in principle, advert to and assess evidence in respect of the practicality, feasibility and proportionality of any removal of a non-national parent in order to give effective protection and sufficient weight to the best interests of the children directly affected by it (see Jeunesse v.\u00a0the\u00a0Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, \u00a7 109, 3 October 2014). In this context, reference is made to Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in accordance with which the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions taken by public authorities concerning children (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.

The most severe sanction imposed on her was a three-year prison sentence. Between her conviction in 2002 and her last conviction in 2008, there was no significant period during which she was not involved in criminal activities. In particular, the last conviction must be considered serious. The Court observes in that context that the first applicant\u2019s offences became increasingly serious over time. It appears, however, that she did not reoffend after her release from prison in December 2010.",

In that context, the Court notes that the exclusion order was issued in September\u00a02008 and will cease to be in force in September 2016, irrespective of whether the first applicant actually left the country (see paragraph 29 above). Because the first applicant was not expelled until December 2012, the exclusion order factually only affects the applicants for less than four years.",

However, she speaks the language and spent the formative years of her childhood and adolescence there. Also, Slovakia is a neighbouring state of Austria and a fellow Member State of the European Union, and there are frequent public transport connections between Vienna, where her family lives, and Bratislava, where she was expelled to.

The separation of mother and child at that time appears to have caused both of them severe psychological problems. The first applicant\u2019s expulsion in 2012 without doubt caused another disruption of their family life. However, after her release from prison, the first applicant could not have reasonably expected to be granted further leave to remain in Austria and continue her family life with her son there, as the exclusion order against her had already been legally binding at that time.",
