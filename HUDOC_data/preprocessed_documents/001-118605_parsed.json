According to his original statement to the prosecutor, the applicant had been residing permanently in Russia since 2008. He had not applied for political asylum in Russia before his arrest. Although the applicant had lost his passport in 2010, he did not contact the embassy of Tajikistan to obtain a new one.

At the first questioning he mentioned that he had come to Russia to find work, not out of fear of persecution. At the hearing the applicant stated that he had attended a political gathering in 1995, but that his role had been limited to giving a lift in a car to his relatives and taking them to the venue of the gathering. He denied having been involved in any political anti-governmental activity in Tajikistan. His activity in the Vatandor political movement was minimal: he simply shared their political opinions. The court observed that the applicant\u2019s brother, Mr B. Azimov, was serving a prison sentence in Tajikistan; however, other members of his family, including his elder brother Mr R. Azimov, were all living in Tajikistan. The applicant\u2019s first wife lived in Tajikistan with their five children and his second wife had been able to leave Tajikistan freely and come to Russia. His family owned ten\u00a0hectares of orchards near a recreational zone. He was able for many years to maintain himself and his family with his earnings from selling dried fruit in Russia. The authorities thus did not interfere with his business interests or those of his family, despite the allegedly political underpinning of the case against him. His own testimony about the political nature of the prosecution was inconsistent. He first stated that the criminal case against him resulted from personal animosity between him and the chief of the local police following a quarrel in a caf\u00e9. Later in the court proceedings the applicant suggested that the criminal prosecution had been instituted so that his family\u2019s land could be taken away.",

The Minsk Convention on Legal Assistance in civil and criminal matters of 1993, other agreements between CIS countries ... offer general language about protection against abuse, but they operate more meaningfully as international cooperation in law enforcement.

The protection afforded by Article 3 of the Convention allows no balancing of the risk of harm if the person is sent back against the danger he or she may represent to the community if not sent back and is, therefore, broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 138, and Muminov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 42502/06, \u00a7 89, 11 December 2008).

The story presented by the applicant to the Russian authorities was substantially different from the one contained in the extradition requests from Tajikistan and public statements of the Tajikistani authorities. The applicant was wanted in Tajikistan not for being a member of Vatandor but on charges of aiding the IMU, deemed to be a terrorist organisation (see paragraphs 12-13 above). The applicant was arrested on the basis of the extradition request accompanied by the indictments dated 26 and 30 March 2009.

The Court has found that such persons were at an increased risk of ill-treatment and that their extradition would give rise to a violation of Article 3. In the case of Iskandarov v. Russia, no.\u00a017185/05, 23 September 2010, the Court found that the forced removal to Tajikistan of the applicant, who had been charged, inter alia, with terrorism and gangsterism in a religious context, was in breach of Russia\u2019s obligation to protect him against ill-treatment.",

Where the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7\u00a0164, ECHR 2009, with further references). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1, and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Rustamov, cited above, \u00a7 150, with further references).",

Nevertheless, they did not cite that ground for detaining him until the time-limit provided for the detention pending extradition had expired. It was the Moscow Regional Court examining the applicant\u2019s extradition case which recommended that the law-enforcement authorities re-detain the applicant on this new ground (see paragraph 57 above). Most importantly, the applicant was detained \u201cwith a view to expulsion\u201d while the extradition proceedings were still going on (see paragraph 61 above). The Court is aware that the Russian authorities have occasionally used the expulsion (administrative removal) procedure instead of extradition (see paragraph 84 above). The applicant\u2019s extradition was \u201cunder the control of the President of the Russian Federation\u201d (see paragraph 28 above), which implies that handing him over to the Tajikistani authorities (no matter whether as a result of expulsion or extradition) must have been regarded as a top priority. All this supports the applicant\u2019s claim that the authorities abused their power to order the \u201cexpulsion detention\u201d, and that the new ground for detention was cited primarily to circumvent the requirements of the domestic law, which set a maximum time-limit for \u201cextradition detention\u201d.

This will admittedly be done; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 \u00a7 1 of the CAO for the applicant\u2019s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting duration of the detention of an illegal alien is not set clearly in the law. It is also unclear what would happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant would clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and would again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on this ground.",
