Nor did the applicant plead before the trial court that the inquiry into his allegations had not been thorough or ask the trial court to conduct further inquiry. Lastly, the Government observed that the applicant had been represented by an experienced criminal lawyer and it would not have been excessively burdensome for him to lodge an appeal against the investigator\u2019s decision, which would be a normal avenue of exhaustion of remedies in respect of his complaint.

The Court takes cognisance of the Government\u2019s argument that those injuries were not serious. However, this alone cannot rule out the possibility that the treatment was severe enough to be considered inhuman or degrading. The Court considers that the abrasions and bruises noted by the prison doctor indicated that the applicant\u2019s injuries were, as such, sufficiently serious. Accordingly, the question before the Court in the instant case is whether the State should be held responsible under Article 3 in respect of these injuries.",

However, it does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant was a practising martial arts instructor and that he had effectively resisted the legitimate actions of the police officers by refusing to comply with their verbal demands to stop the unruly behaviour, and by assaulting one of them (see, by contrast, Rehbock v. , no. 29462/95, \u00a7\u00a072, ECHR 2000XII).",
