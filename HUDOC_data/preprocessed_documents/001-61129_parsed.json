Although the appeal proceedings before the Military Court of Cassation and the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation only took a year and five months, subsequently it took the Ankara Assize Court more than six and a half years to conclude its examination of the case. The case is still pending before the Court of Cassation. No convincing justification for these excessive delays has been offered by the respondent Government.",
