It notes that for both applicants the Lithuanian courts admitted a violation of domestic legal norms setting out specific aspects pertinent to the conditions of detention. It considers that even though the applicants were awarded EUR 406 (in the case of the first applicant \u2013 see paragraphs 7 and 10 above) and EUR 435 (in the case of the second applicant \u2013 see paragraphs 14 and 17 above), those sums, whilst apparently consistent with Lithuanian case-law, are inconsistent with the amounts that the Court awards in similar cases.

In view of the information submitted to it, the Court considers, on the one hand, that that period of fourteen days does not raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 139). On the other hand, it finds that for the remaining period of three years, nine months and nineteen days the applicant was detained in conditions which fell below the relevant minimum standard of 3\u00a0sq. m of personal space and thereby created a strong presumption of a violation of Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0136-37).",
