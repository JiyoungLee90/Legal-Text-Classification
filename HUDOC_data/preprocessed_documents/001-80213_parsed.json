Although some leading questions may have been put to the children, there was nothing to suggest that they would have sought to please the interviewer and adapted their replies accordingly. This being so, the court found that questioning the children in court would not have added anything significant to the case. Having regard to their best interests, the questioning of children of such a young age before a court could not be considered justifiable.

The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre-trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her (section 15(3), Act no. 692/1997). A pre-trial investigation has to be carried out in such a manner that no one is placed under suspicion without due cause and no one is unnecessarily subjected to harm or inconvenience. Nor must the rights of those concerned be infringed more than is necessary for the achievement of the purpose of the investigation (section 8).",

However, the use in evidence of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not in itself inconsistent with paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6, provided that the rights of the defence have been respected. As a rule, these rights require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him or her either when the statements were made or at a later stage of the proceedings (see Sa\u00efdi v. France, judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 56, \u00a7 43, and A.M. v. Italy, no. 37019/97, \u00a7 25, ECHR 1999-IX). A conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on statements which the defence has not been able to challenge (see, mutatis mutandis, Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996II, p. 472, \u00a7 76). Article 6 does not grant the accused an unlimited right to secure the appearance of witnesses in court. It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a witness (see, among other authorities, Bricmont v.\u00a0Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, \u00a7 89).",

These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim. Therefore, the Court accepts that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that such measures can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B, opinion of the Commission, p. 44, \u00a7 77).

This request was however refused. As to the proceedings in the District Court and the Court of Appeal, it should first be noted that the applicant did not request the attendance of the children. Before the Court the applicant stated that he had refrained from requesting that they give evidence in person during the hearings as, in line with long-standing practice, any such request would have been refused. In view of the apparent absence of cases where counsel for the defence has successfully requested the cross-examination of a child complainant of a similar age as those in the present case, the Court accepts that the applicant could not have obtained the appearance of any of the children in person before the courts.",

I leave open the question whether the right to examine witnesses applies to an equal extent during the investigation and the trial stage and whether the problem, if there is one, could be remedied at the trial stage. It is clear that in the case at hand the applicant had the opportunity to ask for the children to be questioned during the trial stage, but he failed to do so.",

                        "content": "It has to be believed that the authorities had good grounds under the circumstances not to subject children younger than 10 years to unnecessary harm or inconvenience. Our Court has accepted that in criminal proceedings concerning sexual abuse certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victims, provided that such measures can be reconciled with the basic rights of the defence under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Baegen v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1995, Series A no. 327-B). It seems to me that this case falls into this category and the measures taken were proportionate and counterbalanced and did not reach the level of a substantive violation of the Convention.",
