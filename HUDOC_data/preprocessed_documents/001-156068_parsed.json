The applicant had been convicted on seven previous occasions, four of which involved similar offences of violence. Relying on a report by a psychiatric expert, the court found that even though the applicant was responsible for his acts, he was suffering from a grave mental disorder, was dangerous to the public and was likely to re-offend. For these reasons, the court ordered the applicant\u2019s detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders in accordance with section 21 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, in addition to the term of imprisonment. Given the time the applicant had served in detention on remand, the Court stated that the applicant\u2019s detention pursuant to the prison sentence was likely to end on 7 May 2010.",

In their view, a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 because of proceedings conducted prior to that date was impossible, which is why only the examination period between 8 May 2007 and 20 September 2007 should be taken into consideration. In that context, the Government emphasised the nature of the applicant\u2019s detention: section\u00a021\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02 of the Criminal Code enabled the sentencing court, in addition to imposing a sentence of imprisonment, to order detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders. Such detention was to be served before the prison sentence, but counted as part of the prison sentence. They pointed out that where a prison sentence was imposed by a convicting court, the review of lawfulness required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 was incorporated in the initial conviction. Accordingly \u2013 because the applicant was not asking for his release, but merely for a transfer from one type of detention facility to another \u2013 that provision was not applicable in the present case.",

The same principle may apply to the detention \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d mentioned in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), but only in certain quite specific circumstances (see, with further references, Iribarne P\u00e9rez v.

That order, confirmed on appeal on 7\u00a0June 2005 by the Linz Court of Appeal, constituted an initial decision that the applicant could be detained in such an institution.

His application of 10 January 2007 to the Regional Court for the order under section 21 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code to be lifted, however, was not an application for a review of the lawfulness of his detention in general. The applicant rather alleged that the reasons for his detention under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(e) of the Convention had ceased to exist. He was asking for the lifting of the measure of detention under section 21 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, which ran parallel to his prison sentence but could be challenged independently by virtue of the domestic law, even if at the material time this could not have led to his release, but only to his transfer to an ordinary prison. In this context the Court considers that in cases concerning the placement in mental institutions where the reasons initially warranting confinement may cease to exist, it would be contrary to the object and purpose of Article 5 to interpret paragraph 4 thereof as making this category of confinement immune from subsequent review of lawfulness merely because the initial decision of detention was taken by a court under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention. This must be the case even if the review under Article 5 \u00a7 4 would not lead to release but to a transfer to an ordinary prison. The reason for guaranteeing a review under Article 5 \u00a7 4 is equally important to persons detained in a mental institution regardless of whether or not these persons are serving sentences of imprisonment for criminal offenses. The Court also reiterates that in the Austrian legal system a separate challenge of such confinement is allowed.",

Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 68, ECHR 2000III, and Kadirzhanov and Mamashev v. Russia, nos. 42351/13 and 47823/13, \u00a7 119, 17 July 2014). Whereas the Court has held above, that Article 5 \u00a7 4 is applicable in this case, it reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention. However, where domestic law provides for an appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4, for instance as concerns the speediness of the review in appeal proceedings. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d has been complied with, it is necessary to effect an overall assessment where the proceedings have been conducted at more than one level of jurisdiction (see Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a0106, 9 July 2009). At the same time, the standard of \u201cspeediness\u201d is less stringent when it comes to proceedings before an appellate court (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7 96, 25 October 2007).",

Although the amount of time taken by the relevant proceedings is obviously an important element, it is not necessarily in itself decisive for the question of whether a decision has been given with the requisite speed (see Merie v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 664/05, 20 September 2007). What is taken into account is the diligence shown by the authorities, the delay attributable to the applicant, and any factors causing delay for which the State cannot be held responsible, such as the complexity of a case (see, mutatis mutandis, Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7\u00a7 91-94, 21\u00a0December 2000). The Court must also examine whether any new relevant factors that have arisen in the interval between periodic reviews have been assessed, without unreasonable delay, by a court having jurisdiction to decide whether or not the detention has become \u201cunlawful\u201d in the light of these new factors (see Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11, \u00a7\u00a0215, 2 October 2012).",

The requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 as to what may be considered a \u201creasonable\u201d interval in the context of periodic judicial review varies from one domain to another, depending on the type of deprivation of liberty in question (see, for a summary of the Court\u2019s caselaw in the context of detention for the purposes set out in subparagraphs (a), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 5 \u00a7 1, Abdulkhakov v. Russia, \u00a7\u00a7 212-14, cited above). Long intervals in the context of automatic periodic review may give rise to a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see, among other authorities, Herczegfalvy v.

Deprivations of liberty based on the existence of a disability are intrinsically discriminatory. Detention regimes which by their own terms discriminate on the basis of disability constitute arbitrary detention. The involuntary detention of persons with disabilities based on presumptions of risk or dangerousness linked to disability labels is contrary to the right to liberty. In the criminal-law context, the automatic and involuntary transfer to mental health facilities within or outside of an ordinary prison facility, or the automatic imposition of mental health treatment as a condition of probation, parole or a transfer to a softer or \u201cnormal\u201d prison regime, cannot be considered a reasonable individualised accommodation for persons with a disability.

Detentions conditions should never amount to causing increased suffering to inmates with disabilities. In no case should the disability entail added forms of suffering for persons in detention. Improper health conditions in prisons and detention centres could result in the creation of further disabilities in addition to the existing ones. These conditions should be properly identified and preventive measures adopted to avoid the progression of an existing disability or further disabilities in the prisoner. Prison authorities should be obliged to implement appropriate measures to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, full physical, mental, social and vocational ability and full inclusion and participation in all aspects of prison life, on an equal basis with others.

The lack of a scientific basis for the outdated \u201cabnormality\u201d concept facilitates a perverse circle whereby offences which are not common, or have uncommon traits, are considered in themselves as reflecting a personality disorder, which is automatically equated to a sign of dangerousness. Like many other \u201cabnormal\u201d offenders, the applicant in the present case was caught in such a perverse circle, having been labelled a dangerous \u201cabnormal\u201d on the basis of a \u201ccombined personality disorder\u201d (kombinierte Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsst\u00f6rung).",

Put another way, the number of people being released from psychiatric detention does not cover the number of people being placed there. Moreover, in the last ten years, the measure set out in section\u00a021 \u00a7 2 has been applied increasingly to petty offences, with the trial court combining the application of a short prison term with the cumulative application of the preventive measure. In the large majority of cases, the conditional release (bedingte Entlassung) from psychiatric detention takes place only after, and sometimes many years after, the end of the prison term owing to a strict interpretation of the legal requirements of section 47 \u00a7 2. The courts are also very reluctant in practice to apply the conditional discount (bedingter Nachlass) provided for in section 45 to these offenders.",

Frequently, the offender is considered as \u201cnot amenable to therapy\u201d (nicht therapiebar) or to the \u201cexisting therapeutic possibilities\u201d (mit den bestehenden therapeutischen M\u00f6glichkeiten nicht helfen zu k\u00f6nnen). Thus, the purported legal model of \u201ctherapy instead of penalty\u201d (Therapie statt Strafe) is replaced by the opposite praxis, with the unavoidable consequence of the dividing line between imprisonment as a criminal penalty and psychiatric detention as a preventive measure being blurred. In practical terms, the psychiatric detention of \u201cabnormal\u201d offenders plays the same incapacitating and neutralising role (unsch\u00e4dlich zu machen) as the 1933 German Sicherungsverwahrung or, even closer, the 1936 Portuguese \u201cpragmatic defensive penal law\u201d (pragmatisches Verteidigungsstrafrecht).",

In other words, the preventive measure provided for in section 21 \u00a7 2 has become the epicentre of Austrian criminal policy for criminally responsible offenders perceived by society as dangerous, the specific provision of section 23 on \u201cdangerous recidivists\u201d being \u201cdead law\u201d (Totes Recht). The fact that section 23 \u00a7 2 provides that placement in an institution for mentally \u201cabnormal\u201d offenders, which is not time-limited, prevails over placement in an institution for \u201cdangerous recidivists\u201d, which is time-limited, evidently contributes to the increased mislabelling of offenders. Looking behind appearances, labelling offenders with intellectual and psychosocial impairments as \u201cabnormal\u201d serves the purpose of formally transferring them from the Normalvollzug regime to the Massnahmenvollzug regime; in fact, most of them never leave the former, the significant difference being that since they are nominally under the latter regime their incarceration may last forever. Consequently, the respondent State does not provide reasonable accommodations in the above-mentioned sense to \u201cabnormal\u201d offenders, imposing a disproportionate and discriminatory punishment on them.",

In Austrian law, \u201cabnormal\u201d persons in psychiatric detention have a set of procedural rights which cannot be disposed of on a discretionary basis by the court. Yet since its implementation, strong criticism has been voiced of the courts\u2019 practice in the context of the placement review mechanism, namely of courts hearing detained persons very briefly, rejecting requests by detained persons for evidence to be produced or for the psychiatric expert to be questioned before the court and summoning detainees at very short notice, which does not allow for consultation of the file or with a lawyer or submission of an alternative psychiatric expert report. Of particular importance is the right to call witnesses and to question the psychiatric expert, it being open to the court to reject these requests only within the limited terms of section 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For example, the court cannot reject a request to take evidence on the assumption that it is not necessary, as happened in the present case.",

According to the Supreme Court, the court\u2019s decision may be taken outside the legal one year time-limit. The guarantee of regular judicial review of the person\u2019s detention is hence more virtual than real. As this case-law provided the basis for the Linz Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 10 September 2007, the finding of a breach of Article 5 of the Convention in the present case directly calls into question this excessively tolerant case-law on the part of the Supreme Court.",

Moreover, it is a form of discrimination based on mental disability in the context of criminal sanctions and violates Article 14 CRDP. The unlawful, disproportionate and discriminatory nature of this interference with the liberty of \u201cabnormal\u201d offenders also breaches Article 5 of the Convention. The applicant was the victim of such a violation. The protracted proceedings for review of the applicant\u2019s detention until his release are not a unique situation in Austria. The groundless rejection of his request for the taking of evidence is also a common feature of the review procedure mechanism. Both shortcomings reflect the widespread failure to comply with the guarantees of Article 5 and\u00a06 of the Convention in proceedings for the release of these offenders.",
