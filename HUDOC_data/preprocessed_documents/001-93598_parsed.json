In this connection, it noted that the RCT had failed to take into account the average rental rate of the shops in the area and relevant factors such as the age, condition and facilities of those shops when assessing the rental value of the shop in question. Secondly, it found substantial errors in the valuation made by the RCT\u2019s expert which included the failure to make the necessary adjustments when comparing different properties and to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the properties compared. The court considered that the valuation given by the RCT\u2019s expert had been ill-founded and unreliable and that therefore the RCT should not have relied on it. Similarly, the court found that the valuation of the respondents\u2019 expert (the\u00a0appellants at the appeal stage) had been unsound. In this connection, it noted that this valuation had defined the area in question very narrowly and as a result had not taken into account other nearby shops which should have been considered for comparison purposes. The Supreme Court therefore concluded that overall no evidence had been put forward which would enable the determination of a fair rent in respect of the applicants\u2019 shop.",

They firstly submitted that although it was general practice that costs on appeal followed the result, in the event that the Supreme Court ordered a retrial the general practice was that the costs followed the result of the retrial. The applicants relied on three judgments of the Supreme Court in which that court had upheld the appeal, ordered a retrial of the case and where the costs of the first-instance and appeal proceedings consisted of trial costs following the retrial proceedings (Antonis Papaioannou v. Nikou Nicolaou, appeal no.\u00a011744, 15 June 2005; A. Athanasiou v. Loizias & Sons Contracting &\u00a0Building (Overseas) Ltd, appeal no. 8120, 3 December 1993; and Elli Simillidou\u00a0v.\u00a0Demetris Stergiou and another, appeal no. 9048, 18 November 1996). The applicants therefore submitted that there had been no reason to raise the issue before the Supreme Court. Furthermore, they observed that although they had been given the costs of the retrial as part of the friendly settlement they had concluded (see paragraph 40 above), they had had to pay the costs of the first-instance and appeal proceedings. The applicants submitted a receipt by the respondents\u2019 lawyer dated 14 January 2008 confirming that the applicants had paid the costs of both the first-instance and the appeal proceedings. Finally, the applicants argued that the RCT\u2019s expert could not be considered as their valuer.",

Secondly, and most importantly, the applicants have not argued that the costs order against them deprived them of effective access to a court, and no such conclusion can be drawn from the facts of the case.",
