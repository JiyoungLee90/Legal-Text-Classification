In creating a scheme of benefits it is sometimes necessary to use cut-off points that apply to large groups of people and which may to a certain extent appear arbitrary. The applicant\u2019s spouse died almost immediately before the entry into force of the 1999 Act and for that reason the applicant could not qualify for BP and BA. However, this is an inevitable consequence of introducing new systems which replace previous and outdated schemes. The choice of a cut-off date when transforming social security regimes must be considered as falling within the wide margin of appreciation afforded to a State when reforming its social strategy policy and in the instant case the impugned cut-off date can be deemed reasonably and objectively justified.",
