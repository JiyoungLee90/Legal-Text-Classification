The court noted that in February 2002, when the articles had been published, the journalist had been aware that the prosecutor\u2019s indictment in the first set of proceedings had been upheld by the first two levels of the domestic courts and the appeal on points of law was still pending. The court also noted that the journalist had been aware that the disciplinary investigation against the applicant was pending when he had written the articles.
