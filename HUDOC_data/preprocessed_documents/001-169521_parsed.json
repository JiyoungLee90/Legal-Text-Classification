Turkey (both cited above), the Court reiterates that it has differentiated between applications where the direct victim has died before the application was lodged with the Court, and those where he or she has died after the application was lodged, as in the present application, which was lodged by the applicant himself. In the latter cases, the Court has accepted that the next of kin, close family member or heir may in principle pursue the application, provided that he or she has sufficient interest in the case (see Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v.\u00a0Romania [GC], no. 47848/08, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2014; Fartushin v. Russia, no.\u00a038887/09, \u00a7\u00a033, 8\u00a0October 2015; and Ivko v. Russia, no.\u00a030575/08, \u00a7 67-70, 15 December 2015). It is not only material interests which the successor of a deceased applicant may pursue by his or her wish to maintain the application. Human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension, and persons near to an applicant may thus have a legitimate interest in ensuring that justice is done, even after the applicant\u2019s death (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.) [GC], no. 33071/96, ECHR 2000-XII). Thus, in cases where the direct victim has died after the application was lodged, the decisive factor is not whether the rights at issue are transferable to heirs willing to pursue an application, but whether the persons wishing to pursue the proceedings can claim a legitimate interest in seeking that the Court decide the case on the basis of the applicant\u2019s desire to use his individual and personal right to lodge a case before the Court (see Ergezen v. Turkey, no. 73359/10, \u00a7 29, 8\u00a0April 2014, concerning a complaint under Article 5; see also \u00a7\u00a027 of the judgment for further references to cases dealing with complaints under Article 5).",

Hence, in the present case, it is not the late applicant\u2019s heir but his grandmother \u2013 a person who claims to be his closest living relative \u2013 who wishes to pursue the application before the Court. As the Court has held before, it does not attach decisive importance to the fact that the person wishing to pursue an application is not the applicant\u2019s next of kin or heir. What is important is that this person can claim a legitimate interest in having the proceedings in the applicant\u2019s case pursued before the Court (see Malhous v. the Czech Republic (dec.), cited above, and Kozimor v.

On the contrary, the latter fact is confirmed by the documents submitted by both parties (see, a contrario, Br\u016bz\u012btis v.

The Court thus accepts that Ms\u00a0Z\u012bmele, as the applicant\u2019s close relative who lived with him for numerous years and had with him family ties, has a legitimate interest in pursuing the proceedings on his behalf (see also Pisarkiewicz v.
