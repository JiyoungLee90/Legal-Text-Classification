While it confirmed the firstinstance court\u2019s findings concerning the role of the chairperson, it observed that the technical members were still subject to reappointment (by the President of Malta, on the advice of the executive, which was always a party to the proceedings before such board). Although the role of the technical members was subordinate to that of the chairperson (who following the amendments was not bound to follow the experts\u2019 unanimous report), in practice it was decisive in so far as the chairperson (a legal person without the necessary technical knowledge) was undoubtedly influenced by the decision of the technical members when considering technical matters. As stated in previous domestic case-law, at least in the mind of an objective observer, the possibility of the technical experts being reappointed could be an incentive for such members to determine low values for expropriated property in order to remain in the good books of the executive who had the power to keep them in office. Thus, such a body did not fulfil the guarantees of independence and impartiality. In the specific circumstances, those failings could not be cured by the Court of Appeal, which was not in a position to interfere with the conclusions of the technical members of the board.",

In connection with future rent awarded by the first-instance court the Government had argued that the court could not change the parameters set out in legislation and usurp the function of parliament. According to the Government the adequate remedy would have been to find the law inconsistent and without effect to the relevant extent. The Constitutional Court agreed that such a course of action would mean that the lessees [who were benefitting from the law to the detriment of the owners] would not continue to benefit from such law had they to be evicted. However, the Constitutional Court held that it would not evict the tenants, as it was not its role.

Both criteria were satisfied in the present case. Firstly, the evictions had been the responsibility of the Government, which was empowered by law to enforce them. It was not for the applicant companies to suffer an inefficient administrative and judicial system. In law an occupier had to yield possession within fourteen days of being offered alternative accommodation. It was thus the State that had failed, for no specified reason, to propose adequate accommodation for seven years. After that, the delay in obtaining permission was a result of applications for a proposed development which were problematic and subject of incompatibilities with domestic planning policies. These reasons could not be considered as public interest. Moreover, during such time (over twenty-two years) the property undoubtedly increased in value (see, for example, paragraph 116 below).",

As to the actual value of the property they noted that it was situated in a street perpendicular to the main central street of Valletta, at a distance of fifteen meters from it, and therefore in the hub of the city, and therefore in a prime area. By way of comparison the applicant companies noted that in 2015, the Government purchased property further away from theirs at EUR\u00a01,645,000 (for half the undivided share of the property). On the basis of that scale, thus not augmenting the price because the applicant companies\u2019 property was in a better location, according to an ex parte architect\u2019s report, the total value of the expropriated properties would amount to EUR 589,875, thus the share of each applicant company (one third undivided share) would be EUR\u00a0196,625.

In the Government\u2019s view the fact that, to date, the property had not yet been used did not cancel the original public interest behind the taking given that the authorities\u2019 action had been constant, as had also been held by the Constitutional Court which was best placed to assess the public interest requirement. Relying on the Court\u2019s caselaw, they noted that placing in reserve expropriated property even for a long time, did not necessarily entail a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.

Moreover, according to the Government, given the public interest involved, the taking had not required compensation at the full market value. Further, unlike other cases decided by this Court against Malta, in the present case, after 2009, the applicant companies could contest the amount of compensation offered in the President\u2019s declaration of 2009 directly before the LAB.

In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount proportionate to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, whilst a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in exceptional circumstances (see Former King of Greece and Others v.

A similar situation obtained in the cases of Ke\u00e7ecio\u011flu\u00a0and\u00a0Others v.\u00a0Turkey (no. 37546/02, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29, 8 April 2008) and Motais\u00a0de\u00a0Narbonne v.\u00a0France (no. 48161/99, \u00a7 19, 2 July 2002). In the latter case the Court found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of a significant delay between a decision to expropriate property and the actual undertaking of a project in the public interest which had formed the basis of the expropriation. While the placing in reserve of expropriated property, even for a long period of time, does not necessarily entail a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, there is clearly an issue under that provision where such an action is not itself based on publicinterest grounds and where, during that period, the property in question generates a significant increase in value of which the former owners are deprived (ibid., \u00a7 21).",

The delay in making use of those plots was not based on any public-interest concern and the value of that land had substantially increased over the years that followed the taking of the land, and thus an issue arose in respect of the public-interest requirement (\u00a7\u00a7\u00a061-62). Similar considerations where made in Vassallo (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43) concerning the laps of twenty eight-years during which no concrete use was made of the property at issue in that case.",

However, the property remained unused for twentyfive years and, as recently confirmed by the Government in view of their inability to carry out the project, a new place has been sought for such a purpose (see paragraph\u00a034 above). The Court considers that while it might be said that at least part of the delay was itself based on a public-interest concern, namely to avoid making homeless the occupiers of the premises, it cannot be said that the Government pursued the matter diligently, as it took them fourteen years to vacate the premises. Subsequently, since 2007 when the premises were vacated no use was made of the property. Indeed while obtaining a permit is surely in the general public interest, the same cannot be said of a delay amounting to eighteen years to obtain such a permit, because of the inefficiency of the authorities  be it of the Commissioner of Lands or of the planning authorities in assessing and granting or refusing such a permit. Given the circumstances of the present case, it must have been evident years ago that the project was not viable in the then near future. Nevertheless, in 2009, at a time when they already should have known, instead of releasing the property the authorities issued a new declaration. Indeed, even to date, despite the recent change of plan admitted by the Government and thus the extinction of the original public interest in relation to the taking of the applicant companies\u2019 property, the property has not been returned to the applicant companies. Little comfort can be found in the Government\u2019s submission (see paragraph 34 above) that nevertheless the property at issue remains designated for a public use, which the Government failed to specify or elaborate on. Furthermore, it is indisputable, in the light of the material and submissions before this Court, that the property has seen an increase in value, of which the applicant companies have been deprived.",

It suffices to hold, in this connection, that (despite an offer which does not appear to have been served on the applicant companies) given that twenty-five years after the taking the applicant companies have not received any compensation they have been required to be bear a disproportionate burden (see, mutatis mutandis, Vassallo (merits), cited above, \u00a7 4445).",

Although the scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the \u201cauthority\u201d referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kud\u0142a v.

Nevertheless, the Court noted that it had found in a number of cases brought under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 against Malta, that the applicants maintained their victim status notwithstanding a favourable decision by the Constitutional Court (see, for example, Azzopardi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a034, and Frendo Randon and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 3839 in connection with expropriations; and Gera\u00a0de Petri, cited above, \u00a7\u00a053, concerning the control of property under title of possession and use subject to recognition rent) mainly because the domestic courts had failed to award compensation for the relevant pecuniary damage decades after the applicants had started being affected by the violation.",

Indeed cases before this Court show a practice where any relevant measures ordered by the firstinstance constitutional jurisdiction, are regularly overturned by the Constitutional Court (see, as the most recent example, Galea and Others (cited above), \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 20).

The Court considers that while this might not always be the case, such orders may result in nonpecuniary compensation being also inadequate.

The Court reiterates that without prejudice to the effectiveness of such an action under the Civil Code  an action of a general nature and in respect of which the Government have not produced any evidence in relation to its prospects of success  in such cases, owners could not be expected to incur the expense and burden of instituting proceedings to ensure the authorities\u2019 fulfilment of their legal obligation. Moreover, the mere fact that the Government would have been forced by means of a court decision to initiate proceedings, would not guarantee that those proceedings would thereafter be pursued with due diligence (see Vassallo (merits), cited above, \u00a7 46). Indeed, the Court has previously found a violation of the reasonable time requirement in relation to LAB proceedings in the Maltese context (see Bezzina Wettinger, cited above, \u00a7 93; and Gera de Petri, cited above, \u00a7 43). Thus, quite apart the issues in connection with proceedings before the LAB which were identified by the Constitutional Court, the preventive element of the procedure under Article\u00a01078 of the Civil Code has not been substantiated.

The Contracting States that are parties to a case are in principle free to choose the means whereby they will comply with a judgment in which the Court has found a breach. This discretion as to the manner of execution of a judgment reflects the freedom of choice attached to the primary obligation of the Contracting States under the Convention to secure the rights and freedoms guaranteed (Article 1). If the nature of the violation allows of restitutio in integrum it is the duty of the State held liable to effect it, the Court having neither the power nor the practical possibility of doing so itself. If, however, national law does not allow  or allows only partial  reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article\u00a041 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (ibid.).

Thus, the Court considers that compensation in the present case must be awarded on the lines of that in Motais de Narbonne v. France ((just satisfaction), no. 48161/99, \u00a7\u00a020, 27\u00a0May 2003), and Ke\u00e7ecio\u011flu and Others v. Turkey ((just satisfaction), no.\u00a037546/02, \u00a7 19, 20 July 2010), in which the Court had in its principal judgments found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of a significant delay between a decision to expropriate property and the undertaking of a project in the public interest which had denied the applicants the appreciation (\u201cplus-value\u201d) of their property (see Motais\u00a0de\u00a0Narbonne (merits), cited above, \u00a7 19, and Ke\u00e7ecio\u011flu and Others (merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 28-29). In both these cases, where the violation pertained to a lack of public interest, the Court considered under Article\u00a041 that the applicants were to be paid compensation corresponding to the appreciation they had been denied. It thus awarded pecuniary damage on the basis of the then current market value of that property (\u201cla valeur v\u00e9nale actuelle du b\u00e2timent\u201d) and deducted what the applicants had already received in compensation for the expropriation years before. The same reasoning was reiterated in Vassallo ((just satisfaction), cited above, \u00a7\u00a018), although in that case, unlike in the above cases, the project was eventually carried out and thus compensation was calculated in that light.",
