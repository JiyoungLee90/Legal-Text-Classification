Admittedly, as the applicants argued, the Supreme Court's case-law has created a measure of jurisdiction in the matter for the civil courts (see paragraph 32 above).  However, the first-mentioned judgment of the Supreme Court, although subsequent to the events complained of, shows that a right to full compensation (enforceable by the civil courts) is recognised only with regard to unlawful detention (see paragraph 33 above).  The latter judgment, which is even more recent, makes it clear that acquittal per se does not render pre-trial detention retrospectively unlawful (see paragraph 34 above).

Proceedings of this type, which according to that judgment are known in several Contracting States, are to be characterised as a kind of extension of, or appendix to, the criminal proceedings which ended as such with the judgment of acquittal.

I see nothing wrong in such a notion.  Under the Convention there is no right to compensation , and according to the Hauschildt doctrine  the mere fact that the decision on compensation is taken by the same judge or judges who acquitted does not affect the tribunal's impartiality, since the questions to be answered when settling these two issues are completely different.
