Nor did the appeal courts say anything about the nature of the applicants\u2019 legal claims which might have rendered their presence unnecessary. It follows that the arguments raised by the Government were not tested in the domestic proceedings and appeared for the first time in the proceedings before the Court. The Court reiterates in this regard that that a lack of or deficiency in the reasoning in the domestic decisions cannot be made up ex post facto in the Court proceedings, for it cannot take the place of the national courts which had the evidence before them. For that reason, the Court is unable to entertain the claims which the respondent Government raised for the first time in the proceedings before it (see Gankin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 41, with further references, and Yevdokimov and Others v. Russia, nos. 27236/05 and 10 others, \u00a7 37, 16 February 2016).
