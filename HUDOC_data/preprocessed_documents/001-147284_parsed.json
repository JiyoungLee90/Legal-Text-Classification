Indeed, a review of the Court\u2019s case-law shows that Article 10 of the Convention has been held to be applicable not only to the more common forms of expression such as speeches and written texts, but also to other and less obvious media through which people sometimes choose to convey their opinions, messages, ideas and criticisms.",

Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence there is an obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on the author\u2019s freedom of expression (see M\u00fcller and Others v.

The applicant Party\u2019s objection was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which held that the Municipal Council\u2019s decision had been justified because the leaflets disseminated by the applicant political party had contained such slogans as \u201cDown with Voronin\u2019s totalitarian regime\u201d and \u201cDown with Putin\u2019s occupation regime\u201d. The Court of Appeal also recalled that during a previous demonstration organised by the applicant political party to protest against the presence of the Russian military in Transdniestria, the protesters had burned a picture of the President of the Russian Federation and a Russian flag. In its judgment the Court held that the applicant party\u2019s slogans, even if they had been accompanied by the burning of flags and pictures, were a form of expressing an opinion in respect of an issue of major public interest, namely the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova (no. 25196/04, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 27, 2 February 2010).",

The Court does not even provide a comparable reference, a tertium comparationis; for example, the fact that thirteen years is a sentence that is ordinarily imposed on murderers.

The law that was applied singles out very specific content: all speech (including expressive action, as in the present case) that publicly insults the memory of Atat\u00fcrk is punishable. The issue is not the protection of all public statues where harm to the statue has been caused by an expressive action. The issue, which is buried under the outrage of the excessive sentence, is the singling out of specific speech content for punishment. Law no. 5816 provides first and foremost that any \u201cdisrespect for Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s memory\u201d is to be punished by a prison sentence of between one and three years, the use of paint on a monument (\u201cdirtying of a statue\u201d) raising the sentence to five years; the applicant was then given an additional eight years of punishment for the aggravating circumstances.",

Moreover, the importance of the end itself may be subject to judicial analysis.

I have no doubts that the Turkish nation has strong feelings of respect towards the founder of the modern Turkish State, and it is within the constitutional powers of the Turkish nation to express such feelings. I have full respect for these sentiments, but equally strong reservations as to the legal enforcement of sensitivities in matters of speech. I understand that the form of the expression is problematic here but, as the judgment demonstrates, it falls within expressive conduct; the pouring of paint is a form of expression, disputable though it may be. Destruction caused to a statue or other piece of art is an ordinary crime; to destroy Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cPieta\u201d would indeed be a serious crime. But in the present case it was the expressed content that was the ground for the conviction: the object of the crime is clearly \u201cthe memory of Atat\u00fcrk\u201d and not the alleged vandalism, which of course might otherwise be subject to criminal sanctions. Moreover, I can envision the need for such a dramatic form of expression of political discontent in certain circumstances, a matter that did not have to be addressed in the present case. The Turkish courts never entered into a discussion of the appropriateness of the expressive act. In any event, all forms of expression of dislike of Atat\u00fcrk and his memory, all the underlying discontent with the political system created by Atat\u00fcrk and based on his political vision, are prohibited: this is the primary and fundamental issue.",

Such laws are simply not necessary in a democratic society (outside emergencies), being contrary to the fundamental assumptions of such a society based on free debate and exchange of ideas. The mere existence of content-prohibiting laws endangers and sometimes kills freedom of thought. It is fundamental for a democratic society that its citizens be treated as adults who accept, or learn to tolerate, even speech that they find offensive. This is the price to be paid for a free and democratic society.",

In a proportionality analysis that looks first at the very law that is the source of an interference, one looks at the law as a means chosen and at the end served (the protection of alleged feelings). The means are excessive here in the light of the end, among other things because the end itself is problematic; the end in itself is simply not worth the inevitable sacrifice of freedom of expression resulting from the means chosen, but also from any less radical means. Alternatively, the present end is not legitimate; or, to the extent it might be legitimate for some, the means chosen are certainly not the least restrictive possible.",

But in those cases the Court did not find it appropriate to make express statements in this sense, probably as a result of its putative role related to Article 27 \u00a7 1 and Article 34 of the Convention, although pursuant to Article 19 the Court is called upon to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Parties; \u201cengagements\u201d that are of a general and structural nature. The Law at issue constitutes a blanket ban on the expression of specific political content for the sake of public sensitivities elevated to the status of a \u201cright\u201d. In view of these engagements, content discrimination for the sake of the protection of the memory of a national hero by criminal law is incompatible with the Convention.

This is proportionate in the sense that it falls within the range of satisfaction provided in other similarly grave freedom of expression and disenfranchisement cases. (One may have doubts that such an amount is equitable in view of the seven years of unmerited suffering in prison). I accept that the amount follows our practice. But with all due respect, I cannot agree with my colleagues as regards pecuniary (material) damage, even if denial of an award on this ground is not uncommon in comparable cases. The applicant certainly suffered material damage (loss of income) because of his incarceration: there is a causal link with a loss of income. This loss is hard to quantify, but technical difficulties of calculation cannot negate the existence of a loss: the applicant was a qualified teacher, albeit unemployed before his conviction, who would have earned a living like any average person in his situation, had he not been incarcerated in violation of the Convention. The loss is thus quantifiable, either on the basis of the average income of a teacher in his position, or at least with regard to the minimum income of an employed person (using the unfair assumption that he could not have found a position in education). Moreover, because of the conviction, he will not be able to work again as a civil servant (it is even unlikely that, having been released on licence, he will find a position as a teacher in private education). To determine the loss of future income is not rocket science and courts do use estimates in such circumstances, taking life expectancy into consideration. I have had the opportunity to express my reservations regarding the Court\u2019s parsimonious approach in matters of pecuniary damage, concerned as it is with the risk of \u201cspeculative\u201d awards. The \u201cgross injustice\u201d suffered by the applicant in the present case forces me to reach the sad conclusion that the Court has departed from those standards of remedy that national courts and international law find to be a matter of course; and a matter of reason.",
