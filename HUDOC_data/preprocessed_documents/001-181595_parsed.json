The domestic courts had made a distinction between facts and value judgments and found that the facts attributed to M.F. were untrue. The Government noted that everyone could file a report with the police and that the article had contained a number of declarations which attributed unjust influence by M.F. on the CoP which did not reflect the truth. They noted that while a number of questions had been put, the article had also contained statements which were unproven. Moreover, a statement of fact could not be proved on the grounds that the statements were based on information in the public sphere.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \u201cdemocratic society\u201d.

The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a \u201crestriction\u201d is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Pentik\u00e4inen v.\u00a0Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, \u00a7\u00a087, ECHR 2015).

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (ibid.). In addition, the fairness of the proceedings, the procedural guarantees afforded and the nature and severity of the penalties imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression (see Kyprianou v.

The Court has previously established that the press, as well as NGOs, exercise watchdog functions and that the function of bloggers and popular users of the social media may be also assimilated to that of \u201cpublic watchdogs\u201d in so far as the protection afforded by Article 10 is concerned (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0166 and\u00a0168). The manner in which public watchdogs carry out their activities may have a significant impact on the proper functioning of a democratic society (ibid., \u00a7\u00a0167). In the present case, the applicant being a regular opinion writer in two weekly publications, the interference must therefore be examined in the context of the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society (see, among many other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.\u00a0France [GC], nos.\u00a021279/02 and\u00a036448/02, \u00a7\u00a062, ECHR 2007IV), as also acknowledged by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 30 above).",

As to whether the applicant acted in good faith and made sure that the article was written in compliance with ordinary journalistic obligations to verify factual allegations, the Court reiterates that this obligation requires the journalist to rely on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis which can be considered proportionate to the nature and degree of the allegation, given that the more serious the allegation, the more solid the factual basis has to be (see, inter alia, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0Ei\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir v.\u00a0Iceland, no. 46443/09, \u00a7 71, 10\u00a0July 2012).

The Court reiterates that Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed. Consequently, it is not for this Court, or for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what reporting technique should be adopted by journalists. Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see, with further references, B\u00e9dat, cited above, \u00a7 58). In that light, the Court takes issue with the decisions of the domestic courts concerning unuttered statements, and their decisions to consider certain statements as factual (which they claimed had not been proved), as opposed to value judgments. Indeed, the Court\u2019s caselaw has shown a broad and liberal interpretation of \u201cvalue judgments\u201d when it comes to journalistic freedom on matters of public interest, particularly concerning politicians (see, for example, Unabh\u00e4ngige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v.\u00a0Austria, no. 28525/95, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 41, ECHR 2002I, and Desjardin v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a022567/03, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 48-49, 22\u00a0November 2007).",

                                                "content": "65.\u00a0\u00a0In the Court\u2019s view, by using a style which may have involved a certain degree of provocation, it is plausible that the applicant was raising awareness as to the possibility of any abuse being perpetrated by the deputy leader of the party in opposition, and that he was calling for action by the minister in charge (compare Thorgeir Thorgeirson v.\u00a0Iceland, 25\u00a0June 1992, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 239, where the Court considered that the principal purpose of the article was to urge the Minister of Justice to set up a body to investigate complaints of police brutality). He was thus expressing his concerns on a matter of public interest. It is true that even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels v.\u00a0Belgium, 24\u00a0February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, \u00a7 47, and Jerusalem v.\u00a0Austria, no.\u00a026958/95, \u00a7\u00a043, ECHR\u00a02001II). However, in the instant case the factual basis at issue is to be found in the deputy leader\u2019s own speech, which he made in public (compare, Brasilier v.\u00a0France, no.\u00a071343/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a038 and 41, 11 April 2006). Thus, in the Court\u2019s view, the questions posed by the applicant, which appear to have been the main reason of his condemnation by the domestic courts, were legitimate questions having a sufficient factual basis: M.F.\u2019s own speech. Nothing in the article suggests that the applicant was acting in bad faith.",

The domestic courts\u2019 decisions, very narrow in scope reiterating what, in their view, was implied by the impugned statements and requiring proof thereof, and upholding the right to reputation without explaining why this outweighed the freedom of expression of the applicant, and without taking into consideration other factors relevant to this balancing exercise, cannot be considered to have fulfilled the obligation incumbent upon the courts to adduce \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d reasons that could justify the interference at issue.",
