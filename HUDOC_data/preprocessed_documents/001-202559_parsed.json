It noted that not-for-profit associations were chiefly characterised by their goals, which is why these goals had to be spelled out in their articles. In recognition of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 44 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 14 below), which belonged to all people irrespective of their ethnic, confessional or linguistic differences, associations were by law entitled freely to set their goals. But as a corollary to that, the Constitution also envisaged, as was indeed permissible under international law, some universally applicable restrictions to freedom of association. A person\u2019s self-identification as a member of an ethnic minority was thus neither a ground for privileges in that respect nor a ground for tougher restrictions.",

Therefore, the manifestation of such a minority by way of an association seeking to cater for its various needs was not in effect meant to defend its rights, which were no different from those of other citizens, but to cultivate among Bulgarian citizens a different ethnic self-consciousness which had not arisen in a natural historical way, and was thus directed against the unity of the nation, contrary to prohibition set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 14 below). Moreover, the association\u2019s articles contained political goals, relating to activities characteristic of political parties, which was proscribed by Article 12 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 11 below).",
