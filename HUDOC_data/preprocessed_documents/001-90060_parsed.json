In particular, the Court held in the relevant cases that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant\u2019s personal situation alone (see Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9\u00a0December 2004; Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, 18\u00a0September 2001; and most recently, Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, \u00a7\u00a039, 29\u00a0March 2007). The Court also reiterates its finding made in the context of a complaint under Article 13 of the Convention that in  there have been no domestic remedies whereby an applicant could effectively complain about the appalling conditions of his or her detention (see Benediktov v. , no. 106/02, \u00a7\u00a030, 10\u00a0May 2007). The Court sees no reason to depart from that finding in the present case and therefore considers that this complaint cannot be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies.",

The Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to indicate the number of inmates on certain dates only. The Court further observes that the Government did not support their statements with extracts from the facility\u2019s registration logs showing names and number of inmates. In this respect, assuming that the facility\u2019s registration logs had been destroyed, the Court considers it extraordinary that in May 2006, that is more than three years after the applicant\u2019s detention in that facility had come to an end, the director was able to recollect the exact number of inmates who had been detained together with the applicant. The director\u2019s certificates are therefore of little evidential value for the Court. However, if the registration logs still exist, the Court finds it peculiar that the Government preferred to rely on the director\u2019s certificates to support their allegations concerning the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention when it was open to them to submit copies of registration logs showing the names of inmates detained with the applicant. The Court further notes that the Government did not indicate the exact number of inmates detained together with the applicant in the period after 22 November 2001.",

They were removed some time in 2001, that is more than two years after the applicant\u2019s detention in that facility had begun. In addition, the Court observes that the applicant was diagnosed with a serious respiratory disease in the facility and that it appears most likely that she contracted it while in detention. Although this fact in itself does not imply a violation of Article 3 given, in particular, the fact that the applicant received treatment (see Alver v. , no.\u00a064812/01, \u00a7\u00a054, 8 November 2005, and Igor Ivanov v. , no.\u00a034000/02, \u00a7\u00a040, 7\u00a0June 2007) and that she fully recovered, the Court considers that these aspects, while not in themselves capable of justifying the notion of \u201cdegrading\u201d treatment, are relevant in addition to the focal factor of the severe overcrowding, to show that the applicant\u2019s detention conditions went beyond the threshold tolerated by Article 3 of the Convention (see Novoselov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044).",

As regards the period after 8\u00a0March 2001, the Government submitted that it had been based on provisions of the old Code of Criminal Procedure. The domestic courts had not been required to take any decision on the applicant\u2019s detention because until 15\u00a0June 2001 the old Russian Code of Criminal Procedure set no time-limit for detention \u201cduring judicial proceedings\u201d and after 15 June 2001 Article 239-1 of the old CCrP, which set such a time-limit, was not applicable to the applicant\u2019s case because she had been charged with a particularly serious offence. On 1 July 2002 the new Code of Criminal Procedure had become effective and the applicant\u2019s detention had been extended at regular intervals in accordance with the rules laid down in the new Code. On 17 April 2003 the Supreme Court of the  had ordered the applicant\u2019s release. It had taken five days to deliver a copy of that decision to Omsk, which was situated more than 2,500 km from .

The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s detention after 8 March 2001 did not require a separate legal order and was executed on the basis of a mere requirement of the domestic law in force at the material time. That period of detention represented a continuous situation which ended on 1 July 2002 when the  issued the following detention order. The Court notes, and the parties did not dispute the fact, that the decision of 10 July 2001, as upheld on appeal on 25\u00a0October 2002, could not be construed as a formal order authorising the applicant\u2019s continued detention during the period prior to 1 July 2002 (see Shukhardin v. Russia, no.\u00a065734/01, \u00a7\u00a081, 28\u00a0June 2007, and Melnikova v. Russia, no.\u00a024552/02, \u00a7\u00a061, 21\u00a0June 2007). Therefore, the most recent detention order that the Court may examine was issued on 1 July 2002. The final decision concerning the lawfulness of that order was given on 25\u00a0October 2002, that is within the six months preceding the lodging of the application. The Court therefore considers that the part of the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the detention orders issued before 1 July 2002 was introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention (see Ignatov v.

Some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities. However, the national authorities must attempt to keep it to a minimum (see Quinn v.\u00a0, 22\u00a0March 1995, \u00a7\u00a042; Giulia Manzoni v.\u00a0Italy, 1 July 1997, \u00a7\u00a025 in fine; K.-F. v.\u00a0Germany, 27 November 1997, \u00a7\u00a071; and Mancini v.

Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article\u00a05 \u00a7\u00a03 of the Convention (see Labita v.

The need to continue the deprivation of liberty cannot be assessed from a purely abstract point of view.

Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is only permissible in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases (see Rokhlina v.\u00a0Russia, no. 54071/00, \u00a7\u00a067, 7 April 2005).

In the present case the domestic authorities did not mention any concrete facts warranting the applicant\u2019s detention on that ground, save for a reference to her lack of a permanent place of residence and work in the Omsk Region.

It is of particular concern to the Court that the Russian authorities persistently used a stereotyped summary formula to justify the extension of the applicant\u2019s detention; the prosecutors reproduced the same formula in all their decisions. The Court also notes that the domestic authorities, using the same formula, simultaneously extended the detention of the applicant and her co-defendants. In the Court\u2019s view, this approach is incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in so far as it permits the continued detention of a group of persons without a case-by-case assessment of the grounds for detention or of compliance with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement in respect of each individual member of the group (see Dolgova v. , no.\u00a011886/05, \u00a7\u00a049, 2 March 2006).",

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Navarra v.\u00a0France, 23\u00a0November 1993, \u00a7\u00a028, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0273-B, and Toth v.\u00a0Austria, 12\u00a0December 1991, \u00a7 84, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a0224). The requirement that a decision be given \u201cspeedily\u201d is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per level of jurisdiction may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 \u00a7 1 cases, Article 5 \u00a7 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v.\u00a0the United Kingdom, no.\u00a050272/99, \u00a7\u00a079, ECHR\u00a02003-IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see I\u0142owiecki v.\u00a0Poland, no.\u00a027504/95, \u00a7\u00a076, 4\u00a0October 2001).",

There is nothing to suggest that the applicant caused delays in the examination of her requests for release or her appeals against the detention orders. The Government did not indicate any particular instance when the applicant had allegedly applied for a stay of the proceedings by which the lawfulness of her detention had been reviewed or had in any other way caused a delay in those proceedings. The Court notes the Government\u2019s argument that the proceedings were stayed due to the applicant\u2019s co-defendants\u2019 conduct. The Court, however, finds it striking that the domestic courts preferred to delay the proceedings in which a question of the applicant\u2019s continued deprivation of liberty was to be decided merely for a purpose of issuing a collective detention order, a practice which the Court has already found to be incompatible, in itself, with the guarantees enshrined in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 93 above). The Court therefore considers that these four periods cannot be considered compatible with the \u201cspeediness\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 4, especially taking into account that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities (see, for example, Mamedova, cited above, \u00a7\u00a096; Khudoyorov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 198 and 203; and Rehbock v.\u00a0Slovenia, no. 29462/95, \u00a7\u00a7 85-86, ECHR 2000-XII, where review proceedings which lasted twenty-three days were found not to have been \u201cspeedy\u201d).",
