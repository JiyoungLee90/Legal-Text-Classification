Since the first trial day on 20 February 2007, hearings had been held on 37\u00a0days. Delays in the proceedings were the result of comprehensive applications for the taking of evidence by the defence in August and September 2007, in particular of a voluminous motion regarding the applicant\u2019s alibi submitted on 2 August 2007. Moreover, the applicant had been unavailable to attend trial on a number of days due to his participation in separately conducted court proceedings. The Court of Appeal further noted that the fact that one of the judges sitting in the applicant\u2019s case had been seconded to another court since 15 October 2007 had reduced the frequency with which hearings could be held.",

The Court of Appeal noted in this context that in the period since 20 February 2007 hearings had been held in the instant case on 56 days with an average duration of three hours, amounting to an average of less than one hearing day per week. Gaps in the hearing schedule from 23 April to 7 May 2007, in the period from 12\u00a0July until 3 September 2007 and from 22 December 2007 to 6 January 2008, were due to the judges\u2019 absence on leave, while in May 2007 counsel for the defence had been on leave.

A.K.\u2019s refusal to answer questions from the defence did not require the court to exclude his statements as evidence in the trial nor did such behaviour put the witness\u2019s credibility into question. Even following termination of the criminal proceedings against A.K. by final decision of the Federal Court of Justice dated 10 July 2008, the witness could still rely on his right not to testify, by virtue of Article 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since there remained a risk that he would incriminate himself with respect to offences that were closely linked to the one of which he had been convicted. Several investigations previously conducted against A.K. in this respect had been discontinued by the prosecution authorities and could be resumed in the future. The court emphasised in this connection that it had done everything in its power to enable an examination of A.K. by the defence. Despite A.K.\u2019s refusal to answer questions from the defence or the applicant, in the beginning he had offered to consider answering the applicant\u2019s questions put to him in writing. The applicant\u2019s counsel declined this offer. As a consequence the court had granted the applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request to examine A.K., which he accordingly did. Any attempts in this respect had, however, been to no avail. Therefore the court itself had questioned A.K. on subjects that had appeared to be of importance for the defence and he had answered all questions. Subsequently, upon the court\u2019s proposal the applicant had submitted further subjects of interest in a list. On these matters the court then put questions to A.K. in a later hearing. In addition, in the last part of the trial, A.K. had answered a number of questions that had been proposed by the defence and had been put to him by the court with identical wording. At his counsel\u2019s recommendation he had then decided to refrain from participating in any such indirect questioning.",

Even if the applicant might have been in a position to present his motions at an earlier stage, any resulting delays were minor, taking into consideration the total duration of the firstinstance proceedings and the fact that the key witness A.K. only answered questions put by the Regional Court and the prosecution.

Bearing in mind the more stringent conditions under which the detention on remand was carried out due to the custody order, the duration of the applicant\u2019s detention and his state of health, the Court finds that the competent court should have fixed a tighter hearing schedule in order to speed up the proceedings. The Court has special regard to the periods when holidays were taken, the time after 15\u00a0October 2007, when the frequency of hearings was reduced due to the secondment of one of the judges to another court, and the time after the applicant\u2019s heart surgery in June 2008. The Court cannot agree with the Government that the court kept the gaps between scheduled hearings as short as possible. The Court notes that these intervals arose, in particular, from 23 April to 7 May 2007, 12 July to 2 September 2007, 22\u00a0December 2007 to 6 January 2008, 13 December 2008 to 4 January 2009 and 5 May to 1 June 2009. In sum, the court did not schedule any hearings for a total of nearly 24 weeks. Lastly, the number and length of court hearings per month did not increase after the applicant\u2019s heart surgery, but slowed down. The Court accepts that a serious illness like the one in the present case might slow down court proceedings. The Court observes, however, that the duty to administer justice expeditiously was incumbent in the first place on the authorities, especially as the applicant had been in custody and had been suffering from a serious illness. This required particular diligence on their part in dealing with his case (see Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 130).Against this background, accelerating measures such as dispensing with the reading out of whole documents, prevented further delays but did not compensate for the lean hearing schedule.",

In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.  and , \u00a7 118, ECHR 2011; Sievert v. Germany, no. 29881/07, \u00a7 58, 19 July 2012). Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument (see Gani v. Spain, no. 61800/08, \u00a7 38, 19 February 2013). The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

The Court accepts that in the course of the trial the domestic courts were under an obligation to respect the witness\u2019s decision not to answer to any questions subjecting him to the risk of being prosecuted (see article 55 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, paragraph\u00a049 above). The Court points out in this context that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6 (see Sievert, cited above, \u00a7 61; Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17\u00a0December 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). This right weighs heavily in the circumstances of the present case, where both the applicant and A.K. were accused of being involved in large-scale drug-trafficking, and could have had a conflict of interests. The Court also finds it relevant to note that the court nevertheless tried to include the questions important to the defence in its own questions (compare also Sievert, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61).",

Italy, no. 11339/85, \u00a7 36, 19 February 1991). They further had the ability to comment on and to challenge the statements made by A.K. directly after the examination of the witness by the court and the public prosecutor and once the taking of evidence as a whole had been concluded. The applicant, while not being able to question the witness directly, thus nevertheless had the possibility to cast doubt on his credibility and contradict his account of the circumstances of the case (compare also Asch v. Austria, 26 April 1991, \u00a7 29, Series A no. 203; Accardi and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 30598/02, ECHR 2005-II; Sievert, cited above, \u00a7 63). He indeed availed himself of such opportunity by filing further motions for the admission of evidence which were based on the statements given by A.K. As a consequence, the court heard representatives of the police and public prosecution who had been involved in A.K.\u2019s examination and read out minutes which had been requested by the defence.",

Having regard to the circumstances of the case, the Regional Court provided arguments why there were no grounds to assume that the witness had wrongly accused the applicant. The trial court further observed that the witness had plausible reasons for his decision not to answer questions from the defence. The Court considers that the arguments advanced by the domestic court in this respect were not immaterial for its conclusion that the testimony given by A.K. was credible and consistent to the extent that it concerned the circumstances of A.K.\u2019s actions (compare also De Lorenzo v. Italy (dec.), no. 69264/01, 12 February 2004). In these circumstances the Court is satisfied that the necessary care was applied in the evaluation of A.K.\u2019s statements.",

In addition, the Regional Court took into account all available protocols of statements made by A.K. at the various stages of the proceedings (see paragraph 37 above). The Court considers that, while such elements of evidence taken separately may not have been conclusive for the charges of which the applicant was found guilty, these items nevertheless corroborated the Regional Court\u2019s careful evaluation of A.K.\u2019s statements.",
