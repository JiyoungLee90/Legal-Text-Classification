It advocates the overthrow of governments and their replacement by an Islamic State in the form of a recreated Caliphate. Hizb ut-Tahrir first emerged among Palestinians in Jordan in the early 1950s. It has achieved a small, but highly committed following in a number of Middle Eastern states and has also gained in popularity among Muslims in western Europe and Indonesia. It began working in Central Asia in the mid-1990s and has developed a committed following inside Uzbekistan, and to a lesser extent in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.",

It is primarily for the national court to decide whether the requested measure is relevant and essential for deciding a case. However, if the court decides that an expert examination is needed, the defence should have an opportunity to formulate questions to the experts, to challenge them and to examine them directly at the trial. In certain circumstances the refusal to allow an alternative expert examination of material evidence may be regarded as a breach of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01 (see C.B. v.\u00a0Austria, no. 30465/06, \u00a7 40, 4 April 2013, with further references).",

Based on these general principles, the Court must examine, firstly, whether there were good reasons to keep secret the identity of the anonymous witnesses \u201cMakarov\u201d and \u201cMedvedev\u201d. Secondly, the Court must consider whether the evidence of those witnesses was the sole or decisive basis of the conviction. Thirdly, it must ascertain whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, to permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place.",

The Court reiterates in this connection that any subjective fear by the witness will not suffice and the courts must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine, firstly, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, secondly, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence (see Asani, cited above, \u00a7 39, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, \u00a7 124, ECHR 2011). There is however no evidence in the case file that the trial court verified whether the witnesses\u2019 fears were objectively justified. It is significant that the applicants were not accused of any violent acts and that none of the other witnesses who testified against them and whose identity they knew feared for his safety or complained about any threats or pressure from the applicants. It follows that the trial court did not advance good reasons for its decision to grant anonymity to witnesses \u201cMakarov\u201d and \u201cMedvedev\u201d.",

It is important to note that the fact of public distribution of leaflets was found to constitute a separate offence under Articles 282\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02\u00a0(c) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 17 above) which resulted in a separate sentence (see paragraph 18 above).

Furthermore, although the applicants and their lawyers were able to put questions to the witnesses, the fact that they were given virtually no details about the witnesses\u2019 personality or background undermined their ability to engage an effective cross-examination and, in particular, advance any reasons which the witness may have for lying and thereby question the credibility and reliability of their statements. Lastly, there is no indication in the judgment that the judge was alive to the need to approach the anonymous evidence with caution. In particular, he did not show that he was aware that the statements by anonymous witnesses carried less weight and did not provide detailed reasoning as to why he considered that evidence to be reliable, while having regard also to the other evidence available (see, by contrast, Ellis and Simms, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 82-88).",
