However, accessibility should be encompassed in general and specific laws on equal opportunities, equality and participation in the context of the prohibition of disability-based discrimination. Denial of access should be clearly defined as a prohibited act of discrimination. Persons with disabilities who have been denied access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communication, or services open to the public should have effective legal remedies at their disposal. When defining accessibility standards, States parties have to take into account the diversity of persons with disabilities and ensure that accessibility is provided to persons of any gender and of all ages and types of disability. Part of the task of encompassing the diversity of persons with disabilities in the provision of accessibility is recognizing that some persons with disabilities need human or animal assistance in order to enjoy full accessibility (such as personal assistance, sign language interpretation, tactile sign language interpretation or guide dogs). It must be stipulated, for example, that banning guide dogs from entering a particular building or open space would constitute a prohibited act of disability-based discrimination.\u201d",

The authorities had thus discriminated against him by failing to interpret the term \u201cproperty that satisfies a family\u2019s housing needs\u201d in a way that took into consideration the accessibility of the property in question. This discriminatory treatment, in the applicant\u2019s view, had no reasonable justification, particularly given that the problem of accessibility impeded his son\u2019s ability to leave the flat, thereby restricting all his other rights, such as those to adequate health treatment, education and personal development.

Firstly, the flat he had owned at the time when he had bought the house objectively satisfied the requirements for adequate housing for him and his family. It had basic infrastructure and satisfied hygiene and technical requirements, and the tax authorities had no discretion in assessing the term \u201chousing needs\u201d.

With regard to the second condition, the Government submitted that the applicant had not met the value requirement in that he had owned a flat of significant value. Therefore, the fact that the building was not equipped with a lift had been irrelevant. It was in fact the intention of the relevant domestic law to provide tax exemption in order to assist individuals who were buying their first real property, and in particular those without property of significant value. In the case in issue, the domestic authorities had acted within their margin of appreciation, and had accordingly assessed that the applicant did not need any such financial assistance, which had led them to dismiss his request for tax exemption.

Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, \u00a7\u00a0109, ECHR 2014). This also includes measures in the area of taxation. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality (see R.Sz. v. Hungary, no. 41838/11, \u00a7 54, 2 July 2013). On the other hand, if a restriction on fundamental rights applies to a particularly vulnerable group in society that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past, then the State\u2019s margin of appreciation is substantially narrower and it must have very weighty reasons for the restrictions in question. The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs. The Court has already identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their characteristic or status, including disability (see Glor, cited above, \u00a7 84; Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no.\u00a038832/06, \u00a7 42, 20 May 2010; and Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2011). Moreover, with regard to all actions concerning children with disabilities the best interest of the child must be a primary consideration (see paragraph 34 above; Article 7 \u00a7 2 of the CRPD). In any case, however, irrespective of the scope of the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court (see, inter alia, Konstantin Markin v.
