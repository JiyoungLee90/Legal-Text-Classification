Moreover, it submitted that the experts who had produced the report had not had the necessary qualifications. As to the two official warnings sent by the Licensing Chamber in July and August 2012, the applicant company submitted that they had been too vague and that it had not understood from them what exactly had been imputed to it. The applicant company submitted that it had declared to the Mining Authority all the quantities of sand extracted and had filled in the official forms required in a timely manner. The applicant specified that initially the official forms did not require distinguishing between the minerals extracted; therefore no such distinction had been made. Later, however, new forms were issued in which it was required to distinguish between the different minerals extracted. The applicant company had also submitted all the required tax declarations to the tax authority. The applicant submitted documents in support of its submissions. The applicant also argued that according to the Mining Code, the only authority with competence in the field of mining and with a right to apply to the Licensing Chamber was the Mining Authority and not the Prosecutor\u2019s Office.",

Moreover, the experts who had conducted the expert examination at the request of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office had not even visited the applicant company\u2019s mine, nor had they obtained any documents from it. The conclusions reached by the experts were confusing because after finding that the applicant company had not exploited any surface beyond the area allocated to it in the mining licence, they have stated that the applicant company had extracted unlawfully 1,400 square metres of sand without explaining on what ground they considered that extraction unlawful.

The above warnings were made by the Licensing Chamber because the applicant had extracted some 1,400 cubic metres of sand without declaring it to the competent authority and without filling in the required official forms for the purpose of taxation, thus acting in breach of Section 39(b), (c) and (g) of the Mining Code.",

The latter report was produced by several experts who had been asked to give answers to several questions put by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, the essence of which was to determine whether the applicant company had extracted minerals outside the area allocated to it in the licence and, if so, what was the quantity and the value of those minerals (see paragraph\u00a06 above). In a report dated 1 June 2012, the experts replied that the applicant company had not exploited any area outside that allocated to it under its licence. In spite of that comprehensive answer, the experts went on by stating that the applicant had unlawfully extracted 1,400 cubic metres of sand valued at MDL 175,812. No explanation was provided as regards how the experts had reached the conclusion that the 1,400 cubic metres of sand had been extracted unlawfully or what relation that finding had with the questions asked (see paragraph 7 above). The court of first instance made the same observations in respect of the findings in the expert report (see paragraph 13 above).",

The warning letters did not contain any explanation as to what exactly was imputed to the applicant company and there is no evidence in the materials of the case file that the applicant company was given a copy of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office\u2019s letter of 19 June 2012 or of the expert report of 1\u00a0June 2012 together with the warning letters. Indeed, the applicant company submitted before the first instance court that it did not have access to any of the above documents.
