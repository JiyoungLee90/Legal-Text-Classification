In response to the applicant\u2019s argument that the maximum statutory period of pre-trial detention had expired and he should therefore be released, the court noted that, pursuant to the applicable rules of criminal procedure, the applicant could be detained for eighteen\u00a0months pending investigation, owing to the seriousness of the charges against him.",

Furthermore, the award of compensation was subject to the fulfilment of specific conditions not required under Article 5 \u00a7 3, specifically the applicant\u2019s acquittal or the discontinuation of the proceedings. The only grounds for awarding the applicant compensation were the termination of the criminal proceedings against him rather than any alleged procedural irregularity in the pre-trial detention. These grounds for compensation did not correspond to the basis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 and the alleged violation could not therefore be redressed in these proceedings (see also, mutatis\u00a0mutandis, El\u011fay v.
