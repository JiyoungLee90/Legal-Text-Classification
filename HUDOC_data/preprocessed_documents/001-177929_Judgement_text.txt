The case originated in an application (no. 33751/05) against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Guță Tudor Teodorescu (“the applicant”), on 15 August 2005.
In a judgment delivered on 5 April 2016, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention on account of the applicant’s impossibility to obtain in court an adjustment for inflation of the amount he was entitled to as compensation in accordance with Law no. 9/1998. The Court also decided to award the applicant 900 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage and dismissed the remainder of the claims for just satisfaction.
On 8 July 2016 the Government informed the Court that they had learned that the applicant had died on 10 March 2016. They accordingly requested revision of the judgment within the meaning of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court.
On 29 November 2016 the Court considered the request for revision and decided to give the applicant’s representative four weeks in which to submit any observations (Rule 80 § 4). Neither the applicant’s representative nor subsequently the applicant’s heir submitted any observations. The Court’s letters, sent by registered post on 2 December 2016 and 7 February 2017 respectively, returned unclaimed and no replies were received.
