For this reason the Court considers that the first applicant brought an arguable claim to the attention of the national authorities which obliged them to carry out an effective investigation as required by Article 3 of the Convention (see \u00c7evik v.\u00a0Turkey (dec.), no. 57406/00, 10 October 2006, and Yerli v.\u00a0Turkey, no.\u00a059177/10, \u00a7 56, 8 July 2014).",

In addition to this, the trial before the first instance courts was not started for a period of some five years due to a number of jurisdictional disputes between 2007 and 2012. The Court reiterates that, while there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, it may generally be regarded as essential for the authorities to launch an investigation promptly in order to maintain public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law (see Bat\u0131 and Others v.\u00a0Turkey, nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, \u00a7 136, ECHR 2004IV (extracts)). In this connection, the Court also considers it essential that a trial started after the closure of a pre-trial investigation must be conducted within a reasonable time. In view of the very significant delay in instigating the criminal proceedings and the failure to expedite the trial at first instance, the Court finds that the judicial authorities cannot be considered to have acted with sufficient promptness or with reasonable diligence (see Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0136).",
