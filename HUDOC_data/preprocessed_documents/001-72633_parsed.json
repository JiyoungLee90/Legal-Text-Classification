The Court has held that the practice of keeping defendants in detention without a specific legal basis or clear rules governing their situation \u2013 with the result that they may be deprived of their liberty for an unlimited period without judicial authorisation \u2013 was incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and protection from arbitrariness, which are common threads throughout the Convention and the rule of law (see Je\u010dius, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a060-64, and Baranowski, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-58).",

The Government, however, did not point to any legal provision which permitted a defendant to continue to be held once the authorised detention period had expired. The Russian Constitution and the rules of criminal procedure vested the power to order or prolong detention pending trial in prosecutors and courts (see paragraph 54 above). No exceptions to that rule were permitted or provided for, no matter how short the duration of the detention. As noted above, during the relevant period there was neither a prosecutor\u2019s order nor a judicial decision authorising the applicant\u2019s detention.

The District Court ordered that the case be referred back for additional investigation, thus shifting the responsibility for the applicant\u2019s detention onto the prosecution, but the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office did not agree with that decision and challenged it, first on appeal and then by way of supervisory review proceedings. Even after the intervention of the Minister of Justice himself, who pointed out that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office had unlawfully refused to extend the applicant\u2019s detention in breach of his constitutional right to liberty, the deputy Prosecutor General did nothing to remedy the violation and failed to specify, in his reply to the Minister, the specific basis of the applicant\u2019s detention. In fact, it appears that by that time the unlawfulness of his detention was fully apparent to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. The legal basis was so conspicuously lacking that the prosecutor L. sent a non-procedural faxed communication to the director of the remand centre where the applicant was detained, prohibiting his release (see paragraph 40 above). The Court finds it particularly disturbing that the prohibition emanated from the prosecutor, who had no apparent authority to extend the applicant\u2019s detention. What is more, his primary function was to ensure compliance with the rules of criminal procedure in remand centres, and the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Law on Prosecutors\u2019 Offices imposed on him a statutory duty to release anyone detained without a legal basis (see paragraph 60 above). It is also a source of concern to the Court that the non-procedural communication was deemed by the director of the remand centre to constitute sufficient grounds for not releasing the applicant, and thereby not discharging his legal obligation to release the person held in custody after the authorised detention period had expired (ibid.).",

A further delay was attributable to the conduct of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, as it refused to abide by the courts\u2019 decisions and sought to overturn them by way of supervisory review proceedings. After the case was set down for trial, it does not appear that any hearings took place between October 1999 and January 2000. Finally, the most significant delay resulted from the domestic authorities\u2019 persistent failure to inform the applicant about the status of the criminal proceedings against him. The latter delay spanned several years.",
