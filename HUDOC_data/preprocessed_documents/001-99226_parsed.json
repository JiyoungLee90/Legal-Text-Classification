The CPT fully accepts that specific security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and/or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners. However, the imposition of measures of this kind should be the exception rather than the rule. This implies that the relevant authorities must examine the case of each prisoner in order to ascertain whether specific security measures are really justified in his/her case.

The applicant in the present case, who was held in solitary cells, did not complain of a lack of personal space. Instead, he complained of other aspects of the physical conditions of detention, including the coldness of his cell, insufficient access to daylight and poor sanitary conditions. The Court has previously found that such factors as access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, compliance with basic sanitary requirements, the opportunity to use the toilet in private and the availability of ventilation are relevant to the assessment of whether the acceptable threshold of suffering or degradation has been exceeded (see, for example, Vlasov v. Russia, no.\u00a078146/01, \u00a7\u00a084, 12 June 2008; Babushkin v.

It reiterates in this respect that allegations of treatment contrary to Article 3 must be supported by appropriate evidence.

However, Convention proceedings, such as the present application, do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation) because in certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government's part to submit such information without a satisfactory explanation may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations (see, among other authorities, Kokoshkina v. , no. 2052/08, \u00a7 59, 28 May 2009, and Ahmet \u00d6zkan and Others v. , no.\u00a021689/93, \u00a7 426, 6\u00a0April 2004).",

The Government, by contrast, confined their supporting evidence to numerous certificates from the remand centre management issued on 18\u00a0August 2008, that is, long after the applicant had left the remand centre. They have not submitted any source materials on the basis of which the assertions of comfortable conditions of detention contained in those certificates could be verified. The Court would reiterate that on several previous occasions it has declined to accept the validity of similar certificates on the ground that they could not be viewed as sufficiently reliable given the lapse of time involved and the absence of any supporting documentary evidence (see Kokoshkina, cited above, \u00a7\u00a060; Sudarkov v.\u00a0Russia, no. 3130/03, \u00a7 43, 10\u00a0July 2008; and Belashev v. Russia, no.\u00a028617/03, \u00a7\u00a052, 13\u00a0November 2007). The certificates are therefore of little evidentiary value for the Court. The few documents dating from the period of the applicant's detention in the remand centre produced by the Government seem to conflict, at least in part, with their description of the conditions of detention and lend some support to the applicant's allegations. The Court will now examine the conditions of the applicant's detention in detail.",

Although the Government disputed that allegation, it is confirmed by the testimony of one of the warders, who conceded that the window was not glazed and was insulated by a piece of polythene (see paragraph 33 above), and by the letter from the regional prosecutor which stated that the windows in the remand centre were glazed only in September 2003 (see paragraph 51 above). The Court therefore considers it established beyond reasonable doubt that for almost a year the applicant was held in a cell which had an unglazed window. It has already found it unacceptable that anyone should be detained in conditions involving a lack of adequate protection against extreme temperatures (see Mathew v. the Netherlands, no. 24919/03, \u00a7 214, ECHR\u00a02005IX). Due to the lack of glazing the applicant in the present case was for long periods of time exposed to extremely low temperatures, falling in the winter months to - 30\u00ba C (see paragraph 41 above). This factor undeniably caused him hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. His situation was exacerbated still further by the fact that he suffered from arthritis and staying in cold places had been specifically and repeatedly forbidden to him by doctors (see paragraphs 59, 60 and 72 above). The Court considers that in such circumstances the lengthy exposure of the applicant to low temperatures amounted in itself to inhuman treatment.",

The concrete walls, the ceiling and the floor are damaged by dampness. The toilet facilities are decrepit and filthy and are not separated from the living area. There is no lavatory bowl or flush system; the washbasin is eaten away with rust. The metal beds are also rusty and dilapidated, while the bedding is worn out and dirty (see paragraphs 38 and 42 above). The Court considers that such conditions can only be described as degrading and unfit for decent habitation.",

Indeed, the Government acknowledged that the blinds were removed only in December 2002, which confirms the applicant's allegation that the window in cell no. 210 where he was held from 6 July to 25\u00a0September 2002 was covered with a metal screen (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above). The photographs show that cell no. 32, where the applicant was held from 25 September to 14 October 2002, had no window, while the window in cell no. 10 where the applicant was held from 22 October 2002 to 18 November 2003 was blinded by several layers of thick metal grills which significantly reduced the amount of daylight that could penetrate into the cell (see paragraphs 38, 41 and 42 above). The Court therefore finds it established that the window arrangements in the remand centre allowed little or no access to natural light. The access to fresh air was equally limited in certain cells, especially in the two cells, nos. 1 and 32, that had no windows. The Government did not produce any reliable evidence confirming their claim that those cells were equipped with mechanical ventilation. It therefore appears that for at least a month the applicant was kept in cells which were either poorly ventilated or not ventilated at all. The Court notes that the applicant was confined to his insufficiently lit and ventilated cells for the entire day, except for one hour of outdoor exercise. On many occasions the duration of the outdoor exercise was unlawfully shortened to half an hour, as the Government admitted (see paragraph 30 above). Accordingly, for a considerable part of each day the applicant was deprived of daylight and in certain cells of fresh air, which undoubtedly contributed to the distress that he felt owing to the other factors described above (see, for similar reasoning, Vlasov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 83 and 84).",

Relying on the opinion of Dr K. (see paragraph 72 above), the applicant claimed that disease-modifying drugs were necessary to slow down the destruction of the joints and that as a result of the failure to administer such drugs his disease had quickly progressed to disability. The Court is faced with conflicting medical evidence as regards the appropriateness of such treatment in the applicant's situation. Thus, Dr K. stated in her report that disease-modifying drugs were an essential part of anti-arthritis treatment, while the rheumatologist Dr L., who examined the applicant twice, decided that they were not required in his case (see paragraph 60 above). The Court is inclined to endorse the opinion of Dr\u00a0L. because she had the benefit of having examined the applicant in person while Dr\u00a0K. never saw the applicant and gave her opinion, which is couched in general terms, on the basis of the medical records alone. Moreover, there is nothing in Dr K.'s report to give support to the applicant's allegation that there was a causal link between the absence of treatment with disease-modifying drugs and his disability. On the contrary, Dr K. admitted that arthritis was incurable and almost invariably led to disability. The Court finds, therefore, that it is not substantiated that treatment with disease-modifying drugs was indicated in the applicant's case or that the absence of such treatment had an adverse effect on the development of his disease. Although his condition had indeed deteriorated by 2004, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that this was the result of inadequate treatment rather than the natural and intrinsic consequence of his chronic disease.",

Dr\u00a0L. particularly stressed that the applicant's condition required constant application of the anti-inflammatory treatment. However, there is no indication in the applicant's medical records that he received the prescribed medication, apart from ten injections in May and June 2002 (see paragraph 57 above). The Court reiterates that the authorities of the penitentiary institution have an obligation to keep a record of the applicant's state of health and the treatment he underwent while in detention. Such medical records should contain sufficient information specifying what kind of treatment the patient was prescribed, what treatment he actually received, when and by whom it was administered, how the applicant's state of health was monitored, and so on. If the applicant's medical file is not specific enough in these respects, the Court may draw inferences (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no.\u00a046468/06, \u00a7 147, 22\u00a0December 2008). Given that the applicant's medical records do not contain any entries confirming that the prescribed medication was in fact administered to him, and taking into account the fact that Dr L. stated unambiguously in her report of 27 May 2003 that her recommendations had not been complied with (see paragraph 68 above), the Court finds it established that the applicant did not receive the treatment prescribed to him by his doctor.",

This circumstance, however, is of little significance for the present case, as by the time of the refusal the applicant had already been left without any treatment for more than two years. In any event, the treatment proposed on that occasion did not correspond to the doctor's prescription.

As a result of the failure to administer that treatment the applicant must have endured constant and considerable suffering. Although he was occasionally supplied with painkillers, their effect was limited in time and, in any event, they could not be considered as a proper substitute for the treatment duly prescribed by the doctor. Indeed, the Court observes that the applicant often complained of pain in his joints (see paragraphs 58, 68 and 69 above) which must have been due to the failure to administer the prescribed medication.

Their term of office was several times extended by presidential decrees, the last of which, the decree of 25 January 2000, provided that all lay judges should remain in office pending compilation and approval of the new lists of lay judges in accordance with the Lay Judges Act, which had just entered into force. By the time of the beginning of the applicant's trial, almost two years after the entry into force of the Lay Judges Act, those lists still had not been compiled and the lay judges elected in 1993 and 1999 remained in office. Accordingly, in order to establish whether the  which convicted the applicant can be regarded as a \u201ctribunal established by law\u201d, the Court has to examine two related issues. Firstly, it has to decide whether the essential requirements of the procedure for selection of lay judges, as laid down in the RSFSR Judicial System Act of 1981, were respected. Secondly, it has to examine the lawfulness of the extensions of the lay judges' term of office by the presidential decrees, and especially by the decree of 25 January 2000 which, the applicant alleged, was incompatible with the recently adopted Lay Judges Act.",

Russia, no.\u00a023610/03, \u00a7 96, 14\u00a0January 2010). At the same time, excessive formalities in such matters, such as those that could de facto prevent a prospective applicant from effectively enjoying his right of individual petition, have been found to be inacceptable. By contrast, where the domestic formalities were easy to comply with, no issue arose under Article 34 (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, \u00a7\u00a7 119, 25\u00a0October 2007).",

However, given that under Rule 36 \u00a7 4 (a) of the Rules of Court permission to represent an applicant may be granted to a non-advocate, the Contracting States must ensure that non-advocate representatives are allowed to visit detainees who have lodged or intend to lodge an application with the Court under the same conditions as advocates. Russian law does not provide for any special rules for visits of detainees by their representatives before the Court. Accordingly, the general visiting rules designed for counsel representing a detainee in domestic criminal proceedings apply to visits from representatives before the Court. As far as non-advocates are concerned, section 18 of the Detention Act provides that a non-advocate may visit a detainee in a remand centre only if the former possesses a judicial decision by which he or she has been admitted to act as counsel in the domestic criminal proceedings, such admittance being within the discretionary powers of the trial or appeal judge (see paragraphs 110 and 111 above).
