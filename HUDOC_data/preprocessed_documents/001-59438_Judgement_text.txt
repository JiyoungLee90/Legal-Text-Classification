The case originated in an application (no. 45260/99) against Italy lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mr Costantino Icolaro (“the applicant”), on 30 October 1999.
The applicant was represented by Mr Pietro Palma, a lawyer practising in Benevento. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, assisted by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of a set of criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
By a decision of 21 October 1999 the Chamber declared the application admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1948 and is currently residing in Moiano (Benevento). In 1988, he was a member of the Bucciano (Benevento) Municipal Commission (“Commissione municipale”), a body responsible for expressing opinions on the granting of public allowances.
On 23 March 1991 M. A. filed a criminal complain (denuncia) against the applicant for abuse of public authority (“abuso d’ufficio”).
On an unspecified date the Benevento Public Prosecutor’s Office commenced criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of abuse of public authority in the course of his duties as a member of the Municipal Commission.
On 10 October 1991 the Benevento Public Prosecutor’s Office requested that the applicant and six other persons be committed for trial on charges of abuse of public authority, forgery and swindle.
The date of the preliminary hearing, scheduled for 22 January 1992, was first postponed until 15 April 1992 at the Public Prosecutor’s request, then adjourned because of the political elections on 5 and 6 April 1992.
A hearing scheduled for 1 July 1992 was postponed until 28 October 1992 in order to enable the lawyers of the Benevento Bar Association to take part in an assembly. On 28 October and 25 November 1992, as well as on 20 January and 3 March 1993, the case was adjourned awaiting the outcome of a connected set of criminal proceedings. Two hearings on 2 June and 20 October 1993 were postponed by reason of a lawyers’ strike of indefinite duration.
On 17 November 1993 the parties presented their conclusive arguments and on an unspecified date the Benevento investigating judge committed the applicant and his six co-accused for trial, commencing before the Benevento District Court on 3 October 1994.
This hearing was adjourned at the request of one of the accused until 3 April 1995, then postponed by the District Court of its own motion. Three hearings scheduled for 12 May, 14 June and 13 July 1995 were adjourned because of three different lawyers’ strikes, ending respectively on 27 May, 24 June and 13 July 1995. On 20 October 1995 and 18 January 1996, some witnesses were examined and the parties presented their final pleadings.
In a judgment of 18 January 1996, filed with the court’s registry on 25 January 1996, the District Court convicted the applicant for abuse of public authority to six months’ imprisonment and to a fine of 400,000 lire.
On 28 February 1996, the applicant lodged an appeal with the Naples Court of Appeal. By an act of 8 May 1997, the President of the Court of Appeal scheduled the date of the hearing for 18 June 1997. However, the proceedings were adjourned first until 10 November 1997, then until 9 February 1998 by reason of a lawyers’ strike. On 29 April 1998, the parties presented their final pleadings.
In a judgment of the same day, filed with the court’s registry on 12 May 1998, the Naples Court of Appeal acquitted the applicant. This decision became final on 22 June 1998.
