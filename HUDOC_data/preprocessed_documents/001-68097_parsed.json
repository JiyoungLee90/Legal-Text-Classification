Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. In any event, it should be as short as possible. Following its visits, the CPT advised of its concerns regarding various aspects of solitary confinement in France (cf. paragraphs 140 et seq., and 158 to 163 of the reports).

In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be \u201cinhuman\u201d or \u201cdegrading\u201d, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account (see, for instance, V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 71, ECHR 1999-IX; Raninen v.

Subjectively, the applicant may have felt well enough, but the issue of whether a person has been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be decided solely by reference to what the victim of such treatment feels at the time: it must also be decided on the basis of what can objectively be regarded as being contrary to the minimum acceptable standards of treatment consistent with respect for human dignity. To take the opposite view would lead to absurd results. In addition, it must be borne in mind that the effects of certain treatment on a person's physical or mental health may not be immediately apparent but become so subsequently. This phenomenon is well known in the sphere of the post-traumatic effects of inhuman or degrading treatment or torture. Similarly, a person in good health may nonetheless suffer from particular forms of ill-treatment.

After issuing certificates over a number of years stating that the applicant's condition was compatible with his continued confinement, the doctors from the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit subsequently became more circumspect and their opinions differed. Thus, a certificate issued on 15 January 1999 referred to the need for psychiatric care. On 13 July 2000 the senior doctor at La Sant\u00e9 Prison stated that the applicant was \u201cin quite astounding physical and mental condition after six years in solitary confinement\u201d. However, he also remarked that it was not proper for a patient's doctor to be required to issue a certificate that ought to be a matter for expert opinion and that it was very difficult for a doctor to sanction solitary confinement on administrative, not medical, grounds. In certificates issued on 3 October 2000 and 20 March 2001 the doctors stated that in view of the applicant's mental state, it was not possible to give a medical opinion on whether he was fit to remain in solitary confinement. On 28 March 2001 a doctor from the Cochin Hospital practising in La Sant\u00e9 Prison stated that the doctors from the medical service at the prison were not qualified to judge whether the applicant's physical and mental health was compatible with his continued solitary confinement. On 23 May 2001 the doctor in charge of the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit wrote to the governor of the prison to inform him that, even though the applicant was in reasonable physical and mental condition, strict solitary confinement for more than six years and nine months was ultimately bound to cause psychological harm. He said in conclusion that it was his duty as a doctor to alert the governor to the potential consequences so that an informed decision could be taken. On 20\u00a0September 2001 the same doctor said that his opinion did not constitute an expert opinion, which he was not qualified to give.
