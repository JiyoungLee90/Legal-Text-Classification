The Court observes that the circumstances of the present case differ from the ones described in application no.\u00a037565/08 lodged by Mr\u00a0Nagibin and concerning the same public event. Unlike Mr\u00a0Nagibin, the applicant in the present application (Mr\u00a0Nikolayev) was not apprehended at the venue of the public event that he had allegedly intended to join on the day of the arrest. Moreover, in the administrative proceedings Mr\u00a0Nikolayev did not argue that the measures taken in his respect had infringed his freedom of assembly. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it is not in possession of materials or submissions that would allow it to establish a clear and acknowledged link between the measures taken against the applicant and his exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly (compare with Navalnyy and Yashin v.\u00a0Russia, no.\u00a076204/11, \u00a7 52, 4 December 2014).

The Government submitted that the court had granted the request to question Mr\u00a0T. (the police officer who had drafted the administrative offence record), however, for an unknown reason that witness had not been questioned. The Court further notes that the domestic court heard one of the police officers who had arrested the applicant (see paragraph 22 above).
